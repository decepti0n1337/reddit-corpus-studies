Druid tank, kek!
---
---
---
I'm a priest leveling and dungeoning with a tank friend, so I'm very familiar with my tank every single time which is sort of easymode, but personally I've entirely skipped Flash Heal. I rarely use Renew. And since my tank is a warrior, I rarely Shield him unless I HAVE to to make him last until my heal lands - usually it's for emergency saving a dps who's pulled aggro. I'm able to comfortably use Lesser Heal as my 'quick' heal on the tank and dps, and wait until tank's hp slowly ticks down far enough to use Heal and then go back to wanding to conserve mana. Again, I have an easier time doing this because I'm super familiar with my tank and how he takes dmg, but I've never had a situation where shield + lesser/reg heal was too close, or where I ran out of mana, except for risky questing pulls where we didn't have dps to burn stuff down. Dungeons are pretty smooth so far.
---
I tank on fairbanks. I get whispers from people who have run with me before about every 20 min while I am on. So I am thinking the server needs more tanks.
---
Thanks, how come only next phase for DM? Pvp items?
---
Nice video, i will say though that I don't think that Paladin played well at all, he wasted a ton of mana by using consecration and probably should have used Judgement of light over Judgment of the crusader as the sustain outweighs the amount of damage JotC gives you imo.
---

---
But then again he's not high enough level for Seal of Wisdom so he probably wouldn't be able to win the sustain war anyway, his only choice was to kill you quickly which he clearly did not have the dps to do. 
---
Pallies don't often get away alive in those situations unless they can bubble hearth as we're one of if not the most immobile class in the game, that's why I bought Swiftness potions once I went to STV.
---
This is why I don't mind the shit drop rates. Even in the barrens I just run laps killing everything I see and eventually realize I got all the drops I needed.
---
‚ÄòAm I too skilled?‚Äô  
---
 
---
 Plays level 25 hunter.  
---
Reality check incoming.
---
I've wondered that from the very first day I started playing.  The quest is already done and I know what rewards I'll get, what's the question?!
---
My first playthrough I was a mage and I just assumed I was causing too much damage to things to recover their bits.
---
I for sure keep the imp out. I guess I should say I dont \*actively\* use a pet. As for the dots, I am wondering the same thing. If the tank is holding aggro really well I will dot everyone, and AOE if the tank the pull is strong enough, or if the aggro isnt staying on tank I will wand down what every add the tank is focusing. It seems like the most efficient way to run a lock without wiping 50 times.
---
As close enough to verified metrics as you'll ever get

Almost 50 / 50 on Whiteman
---
for bind of pickup, you roll need on what would be upgrade for you right away and you would immediately equip it, and greed on everything else. for green bind on equip its mostly the same. however on blue items that are bind on equip its different since it can be sold on auction for good gold. best way is ofc you talk about how you handle expensive boe loot in the beginning of your group, or just right when it dropped before people started rolling for it. like ‚Äûhey this would be upgrade for me, can i have it?‚Äú. its gray scale area since most blue boe are not that expensive and most people would not mind you getting and equiping it, but if purple (epic) boe drops, i can assure you most players  would like to roll need for it, since it is gold and everyone needs gold.
---
I mentioned in another comment that 9/10 runs go great for me, but the 1/10 that don't make the best stories :P
---
3 am in the morning.
---
And here I am with my guild spouting The Office quotes all day. Gz
---
Why don‚Äôt you post where you found this in the TOS.
---
Like an escort quest you can do over and over?
---
yeah.  at first i thought it was unlimited but i remembered it wasn't always that way.
---
Hmm. Only a bot would say they aren‚Äôt a bot unprovoked. ü§î
---
Im a total noob at pvp since its not what i play for. But im getting pretty good at aoe and kiting mobs now :p
---
Boom
---
Maybe, we still dont have a timeline for when they are rolling out the new stages... And if the side arent balanced and one side gets stomped then it will drive players away from BGs and wreck the queue times. It doesn't matter how many Horde are in the queue, if alliance players dont\* queue up then nobody wins
---
why did you crop the screenshot tho
---
Actually even in phase one fury warriors are the best. If you check the wowhead classic dps tier list, you'll see warriors then rouges. And this is current stuff too, not anything from private servers or 14 year old data.
---
Just because they don't care if its pristine, doesn't mean they don't want it whole.
---
Tufts of fur still need to be intact. Blood needs to not be on the ground, and in whatever vessel you have for it.
---
Weird you are having that experience.  I play Horde on Whitemane and some zones are a nightmare.  STV is almost unplayable sometimes.  I‚Äôm run into 50+ groups of ganking Alliance in low level zones all the time and they love corpse/FP camping.
---
Frost damage is better
---
Yes stealth formulae includes level.  Kind of like aggro radius is increased when the enemies are skulls.
---
Alliance dominates endgame content. Horde is at a huge disadvantage here. I actually think that Shaman are more useful than Paladins in small groups, but when you're talking 10+ players in a group (i.e. any organized battleground or raid)? Paladins are just flat out better. Paladin buffs reach everyone and their defensive dispel is 100x more useful than a Shaman's offensive dispel in group content.
---
The leveling experience on Horde is a lot smoother, but Alliance is enjoyable in its own way, even if the quests can be a pain in the ass sometimes.
---
I'm pretty sure /who is effected by layering
---
Take a break.
---
its now allmost the size of an actual buckler
---
Uhm hello.. he‚Äôs a shady dealer. 
---
Black is a shade, after all..!
---
I think it's quite fun to go on some mad revenge mission after getting killed.
---
My most satisfying and funny revenge was when I (warlock) got killed by a hunter while I had ress sickness just minding my own business. Then I figured he was heading to do those elite qs in wetlands so I find him and mess up his whole group and kill him repeatedly. His group finds a new spot to continue where I'm not disrupting their quest and the hunter reconnect with them while I'm chasing him. 
---
Then we got a standoff situation where they cannot engage the mobs as I'm standing there, and I cannot fight them all before they pull the mobs. I do /point on the hunter and his group ends up sitting down and letting me and the hunter fight. I kill him and when he comes back he ditches his group since they just let him die. The group could now quest in peace after they let go of the hunter. I corpse camp him again and he logs out.
---
No melee cleave :(
---
HotW is a very specific playstyle and does not scale well. Once other classes start to obtain gear, it's harder to outlast them and burn their HP down. It's also telling that the very best 1.12 druid rerolled because the class is overall so niche that he enjoyed playing mage/lock more.
---
Sounds like you should roll PvE
---
It was zoomed out a lot so I cropped to zoom in.
---
I haven't seen my blueberry since I unlocked the succubus. Imo seduction is just as powerful as torment for doing multipulls and her dps seems to be the highest of all the pets. 
---
I have the imps fireball at the highest it can be right now and it tickles things.
---
Or the game was difficult before 1.12. lots of stuff was added that helps. Not to mention onyxia was nerfed since the start.
---
nobody cares kid, stop being a little prick
---
LMAO , this is amazing . what server is this ?
---
I‚Äôm curious if anyone thinks it would be good if they released another iteration of WoW classic a year + later with buffed bosses?  
---
Everquest ‚Äúclassic‚Äù (called ‚Äòprogression‚Äô servers since you go from start through each expac) servers found the same problem on their first iteration ‚Äî it was too easy. Like WAY WAY too easy. People abused scripts and rolled enough of a class with a strong DD nuke on a super long cool down so that they spammed it as soon as the boss spawned and you literally can‚Äôt even see the boss. If you watch the YouTube video you can maybe see it alive for half a second and then all you see is the corpse.  
---
  
---
So they added Auras or Buffs on top of each boss (bosses and certain special key NPCs only) which did quite a few things like buffing their HP and mitigation to insane amounts. If melee were hitting the boss for 75-100 before now they‚Äôre hitting it for like 15-30. They also added an aura which made player resists drop a significant amount, so that bosses AoEs did a ton of a damage.  
---
This by no means made bosses impossible ‚Äî the ‚ÄúAPES‚Äù of these servers were still clearing things quickly. However, bosses once again proved a worthy challenge for less hardcore guilds and people who didn‚Äôt know the game like the back of their hand.  
---
The issues seen in WoW aren‚Äôt nearly to the same degree as those were in EQ, and I think this is a dialogue that will need to continue with more observations from BWL and Nax raiding, but it is pretty disappointing that Ragnaros is killed with significant amounts in the raid force below 60 and everyone pretty much wearing trash gear.  
---
Yes, #nochanges and all, but I feel the spirit of classic WoW is really the 1-60 leveling, grouping dynamics, and social structure. I think it‚Äôd be interesting for them to do another ‚Äúclassic launch‚Äù at a later date which attempted to make the raids more difficult, whether with just plain mathematics, or messing around with the mechanics while keeping them near to the original.
---
Mages using Blizzard on 2 mobs... Holy fuck that's too real. I can't imagine that is anywhere close to the best DPS Or DPME there is. I could be mistaken but it hits for like 90 while FB hits for 300-400 and costs 1/12 the mana or some shit
---
Some classes are mediocre even in 1.12, and you still want to go further back..?
---
No layers with more people than classic had on one server wouldn‚Äôt be the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù experience either.
---
Dang did you really! Haha, got it for a steal then. I got it for 1,300
---
Insane mobility, entangling roots gives you CC, and you can heal regardless of spec. Stealth, speed and damage in cat form, durability in bear.
---
It's rough trying to kill a feral druid if they've got hots ticking on them. It's impossible for most classes to catch up if you decide to book it. It all comes down to the sheer utility and flexibility druids get.
---
Nah it's okay
---
you do know that lvl 70 is BC not classic
---
on my rp server, i found and guided a group of 4 dwarves searching the Inn of Darnassus so they could drink alcohol and sh\*\*.
---
They were quite disappointed.
---
You do realize how much blood is in an animal... Right.
---
Yeah Paladins have nothing on druids when it comes to running away from battles stacked against you.
---
Bubble+hearth is just more infamous because it's a lot more in-your-face. But every class that has some sort of easy escape uses it regularly (Rogues, mages and hunters as well), and why wouldn't you? It's a weird "honor" concept that only applies when you are winning. "Look what coward he is" when you'd do the same in that position. No one wants to corpse walk to a corpse camp over some "honor" over never leaving, which people very rarely do.
---
Besides, doing an invul and escaping from battles when low is Blizzard tradition. I need to make a macro that shouts "Enough!" when bubble+hearth
---
Seriously though.  This was my experience on classic but reversed.
---
If you have accurate data on what the item disenchants in to, and accurate data for what the dusts and essences sell for, then you (or your auction addon, or your enchanting addon) can calculate the expected value/average disenchantment value of the item.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If the buyout/vendor value is less than the disenchant expected value/average value, then you should disenchant the item and sell the products. On average, you will make a profit.
---
Eh true I suppose but I was talking about level 40+ and I had 4 14s without buying any. 2 from questing and 2 from looting
---
And they replaced my 10s bags that I bought off the AH in early levels. So yeah start with 10s and grow it but still that guy acting like he doesn't have bag space likely carried way too many quest items
---
I think it's currently bugged. I remember thinking I'd hit the jackpot with a few greens early on, but it simply didn't disenchant into what was shown.
---
If it has been fixed then it is still potentially a gamble because there are multiple things that can be the result of the disenchantment, some worth more than others.
---
If you're looking for a sure thing maybe check the price of each possibility individually.
---
Yes that is the classic experience. Even though you feel like there is more horde, there probably isn't. You only notice them more. Honestly I wouldn't mind being on a 10 to 1 ratio because that means there is more alliance for me to kill lol. As every one else said. If you don't want to be ganked don't play on a pvp server.
---
yea no clue what he means, That's SHIFT+1-5 and CTRL+1-5
---
[It's almost exactly what I use and It's very efficient](https://i.imgur.com/Za3qBMX.png), You never really reach 6 without having to move your hand ,that'S why you use as much modular keys as you can.
---
You can even do it like I did it to support your brain distinguishing between the different combinations.For example 1-5 for me is very common attack spellsSHIFT 1-5 is healing and curingALT 1-5 is supporting spells that you don't need to constantly press.
---
I don't use STRG cause it's too annoying for me to press, but I know people do use it.  
---
But maybe he is talking about your macros at 1-3?
---
And more dots
---
Undead packs at the start of strat can be solo'd for pretty good gold, but that might require better gear than what we currently have available.
---
DM is not available until phase 2.
---

---
They're literally in a discord communicating with each other to camp devilsaurs.
---
Blizz has already had GMs ban people fore exploiting buildings in Booty Bay/Gadget. They will definitely be enforcing the Classic version of the game rules against this behavior.
---
But im guessing your just a mad CLC/Vampire member knowing thet you're guilds gonna get banned
---
yeah my friend is completely hooked, its not for everyone though!
---
As the Light intended.
---
[removed]
---
Strength before weakness
---
See normally I'd just say this is bad rng, but it's just such a massive shift each time after I level. Probably just in my head, but I cant help but wonder if theres some weird bug or something
---
Outstanding move fellow alliance member,
---
The horde shall fall
---
Soft headed peasants
---
You can smelt copper and tin together to make bronze. Maybe that's what it is suggesting. Any mention of bronze?
---
I‚Äôm a healer, and when there‚Äôs a hunter with a gun standing next to me for an entire dungeon, I just have to turn off the sound.  It‚Äôs terrible.
---
why are we looking at average instead of median damage?
---
Whats the problem with 2h war tank?
---
Generally speaking how much would the following enchants cost?
---
Enchant Boots - Minor Speed
---
Enchant Weapon - Fiery Weapon
---
&gt;nobody cares kid, stop being a little prick
---
stay mad. You will get banned for colluding and everyone will report you
---
actually thats the infernal. felguard quest is im blasted lands and isnt out till phade 2 or 3
---
Yea but sometimes You need to go back to town after a long bout of questing anyway. If they hearth away I imagine them being able to put their feet up and relax which is the opposite of what I want when I‚Äôm fighting them lol
---
Then idk what to tell you. I have no problem giving each caster 40 waters at the start and 20 food. Then they eventually ask for more so I give it to them later. If they want more at the start, they can also get it. 
---
I start dungeons at level 56 with 200+ water
---
I didn't say I don't do that - just pointing out how big a pain in the ass it is to have to worry about them that you have to do stuff like that.
---
Besides heavily pvp oriented zones STV and hillsbrand. I normally play in peace with horde players.... Until I finish my quests then I gank everyone on my back to turn them in, minus anyone who helped me in any way with questing
---
Forgot about the durability thing, still no point in fighting a full team solo though, saves time hearthing.
---
Good idea anyway
---
Using exploits in game vs talking with other faction players is completely different. 
---
When world bosses came out we would do this all the time by swapping who got the boss that week.
---
ultra-optimisators of reddit : "yeah, sorry, you wouldn't find any place as a hunter or retladin in a raid guild roster, every spot should be fulfilled in the best way to help the raid so they can beat the boss "
---
A random guy on westfall server : " Watch me and 23 others randoms beat the shit out of onyxia "
---
I've heard that auctionator is more lightweight but I haven't compared the two.
---
You're very trusting of people named "Mebackstabgnomes" and warriors who tank in berserker stance
---
But blizzard already said that the current realm sizes are several times bigger than vanilla was
---
Blizzard had the opportunity to fix this week 1, but they chose not to. Now it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it.  
---
It really sucks because it taints Classic for as long as it‚Äôs alive. If they do Classic+ or TBC, people will use the same characters and there‚Äôll always be a big faction imbalance.
---
I rolled a Warrior after seeing so many people always LF1M tank. Even geared it up quite nicely with enchants and all. After a few Deadmines of chaotic party members on multiple runs, I nope‚Äôd right back out to my DPS toon. As a Hunter, whatever I do in the run I am thinking of the tank and healer the entire time ‚Äî not some DPS meter.
---
I'm the same way with alliance usually too, unless I see them start something then I'll jump in and help my horde brethren
---
afaik you can only smelt copper bar together with tin bar into bronze bar. auctioneer is ported from retail, and for ‚Äûsuggestions‚Äú it uses a lot of recipes from retail that are different or missing in classic. i found auctioneer was getting way higher values than actual auction prices, so almost all suggestions were wrong. you can go into setting and turn some suggestions off, that are not available in classic.
---
When does the gold start to build up? I'm around 20 on a few different toons but the gold I do get mostly gets spent repairing and training.  When does gold gained questing and grinding begin to outpace training and repair costs?  The AH isnt much help as the low level skins and herbs I gather arent really selling for any more than their vendor price.
---
She also waited for me when we died while 7 mobs respawned between us. Was definately a fun journey and maybe you will read this :)
---
Also sometimes heal forgets to heal me üò≠üò≠üò≠. I am LVL 43 and died 10 times because heal didn't heal meüòëüòë. And they had full mana btw. They just randomly go afk or start to dps or heal hunter's pet. Or they save mana.
---
You are the hero we need, but not the one we deserve. I‚Äôve also noticed a severe lack of druids so if you feel like going feral bear tank, do it! And leveling won‚Äôt suck balls!!!
---
Classic has reagents for a lot of spells. Totems require you to have that element of totem in your bag, but you're also going to need shiny fish scales for water breathing, fish oil for water walking, and ankhs for casting Reincarnation. You'll see the reagent requirement in the spell's tool tip.
---
You joke but I give it a few months after naxx launches until it happens
---
I want to go sub just because of fun with PvP but doesnt it slow down leveling? And and on what level do you recommend switchin from combat ?
---
If Mind Flay isn't doing damage, thats a bug. The slow is the only thing that gets knocked off as a debuff, not the damage.
---
Are they really though? For new players such as me, who don't know what the fuck is going on?
---
Outplayed
---
Warriors are in the #1 spot already in MC etc. and with more gear they will get more damage.(graph was posted today on this sub)
---
Thats false
---
In my head, it‚Äôs the questgiver calling out for help first and then asking if you‚Äôve completed it.
---
*laughs in PVE server*
---
WHAT YOU CAN JUST JUMP OUT OF THE CANALS. WHAT THE FUCK I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH OF MY TIME.
---
It was my turn to post this
---
Oh hey, I know you're only level 16, but here's a 26 elite just walking the fuck around these level 14 mobs. Have fun!
---
Good movie. Damn good movie. saw it a few times as a kid but it never really made sense. saw it again this year and it just clicked. "Pull my finger you fucking fascist". Brilliant.
---
I would vendor it.  Get a solid 49 silver
---
Mr. Rogers taught me to always say please and thank you. I mean, this is kindergarten level stuff.
---
I think it's supposed to be "Hey, I've got a quest for you!" and "Have you completed my quest?"
---
Inside the instance at least 2 hours if you move fast and no wipes. Then factor in travel time, breaks, wipes, and you can shoot up to 3 hours easily
---
Oops i read that as brd. Bfd is a bit shorter
---
The game wasn't designed for you to keep track of enemy cooldowns but addons existed for that as well. Just because it was an oversight doesn't mean it's unfair to utilize addons to serve as solutions to problems they hadn't yet solved. I agree, just give castbars to all, but the #nochanges crowd fights back at the whiff of anything like that.
---
Just look at how the community got the LFG addon killed days before launch.
---
Who needs to spells hah!
---
Its a 1 hour cooldown you should be flattered not complaining
---
I think you went all in on the dr00d juice a bit. Yes they're ok, but there's a good reason 90% of guilds atm are running warrior tanks in MC.
---
What about that is false?..
---
Should have prepared a clean robe for him to change. Haha
---
There is a meat vendor in darnassus and owls also eat fish so you can level your fishing and get free food
---
I would use it, there's no suitable upgrades til mid-40s
---
it totally depends on the quality of your group. 5 experienced players with appropriate levels could get it under 30 minutes. if you are unlicky you can spend there several hours and not be able to finish it at all.
---
There are plenty of people playing other classes and you can see from comments on other people's posts that not everyone is worried about the meta. I feel like the majority of people playing classic are playing how and what they want to, while a very loud minority is playing the minmax meta.
---
My favorite is watching a bunch of paladins charge into the Horde in AV and then they all pop bubble and trinket hearth back to the AV Alliance base.
---
(After last boss)
---
‚ÄúI need x item for y quest. Where is that?‚Äù
---
I believe it. Some of the deaths I caused I wasn‚Äôt even stealthed yet lol. They just walk up and click.
---
Yeah man this was nothing new :&lt;. Like "ret paladins bad" has been the meme forever and ever.
---
They're skippable for everyone, and new players need to learn what they want to do about elite quests at some point. Earlier the better. Barrens has quests that are harder with no warning label.
---
This is why if a quest has some bullshit 5% droprate and I;ve been doing it for the past hour and only got 2 out of the required like 15 or something then I just abandon that shit
---
As a followup, do you know what the appraisal function does? From what I can gather, it gives you the most cost effective way of splitting up a stack, right?
---
RemindMe! 24 days
---
Not even my good side.
---
I heard a theory that it's not that the mobs don't have the quest item but you actually just ruined the item. So when zehvra doesn't have hooves it's because your character absolutely demolished the poor animal.
---
Closer to 30 it goes up much more. I got my mount right at 40 with some to spare. Up to around 20 I didn‚Äôt have anything to brag about
---
I love these fermented grains but I've got a feeling Arthas is coming for me!
---
I saw a post earlier with a link to a page that had data for faction / class distribution across servers. I haven‚Äôt been able to find it again. Can someone help me out?
---
What about raptors with no heads in barrens how can they even see you?!?!
---
Oooooh he card reads good!
---
What level are you? I found that most of my characters were painful until level 10ish, but then you start to come into your own. You gain a bunch of new abilities so combat is a little less boring. Also, by lvl 10, you can skill up professions to 150. I find that the more I level, the more goals I create for my character (work on fishing, complete quests in a zone, run a certain dungeon for a specific drop). If that's not as natural for you, maybe write some down and work on those? I highly agree that if you are only questing to finish the quest and you feel like a mailman running around a zone, it can get very tedious. But when I put a goal in front of me (get to level x so I can learn a new skill. Max out fishing. Gather herbs and sell them on the AH) I don't find the boring parts nearly as boring.
---
I tried to name my cat "Easter" after my mum's cat that I grew up with. It wouldn't let me. Struggling to work out why I tested a random name "Catster". I was not impressed when that did work and now my cat has a stupid name I can't change.
---
A) don't call us retarded no more ports/food for you b) I understand that you are pissed but pls understand that noobs are noobs and learn by failing anyway how would they lose agroo
---
Mark targets and help your dps focus on those 2 targets you can hold. No need to hold aoe Aggro from 3-4 sized groups if you can mark them(if you still want to: tab/sunder) . If you want to hold Aggro while they aoe bomb bigger groups: won‚Äôt work with fixed demo shout you will need late game with reflect dmg and engeneering.
---
Except that I think this says more about how awesome dps druids are. Great utility/relatively good dps/scales late
---
How do you find groups as a heal / dps because it honestly feels impossible to find groups for some dungeons. I'm on Alliance - Herod a very populated server and yet I have to spam LFG channel for 3-4 hours straight to find a place in a group for something like BRD which seems ridiculous considering I can heal the dungeons as a priest. I've tried making my own groups instead but it feels just as hard to form a group.
---
Nobody who‚Äôs been playing the last 5 years ever said that.
---
So it makes you weaker...?
---
The Spellcleave groups I healed was myself (Holy Priest) 2 Mage, 2 SPriests. The SPriests just MC'd the casters and destroyed everything. Once thier MC target died they just grabbed another and kept going. It was amazing.

Just downloaded it today, there‚Äôs an updated version but it works fine. 
---
There was an extra folder I had to take it out of after extracting it though, just a heads up
---
True, but from an aesthetic standpoint, flight paths could show us the storm peaks and more could be added if needed to offset removing flying. From a mechanical/community standpoint, flying leads to less PvP and less ‚Äúoh hey there, want to party for this quest or help me get through the area?‚Äù  Two key points of an mmorpg.
---
they still deal less dmg than on private servers and mc is melee #1 as usual
---
This situation is happening to my wife but not me. I have a PC and she has a Mac..
---
There was a good one in trade chat on my server earlier today too: 'join us to raid 15 year old content that was created in under a week.'

Made me laugh.

Downvote my comment you play video games on a apple mac.   SACRILEGE.  
---
Filthymac user.  Therea no excuse for that. How can you call yourself a gamer after admitting to that?
---
Locks scale better than any class in the game, utility is a bonus though for sure. Shaman main here so I know I am healing all day long.
---
Life tap basically converters the healer's Mana into the warlocks Mana.
---
is this actually against TOS though? i have seen people complaining about it but have yet to see someone actually link a TOS rule that would prohibit something like this
---
is it scummy? yeah. is it actually against TOS? i dunno...
---
Is it just me or has barrens chat gotten more disgusting, i remembered it as more innocent tom foolery back in the day but now its just people talking about the most disgusting porn imaginable.
---
When I start looking for a group I make a stop at the bank and drop off quest items, the poisons I prefer for soloing (and pick up the ones I like in a group), my fishing pole, basically anything I don't expect to need in the dungeon. I almost never fill up on a run anymore and can sometimes even hold stuff for party members so they can get food/water, pick up quest loot, etc.
---
Yeah but if all you‚Äôre doing is swinging a sword at it, it should be fine

You're probably right, but it was a very popular comment from people on here over the last 6 months. Here's one from today lol https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7y7lv/class_roles_in_classic/f15sssb/
---
I‚Äôve been playing on RP servers since vanilla and I‚Äôve never seen anyone speak in old English. RP is fun, you should give it a shot!
---
Going to try to push for dong to be used for future tense.
---
Anyone about to dong on this run?
---
oh thank god it wasn't people fucking in goldshire
---
I think youre overestimating how serious the average person takes this game.  What youre describing is what only the most hardcore raiding guilds will be concerned about.
---
And even then.  Every raid will need a decent mix of classes.  A raid with mostly warriors is severely gimping itself.
---
Beyond that, being the "best" dps.  What does that mean?  Just slightly higher?  Target dummy DPS?  Even if one class is far superior in all areas, viability is what people are concerned about.  And every class is viable to clear content.
---
When I was in that level range a couple weeks ago they they were very contested on my server. I can imagine it‚Äôs worse now. It‚Äôs a common farming spot and the elementals are quest objectives.
---
&gt; Most people who attack me show up as ???
---
A paper plate mask that says "no rogue here" is about as effective as stealth in those circumstances.
---
I play on arugal and every time i mention stance dancing they reply with * wtf is that* it gets rough some times
---
It's just as "hard" the dungeon spamming meta just circumvents the challenge of leveling a warrior.
---
Dang he dang
---
press V for nameplates. There's an option under display/interface to toggle guild and profession tags.
---
There's really no reason to go out of ZF 43-52 and BRD 52-60 at the moment. Unless something changes, people will just stay inside once the contested areas is the only place to get relevant quests.
---
The level of mental gimnastics you're displaying here, just to tell us that in fact, yes, you are wrong and if you NEED and item that doesn't upgrade you, you are in fact, a NINJA looter my friend. That is the only truth here, sure if us 4 rolled greed and you need them, yes you will be 1500g up in your bank account, but your gm and your guildmates will know about this, i will be roasting your shitty name for weeks on tradechat and I will totally be right to do it. So dont be an ass and roll greed ;)
---
i usually realize 5min in that im too high, i want the rest of the party to share my realization
---
The idea is that for every meme spec you bring into raid, you are spending that much more time clearing it.
---
Everyone in your raid is thinking "Why should some selfish prick weighing us all down get that fucking piece of gear over me?"
---
Because you bring the spec that needs to be carried. You don't contribute, and you are only there because someone else wants your personality more than they care that you are pulling them down.
---
I'd like to add dying on purpose at the start of the fight to go make a snack.
---
Go to Heartseeker.
---
Immediately understood the reference lmao.
---
shift click their name
---
Thanks for the tip. I set up all the macros.
---
How does it work when you level a spell up? For example, how do I code the script to cast corruption level 2 instead of level 1?
---
Also, does the order of pet attack vs spell effect the timing at all?
---
i use ‚Äûaux‚Äú for auction. it is ported from private classic servers so it has disenchanting formulas which are correct, and also estimates the market values far better than auctioneer in my experience. it has a lot less fancy functionality compared to auctioneer but it has simpler interface and basically does everything i personally need. it is however still under development and currently not very stable.
---
Doubt it
---
No. It's not truly how things were back in the day. 
---
Classic is absolutely tuned down. Also everyone knows every strat and has done all of this before. It's kind of killing the feel of classic really. 
---
Oh well.
---
Classic doesn't care if you're upset.
---
I enjoy world pvp and the sense of fear.  Just wish it wasn't always a rolling thing, but hard to change an ingrained playstyle of a group for 15 years.
---
The embarrassment comes from (at least back in the day) how hard you'd have to try to kill a paladin and them bubble-hearthing away denied you an HK for your hard work. I agree with you though, forcing someone to flee feels like a win.
---
Pretty sure it's zone wide.
---
That‚Äôs loot council mentality. If you want to do that, that‚Äôs fine, but declare that before the raid.
---
You'll spend your days getting ganked by people who are far superior to you, since you're trying to buy yourself into progress I can only asume that you are 200% dogshit in the game.
---
That bobbing gnome looks pretty peaceful to me.
---
Very uninformed.  He doesn‚Äôt even realize T3 gear is pure tanking gear and end game fury warriors use a combination of different pieces/sets.  Even the end game survival hunter being the best has been proven wrong.
---
If it existed in classic it would be 100% not bannable, you can't ban people for moving. It is not in classic though.
---
They just cut it into five pieces, like a cake.
---
You mean *laughs in half a game*?
---
No? Over watch was project titan, project titan was suppose to be the next big thing after wow. Overwatch in its current state wasn‚Äôt even thought of in 2003 when this was probably made.
---
This is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. I belly laughed for a good minute. Still chuckling.
---
You seen what those humans do to cows?
---
Oases?
---
You're thinking of a Tauren npc in Mulgore who gave out a quest and was voiced by the child. I think you had to find the Taurens dog or something. It was added in TBC from memory.
---
If you got agro you hit them or you were standing in the middle of a camp. That's your fault for dying, mages reset all the time if it's a bad pull or get a resist.
---
Mark a caster enemy with a skull and completely ignore it, won't deal a lot of damage to your party in most cases and allows toy to get reliable threat on the rest as they nuke the skull as hard as they could ever desire
---
Lmao, I love this.
---
Dang!  I just dung right before your ding and tank about to dong all over us!
---
I'm gonna tell everyone at school you're a loser, Timmy
---
Yep. Got mine in Vanilla after a druid juked my counterspell with a Hearthstone.
---
try /join world. it is another chat people use to look for groups. also make sure you a re looking at the chat and see for people looking for a healer. brd is more advanced and lategame dungeon which means that by that time a lot of players found themselves a guild or partners for forming groups. which means there are less pugs (public groups). finding yourself partners or a well populated and active guild will help a lot.
---
I think a good chunk of people rerolled, plus there‚Äôs those warriors who only dps and never tank. 
---
And for me personally, sometimes I just want to quest for a little while and not be bothered with a dungeon.
---
It used to be against the ToS.  Now there is a EULA and no ToS.  The EULA is fairly generic and doesn't go into specifics about cross faction collusion.
---
Damn there is some seriously bad information in that article. Loool
---
How‚Äôs the horde alliance split?  I heard alliance heavy right now?
---
Does it fell full when out questing?  
---
How hard are groups to find for dungeons?
---
the classic 3/1 horde ratio
---
But you can rez and buff. Enhance shaman are even worse off, except we are needed for lust, reincarnate, and totems. And you can be somewhat crossfunctional and heal DPS should that be necessary.
---
It's not like retail where things have to be balanced DPS wise, because otherwise high end raids won't bring the spec.
---
OK man, good luck with your perfect 40-man full guild group of Tier S and A with perfect attendance. The rest of us will be over hyah &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Fuck that quest like seriously. I GOT 1 MEAT IN 20+ KILLS
---
Keep that shit
---
Don't dissagree there but considering the requirements to get the sword and the fact it really is a tanking weapon what is there left to do with it? It should have gone to a tank and I guess that guy was MT?
---
Which pixel is Ragnaros?
---
*laughs in Paladin*
---
...does darnassus not have toilets?
---
amaxin tks so much
---
Use it. Keep in mind, you may not get your mount by forty but if you keep questing and just selling stuff, you‚Äôll get it by 44-45 no problem. So its up to you. Wearing it though will allow you to enjoy the game more as you get to that 44-45 point. Your choice.
---
People have 15 years of not just WoW experience but gaming experience built up since these raids were released. These bosses have incredibly basic mechanics so they really can‚Äôt stand up to that kind of pressure. 
---
Add to that fact that it is much easier to find information for these fights and we are working with the final versions of classes...how could these bosses be difficult ?
---
Gonna guess that's 2019 hardware mainly.
---
As a healer make friends with tanks. As a tank mike friends with healers. Dps tend to be a dime a dozen and a good tank healer combo can quickly form groups. An active guild helps as well.
---
I just wanna throw this out there too; I really don't think she's working right. We did a guild 22 man Ony with only 5 RDPS and she did not deep breath one time during the entirety of phase 2. IT lasted at least a few minutes. It really feels like they got a lot wrong with certain bosses.
---
Farming for chest last night the belt dropped 3 runs in a row...
---
Very true üçª
---
I got that yesterday and was super excited. But am a priest :(
---
Or old school decursive.
---
Ok? Just another PC fanboy. I don‚Äôt care what you think.  I don‚Äôt care about any of the BS going inside you‚Äôre head.  say sorry to you‚Äôre mother you have issues.
---
It's a given in any competent raid shamans are providing totems, and pallys blessings, and warriors sunder, and warlocks CoE, and druids MotW etc etc. It's not like people forget... it just goes without saying.
---
Is it much more populated than EF?
---
Thank you...
---
This is the sad reality. Getting other shaman to totem weave with grounding totem is a nightmare. They just don‚Äôt understand the concept that we actually go faster even though you might do less dps lol.
---
&gt;  five minutes
---
try 15, at least
---
Not a fun fact at all, my friend...
---
Tons of guilds recruiting, tons of groups searching in trade/world for dungeons. Plenty of people out in world questing. Definitely horde around, but many alliance!
---
Thats perfect man,thanks for this
---
Same.
---
300 yards according to [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Chat)
---
:o i didnt know that thanks:)
---
Also did it ever occur to you that if you tried playing classic wow with another laptop with OBS running. One that isnt a mac.....       or apple product 
---
They're not built for recording and gaming on. That's why you're getting issues. But you're trying to anyway and complaining that it has issues. 
---
Fucking dumbshit
---
Me slow falling into thousand needles.
---
Min max bullshit
---
Apparently they weren't interested in a pint.
---
It's not strictly because of layering we can magically have more people connected, it's their own artificial player count limitations due to probably what they think is "fun" for the players.
---
They could remove layering, and also just literally allow more connections at the same time. Achieve the same number.  But I imagine the team thinks it wouldn't be playable in terms of just overcrowding.  
---
That may or may not be true, but we'd never know cause they won't do it.
---
Holy shit. I've not managed to get all Peggles on a single map.
---
Yes. By a lot. 300+ 60‚Äôs alone online right now.
---
I just did a /who on horde and alliance on Earthfury, not even a comparison.
---
And saying classic was easy because modern classic is on the easiest patch is an error.
---
Yeah fuck that. That's 200 gold and some nice, expensive shit. I'd take that mail in a heartbeat.
---
i am
---
the two toxic events I was involved in were
---
1) dueling a warlock on a ship and telling him beforehand not to fear me.. well he did.
---
2) someone not /roll on a chest twice in one dungeon
---
Playing on herod, very high server poplulation.
---
community is very kind
---
you're looking at 90th percentile, median is pointless because people dont know how to optimally play a spec, its just noise.
---
Keeping something at a certain range. Kind of like flying a kite
---
brother
---
Omg id be disrupting the shit outof y'all. This is way too polite and inefficient for me.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt have issues for retail.  You are not reading my original comment.  You are just filled with emotion and it makes you look and sound weak.  Stop getting emotional and looking for a negative dig.  I am seeing if anyone else has had issues like this and possible solutions.  One of the only places to look and ask.
---
Grow up
---
It's based on quality of the gear only I believe.
---
The thistle teas help the whole way, you can have someone else make them just buying herbs though.  Just like you can buy all the gear a lw would make.  Having a stash of healing potions is nice simply because you made them just to level up alchemy.  The instant gratification of seeing in 5 more ranks of lw means a cool new item you can wear does feel cool.  But also could just buy it.  Alchemy would be mich more useful overall but if you like the sound of lw... go with it bro.  There is no wrong answer.  Late game you may want engi/alchemy and just buy ore and herbs.  Also alchemy can sell your arcanite transmute every couple days for a handful of gold for doing nothing except giving up your timer.  Or get the ore and crystal and just make the bars and sell them.
---
So, by that logic then you probably don‚Äôt run master looter because it takes longer than regular group loot then I‚Äôd assume?
---
Your brother is a god damn monster who has earned my damned respect
---
So heartless
---
4 gigs of RAM is not much nowadays. Make sure you are not running any other programs like a web browser when you play.
---
You polymorphed me a few times in feralas by the yeti cave and enoted a bit before knifing me out and letting me go on my way haha
---
Yes, but the point is that removal of layers will increase queue times
---
I remember doing this on my NE rogue with explosive sheep in the undead starting zone
---
That was part of why I quit vanilla originally. I started playing some other RPG and when I logged back into WoW it really stuck out how naked the quests were just "go murder generic respawning things in this area and come back." When I came back for WoD I was impressed with how they had expanded the different objectives for quests. There's still a ton of "go here, kill these" but there are also activities to break up the monotony. Then on the other end of the spectrum there is "a turtle has made it to the water" where you'd rather just kill some birds and crabs.
---
Yeah, you're right. After some digging it looks like ththe range is about 300 yards. I think it does interact with zone borders though. Like how in... I think it was Wrath where Gamon would yell about stuff. You couldn't hear him outside of Org but you could hear him anywhere in the actual city.
---
This is evil. I must try it.
---
...I'm an idiot. I thought  PUG stood for Players un-guilded.
---
WASH YER BACK
---
If you can 30 man MC with 58‚Äôs in the group, I doubt the other raids will be unclearable without min/maxed players.
---
Dude, I recommend tribal. LW is a hard profession to make money with, and between the hide of the wild (phase 2) and the devilsaur set, that will be a much better decision. Technically speaking, elemental has gear that you could use (living set), but there are much better healing options pretty easy to get in endgame dungeons.
---
makes sense
---
You summon eye of kilrog to pull and the priest will shield your eye. The mages take turns nova'ing the mobs and you all aoe them down.
---
Don't let people push you around. A lot of people don't really understand tanking, aggro, rage, etc. You're the most valuable member of the team because you're so hard to replace. If they start pulling for you, or dpsing before you can get threat, tell em to knock it off.
---
Well actually not, ik pretty decent at this game and i play classes who are superior at 1v1. Very ez
---
I hate this chart sooo much
---
Windfury totem buffs every melee in that group and any extra damage that is done from Windfury is technically Shaman damage
---
good job!
---
Oops, I wasn't done. So I think you'll get the most money and use out of tribal, so long as you plan on using the profession to make money at some point.
---
And here I run around with Vanquisher's sword on my hunter like an idiot.
---
good job! lol
---
I‚Äôve got a couple of friends on EF so I‚Äôm leaning towards that for that reason, but I‚Äôll consider doing heartseeker instead if it‚Äôs much better.
---
I was today years old when I learned about %t
---
Its cuz hes watching over the goblin, cuz hes short
---
Awesome dude
---
Don‚Äôt reroll
---
Nope people.dont want.to learn how to play classic they want to treat it like retail, and someone posted a few days ago about a small trend asking healers and tanks to not roll on loot. Its so bad i dumped my tank and rerolled a rogue
---
No you dont need on items for gold -_-. Need means need, and you should equip it immediately, thats how its always been in vanilla.
---
Drop rates wouldn't bother me so much if the mobs spawned quicker.  Most of the time there are bunch of dead bodies around me and I just sit there waiting for the next one to spawn, which often takes 5-10 minutes.  
---
You can keep the shitty drop rates, just have these dudes spawn like 60 seconds after you kill them.
---
Deliberately killing people from a place that is unreachable by guards, is a bannable offence.
---
His name (Dvergur) means Dwarf in Icelandic
---
Awww
---
I feel like you answered your own question
---
Yeah my mate (who I played with in vanilla) got a tad too used to the retail breathing bar and drowned in darkshore. I was with him and was super confused as to why I didn't see him going up for air while i was going up and down... then suddenly he just dropped dead.
---
Ever since the fix*
---
I get whispers from randoms to tank dungeons. I'm a *paladin*.  No, there aren't enough tanks.
---
You might think that your player would be more careful after the first 100 kills though.
---
Strongly requesting good attack bars / keybinds / macros for a warrior for 1. open world pve and 2. Dungeons. Currently at lvl 19 getting into DM and getting overwhelmed by my action bar
---
those are gray items, which means they are trash and their only use is selling to vendor. your addon is probably ported from retail, where those might be of better quality and are used for something.
---
Are you blind?
---
Quests have intentionally low drop rates in vanilla to compensate for the lack of them. If everything had 100% drop rate you would run outta quests even faster. 
---
They're essentially just leading you to mob grinding areas.
---
You're pathetic. Go spend time with your wife.
---
Robes of winter night should be a touch better, but cost at least 36g in felcloth aline
---
Oh right thought you meant deadmines haha
---
Every raid usually will require a shadow priest for their warlocks. 
---
There is good news and bad news as shadow. You ain't getting SHIT from raids over your healing priests. Cause shadow doesn't get any love from your tier sets, at all. That being said all of your BiS in phase 1 are basically random drops from BRD, Scholo, MC and some crafted pieces.
---
Centaur without bracers are the worst
---
Nearly every leveling guide I've seen assumes you're on a PvE realm and say nothing at all about useful PvP talents/skills to take or how to use them. These guys are running PvE farming/leveling builds on PvP servers and get absolutely wrecked because they gave no thought to what would happen when they get jumped.
---
Mining, herbo, skinning, everything else is better than brd runs.
---
In my experience that one has a 100% drop rate though
---
Yeah only works in barrens tho
---
Pretty sure most warriors want to be dps anyway.
---
Someone there isn't in your guild!
---
oh man
---
I tend to spam trade with people as warlock to toss healthstones at them and now I'm wondering if they're getting the wrong idea
---
You were spot on, he's the one out of touch here
---
Lol the first one was worth it because well ya know happy wife happy life. It it‚Äôs for me then spending isn‚Äôt an option lol. 
---
It was also 10ish years ago and it was hand painted on a canvas and we had almost no responsibility so all income was disposable income. 
---
Paid or not any art is beautiful and deserves praise. I hope people don‚Äôt perceive not having income to pay for a request is considered not respecting their worth.
---
Yeah you would have more success getting your pre raid gear and then selling your heals to groups. Make a reputation for yourself and you‚Äôll be set.
---
A proc if some kind associates with your spec or gear. Either they have no resource cost, guaranteed Crit, etc.
---
Not as bad as meatless turtles.
---
I remember doing shit like this back in the day. I'd put an exploding sheep next to a low level player and /hug the sheep and /pet the sheep and the little shits would hit it can kill themselves.
---
One of the more balanced pvp servers that's for sure
---
Perfect pop to get groups in a timely manner and not have to deal with waiting for quest mobs
---
Rofl
---
Idk, ive never played mage at a high level. 
---
Theres not really any way for someone else to decide this for you. Just keep playing them both until you decide which one is more fun. Fun is the point of the game
---
I pretty much never feel bored during flights as that's almost always my bathroom or reading stuff online time (often about quests or materials for professions or the subreddit etc).
---
It is anecdotal. But there is nothing wrong with anecdotes. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm making some huge argument based on it. It is not false however. What basis do you have to claim that? This is a thing, that happened to me, that is interesting and relevant to the conversation.
---
Lol I'm level fucking 18 and I got ganked twice in Lakeshire today while I was fishing.
---
As a former main Paladin in vanilla I‚Äôve done this many times probably and thought ‚Äúhaha can‚Äôt kill me now!‚Äù Over the years when I switched and encountered the same thing happen to me I think haha he wasted a cooldown and hearth. It truly is a win/win for both lol
---
That feeling when for some reason 98% of the classic playerbase has a quest helper addon.
---
Seen full groups of 40 wiping all night on Onyxia. It is not that everyone is better, its that the best video game players are much better than the best 15 years ago.
---
If you plan on playing holy I'd just go your final holy build at 58. You're gonna have to do a decent amount of these 5 mans for gear anyway.
---
Oh boy! What level should I go there again?
---
I think the meme they were talking about was *hunters are garbage raid dps*, not *huntards pull the whole instance with their pet*.
---
Not true, you can absolutely just spontaneously change layers, without inviting anyone, fighting someone, anything
---
Is 4-5 hours sleep not enough?
---
Real life responsibilities are overrated.
---
So all grey items should be vendored? Then why is so much of it on the AH?
---
This is a myth.  You can check the 1.12 patch notes yourself.
---
I'm only a noob mage but I went skinning and tailoring, as I figure (from what I have read) enchanting is a big gold sink so I can always switch to it later when I have more gold. Not fully sure though.
---
I'm on bloodsail RP server and they aren't all hardcore RP, you still have to seek out the ones that stay in character.  I personally enjoy being able to jump in character as I please, gives some more depth to the open world experience and a break from the grind.  It's always entertaining bc people can tell when you are in character and they play along.
---
Sorry, I'm bread spec
---
The scenario described in your last paragraph has literally never happened so dont be so cynical.
---
Clearly all the tanks weren't from the host guild.
---
I love how you're scratching your ass in boredom
---
Bind on equip follows the same rules. It always has, you greed unless you are going to equip it.
---
Hey I didn't say it was well informed, i said it's common. Look back through the Class Discussion stickies from 2 months ago for a good laugh.
---
Dumb
---
False you do randomly get layered
---
God damnit... fucking lol...
---
Easy frames or Unitframes improved. Both is pretty much the same.
---
That's why I'm on a pve server. People call it ganking and say it's fine. But if you just wanna play classic.. especially with the camping and dancing on the corpse.. it's fucking griefing.
---
Haha! Love it
---
that would be the way in perfect world. but in reality you have to deal with different players with different opinions on that topic. one of way is to need on expensive boe to eliminate ninjaing possibility. im not saying thats how everyone should do it, im saying that this happens and you should be aware of it.
---
Shamans being that low breaks my heart...
---
I played mage in classic, playing a priest now. I learned to be better. I always message, "Can I buy some water?"  Many say no charge, but the others I give 10s. Nothing I hated more than people that would expect it with out even politely asking.
---
How long is a day? Like 8hrs?
---
Invictus? You guys are from Skeram surely. Hail!
---
Whelp your doing it wrong
---
All Alliance must die!!
---
Or satyrs without horns, kodos without livers..
---
Use slam on warrior and you'll realise it can store attacks sometimes.
---
No it doesn't lol ive played since vanilla
---
Wait why 24 days?
---
The last time the mage traded water on default to anyone. Even to me: The warrior tank. GG THX
---
So far only pleasant groups for me. Only gripe I have is that everyone is so focused on the bis-lists.
---
Wow dude thanks a ton very informative
---
For every one of your guilds that means another guild has 15 mages and 1 druid i guess.
---
17 but I‚Äôd recommend 19 or 20 for smooth sailing.
---
Nice!
---
I‚Äôm two full clears away from getting one of the final talents. I assume once that happens the rest of them get a ton easier.
---
The noggenfogger bug is on Bliz official list of known bugs. The Mana burn one (if true) is pretty severe.
---
Most of these others aren't bugs. Some may be, but Id have to test myself to see if true.
---
No thanks.
---
-will make decent servers for some completely barren
---
-when queues start when layering ends I think it would be a disaster for hardcore players from queue servers to transfer to my medium pop server and ruin the community
---
But the other guy didn't get a chance to fight. I fight with honor.
---
Idk why this is so funny to me
---
O my sweet summee child..
---
&gt;there‚Äôs nothing wrong with soy
---
&gt;Eating half a serving of soy food a day lowers sperm concentrations and may play a role in male infertility, Harvard University researchers report
---
Lol, I came across some comments here earlier about people constantly talking about layers, and thought to myself that I'd never heard anything like it. Then I join world, and it's *all* they talk about.
---
How do they even tell that they're on a different layer?
---
Sounds good! LoadsofCoke the Polar Bear loves trying new food!
---
Wasn't that fixed already in 1.10 or 1.11?
---
Anything fancy or just evasion etc?
---
Just this afternoon during the last 2 hours of my sleep I kept waking up with frantic thoughts about the game, running dungeons and completing quests.  Makes it very hard to get good sleep with these merciless thought patterns.
---
Dont play, problem solved.  Also, dont be an asshole so you wont have an issue.  But I'm sure you're a saint online right?
---
If you counted dps that way the warrior tank would be way out in the front providing -2250 armour to every single other physical dps in the raid. Would be pretty funny to see lol.
---
I advised rogues before, and that advice still holds.
---
But in addition to rogues, warlocks specced either Soul Link/Nightfall or Soul Link/Shadowburn are good for solo PVP in Classic.
---
Also, frost mages and shadow priests are pretty good at solo PVP in Classic.
---
So you would probably do well looking at any of those four options.
---
300 Yards, per googling.
---
Humans in Hillsbrad don‚Äôt have skulls smh
---
Remove it completely. Layers will be removed in stages much earlier.
---
2h warrior tank is a free spot when your group forces you into tanking after unsuccessfully trying to find a real tank.
---
Gnomes are my favorite race :)
---
Thanks, Knife.
---
People seem to forget about the bad and think that every single person back in vanilla was a shining beacon of friendship and teamwork. It‚Äôs crazy.
---
The disgusting oolings aura canceled out the stacking debuff in C'Thuns stomach, allowing players to remain in there indefinitely, but it was hotfixed very soon after it was discovered.
---
It means you're playing retail because that belt was added in legion
---
Tuskless boars and toothless Jawbreaker Trolls. What has this world come to?
---
There's some truth to that. I've never minded and even enjoyed doing the quests even if I have already done them. Idk
---
Sure let me quote a blue post 
---
"While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan."
---
Straight from a blue post, when we turn off layer server queues will increase......

That honestly isn't really a thing. I played on Moon Guard for a while, then like 6 years of Emerald Dream. Never saw anyone get salty. Same thing on Grobb
---
My bad, it's even more boring than I remember.
---
Usually when I see a mage doing this and it's against my quest mobs, I'll wait until he frost novas and then demo shout as many as I can and pull them into his blizzard.  The rest, well, the rest is up to him at that point.

Lmao just tryin to share a nice pic, my dude. You're the one upset.

What is the Rogue 10 min CD?
---
What? I raided classic as both arms and furry  and there were plenty of dps wars.  I often was top dps.
---
Also played since vanilla. Pretty sure it's 100%.
---
But they only drop one so if you're in a group only one of you will get one.
---
start fresh servers and do it again
---
You're strictly wrong. The point of layering was to not have dead servers because of low (playable) server caps. The idea was classic populations would drop to a full original vanilla server by phase 2. If that doesn't happen they will have to implement queues to keep what blizzard would consider a playable product
---
if you have enough free time for this to be worth it more power to you..

Trash at pvp ü§£ü§£üò≠

This is true. Ironically, telling me to get an absurd amount of a quest drop with 100% drop chance would definitely motivate me more than a lower number of a reduced drop chance. Every kill is definite progress!

Fast ranged weapons are for the non hunters. Nevee use them no matter how much of a dps upgrade they are

Hold it until the economy is more developed

Ok guys ive already done this twice in classic too its not 100% i guess u guys get lucky rng then
---
Yeah there would have to be a good median lol but some quests specifically make me wanna die IRL. Either adds spawn too slow or too fast. Drop nothing or drop in bursts.

This can‚Äôt be random. Lol.

This is the specc i was running :) Currently playing dagger though with my sweet Barman Shanker. Just send me a message if you need help with anything.

If we booted everyone who didn't rp off the server it'd be dead.
---
Same. Pretty annoying.
---
Ok. Your servers can have layering with phase 2 world bosses as long as you NEVER get to transfer to non phase 2 layered servers. 
---
Not. Even. Once
---
I don't RP and never have, but I know that most proper RP'ers don't like this form of RP'ing. You're essentially "forcing" the story by saying you did something. Proper way would be ".. attempts to push %t in the water." so they have a say in the matter. Otherwise you can just run around doing "/me steals all your gold".
---
It's so annoying!!! I'm a mage myself. So over other mages not being able to farm properly.
---
On Herod Horde, run speed is 5-6g, fiery weapon is 20-25g.
---
Picky fuckers
---
**ENOUGH!**
---
You wouldn't get anywhere near 30g for that I dont think.
---
Not knowing things might very well be the case. I've just been selling stuff, but that makes me quite confused as to why people have been buying my gray stuff.
---
It‚Äôs a game, the point of it is to have fun. If questing and exploring are your thing than do that, nothing wrong with it.
---
Hook em
---
not sure what your question is. you cant find out how many layers there are and what layer on you are. but if it happens that someone from different layer invites you to party, then you will be moved to his layer. this transition is visible by mobs/players/ gathering nodes disappearing or appearing  right in front of you.
---
Is there any guides on how to pull with this comp? I am a lock but a beginner to wow so I have never done it. I have been kicked from a few groups bc I told them I wasn‚Äôt comfortable eyeball pulling. I‚Äôm unsure how close I have to take it and how many mobs I should pull. I‚Äôve only ever done like 6 dungeons but I always just follow the tank
---
It would be funny doing 1.1 talents but it wouldn't be that different. All your warriors would only be tanks, all your druids would be resto, and you'd need one healing pally to go 31pt ret for BoK. I don't think any of the other classes really changed massively.
---
You could have skipped it.
---
Go fuck yourself it's a videogame you fuckwicket stop bullying people and have fun, if this is fun for you get banned.

That is not what is being discussed here at all.

That's almost exactly what it means. They have no purpose other than selling to a vendor
---
Faction?
---
Fuck. Those. Trolls. I level with my buddy who is a warrior and the quest to get that whirlwind axe had us grinding those trolls for EVEN LONGER than necessary. Still didn‚Äôt even get all the bone tooth necklaces.
---
The aggro in classic is so weird. Normaly if no1 else touch the mob except for the guy that just died the mobs reset and run back to their spots. in classic however they will swap to a player that is nearby.   
---
Sometimes I see situations wher some dude is running from a cave with 10 mobs on himself, he gets dazed, dies and mobs switch to some random just passing by and kill him aswell.
---
Trying to parse in legion was so frustrating. I was the eighth highest parsing arcane mage on my realm. Two guys above me were legitimately better than I was. The other four above them were there because they had the time warp legendary. Without that legendary it was physically impossible to parse any higher than fifth on the realm.
---
Mate, just give them the damn water. If you wanna charge for water or portals when you are out in the world then do so. Don't do it for dungeon groups.
---
You are DPS, you are easily replaceable. You even said you've been kicked out of groups for this.
---
Right?? Wheres the imagination? Where is the RP in MMORPG? The game is only as fun or realistic as you make it.
---
No. My server won't. 
---
And I REFUSE to even be apart of a cross server bg group with layered world boss servers.
---
Sounds like a charity.
---
I seem to nm only ever get 20 or 21. Never had a 19 that I remember and I am level 56.
---
that isnt how we kill people in wow, we're better than that
---
shit do i really need the /s?
---
I recall doing needs on BoE world drops in dungeons due to people rolling need and then selling the item. You can't force a person to equip a boe so everyone rolls need.
---
You're so close. Maybe play a little less for a couple days, use that rested xp to reduce rl time played.
---
To be fair just running up and saying that you push someone isn't very good rp etiquette
---
At least he‚Äôs earning the right to yell, ‚Äúhunter weapon!‚Äù

Back in classic i had a macro for my battle rez that would mimic scarlet with "/y Arise, my champion!"  then enough spaces to make my target go "[%t] yells:  At your side, milady!"

Sadly it doesn't work on this version, because they cut out the ability to go down a chat line :(

Oh it‚Äôs an odd number, he meant thirds.

LF Blink
---
Wow lmao this guy has no clue.
---
Heh. I feel the same way. The only reason I'm on a PvP server right now is because everyone I know is on one so no real choice. I really want to roll on a pve server though just because I dont have a lot of time to play compared to others so having some asshat ?? Level kills me repeatedly while I'm just trying to get shit done annoys me. Not to mention, 98% of the encounters in the world are someone with a heavy advantage attacking someone who is at a disadvantage.
---
Definitely thank you
---
I mean he's playing WoW lol
---
You can make yourself a list of rare mobs for a zone pretty easily on wowhead. For example, here's Dun Morogh:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npcs/classification:4:2?filter=6;1;0
---
Try and quest in areas that are just a bit under level for you, it‚Äôll be much easier. 
---
As far as rogues go, don‚Äôt be afraid to use your cooldowns and vanish from fights that are getting a bit too much. It‚Äôs rough but as soon as you have enough points to spec into blade flurry and adrenaline rush (assuming your speccing combat) things get more fluid and easier. 
---
Definitely run the different wings of sm also as the xp per hour is great.
---
Not really. I wand and SW: Pain religiously during dungeon runs but even then it mostly never amounted to more than half of the lowest performing dedicated DPS.
---
Often SW: Pain isn't even worth the mana because you never know when someone is going to fuck up and you'd wish that you had saved the mana and started your mana regen a couple of ticks earlier. So mostly I just err on the side of caution.
---
If we talking like thousands of years of sunbconscious influencing level arachnophobia from ancestors getting fucked then that‚Äôs fair but only if she‚Äôs Aussie
---
It used to be even, but after the recent wave of transfers it‚Äôs comically unbalanced in favor of the alliance. Some contested zones are effectively impossible to quest in as horde during peak hours. It‚Äôs not fun. I know people who actually abandoned level-40+ characters in order to switch servers, which seems crazy to me
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
Oh fuck! That made me giggle so hard. Perfect timing and fantastic subversion of expectations.  
---
Well played, Druid. Well played.
---
But what does that matter. As long as they stick around til you get yours it still takes the same amount of time/kills.
---
One of the many benefits of a PvE server: You don't have to worry about this garbage.
---
same 30 tl 36 seemed take ages. then it got much better
---
Yes, it does. See the posts Blizzard made that directly state that queues will increase when layering is removed. Servers are currently operating well above vanilla capacity and layering is removed we are all returning to that capacity
---
Recruiting keeps the guild active, not removing names that will never logon again (and thus have 0 effect).
---
It's been pretty faer so far.
---
Yeah, they should be expected to be polite. Don't be an asshole or you get treated like one.
---
Holy crap talk about a throw back. I too am now curious about this.
---
Ah yes, age ol' other people do a thing that doesn't affect me but I disagree with it so O must cast shame.
---
You're a chungus.

did you compleated all wetland and duskwood quests. i went to svt omly when i really needed it and it was lvl 33. then quests are easyer since there are more green mobs

I thought private servers had increased mob armor values.

They won't have cross server BGs, no need, populations are high enough. And for world bosses, they can easily make it so they despawn when one is killed.

I was in decolace last night doing the 2 quests where you have to collect 15 centaur ears and get to friendly with 1 of the clans (fuck yeah clan gelkis) which ended up with me killing roughly 50-60 centaurs.

Well time to switch to an rp server

You can never go wrong with dungeon gear. What I do is use classic wowhead and search dungeon loot and dungeon quest rewards for my level range and gear up that way.

The quest is not available to horde. You can pick up the egg if an alliance does the quest, but that's the only way.
---
Juzt a lower chance to fail on high level herbs.
---
If you don't mind wait times Faerlina is actually fun for Alliance. This last week with the big raid groups was entertaining.
---
Classic difficulty is handling loot drama. Onyxia isn't hard. Determining how to handle what she drops is way harder than getting her drops.
---
Please link one.
---
Correct.  I dont know what the exact level ranges are, but purple stuff will drop from monsters somewhat around the level of the item (so staff of jordan from late 30s early 40s stuff)
---
its an mmo and you cant avoid grind. i find myself doing quests is less grindy since your gameplay changes more often. so it kind of distracts you. doing repetitive dungeon or grinding mob spot is more efficient but also the repetition makes you feel the time go slower and boring. most factor in mmp is ofcourse player interaction. its big difference if you grind your quests alone, or find yourself some friends, maybe even join voice with them. you could event talk about completely game unrelated random stuff while griding.
---
God bless your soul and the guy that made the addon's soul

The talk at launch was this is a private server thing because proper vanilla has those packs with abilities that make solo'ing them impossible.

God how I missed you classic!

Agreed I'm alliance and so far it seems really balanced. Added plus is there aren't many griefers who just corpse camp you for the hell of it. I've only been in a queue once and it was less than 5 mins.
---
Cant dodge or block either
---
I know this is a joke but I‚Äôve had to abandon like 5 drop quests and relog them to get quest items to drop. Think some of them might be bugged.
---
&gt;  dps warriors both weren't a thing at all last time MC was current content
---
Yes they were...
---
I feel like the drop rate for tradeable items eg cooking quests items are reduced in the zone the quest is given in. I get mad and give up, go to the next zone and the items drop constantly. 
---
I could not get mulock fins to drop in red ridge then got a pile of them in wetlands. Same with spider legs, killed 20 no legs in red ridge, then got 10 of them killing  15 pygmy spiders in duskwood.

At least I'm not pulling my raid down by playing a shitty class.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs been a bitch. I rolled an ally toon, got them to Westfall to buy it, got to Menethil and took the boat over, then swam to The Barrens to take the boat from Ratchet to BB to sell the feed to a friend of mine who traded it to me. I just want the damn chicken!

E: do NOT try to corpse run STV at level 6. Trust me

It‚Äôs works in real life too. Like if you get pulled over, miss your deadline at work, forget to pickup the kids, etc.

Yes you can. 
---
/who z- shows people in your layer.
---
If you take the Z- out, it shows everyone. Ie. 55-58
---
If there is no difference in who is displayed. There is no layer.
---
From my understanding all talent trees and builds are viable for tanking early on. It‚Äôs the higher difficulty content that you‚Äôll have to focus on specific builds. Also warriors are very gear dependent. Train first aid and get herbalism and alchemy for health pots. You‚Äôll need em.
---
i believe i saw in that Classic with Creators series, that our good buddy Jeff Kalpan from the Overwatch team designed most of the westfall quests.
---
(I think he also made that one Stranglethorn Vale quest with all the pages, But i could be totally wrong on that one too)
---
How'd you get it to just stay yellow like that?
---
Heals are a dime a dozen on my server. No one is ever looking for one let alone paying for one.
---
Hahahah holy shit it's fucking horrendous
---
We need a picture of the minimap with small golden dots for that authentic feel.
---
In terms of specc I would go Arms. It will teach you how to 'stance dance' with tactical mastery while leveling.
---
Make sure to keep your weapon updated
---
Tanking? Look at the healers Mana and always try to evaluate the different situations.
---
Oh god don‚Äôt come to Heartseeker if you‚Äôre alliance unless you enjoy 10:1 population imbalance
---
Like it might as well be a PvE server if you‚Äôre alliance, and a dumpster fire if you‚Äôre horde
---
It doesn't. It was a joke about RNG that clearly didn't come across well enough.
---
You dont really. I do my best by charging in, blood rage, sweeping strikes, defensive stance, demo roar, grenade and then sunder/revenge as needed. Mostly on the second or third targets while dps blows up the main target. When I lose threat on skull, if it's near dead I ignore it but if its 50% hp I'll tab taunt and go back to the other targets. Works ok. Dont waste rage on t-clap or heroic strike for trash. Dont waste a gcd on rend. If a pack is almost dead, pool some rage for next pack.

Dont buy any more ranks of skills. Dont buy gear. Grind ur next levels in dungeons or on mobs not quests and you will have 90g for mount

Tailoring has some incredible BiS gear.

The bloodvine set from ZG with tailoring set bonus is epic. Not to mention Robes of the Archmage

Lose so much gold while leveling when you forego skinning

You misspelled "spamming noggenfoggers for the slow fall effect".

How long will it take to gear 10 mages? How many hunter items will be disenchanted during that time?

Pretty sure it's just in cities that the general ( and trade) chat isn't layered.

Still going to need a few for tranq shots even in the late game, and the melee would probably rather have Trueshot Aura, than not have it.

There was a time on a private server I was leveling in Duskwood and an undead rogue ?? level kept ganking people. I shielded and /chicken'd him in there before it wore off so he could kill me. He spent the rest of the night camping and killing me and me alone. He'd sit and mess around with my friends and I'd rez and immediately die. It was one of the funniest things to happen to me in wow.

I hate boats so much. There was a time in my late 40s where it felt like I was spending more time flying and waiting for boats than I was leveling.
---
This. I played on RP servers for years and I'd bet money most people who play on them don't RP.

It's the people who actively grief that you need to focus on, not the people minding their own business and not being disruptive.

Awful against shaman and casters though
---
What is the best way to get resources for Enchanting? I'm struggling levelling it and getting work for it - but tailoring work is quite easy to find and grind resources for, and fishing isn't taxing at all. I just feel like I'm missing out on a market corner here, even if the latter 2 are going alright.

I‚Äôve read that horde can do the quest without snatching the egg from an ally character, as long as they have the feed.

I‚Äôm already coming to terms with having to do the clucking with my low level ally toon and having my horde toon logged out at the site and switching over once the egg appears, but I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs possible without having to do that

They're not going to raise it **further.**

This is not the same thing as saying they are not going to raise it PERIOD.

If you need any more help, let me know.
---
This brings a smile to my face lol
---
There's also the fact of the matter than any item desirable for twinks has way less of a point right now. No honor, no battlegrounds.
---
It's not stupid dude. Unless you are in a guild with exactly 40 raiders where eveyonr is friend to each other then you can have even 10 shadow priests playing.   
---
But the moment there are more peopl intrested in raiding than 40 and you are all bunch of randoms to each other, that just happened to be in the same guild then why would you even take someone who is worse at doing certain thing and has no potential to become better, but the opposite - with each new content will fall even more.   
---
It's that you can't bring spriest to a raid, it's why would you bring a priest to a raid when you have 3 meges sitting on the bench and willing to raid.
---
Yes, I think we all hope for that. However, they have to have an active game for that to be successful. And when we have half-sized pug groups in greens downing the most difficult content available, that whole activity thing might be become a big problem. With phase 2 being relatively nothing, it won‚Äôt be too long before you have large numbers of people getting bored and uninterested, having already ‚Äúdone it all‚Äù aside from various side-grinds you may or may not be interested in. And what if BWL is just as easy?  We could easily get into big trouble player-base-wise if blizzard plans to slowly release these phases over a period of 1-2 years or more, and they‚Äôll never even get a chance to steer the ship anywhere.
---
I regularly have to look for about 2 hours for ANY tank.
---
Non cross server bgs would go against their no changes policy of the current vanilla patch for battlegrounds. 
---
X-server bgs were added in 1.10 as well as the nerfed AV which they said is staying true to the patch.
---
You will not have layering in phase 2 because they wont keep it for some servers and not for others. That's not how the layering technology works as its built into the automated game technology and not the individual servers. 
---
They promised me no layering phase 2 for my medium ~9k pop server. They better deliver
---
Layering will definitely not be removed soon. Absolutely no chance
---
That's too hard, let's find a way to punish them instead that doesn't involve effort and teamwork.

stonetalon/desolace/thousand needles is an option too.

Make stuff with tailoring and just disenchant your greens that don't vendor for a lot. The only money I've spent on enchanting at lvl 45 is the vendor stuff, and I have a 12 and a 14 slot bag filled with enchanting mats simply from disenchanting.
---
I've read the opposite, so one of us got bad info.

Ok i understand sorry. I thought you mean they quit because it‚Äôs too hard thank you

sell, get some money toward mount
---
I have to poop brb
---
Yep. I get it on not using it. However there is a VERY good chance I'd miss some or most of the hidden quests, and I'd definitely get frustrated on quests where it's not clear where to go. Most quests are pretty reasonable on their text, even if it requires digging into a longer book to figure things out. But then for instance recently I've been in and around Stranglethorn Vale and some quests are literally "fuck you go find the monsters lol". I find the game still plenty rewards exploration even IF you're using a quest add-on.
---
According to a link someone else posted it sounds like it was me. I guess you could do it back in vanilla but that might have been an earlier patch. Oh well. Time to have the ally toon I rolled cluck like all hell to get me that chicken

How does dismounting work in wpvp? A buddy and I were out enjoying some pvp and the times we knocked players off their mounts felt completely random.  Is there some factor involved?
---
Lol
---
Ooh I know this.  It's called "powergaming."
---
Well that‚Äôs all they have to do right now because there are no bags/arenas. Once those are released you won‚Äôt get camped as much
---
&gt;1.12 naked mage does more dmg, than 1.1 fully epic mage in BWL gear.   
---
Gonna need to see a source on that.
---
I'm only level 19, but then again I've been having too much sex.
---
I play for the moment. Idc a lot about lvling (after I power leveld my first 60). Getting ganked by a lot enemies? Form a group and fight them for hours. I just enjoy the PvP aspect even if that means more downtime.
---
Engineer is good for pvp. An Endgame raid will sometimes require a lot of pots for certain buffs and what not needed to facilitate progression.
---
Why roll on a RP server if you are not interested in RP in the first place?
---
Severe ques when they turn off layers.... 
---
Cause: layers being turned off
---
Effect: longer queues
---
I say big dumb lovaeble bear tank LFG xyz and it works everytime.
---
Leveling on a balanced server may help, but I haven't been on one so unbalanced. I enjoy the thrill of anywhere there could be a fight to the death with someone that isn't computer controlled. There's a whole new level of world interactions on a pvp server that leads to more satisfying adventures and shenanigans.
---
Dear Warlocks. Please bring food/water to dungeons and use it. I'm not buying double/spending double time drinking just so you don't have to. Regards, your healer.
---
I‚Äôm glad people are coming around to this a bit more. A stagnant game WILL die. Period. Your choices are not to either play this game forever, or play some changing/updated version of it (classic+, expansions, whatever). No, your choices are to play this game as a ghost town, or play an updated version of it. Even the classic purists don‚Äôt like playing a game with no one in it. And at that point who knows if blizzard would even keep it online anyway.
---
Even if you use it for the next 20 levels, you'll eventually replace it.  Your mount will likely be with you for a very, very long time. 
---
Sell it.
---
Don't forget to use berserker rage before you start a pull. The extra rage generation helps alot
---
Bit of both I'd say. Haven't leveled in a PvP server for a while .... Like 10 years kind of while lol. Took me some time to get back into the groove of things; it's pretty much gank or be ganked during prime hours. There is definitely times I've been livid beyond belief by getting rogue ganked over and over and over and over in STV, but you always get some poor sap leveling and not paying attention back for it lol.
---
I just tell them I have a map anything else I need to know let me know lol
---
Thanks for the info. Does this mean Ill basically level Ret and then respec to Holy later on?
---
Arrrrr, come for the questin', stay for the chattin'
---
OK BYE
---
I thought that quest was disgusting, however, as a first time classic player, it just prepared me for many quests to come lol.
---
I just flag myself, and jump around and emote at them. Then when they go to harvest a node, I stand on it. They accidentally click me, and I wreck their ass.
---
Can you enlighten a noob? What is he doing wrong?
---
35:65 is pretty rough tbh and idk if I'd enjoy that either.
---
I'm on literally 50:50 server and it's pretty good. Even battles unless some high level comes.
---
But to be fair I don't even play weekends or nights because no matter the server right now peak times just has too many people of both factions competing for such little resources.
---
I don't think its good etiquette irl either but it can happen. For me, rping/playing and having random stuff like that happen gets me excited. Like someone below said you could have it say "tries to" instead of just does. Hell maybe even roll on it rofl.
---
Me, the tank: "Mana up, boys."  
---
Rogue: \*goes for the 2647th risky pickpocket\*  
---
Hunter: \[ANXIOUS URGE TO PULL VISIBLY INTENSIFIES\]
---
Priest @ 1/4 mana: "just pull we'll be ok"  
---
Same priest but dead: "fkin tank pull when I'm low on mana awful group smh my head"
---
Raptors without heads.....
---
Issue is that you get to loot every other mob, so the effective drop rate is halved
---
I mean, if you dont want to play, dont play.
---
You shouldn't force yourself to do it
---
&gt;Me the entire video: "what none of this seems stupid."
---
What? Dude was playing like absolute garbage the whole fight rofl.
---
He engages  while low on mana on a shaman that has clearly seen him and waved, so no surprise element, cant cast much, wrong pet.
---
He follows OP in the water thus losing his range advantage.
---
Stands in melee doing NOTHING while op is hitting him and circling around etc.
---
1st undead just got to silverpine today. I love the feel of the zone.
---
That being said, I‚Äôve never run for my life so many times in 10 minutes in all of my wow experience.
---
Love him! :D
---
Have had no probs getting into groups as a hunter
---
There were tons of hot fixes never included in patch notes tbf, including the infamous cthun nerf.
---
Stratholme, Scolo and UBRS
---
He just dropped my valor helm, how could I roll a 6?
---
I'll report you for accepting my trade of 100g 
---
lol
---
I try but sometimes warriors like to feel useful and stand next to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Except 1.12 did nothing to old raid content.  Why would you bullshit like that without even reading the p.notes..
---
PvE is valid. PvP has the Higest Highs in wow. which is great! But also the Lowest Lows. I have a mighty need to focus on downing Raid content so i dont want to have to worry about that Rollercoaster mode.
---
enchanting is very expensive to level. and not really something you can make gold or stay even during that. its basically a big investment. buy quality items of ah and disenchant them, make them yourself with crafting professions, buy reagents from ah. in any case it will cost you something to level enchanting. your hopes are that once you get hands on some rare recipe that has demand (for example raiding enchants) you will be able to make gold selling your work.
---
We do not speak of it
---
So you state in your first post that being banned from the channel makes it hard to find groups, yet you don't want to use lfg because people are spamming groups looking for members?
---
Lol? Did you just want a world chat channel that you could shit talk in?
---
Because 95% of warriors are playing it for arms pvp or fury raiding and are terrified of tanking.
---
The ram is not faster the skill makes you faster. The rams speed is off your riding skill
---
I have to buy ammo.  DPS litterally costs money for hunters doing ranged, but do you see hunters asking for tips in exchange for DPS? No. Why? Because its what is expected of us. CHarging for water, when its how you help your group? Do you like to see wipes and failure? Its part of your damn class. DO YOUR JOB.
---
Wait till you get the murlocks without heads.
---
Why did you fear?! 
---
Me:  ever heard of curse of reck?
---
*I am the fear*
---
That's fair. It certainly does feel more...dangerous in a way that PVE never does.
---
I can't upvote this enough!
---
One of the funniest things I've seen along these lines is a person winning a Need roll on a 1. Everyone else went Greed.
---
dont grab divine spirit thats only for pvp
---
I'm not surprised you can't form complete sentences. That's that prime Oklahoma education.
---
Yes everybody knows you can do non pvp servers. I just like honorable pvp more than purposely being a dick because it gives you a power trip
---
Its also a way to make half the party realize they are wasting their time.
---
I played on a RP server all of legion because they would buy random leveling greens and blues that looked cool for crazy amounts of gold. Like I made close to 5 mil on random items.
---
Tbags is probably my favorite. Replaces your bags into one giant, auto-sorted bag. If you don‚Äôt like how it sorts you can manually assign classes to items and positions to classes. It also doesn‚Äôt actually sort your bags(as in move them from bag1 to bag2) so I never have any technical issues with it
---
The wake up call for me was the lobster traps in Desolace. I remember farming these back in the day and while you usually had a little competition, it's nothing compared to how it is now. Day or night, even super early, like 430am there is ALWAYS a pack of people there.
---
Where did you find this data
---
Isint this account sharing?
---
Yeah, in my mind, the parts you needed were damaged in the fight.
---
i played an RPPVP server (Maelstrom) back in original vanilla,  and i still do RPish stuff on my PVP server now.  But ultimately being in Oceanic where we don't have RP/RPPVP servers i succumbed to the amazing pings times and had to move off.  if Blizz opened an RP realm on Oceanic i would move in a heartbeat.
---
I like this idea a lot. Doesn‚Äôt detract much from the social aspect of looking for a group, and can make it  easier as well
---
- RP sparingly;
---
- Observing RP;
---
- Friends who RP;
---
- Friendly communities;
---
- Faction balance.

you cant  focus target stuff in classic :(

had to make a weak aura  to see healer mana  , since i am used to have the healer in focus frame  next to mine
---
Error at layer 8
---
That's what I'm saying
---
Bandits in Warcraft 3 (including the 'Rogue' variant) used javelins and small round shields.
---
WoW's bucklers are actually nowhere near the right size or design, they're at least as large as targes. I know Warcraft isn't the most faithful representation of medieval gear, but I think the devs saw the models they had and went "Yeah, no-one's using THAT for a rapier duel."
---
Being on such an imbalanced server would definitely  make it harder to enjoy but I have been there. For me, part of the core gameplay has always been The Alliance vs The Horde. It can get rough at times but were at war and I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
I just spam scarlet monastery, they kill us sometimes out front by still way faster than questing. I quested till like 38 but the horde made it hard to catch up to my friends, and it‚Äôs pvp server so not like they‚Äôll stop. Not all of them are cunts either, usually it‚Äôs the level 60 horde that kill me, not ones close to my level, still slows questing down so dungeons it is.
---
Idiots hand out silk bags. Wool bags are cheap so I give those away but 30-40s a bag is too much to give away for free.
---
Darnassus lacks any alcoholic beverages.
---
Yeah sometimes there's a silence or a knockdown and a flash heal is too slow.
---
Idk man.  I wholeheartedly agree with you.  But I just have accepted that things like this are important to people. And I find like minded people to play with who don't read much into these things.  I kinda get it in BFA where some of the content is actually difficult (specially high M+ keys), but Classic is a joke.
---
So I got about half way through heart of darkness and it just wasnt going anywhere fast. Is it worth sticking it out?
---
*sees target of target* I‚Äôm in danger
---
Dudes just mad he lvls slower.
---
It‚Äôs funny that you bring up addons because blizzard has restricted addon capabilities over the years. The addons of WoW‚Äôs early life were far more capable of ‚Äúplaying the game for you‚Äù than they are now. In fact, most of the restrictions are still present in classic because classic addons were too capable of trivializing the game. At least pretend you know what you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
Vanilla was never hard. Addons were capable of far more then than now. There are a lot of things that make it a great game. Challenge isn‚Äôt one of them. 
---
If you walk into anything with 0 preparation it can be difficult for you. That doesn‚Äôt make the content inherently difficult. It makes you unprepared.
---
Back during the beta, when people realised that dungeon levelling was potentially better xp per hour than questing, people began theorycrafting the most efficient way to do it. The first groups were melee focused for minimal downtime between fights, as energy and rage users don't need to drink. Since there were typically several warriors per group, and the strategy involved AOEing everything down with cleave (and various cleave-like effects like sweeping strikes, blade flurry, and swipe), they became known as cleave comps.
---
I think the optimal comp was something like 2-3 warriors, a rogue, a druid tank if only 2 warriors, and a shaman for heals and windfuy and melee damage when not healing.
---
Then Venruki + co discovered that 3 mages could pretty much solo SM Armory with improved blizzard. It was basically the same thing the cleave groups were doing (running dungeons quickly and repetitively, killing the mobs with aoe), but used spells instead. Someone coined the term spell cleave.
---
Spell cleave was even better than melee in terms of xp efficiency. A Warlock could pull half the instance at once with Eye of Kilrogg, 3 mages cycling novas and maintaining blizzard kept the mobs in the death zone and unable to do damage. There were numerous variations (rogue for pulling instead of lock, hunter/lock instead of the 3rd mage, healer, tank), etc. (As the typical 4 or 5 clothie group resulted in a lot of wasted drops).
---
It‚Äôs probably the droves of alliance that were outnumbered and ganked on their old servers coming back and doing the same thing to others on Heartseeker
---
Stonetalon and STV are primarily horde zones, so no surprise there really
---
Full try hard mode *is* fun
---
Could be depends on proc rate.
---
The disappointment when you realize it's not a real community :/
---
I think this comment thread was missing an important piece of the puzzle.  All of the people that are 60 now really plowed through the content.
---
I played with a ton of people in vanilla who were just going through the motions.  40 man raids invariably had 10 people with thumbs up their asses.   Had to keep my healing / dps parses to myself for fear of outing the scrubs that everyone loved or was the wife of an important guild member or their dog has cancer give them a break.
---
It will be a nameplate add on. 
---
Could be kuinameplates.
---
Just do a search for classic wow nameplates.
---
You will find what it was. üòä
---
Use it. You won't have to worry about a chest piece for a while. And why bother holding onto something for a year when it can speed you up leveling and help get you the mount gold
---
&gt;RP sparingly
---
Then you are interested in RP
---
&gt;Observing RP;
---
Interested in RP
---
&gt;Friends who RP;
---
You are most likely to RP then, if you play with friends interested in RP, I think.
---
&gt;Friendly communities;
---
Well yes, but it is not really friendly to a community to not even bother with the one rule enforced on RP servers: the naming policy.
---
&gt;Faction balance.
---
I don't know what faction balance has to do with RP but I suppose.
---
I wouldn't say "terrible" just sometimes annoying and hard to deal with, hearing someone cough up a lung every 2 seconds into their mic and say "MAAAAN I AM SO HIGH RIGHT NOW" over and over again is really annoying
---
Or having them pull extra shit or die to stupid stuff because they're barely paying attention, just from my own personal experience playing with stoners has NOT been a good one lol
---
They won‚Äôt post one. I‚Äôve seen this garbage regurgitated 4 separate times in different threads with 0 facts to back it up. Myths get spread around this sub like wildfire.
---
for sure
---
This is because quests were a relatively late addition to the game. When WoW was being developed, MMOs were very much a "make your own adventure" type thing that entirely revolved around grinding up your skills - your level was only *one* of the things you would be grinding. Quests weren't anything new of course, but they weren't the driving force of MMO's. You would pick your own goal, say cooking, and go grind out a heap of mobs to get the stuff you needed to cook what you wanted. Or you'd grab all the resources in an area while killing whatever was there as you waited for them to respawn. Or just kill shit to grind up your level and make money, whatever.
---
They added in quests and they were so popular that they very quickly worked on adding a ton more.. which is why so many of them boil down to "go kill shit already in the world until you get 10 macguffins. This is also why class quests are super meh depending on what classes the developers liked more (yes, this isn't your imagination.. the devs liked some classes more than others so those got more attention class wise) and why the higher you progress in the game the fewer quests there seem to be and why the quality might seem to drop.
---
I mean take druids... cool class quests for your bear and aquatic forms, but you hit 20 and your cat form just gets learned from the trainer. Rogues have a fun dagger quest at 10 and the very cool poisons quest at 20, but other than a "go find this secret society that will literally never have any use in the game also don't die in the cave" and a "pickpocket some oozes kthx" quest there's nothing else for them.
---
Basically it's because vanilla WoW revolutionised MMOs in many ways, including the role questing took. So what you have is a very basic, thrown together bunch of quests that paved the way for what MMOs eventually became.... but it does mean there's a few flaws in there as well.
---
[And then?](https://youtu.be/oqwzuiSy9y0?t=30)
---
yeah no
---
I‚Äôm sure it sounds like that but I‚Äôm just grinding until I hit 60 and can start running instances with friends and start doing bg‚Äôs when they start them up. I love battleground and that is the kind of pvp I like. Getting ganked when I have no mana and half health requires no skill and is just obnoxious. And that‚Äôs usually what passes for pvp in the open world. Just a bunch of coward shit. That ain‚Äôt my jam.
---
That's what I was thinking. 
---
However, after using it for a bit, I can see how it might not be that great. It has no stats, and it doesn't seem to proc off Shadow Word: Pain ticks or Mind Flay ticks after the first application of damage of either. 
---
When I got it, I thought it could proc off every tick of SW:P and Mind Flay. If it did, I could easily see how it would be BiS.
---
That‚Äôs why their brains are so damaged.
---
I tested it once with my brother and I couldn‚Äôt see his message in general, so I can say maybe.
---
A legal precedent that makes it okay for alliance to receive a lesser product while paying the same price is unheard of though.
---
Not sure on the weapon training, but booty bay is reached by taking the boat out of Ratchet.
---
lowest roll wins right?
---
To be fair to the mages, AOE on 2 mobs does slightly more dps than burning them down after another, (at least before you have tons of spell power).
---
Lmao what the fuck is this post
---
You can have fun doing anything with your friends. But the gameplay system of WoW is as fun as tic tac toe
---
Worth *more*.
---
Classic isnt just 'about your spec'. You have access to your class (as opposed to your spec like on retail). You will use just about every skill on a warrior. While leveling though, you will be very choosy to conserve hold. As to what you can skip, Google knows more than me. My alt warrior is 11 lol
---
When u get to /laugh as you kill the alliance scum who tried to gank you. I was just passing on through dude. Didnt want no trouble... Now look at you... Your dead. (Even better when your killing mobs) R.I.P hillsbrad farm, i will not miss you.
---
How do uou show peoples lvls in chat?
---
Might be fun for some, for me it isnt :)
---
I have had no issues with devilsaur as combat anyway...
---
Wear it.
---
Why do you think that everyone who likes to play somewhat competitive is a bad person?
---
People like to be the best they can be. Settling for mediocrity is not a good thing.
---
There's parts where you can still ledge jump out of the canals, but most of the ledge is too high now that they fixed that bug.
---
I never plowed through, I quested fairly slowly and didn't even grind that much, just played every day since launch and hit 60 a lil' while ago
---
People didn't freely share information on how to kill things.
---
well you are clearly personifying that last line in the comment you replied to
---
No just leave it at rank 1. Further ranks only add a little extra damage not that great
---
That's the type of skill it is and it generally gets more powerful or has the potential too by going into that spec. So if you spec into fury you can get improved cleave for some extra damage for example.
---
I talk to my little bear Bubu all the time :D
---
I think it‚Äôs the perpetual ‚Äòalmost there‚Äô feeling.  It‚Äôs like questing blue balls.
---
The biggest problem is that it costs them the resource they never have enough of (rage) in return for the resource they currently have an abundance of (hp). In fact it costs even more because that damage blocked will count as threat towards you as the healer and now your tank needs to spend even more rage he doesn't have on capturing that threat back.
---
---------
---
Pre-casting shield on your tank *feels* better because you don't see them instantly drop from 100% to 90%.
---
For a squishy caster, a drop from 100% to 90% HP elicits a feeling of "something went wrong!".
---
For a warrior, a drop from 100% to 90% HP elicits a feeling of "FINALLY, I can cast something!".
---
oof
---
Did you read the post?
---
In Classic you really need all those extra kills though, or else you'll be underleveled for the next zone by the time you finish all the quests.
---
A streamer who can have someone clip it...
---
Doesn't proc off Mind Flay or SW:P ticks. Thinking it's not that great.
---
Wait. What happened?
---
Those people are the most stubborn in the game I have found.
---
+1 for ElvUi. It's the first addon I install because it does so many things for your UI. After my ElvUI is setup, then I start looking for other add-ons, like Questie and such.

Half of my quests have me cutting off the head of some named npc or raptors. End up walking around with an invisible backpack full of rotting heads to deliver back to a quest giver.

Yes, it's like saying emerald nightmare was easy in patch 8.0.

Yes it was, especially compared to 7.0

I feel like it‚Äôs a good way to encourage teamwork &amp; help the shy players find friends/guilds.  Ease into the multiplayer &amp; whatnot.
---
Just chill like a cool bus driver. The passengers will sort it Out.
---
Yes.  All future content will be breezed through just like MC and Ony.  Until WotlK, all of the difficulty in raiding was in knowing *what* to do more than *how well* you did it.  
---
We know what to do, so there's no real difficulty to conquer.  Assuming people farm gear normally, then people will go into each tier fully capable of clearing it all in one shot.   Yeah, if you impose some restrictions you can make it more challenging, but even then you're only screwing with the math to create barriers that weren't mean to exist.  
---
As an aside, I think it's rather strange how people are shocked or defensive about the lack of challenge.  All that "the itemization is from 1.12" nonsense is a really needless rationalization for a point no one should be defending.
---
Haven't been to vietnam yet, unfortunately.
---
You don‚Äôt see the problem of taking the binding when it wasn‚Äôt reserved?
---
because mobs in dungeons below 50 do fuckall damage and you do way more dps with a 2h than a sword and shield so there's really no reason to bother.
---
dungeons are a joke, nice "hardcore" game lmao
---
It takes years to get a tank

Oh certainly.

yeah, people im talking about are sitting around org at level 25 admiring their new shoulders and thinking about starting their fourth alt because they aren‚Äôt doing all the professions yet.

Apparently bleauxmeux has a really even pvp population.  Def has a horde advantage but probably not as bad as others

i know, every time someone mentions something bad it means that person is triggered, peasants are peasants, most of wow players are dead end job peasants or students, i would never consider wow to be a hard work (not to mention i am 60 already), its just time sink

---
Upgrade your potato. It's not hard.
---
The LFG addon didn't even die lol. I've been using it to get groups every day since launch. Hell I even made two legit friends through it. 
---
All Blizz did was meet with the creator so that they knew what aspects of that addon could stay and what had to go. 
---
What I find hilarious is that Blizz has given this addon their approval but on this sub it's reviled. People here are so childish, you can't even discuss it without downvotes.
---
Bad example because osrs you can simply hop to one of 150+ worlds to avoid those people, also in osrs everyone is on the same ‚Äúfaction‚Äù. it‚Äôs straight up against WoW tos to collide cross faction.
---
I've had heaps of trouble deciding on class. I keep coming back to thinking about Druid but hear so many people shit on it.
---
My main goal in game is world fun/pvp and bgs when they come out. Can anyone give me some insight into that. I think I enjoy Bear, Feral and Resto the most.
---
I mean it was 5 manned back then, well in bwl gear tho, but still. Seeing a 24 man pug her isn't surprising
---
When youre on pace leveling with the pack on whitemane youre litterally fucked. Everymo  everywhere is spawn camped and dead on respawn. Its actually attrocious.
---
I think we just have all the high level druids on the server lol. We have a bunch of mages in the 50s though. All our druids are 60. So eventually itll be a lot more mages
---
You could've made a LOT of gold. Dumb af
---
That's why I gave up on earthbind kiting
---
He said elsewhere that he installed it with the twitch client
---
So many shenanigans as a rogue.  Part of what made the game great is each class had it's own flavor of community among the classes.  From the unkillable 5 man pally squad, the furry druid parties, that all mage lvling dungeon group.
---
Well, my post was talking about a paladin. I know not to shield warriors unless the situation is dire.
---
Which I definitely appreciated on my Bear but I doubt most other classes got much from it.
---
Sound tells me when it has procced
---
This. People get shitty at me when I refuse their group invitation... the quest gives say 2000xp and each mob is giving 250xp... grouping kills your xp. Only exception is somewhere packed or rare/named quest mob.
---
Playable race my ass.
---
I have a very good PC desktop that I play on but when I am watching the kids or watching tv I use the potato laptop which runs it enough to get what I want done. You don‚Äôt need a top of the line laptop to run this game.
---
I bet there is. Maybe search on your server in trade chat :)
---
You get a grouping bonus to xp rate but your efficiency goes down in a group.
---
I get this is a Rogue with lock boxes sometimes. Happy to help if they ask but if you just assume and request trade I‚Äôll be on my merry way right past you
---
that's the entire game. progress slows. that's how it works. diminishing returns. 
---
you think it's gonna accelerate at 60 or something? your rate of progress after 60 is even slower. you're gated by weekly raid resets and rng of raid boss drops. you could go 4 resets without increasing your dps by a single digit, just waiting for the next tier to release and praying to rngesus for your BiS to drop ever.
---
level 30 isn't a hump. the slope is parabolic. it takes longer and longer to increase less and less until a patch hits.
---
Then its ass. Thats all you cast lol.
---
They can't fit inside.
---
who cares about the mechanics. there‚Äôs nothing special about memorizing a dozen phases either. giving a boss an obscene amount of health and damage output is just as ‚Äúhard‚Äù. 
---
the only true difficulty would be dynamic mechanics that can‚Äôt be looked up. but that would turn WoW into a twitch shooter.
---
What do you mean?  Like needing twice as many item drops?
---
It‚Äôs just that the luxury edition has so much more eagle.
---
ours is 69. we are very mature.
---
how do you play this?
---
How's that rock you've been living under?
---
Zandar-Tribe-EU ( I read it in another comment)
---
Its the best server btw ;)
---
Holy doesn't get partial resists so it's actually some cutting edge technology that actually looks promising
---
Just because you hit it in the heart doesn't mean it's not there. It's still there. Drop quests are aids.
---
God the amount of 2h tanks Ive seen has been ridiculous. They charge in go berserker stance immediately to WW spam "for aggro" and then complain when they drop in 5 seconds
---
This never happened in vanilla this often did it?
---
PvP is a shit show up until lvl 50 on Patchwerk. There was a Horde Druid in the Searing Gorge ganking me for 3 Hours straight everytime i was drinking xD. It got a lot better from 50-60 tho since ppl just wanted to hit 60.
---
I'll make sure to /wave if we meet ingame :)
---
All the try hards are 60 now wait until us scrubs hit 60.  Things won't go down so easily then.
---
Unrelated but which classes can break out of rogue cc without trinket? Just wondering.
---
Mage has blink for stuns and 2x ice block. I assume bubble breaks you out of cc? Can't think of anything else.
---
Either continue as paladin to heal, and be rewarded with the coolest tier set in the game, or reroll. You'll be happy rerolling if you won't be happy healing.
---
Its Neatplates.
---
Can you message me some good ones so I can learn from them?
---
That's actually just an unfortunate result of being on the 7.3.5 client, not a Classic specific thing. It happens in Retail's 8.2.0 client as well, bug's been around for a while. Fortunately, it's really not that common and only happens at very specific camera angles.
---
You have a higher xp rate per hour soloing mobs than in a group generally. Unless like aoeing or something obviously.
---
The feel when you see only 1 graph per class, not 2-3-4 per class.
---
On my server nothing you can gather or craft sells for better than the vendor price.  There is literally no chance I will have anywhere near enough gold at 40 to get my mount even with skipping lots of spells.
---
And this was rather normal in vanilla so I'm not sure why anyone would pretend that it isnt.  Getting your mount right at 40 was very rare in vanilla.
---
Not fum when it's 5v1.
---
Tons of fun when you get a group together to beat the shit out of them though.
---
You're not behind. You're behind all the no-lifers, but they represent a tiny portion of the community. And if you're enjoying yourself, then you're ahead.
---
I used this as a Druid till about 47
---
Yes it is.
---
Alot wrong, but I wanna add one big unique thing about warlock, which is that they have an answer to every class in pvp duo to their different pets and their God tier pvp anyways. Other classes always have atleast 1 counter or mediocre matchups.
---

Yes... that‚Äôs what he just said.
---
Anyone know of videos similar to this or articles explaining the development process and what things were rushed or unfinished? I see people saying all the alliance stuff was done first and horde was rushed and tons of zones being half done etc. I'd love to find more info on this.
---
How long should each lvl take in early to mid 30s assuming no-few deaths.

Sorry man, just been enjoying the game and having fun.

/r/WoW was ruined by low effort posts, let's not ruin here too
---
Hello and thanks for your response. Yeah I had meant .25 fps (one frame every 4 seconds) but I'm glad to know it was a software problem. I upgraded to Win 10 from Win 7 and it works fine now.
---
Good for you, it's info I took from a developer interview released when vanilla was current, but you're most welcome to think whatever you please.
---
Yeah but frostbolt also looks 1/12 as cool as blizzard
---
And don't even get me started on the satyrs!
---
While that's true, the vast majority of guilds that progressed through and farmed MC did so around and after the BWL patch. By AQ launch most of the guilds that would get into Naxx were established and by then most of the class talent revamps were in place.
---
So when it comes to really early patches and things like MC dropping T2 with bad stats, that's just a weird time of the game that doesn't match most people's experiences.
---
I'm still having 9 great experiences for every 1 bad one - but it's the terrible runs that make the best rants / comics :P
---
I got 15g towards it so far! If I really want to commit to it then I can just AH to get there, money isn't a big worry.
---
I got it to work by upgrading to Win 10. I guess it was drivers I'm just not sure what exactly fixed it.
---
For me, the best moment was watching two raiding main druid healers  duel each other outside of Ironforge with perditions blade (the BIS rogue dagger during the MC era).   Much to the tears of all the other rogues outside dueling.  
---
The fight went on for an hour, and the person who won was the one with an alternate suit of armor after the first one broke.  
---
We just had *that* many of them drop that all of our raiding rogues got one, and the other members were just picking them up for giggles.
---
Except DM price will crash since servers are full of mages eager to farm there
---
Some people are just delusional. Better to give up on them.
---
Staves are in Thunder Bluff I believe.
---
Need some addon advice: 
---
Which is the addon that shows npc and friendly player health in actual numbers? I have a ui addon, but that option doesn't seem to be included. 
---
What's the best addon for healing in raids and dungeons? - Grid just seems to be annoying without actually adding any useful information that I can't already see with my UI. 
---
What's the best threat meter for dungeons as a healer?
---
When normal people see stand users
---
Clearly we can all agree on which is the worst... right?
---
Ladies and gentlemen...we got 'em.
---
You think you do, but you don't. Just because you have no idea about those nerfs and didn't experience them playing back then, doesn't mean someone needs to poke your nose into it and provide you proof and explanation and the exact patch notes when it happened. He's saying the truth, content has been nerfed towards the end of vanilla.
---
Don‚Äôt think that was their goal, don‚Äôt be a chode.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer.  Seems like the root cause of trouble is a crazy long stun time, not shields on scouts.
---
What would have also been cool, have this set and a silver hand one. I would love to have seen that.
---
oh i see, thanks!
---
Nope, it drops. Its a white item that is unique soulbound.
---
I‚Äôm leveling a paladin right now
---
The biggest thing is too use a two handed weapon and run seal of command in the retribution tree to level
---
It does a lot of damage 
---
I hit 33 tonight with 1 day played in time 
---
I‚Äôve just been grinding mobs and been kind of avoiding dungeons and questing
---
dps doesnt mean that much in pvp, and in raids youre gonna want a mix of classes anyway
---
Fighting all the other warriors and paladins, for the pants/shoulders/helm!
---
I've done it 3 times so far in classic. If it's not 100% it's gotta be pretty darn close to it
---
Zygor guides is all you need.
---
People will appreciate 8 slots aswell. Especially low levels  in the Barrens. His goal was to get pats on the back and I'd say he achieved it. Still a dumb move imo
---
Real mob health
---
You‚Äôre a special kind of person.
---
That could be it. But now things like Crimson lotus is down to scrap prices. I found one a few days ago, and saw it around 1G in the AH, so I put mine up a bit lower. It didn't sell. As I've had my eyes on it seeing if it was going to rebound, it has just collapsed down to a few silver.
---
Perhaps people used it to transfer gold, and maybe people like me were trying to lower the price all the way down.
---
People that buy blues for levelling is a very niche market at the moment. New players simply don't have the gold to spend, which means your only real market is people that are rolling alts to level; even then, I have my epic mount and I still wouldn't spend anything over 3g for a piece of gear for my alt. I've also tried selling blues that just won't budge.
---
It's hard to say though, wearing it will get you to level quicker, get you to 60 quicker, which will earn you more gold in the long term. On the other hand, selling it might will get you your mount quicker, which is arguably going to help levelling more than a piece of gear.
---
Personally, I'd check the AH prices and decide if the amount is worthwhile, if so, then see if I could get a sale in trade chat. If no one bites after ~20 minutes, just wear it.
---
Yea man it's shitty to charge people for your time and crafted goods. Good point
---
It's pretty trash.
---
They measure the time difference from when you start a cast (client-side), to when the server acknowledges that you've started the cast.
---
If that time takes, let's say 150ms, then they add 150ms to the latency in the cast so that you'll know when the server thinks the cast will finish.
---
This is measured for every cast.
---
The Darkest Dungeon theme made this so much better LOL. We should raid Red Hook studios next year for details on the sequel &gt;:D
---
I dont get it

If it's worth more than 10g sell if not use
---
First aid and alchemy/herbs made the first 20 levels livable.
---
Holy. Shit. 
---
This is big brain right here, folks. 
---
You're the real mvp my friend.
---
I healed as a resto shaman from BC through MoP. I had purged the memory of the nightmare of setting up Grid from my head. Thanks for bringing that back.
---
All's fair in love an war. Ya got had. Now go get good.
---
I did it in vanilla, then did it again in classic. You're right that not much is worth selling but some stuff *does* sell quite well, take the time to check. Everything else just vendor and otherwise be careful with your cash. Factor it in to your levelling and go grind some mobs with good drops like cloth or whatever, that 100% sells even if not for much. It adds up.  
---
Personally I took some time to get Arena Grand Master in STV while levelling. Good cash in the chest, with some nice BoE blues that stupid people will pay 4-5g for on the AH, much much more in a few months if you want to hold on to them. Plus I have a cool trinket. I also got my cooking and fishing up *and* fed most of my cloth to my mates doing tailoring.
---
I hit 40 with just over the 90g so got my mount. I'm now 49 and have over 200g, I plan to hit 60 with at least 500g and I'll be getting my epic mount within a week of dinging. 
---
Like I said, just keep it in mind and play smart, you won't have to worry about gold.
---
Or you could grow up and not be so insecure that you keep your wife under a padlock and not let her out without you üòÇ

All this claims is that energy doesn't regen every .1 seconds, which is true, but irrelevant.
---
Alliance has had windfury totem for the past 12 years, I think they‚Äôll understand
---
lol 1.12.1 was that patch. before that it was lots harder.  that's why they chose this patch
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just being dense, but could you explain why?  I don‚Äôt understand.
---
Too soon.
---
Just wait till you get to hillsbrad sweety
---
These things happen. Haha
---
That's not how aggro works. Unless you are standing where they reset to, they wouldn't hit you unless you tagged them somehow (shouting, fighting a mob that yells for help at low hp, aoeing them when they ran by).
---
Why not use mindflay in raids? It slow debuff should be in lowest debuff group and get knocked off by pretty much anything so that should not be a problem.
---
warcraftlog's interface is hilariously bad sometimes. You can mouse over people's ilvl and it shows you their gear in a popup, but there is no way to pin that popup so you can't mouse over individual gear pieces or even copy their names. It's almost they intentionally designed it to troll you. And then they don't give you an easy way to look at people's talents either (I'm guessing they're all the same anyway though). (Edit: I guess the talents are supposed to show when you mouse over the spec and that's just not implemented yet. It'd kinda suffer from the same problem as the gear popup though, how do you design that without a way to pin the popup?)
---
I really like the idea as FC tbh as well
---
Fuck that quest 1000x in the face
---
Yes
---
Ah yes the ones that will hinder their bg groups because they actually suck dw what goes around comes around
---
the problem is that i play with irl friends and we are all about to hit 40. getting everybody to commit to the switch is difficult. i work a  40-hour week and dont get to pay much, so its difficult to coordinate with our group as it is.
---
I never played a Mage before, but now I'm curious, can you make a macro to automatically set the moon raid icon over your sleep targets as well in case you have to sleep someone unmarked?
---
Yes, bonebiter is better. 
---
But I couldn't get bonebiter at lvl 30 like I could the WW axe. I had to be lvl 38 or 39 for the quest for bonebiter
---
Yes I got taunted in MC and the warrior dragged my body to the lava. 4th degree burns all over.
---
i kind of like them
---
Yea, so im currently getting 38ms according to WoW. However bar is showing between 1000ms and 40ms on casts.
---
Edit: I guess  im just asking if other people are seeing crazy high numbers or if its just me.
---
Thanks man!
---
welcome to classic
---
Never done this before, probably never will
---
"minutes" is a weird way to spell "hours"
---
Use twitch client
---
Ah fair enough - I got tangled up reading through through all the newbies in here who genuinely weren't aware.
---
As long as you're conscious of the threat thing, you do you.
---
That's what happened, he pulled all the mobs around my one and when I attacked mine the others came and killed me
---
Our raid on SS, Arathi Highlands, and STV tonight is now justified.  Thank you.  For the Alliance!
---
Behold, an alliance PvP player
---
Can you post your source that says they chose 1.12 because before that it ‚Äúwas lots harder‚Äù? I‚Äôll wait patiently. Or are we just talking out of our ass here?
---
The recipe ain't that rare, I've seen people asking 5g fee for.
---
Meanwhile for Lionheart helmet I've seen someone ask 150g fee.
---
Christ you actually wasted your time editing that
---
No one has 250g to blow on that now. You won't have that kind of money before 60,and level 50+ blues are simply better. Hold onto it.
---
Just customized it a bit. Which color is yours?
---
Ah okay, not sure where I got booty bay from lol. I can get to TB from ORG via a zeplin, right?
---
I frequently get jumped by 5 or more horde. You damn right I‚Äôm bubble hearthing.
---
I still really want to roll on RP-PvP, but my non-RP characters are keeping me busy enough right now. I did create a toon (complete with a TRP3 profile and a detailed background story) on retail and haven‚Äôt gotten around to actually playing him (eventually I will), and now it looks like I‚Äôll have to do the same for Classic üòÑ
---
Does TRP3 work in Classic?
---
Alliance Horde companionship makes me sick.
---
Best place for this is probably your realm's forum, since this subreddit has no way of knowing which realm you're referring to.
---
You can find them at the [World of Warcraft Forums](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/) under **All WoW Classic Realms**.
---
As a shaman, all weapon imbues don't stack with WF totem right? So if I'm in a melee cleave group where I'm dropping  WF totem, does that mean I just don't use a weapon imbue at all for the dungeon?
---
...I don't think that's the right way to cut a cake.
---
I‚Äôve never wanted to create a character on a rp realm more than I do right at this very moment
---
Maybe it's just the server then. Isn't Herod one of the ones with a queue still? Multiboxer might not play on servers with a queue still because if they get disconnected on one account and sent to the queue, it halts all progress for them.
---
I think on rare, peak times, my server gets a 5 minutes queue. If one account gets DC'd, no wait time.
---
While warriors are plentiful, tanks are not. About 80% of warriors are wusses who don't want to take a hit.
---
Well you try smuggling phat loot into SW prison. You can‚Äôt just stick it.... well, you just can‚Äôt. Lol
---
go read the inbetweens bro. you only say its myth because you weren't there. also alot of hotfixes then weren't in patch notes like they do for retail today
---
Because joining a party shouldn't mean your loot disappears?
---
UD strath side?
---
yes, but ... i think you can only mark if you're the leader.... someone i'm sure will correct me

It's a trade-off no doubt. I'm pretty sure that preventing players from creating characters on full servers is something they have done in the past though. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
edit: this is from the WoW wiki, not sure if it is being enforced in Classic though.
---
&gt;"Players cannot create a character on a Full realm unless they already have characters on that realm. Full realms are deemed 'full' by Blizzard and as such, their 'full' status does not fluctuate like a 'high' population realm's might. There is no reason to wait until off-peak times to see if you will be allowed to create a character on a 'full' realm."
---
I actually still like retail, but this comment was funny as hell üòÑ
---
Just enchant your own weapon with WF, it's 2x as good as the totem buff.
---
It's such a smooth leveling curve, too:  Brilliant Smallfish &gt; Longjaw Mudsnappers &gt; Bristle Whisker Catfish &gt; Mithril Head Trout &gt; Redgill &gt; Nightfish/Sunfish and you're done.
---
No screwing about with weird recipes or juggling odd spices or other weird ingredients like Spider Ichor.  Just fish.
---
Desolace at lvl 30 as well. Do sm gy/gnomer/RFK. 
---
And you will have to grind occasionally, some people say they can make it without grinding on quests alone.. but I'm not to sure. Dont be scared to do some dungeons in your level range, or green dungeons, a few times. It really helps with the xp. 
---
Oh and, DONT FORGET DUNGEON QUESTS :) GL mate
---
Oh shit, other healers drink while healing? I thought I was unique and fun.
---
You and also type /e instead of /me
---
I thought it was Pretty Ugly Group...
---
keep up the grind, lvl 30 gouge!
---
I‚Äôd create an incentive for people to play the underdog faction.  
---
For instance if the imbalance is 70-30, then the underdog faction should get a 40% XP buff.  The buff deteriorates at the difference of the imbalance.  For instance when more people play Alliance the ratio may change all the way to 49-51.  In that case the underdog faction only receives a 1% XP bonus.  This would encourage faction equality.
---
I would like to know this too &gt;.&lt;

Wee have 1.12.1 talents and have a base of like 50% extra damage regardless of skill level and these raids are POST NERF with increased debuff sluts and improved itemization 
---
Im so tired of retards talking about easily googlable facts they are oblivious to
---
You can do that now!
---
You receive reduced kill xp while in group. Dont know the exact math, but obviously its less than when solo. The more group members, the bigger the reduction.
---
The mage quest offhand is pretty good as well.
---
Lizard people
---
Bags?
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Weeelll mana potions and demonic runes can solve the mana problem for the most part. Does mean more pre-raid work however.
---
Druid is a top tier class for wpvp and BGs as long as you like being the dedicated flag runner. In AB, they are a bit more boring (mostly you will defend in stealth) but effective. In AV, best bet is to follow the zerg around healing anything and everything.
---
Druids suck at ganking quickly, but you have the potential to win almost any 1v1 if you are good.
---
I did Tyrion's quests in Stormwind just the other day!
---
I don't know what you don't understand about aggro not working that way, but good luck. I look forward to seeing what else makes you mad tomorrow.
---
They said they are removing the way that it works, like the way it utilizes /who I believe. Blizzard is VERY against LFG addons. Theres been posts on this sub about it, Im at work so cant copy and paste sorry :/
---
Username checks out.
---
Amazing, thanks! I'm gonna try this out today.
---
I'm a very passive Horde warrior on incedius (pvp).  Honestly I've never been engaged in a fair fight. They either out level me, gank me when I'm questing or 2+. If their the Same level or lower than me tend they tend not to engage. I imagine alliance experience the same.
---
Good one buddy. Haven't heard that one before.

‚ÄúNobody says a word‚Äù???

Didn‚Äôt know that happened in classic :P

I killed 15 young crocolisks before one stopped its skin. Had to kill over 30 to get all 4 skins. What kind of crocolisk doesn't have skin?

Yeah man go with what fits your play style. its all going to get replaced pretty quickly just trying to help ppl that think WW is the only way.

Fuuuuuuuuuck that quest

My druid is Boozebear haha people usually get a kick out of it

I love your UI!
---
Yup. Start swimming, it'll save you time gettin around SW if you get familiar with areas you can do it.
---
Are you sure they even add/remove layers actively? If that was the case you'd figure they would remove most layers at night. As it is you can be almost alone in some zones during the night.

Yeah and he started the fights.!

What server are you on? That sounds awful

Errr no. That's my fiance lol. Kitty is watching her dad play WoW

Being forced to live inside instances 30+ to make any meaningful gains , and even then having to make corpse runs to get into the instances since they're mostly in horde territory

It's fucking insane to me that you are being downvoted for this, especially when, AFAIK, it being exploitable only exists because of #nochanges.

IIRC they have fixes they are intentionally not implementing, and instead banning people, because #nochanges.

THAT WAS YOU.

YOU were the reason general fuck-face in front of stormwind wasn't on his horse! I had to turn in a quest to him and apparently the "him" kneeling isn't associated with the messenger questline so me and 2 others just had to sit there and wait for him to respawn.

i was just coming here to say this.  BB has a lot of hardcore RP'ers, but, if you don't want to RP, you don't have to.  a little bit of RP can make things fun sometimes though

There was the blood plague that ran so rampant they had to shut down servers to be able to fix it. Good times.

Which is the reason why an absolute minority of players have seen any raid content beside some Molten Core and Onyxia.

Im leveling with the plan of going 20/31 and it's goin well, i don't play to hardcore and am 40 atm. Plus this will allow me to tank dungeons and heal raids
---
Weapons are just stat sticks. No reason to whack something for 10 damage every 3 seconds when you can fireball it for 50 damage instead.
---
He‚Äôs doing it wrong, you need to wait until you‚Äôre on less then 5% health then you bubble and heart... you need steal that satisfaction of getting a kill from them but you also need to tease them with almost thinking they are going to get it. Mind games.
---

Gz, but that UI is an absolute abomination.
---
While questing and running between places you should still continue to kill everything you see in your path, as the game is a grind the quests just give you direction.
---
The cleave meta has really fucked the community.  Everybody believes themselves to be a cleave God now. Its encourages bad players to play badly.
---
I call that "the paradox of convenience."     
---
Little things like summoning stones or not having to feed hunter pets or being able to queue up for BGs from anywhere feel convienent and great individually.  But before long, you add them all together, and you are doing nothing but sitting in Dalaran waiting for instances to pop wondering what happened to the "world" of world of warcraft.    
---
      
---
The paradox being that many of those changes to make things more convenient are good individually, yet collectively ruin the game.
---
Oh drop the crap already.  I played vanilla pre nerfs and class buffs and the classic dungeons were NEVER particularly hard. 
---
Half these people who swear that classic dungeons were originally challenging don't seem to accept the fact players have evolved.  
---
These same people often shit on retail for being easy, but unless they have done cutting edge m+ keys in legion or BfA, they don't have a clue what a hard dungeon really is.
---
Is the card saying it‚Äôs a bad thing? I haven‚Äôt had anyone get upset when I ask for quests. Everyone does them at some point so getting mad at people for asking for quests is pretty selfish.

No he's a boy. Obviously it was me to birth her.

Nah we needed one more gem (nobody had the key on them) seemed easier to smash out a boss that‚Äôs all
---
In my experience this is incorrect. I work for a large federal subcontractor and a few department heads in it do not consider internship experience in weighing candidate's resumes. My IT department turned down a fresh RIT cyber security grad (didn't even phone screen him, just flat out put him in the no pile) because all he had was internship stuff, nothing paid.
---
Unpaid internships are bullshit.
---
You at the end: hahahabaaaaaa

You can just turn on resource bars on raid frames, but obviously that's not as in-your-face as a focus target.

He rezzed, ran up and then bubble Hearthed in front of me. Lol

I personally love the druid. It may not be the 'best', but it's certainly quite good. And you have a tool for damn near everything. Wanna hide? Stealth. Need a tank. Bear. Heals? done. And the class fantasy for it is great. Go for it! /moo
---
I think best part of that convo is that they're obviously aware of the exploit but don't bother to notice who the reports are for
---
Thanks man! I‚Äôll definitely put it up there!
---
git gud or go pve or retail
---
Yeah I know about the buff I get, but I meant like a list of weapons I should be using at x level, if there is such a list.
---
Yes, get Spiritual focus and consecration. Then go down the prot tree. Redoubt is key. Precision yes. Get improved RF so you can tank dungeons. Then go deep Prot for BoSanc and Holy shield. After that use the rest of the points either in Ret for Benediction and Imp Parry, or add more to Holy so you can also be a better healer.
---
Context: 
---
* Undead priest is atop the arena in Gadgetzan, spamming DoT's indiscriminately on people, stopping me from turning in quests
---
* I submit report
---
* A while later I'm sitting afk in stealth on top of the tall iron boxes aside the Arena. I have not attacked anyone, I did not retaliate at any point. I am sitting *afk in stealth*, then the GM messages me.
---
I'm guessing he just swooped in and gave a blanket warning to literally everyone in the area, but it's kind of obnoxious to just cut off the conversation and take no measure to investigate.
---
It's like he wasn't even listening to you, could have just sent you an email if that was the plan
---
Yup, if you kill them they can just walk back and continue what they were doing. If they have to bubble hearth, not only have they wasted two long cd‚Äôs but they probably have to run back from somewhere more distant (like a city).

He looks undergeared for 60 so probably a fresh ding with basic quest and instance gear.

Isn't Vampire Clan one of the self-professed "anti-streamer sniper" guilds on the server?

Not surprised.

The "anti-streamer" guilds on that server have been really struggling to make an impact and have been largely ignored by everyone.

Make sure you have lots of stam and mana and an up to date shield.  It's really not bad if you can find good places to do it.  Though it really doesn't work till you get consecration and have a few points in redoubt.
---
Actually you are right. In the first or second war, how were not seen at the frontlines (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gnome#The_First.2C_Second_and_Third_War)
---
Are Druids able to tank top level stuff?  I know warriors are king, but can druids do it very effectively as well?
---
How do you deal with ranged interrupts in dungeons? There's no obvious way to avoid them (such as not standing next to shield mobs) and no way of knowing when its going to come, and having no healing for 15 seconds is pretty much a guaranteed dead tank.
---
Wrong universe
---
Skeram is not 70:30. One of, if not the best Ally guild, followed by another close top ranking Ally guild are on this server and they‚Äôre massive. The unofficial count is around close to 55:45. Nobody really knows tho. All speculation.

And yes, real Invictus. üôÉ

Boi if you ever paid attention to pvp you'd know it's been a thing in arenas ever since arenas were a thing.

I barely pvp actively but I have noticed the xyz cleave naming convention for various class comps.
---
Jungle cleave was a thing in retail during my little foray into pvp last year.
---
If you are idle in the world you sit down automatically. Not sitting down might've given the druid a hint that he was getting baited.
---
I agree with some (not all) of your points, but honesty your post was pretty rambling and your arguments were not easy to follow.
---
If i start a group with a healer and type "LF3M X DUNGEON ANY ROLE" and get a warrior I just automatically assign them as a tank mentally and move on to "LF2M DPS X DUNGEON." I'm only in my 30s and I assume the tanking role gets much tougher later on, but for everything that I've done so far, any warrior/druid can tank regardless of spec/gear.
---
Mists of pandaria called.  They told me to tell you classic is a bit too soon for you.
---
But why? It looks like your itching for your ‚Äúfix‚Äù lol
---
I did Shimmering Flats @ 31, was good for a couple of levels then start Arathi / STV (if you can stand the competition for mobs). SM GY always an option too. Grinding for a bit in STM (Charred Vale) can also be good at that level.
---
I've been having more fun grinding duengons than grinding quest imo but that's just me. Maybe it's bc the quest area I'm at rn is nonstop horde ganks (STV)
---
Never mind. I went afk and didn't feed him and he's run away. Fuck's sake.
---
I haven't seen a cleaner default UI as ESO. But GW2 is really nice.
---
What's bumming you about druid tanking?
---
Use logic here. Too many people in zones means crashes and lag. They wont want that this they will most likely decrease the realm capacity, thus increasing queues. Tbh they should come out and say that and it will get more people to spread out on other servers.
---
I would assume this would still lead to them kicking me. I am a complete beginner. I have no idea how threat mechanics work or what to do in a dungeon other than spam my abilities
---
So how does a duo maximize XP?  Just kill separate mobs while questing?
---
I did the Ashenvale version of that with pages of a shredder manual.  It was pretty awful, even without being ganked every few minutes.
---
&gt;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm ... we are not going to raise that cap any further, ... Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, 
---
This part is saying they're making a decision to not have severe queues in phase 2. We will have queues but not much worse.
---
I don't know why people equip and use BoE gear while leveling... it's only a few stat point differences, and you'll replace eventually.  But I'm glad there are so many people who don't think about this, and buy my BoE I sell on the AH...
---
The exception is of course weapons, which make huge differences for melee classes.
---
I'm mostly talking about the connections you get from the internship not the actual internship in itself.
---
This has has little to nothing to do with it. The debuff limit was also higher in 1.12 back then, and people still struggled with bosses due to the things mentioned above.

If he wasn't streaming, it could have been [ShadowPlay](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/).

I assume you mean floating healing text above targets heads in which case correct me if I'm wrong but that's a TBC or wrath feature.
---
If you want healing meters there's recount, details and skada.

I used to do that in Gears of War.

Basically you'd pretend to be afk at spawn; they enemy would kill the rest of your team and run up to you.

The old unexpected chainsaw in 1/2 was a pretty bad feeling.

No, you see, there is no knack for it. Combat is chaos is unpredictable. You take the hits you can get.

I still don‚Äôt understand how you only have linen bags.
---
A fast attack speed is good for maintaining Frenzy if you're specced for it, but the difference between Broken Tooth and a 1.2/1.3 cat in PvE is minimal.
---
if I remember correctly, a warlock could just cast [Curse of Recklessness](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11717/curse-of-recklessness) on mobs for that sweet, sweet 90 AP buff... making 'em oneshot low level players.

Nope.  The riding skill allows you to ride the faster mounts, it doesn't change the mount speed in Classic.  O think that may have been a WotLK change.

---
This shield is basically a must-have for any pally who wants to tank at 60... 
---
Its value is amazingly high, and usually goes for 900g at least on a developed server.
---
You just reminded me that I had an addon or rez macro or *something* in Vanilla that would send silly messages every time it was cast. Time to go find it again.
---
&gt;we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so

I get it that inventory space is at a premium, but I'd never delete a mount.

Yeah, heard about it. Might be convenient for updates but as I wrote the addons I simply copypaste should be sufficently updated.

Wait i'm the druid in this picture but I didn't post this thread &gt; &lt; mah karma.

I'm not entirely sure, but I believe that is a tortoise, and judging by it's trajectory, I'd say it's trying to kill itself.

then what are they?

If you‚Äôre horde there is a repeatable quest in desolace where you turn in 5 clam meat for 55 silver. You can make about 15 gold an hour.

So I'm not the only weirdo that helps Alliance lowbies do quests.

No sane resto shaman totem twists.  You want me to spend 500 mana on totems every 9 seconds and permanently lock my 5second rule for you? lolno, get one of the many enhance shamans looking for a raid spot, I'm going 30 0 21 after I get my set anyway.

Aggro didn‚Äôt used to work this way, but now it does. I have seen this happen quite a few times. A passerby somehow gets offed by a group of mobs they had never interacted with. One of my new favorites is when two groups of players are fighting ogres in stormgard and one of the healers crits a big heal and all the mobs nearby in combat for both yet separated groups aggro on the healer ...fun times. It is a brave new world.

Actually we‚Äôre all laughing at you

after a quick google search insta equipped it.

It works "similar" at this point. They removed a chunk of functionality to combat overly powerful addons about 2 weeks ago. So a fair few calls are now protected from macro access.

That and we have class stacking, guides and 1.12 patch now. It's like 30% easier because of 1.12 alone.

In a duo you just get a 50/50 split so either kill twice as many mobs or yeah split up.  This is only if you‚Äôre going for maximum efficiency though

Not everyone does DM 20 times, normal people just do 1 run with full quest and moveos on.

Edit: not to mention,  the staff I'm talking about is from the quest reward lmao

Nope, there are no offers or anything, you can open a ticket and beg for game time but the most they'll give you if you're very very lucky is 2-3 days of time to just try out the game, otherwise you're boned.

First time WoW player progressing pretty nicely I think (57 Hunter).  Trying to get some Pre-BiS items from the higher level dungeons but everyone who runs these dungeons are super picky and either a) don't want a hunter in they're party or b) are super try-hard and expect max efficiency.  Seems like a catch-22 to me to where new players can't get experience because nobody will let them in.  I know I'm not the best hunter in the world but I think I'm doing pretty well and have the common sense knowledge required to run these dungeons.  Any advice on how to get in a solid group? I don't have a good guild to rely on.  Anyone on Blaumeux wanna lend a hand and show me the ropes of these end-game dungeons?

I can transfer to Earthfury but hesitant, whats it like? Faction imbalance? High activity hours?

You have the be level 34 just to get the quest for the Bonebiter axe, and the mobs you have to kill in Desolace are around level 37.  The Instances required to complete the next part need level 35-40.  
---
You can get the Whirlwind Axe at level 30.
---
If that‚Äôs true then 98% of the horde on my server must be fucking terrible at PvP.

Yikes at you being a douche. Who gives a shit.

This is wrong, it just says 19 or 21, it still ticks for 20. Ive backstabbed with 61 energy and went to 0. Its a visual bug. I have 16 days played on my rogue.
---
Which is the scenario they described that would lead to a severe queue upon removal of layering. So we will indeed get heavy queues upon removal. 
---
Should probably have included that in my post. Thanks for clarifying for everyone. With this information it is crystal clear that we will get severe queues.
---
Don‚Äôt tell the elf

&gt; Meanwhile us hunters get the worlds easiest leveling and still 3rd best dps in early raids, not bad!

Why do US hunters get an easier time over EU/Chinese/Oceanic hunters?
---
Who RPs in old English?!?
---
Damn you got me
---
Best way is probably letting the tank know it has been a problem.  That helps push them up the priority to kill.  They would also then look for opportunities to hold them around a corner so they don't have line-of-sight to you, though not a guarantee but they'll find it if there is the opportunity.  They also have cooldowns they can use.  You may also need to overheal just a bit on them as well, if you can afford the mana to do so, so at least they're topped off prior.
---
Where does this occur?  I don't remember this ever being a problem.
---
Since when?
---
That mage probably leveled with AOE Groups in dungeons.

Might be a bug introduced by an attempt to make trades with NPCs a thing

What he said.
---
In pvp, each hit causes interruptions...so faster attack means more interrupt.   But faster attack vs shamans triggers their uninterruptible casting talent more.   Cats also allows stealth at key pvp objectives which synergies well with night elf racial without having to dismiss pet.
---
In pve, brokentooth and faster pets do allow you to cheap out on frenzy talent. You can do 3/5 or 4/5 while maintaining mostly a full uptime on this ability.  These one to two points can be spent elsewhere. Pretty minor!
---
As you said you don‚Äôt care about min maxing so pick a pet you like!  If you care a little, having a pet with slightly faster attack speed will be prefered.  Checkout petopia classic for pets organized by attack speed for some guidance.
---
"While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, **with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan."**

Bags are an easy way but I'm not sure it's profitable to flip raw mats from AH for them.  Grinding cloth, silk and up will be good.  Wool as well.  Once you hit moon cloth, you should be making an effort to transmute on cooldown.  That alone should net some money

This literally means nothing unless you know how layers interact with queue times in very specified detail. Details which do not exist since blizz haven't given them. This could mean anything from 2 layer server getting double queue time from removal of layering to no queue time increase at all.

All we can look towards is blizz having stated queue times will increase upon removal of layers if the server cap will be raised further, which it has.

That isn't because some specs are worse than others though. With the exception of naxx, vanilla raids are arguably the easiest in wow's history. Raid completion and popularity went up with subsequent expansions despite raids becoming significantly more mechanically involved and difficult. 
---
In vanilla, many players didn't even reach max level, much less participate in a max level raid. Most players barely knew how to play the game because it was brand new and information was more difficult to come by.

%t! Nice. Now how do i make custom emotes?
---
There is a quest in Tanaris to collect Pirate Hats from pirates... that do not wear hats. 
---
Finally a quest that makes WoW go full circle !
---
Warriors are a very slow leveling class. Dungeons are probably your best bet.
---
It's not really that big an issue. A normal raid probably takes 12 healers, but you really only need those 12 for 1-2 fights a tier for the first 2 weeks. But after 2 weeks of learning the fights and gearing, you're down to needing 10 healers for the worst fights, and are ok with 6-7 healers the others fights. But, of course you still have 12 healers specced and gearing for the hard healing fights in the next tier.   
---
My point is that for 90% of the time raiding you have healers sitting around scratching their arse, and the more warlocks life tapping the better really as far as they're concerned.
---
Come to Heartseeker. Everywhere I go the balance seems very close to 50/50.
---
Your bold part gets qualified by 
---
&gt; Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line
---
Suggesting that the cap is at a sustainable level, it would not be higher
---
Plus, as a few other people were saying, the early raids (Ony, MC, BWL) really were tuned more for 20-30 people with the rest just being "warm bodies."
---
Guilds that were legitimately bad and had 10+ total dead weight people in their raids were still clearing Onyxia and at least portions of MC and BWL, even back then.
---
The raids didn't start to get difficult into AQ40 and Naxx - and not because of mechanics, but because the fights were actually tuned somewhat appropriately for 40 people.
---
I‚Äôve done it and honestly it can be worthwhile if done correctly. I‚Äôve got Mage gear set that cost me a decent penny but the stamina on it was so good that I legit outtanked the tanks. Priests where confused why their heal is barely effective on me. Without needing a tank (so more DPS is faster runs) and without fear of wipes transitions to faster level 60 and faster gold generation in the long term.  
---
But yeah I‚Äôm sure most people just overspend cuz it looks pretty.
---
Err.. classic wow apparently
---
Hmm interesting, so it‚Äôs the counter not counting the stacks of reckoning? Or is it counting the stacks but when ever you go to unleash it gets wonky?
---
I though they disabled this addon in retail? It works in classic?! Holy shit yes!
---
When you are in a group of 2 each one of you receives 60% of the exp you would get when killing solo. As such you essentially receive 120% of the exp, assuming you together kill mobs as fast each as you would solo. 
---
If done right you kill more mobs in a group of two than the total of each of you killing alone, so it should be worth it. But yeah, kill quests in a group essentially need you to kill double the number to stay in the level range you are supposed to.
---
I think us casuals are mostly in the 30s or 40s
---
They are saying they won't raise player caps above the eventual single layer goal at the time of the post. This situation isn't what most people think it is, and it's not exactly simple. 
---
What this post means is that layering was supposed to have 0 impact on queues. Layers were splitting up the population the server was allowed to have, it was in no way changing what the total population could be despite them blizzard being able to have more players hardware wise. At the time there was no definite plan to allow character transfers.
---
That was August 16th, before launch. Your blue post is dated to that.
---
They went back on this decision about 1-2 weeks in due to severe queue issues and players being reluctant to move to new servers being spun up. They both opened new layers, and raised the total number of players on a server that were allowed on.
---
This leads us to today. They now have layered and overpopulated worlds. They likely haven't changed their minds about what the longterm 0 layer population cap should be. Character transfers have been added for basically every server that has a queue at any point.
---
So what's the deal? I'm guessing they're going to slowly boil the frog by lowering the server pop allowed over time. Queues will grow until players start to feel the pressure and move to new servers. Longterm the plan would be to blow off enough players into other servers so the original servers are within the population target.
---
Me and my mates rp all the time in multiple locations, we just randomly start rping. Definitely the most fun I‚Äôve had while playing classic so far.
---
Charge, demo shout, thunderclap, alt to shift through targets while spamming sunder armor. Congrats you're tanking as an arms warrior.
---
Thanks.
---
you could try camp taurajo in southern barrens. walk the road further south as well and there's a dude on the road who gives you a couple of quests, first one has lv21-24 mobs, next one's a bit harder at 23-26.
---
What companion are those?
---
i've been 60 for a week and still havent been to mc
---
I'm getting close to level 60 and I'm starting to see more and more groups try to reserve items and other annoying interactions.
---
This is what I hate about logging for classic, there are so many abilities that are important for a raid that can't get factored into a log parse.
---
If your warlock has points in improved imp and that's the difference between your tank living or dying, that's never going to show up in a parse, but you're going to be happy you didn't replace all your warlocks with fury warriors when it does happen.
---
It's objectively great when precast on tough pulls in order to give the tank a headstart.
---
It's objectively useful when dealing with damage spikes to avoid someone dying (be they tank or otherwise).
---
It's just not a part of the bread and butter healing rotation.
---
Swamp of sorrows probably
---
I was just saying this yesterday
---
Satyrs without horns
---
Cheers to having a good experience at low levels! There are some shitty players but the community is pretty great overall
---
Had a shadow priest tank archaedas since he was the highest level by far. They get sick armor bonuses and are tankier than warriors at that level, 45-55, easily. Single target threat is good too
---
No, they just really want you to find a lower pop server instead of going for High/Full pop ones. Doing it now will make things easier for P2.
---
I'm brought into a group to be a dps. My ability to provide drinks and food is an added bonus. One that frankly I shouldn't be "expected" to do like some servant. I'm not asking people beg me. I'm asking, like the original poster, that people just take the added ordeal of a few keystrokes to actually ask nicely. I know moving your fingers is a huge hassle but taking a note from someone here. 
---
Maybe not roll classic if you can't be bothered to have basic manners.
---
Could you have two macros? One tied to the rez then hit the second at the end of the cast?
---
They should slowly remove layers so people slowly get the gist to switch realms.
---
took me 10 played days with a lot of afking to get to 60, id guess most casual players will be hitting 60 within next 2 weeks
---
What is air
---
I‚Äôve been playing for about 2 hours a day for 2 weeks on one character and I just hit 21. But I‚Äôm definitely taking my time.
---
Found a level 1 troll rogue named Lololol chilling in Booty Bay that went stealth right on top of the Flight Master. First time I clicked on him and the guards all tackled me to death. Didn't at all know what happened because the rogue disappeared as soon I killed him. Came back and did it again, but I noticed this time. Thought it was hilarious. Corpse ran back and stayed a ghost as I watched him set it up again, then it happened to another player. Hit him with the "same lol" and flew off.
---
An enh sham in optimized gear with pin point rotation can hang in the top 10, but it takes a lot of effort to pull off. They'll sweat bullets when it comes to threat though.
---
Does not stand the test of time.  Watched it 3 weeks ago and it was just okay.
---
Per tick is fine. :P I am looking for at what intervals. Optimal dps and all that
---
Playing as much as I can with a family and I‚Äôm mid 30‚Äôs. Rest bonus is actually taking some of the grind out.
---
Yeesh. Judging by the first page of your comment history, you're not worth having a conversation with so I think that's the end of our little comment chain.
---
Me and a couple friends decided to make a group of 3 paladins and engage in some light RP when leveling. 
---
One of the first things we noticed was a pie vendor guild, with an queue of people waiting in line to buy pies. They would all greet the vendor, thank them, and walk away, nice and orderly.  This was the same at the Stormwind Bank, with people waiting in a queue. 
---
I was in the Goldshire Inn talking with some people when a person walked in. A number of people stopped to look at him as he entered, and all went mostly silent until he left. I asked what was up and got the answer of "he is known around these parts".
---
[Then there was this nonsense, which I had the mod-given title of "dog" on here for a while from](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1651hs/god_damn_rp_servers_man/)
---
Yo, it doesn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúsnap back‚Äù, I tried that before, didn‚Äôt workout well for me, after 2 days I‚Äôm no-lifeing it again, I keep thinking about the game when I can‚Äôt play and it drives me crazy! So just take it slow, step by step, try to just log on to finish one to two quests, or just hangout and do some goofy stuff or talk with randos, you will feel better that way.
---
I don't like assuming the worst in people, so I agree. In all likelihood the GM is incredibly stressed and there was some misunderstanding. However, in my many interactions with Blizz CS since 2005, I have not once met a GM who just says "Thank you" and closes the conversation. They always ask if there is anything else, any more questions, etc. Alongside them talking past me, it was just really poor communication on the part of a person whose literal only job is communication.
---
That's not easy for any tank to hold. Not just shaman.
---
&gt; Shadowmeld allows rogues and druids to eat/drink while stealthed.
---
Late to the party, but this isn't how it works at all.
---
 * If you stealth/prowl *first* and then try to eat/drink, you pop **out** of stealth/prowl.
---
 * If you shadowmeld *first* and then try to eat/drink, you pop **out** of shadowmeld.
---
 * If you try to eat/drink *first*, you can *then* stealth/prowl *or* shadowmeld to hide yourself while you're eating or drinking.
---
For rogues/druids the only benefit of shadowmeld (aside from the +1 stealth level) is that you can shadowmeld to hide while you wait for stealth/prowl to come off cooldown and then use those so you can start moving again.
---
hot damn your server sucks LOL

---
The realm is divided. 15k players would be 3k players each in 5 layers. Reasoning is because you can't have 3k players in one area.
---
All target chains lead to Kevin Bacon
---
They tripled it to 3 minutes in wrath.
---
It does reward cooperation. Usually if you are working in groups of 2 or 3 you can kill mobs much faster than if each of you would kill mobs solo. There is less downtime and you can go in more aggressively. Which also opens up for AoE potential. So if for example in 10 minutes you would solo kill 20 mobs, in a group of two you may kill 50 mobs in 10 minutes. Then add to this the Exp bonus and you received the exp of killing 30 mobs each. Making leveling 50% faster.
---
He saved you a few gold, which you can easily afford to use for spells as you level.
---
I‚Äôm super casual, but I‚Äôm also taking the time to level professions, cooking, and fishing (which is never done before!). In retail I always felt like I needed to rush to the next level, I‚Äôve actually turned off the XP bar this time around and it‚Äôs like a cool surprise when I ding.
---
I‚Äôve got a priest lvl33 and a level 15 rogue.
---
What part didn't make sense? I'd be happy to break it down for you
---
Blaumeux is near 50/50... i think its the closest of all servers
---
If they cast hearth even 1 second too late after popping bubble you will have the chance to interrupt or stun etc and stop the cast
---
id rather die and run back, be a lot faster than going from kalimdor to eastern kingdoms, or vis versa
---
.
---
How much are you making per hour?
---
layers don't decrease or at all effect the server pop cap
---
Never seen a player fight a fair 1v1 before. FTFY
---
Love RP realms.  &lt;3
---
yes.
---
we were absolute crap 15 years ago.
---
notably, we had a strong culture of hatred toward DPS, making the fight ridiculously long, pushing healer's mana to the limit and so on.
---
35 but I‚Äôm doing lotsa professions. 190 fishing 207 cooking and 225 first aid on top of enchant and tailoring.
---
The fact that this is a retail addon confuses me, what use would it have in retail? You very rarely play with the same people again
---
Congrats you got your own layer
---
layers don't effect server population cap stop spreading false info
---
I‚Äôm not really concerned with speed, as we‚Äôre doing all the quests for story/immersion.  Will we be under leveled though?
---
holy shit i know exactly what are you talking about hahaha
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it, mud farmer.
---
Full pre raid bis frost mage, x2 freezing band. Im so tired.
---
Thats a yikes
---
I use fade if it's multiple mobs. If I have aggro I shield myself and walk the mobs back to the tank.
---
 we have never crossfactioned :) [https://imgur.com/a/j9X3n0q](https://imgur.com/a/j9X3n0q)
---
Correct
---
I just started leveling a hunter and I'm really appreciating their role in raids. They may not bring the highest personal raid damage but with trueshot aura and furious howl they bring more overall damage. It just doesn't get shown in their numbers.
---
Leveling a priest (36 atm) as disc, have been healing instances but at 40 will respec to shadow. If I really enjoy it I'm planning to stick with shadow til 60 and beyond. I am aware that raid spots are basically limited to 1 for SPriests but I currently do shift work and can't commit to a full on raiding schedule anyway. So my question (finally) is: what is a good shadow/disc talent tree that would allow me to melt skulls in 5-mans and also melt faces in BGs?
---
West Ashenvale, Southern Barrens, Stone Talon Mountains. Quest run into WC will also net a sizeable amount of XP.
---
Ah, so you're just an elaborate troll.  Not bad to be honest, you had me in the first half.
---
i love him
---
In PvP they do.  You go in and out of forms enough that a good weapon is useful.
---
Important to mention is that it was important for WoW to have quests everywhere. WoW was a super casual MMORPG for its time. I remember one of the more casual pre WoW mmo's where solo leveling was possible meant you would multitask at least two accounts at the same time and usual leveling groups were 8 player groups. Because it was essentially impossible to kill mobs alone in an efficient manner. 
---
But with this need came the content as leveling in a group is fun. But if you play casual solo game WoW, you need something else than to just solo grind.
---
DAE THE OTHER SIDE UNFAIR???
---
Renew is very inefficient and not worth using.
---
Downranking is also inefficient unless you have a lot of + healing gear
---
naxx-level mecanics are baseline stuff in heroic mode dungeon /raid.
---
example: 4 horsemen.. taunt swapping.. it's now a munane, brainless mechanic present on nearly every boss.
---
C'thun: spread out for chain lightning... it's such a trivial mechanic that it has to e overlapped with movement restriction ( see zek'voz in uldir)... and so on.
---
onyxia have virtually no mechanic P1 ( dont stand in her front or her back). you can do P2 before a deep breath ( not that it's hard to dodge it), P3 is just P1 with fears...  she hit like a wet noodle too.
---
Grobbulus FTW!
---
Think there is one in AQ off the worm too.
---
If you count all the windfury procs they give the warriors and rogues as their own damage they would look a lot better on the charts.
---
Have a Tailor, Alchemist for Mooncloth and Arcanite transmutes if you got them to 35+
---
One alt to disenchant greens.
---
Most of the crafting professions have a couple of things you can make at lower levels that sell. Iron Counterweights and Weapon Chains for example jf you're a blacksmith. 
---
Some people will level a Mage to 60 just to farm DM E or do some AoE farming since they have a much easier time making money.
---
I'm a feral druid. It's just straight up not true that druids are better tanks for MC, they can do it, but equally geared/skilled prot warriors are better.
---
Druids can be argued to be better OTs though, or an argument can also be made for them being better for speed clearing on fights they can tank.
---
The community, especially in my server(whitemane) is trying way too hard, Tons of 60s and the main population are all grinding SM cath, almost no one calling for RFC and WC already,the fast pacing makes me feel a bit painful because I have to catch up with the crowd, and that wasn‚Äôt fun at all.
---
If you're at lower levels with a normal dungeon group and not a cleave group then havr them eat the caster while you build aggro on the melee. Stun/CC/kick any other casters you pull. If you're with a cleave group all you need to do is grouo the mobs and then focus maintaining aggro/ kicking the casters while they eat the melee. That's it
---
Can't you make an alt and find out?
---
Bears. Beats. Battlestar Galactica.
---
Spellbinders in the first part of LBRS and mobs in Instructor Malicia's room in Scholomance have counterspell.

Took me 12 days played to hit 60. I did have every profession except fishing at 300 and 5-6 BiS preraid pieces. I also afk'd quite a bit due to server queues and not wanting to log out and wait in a 50 minute queue just because I was doing some work for an hour or so. I had some internet issues that caused a lot of wasted time from deaths after disconnecting while fighting mobs. I'd guess that realistically without all of the aforementioned things slowing me down, I'd have hit 60 in 8-10 days played. This was on a rogue. I think mages, locks, priests and warriors willing to tank dungeons would have been significantly faster. Also hunters. I barely did any dungeons outside of one run for each quest sword I needed until level 55 or so when I started going to brd.
---
Depends on your class. As a shaman I have to say, grinding after level 40 is way too slow. Doing dungeons gives me the most exp.
---
&gt; WTF is a windfury totem
---
WFT* :-P

Went on my first RP server today. I choked on some spicy KFC. Things got hectic. Long live RP realms.

It does I‚Äôve switched from gnomish to goblin using the book after releveling engineering. It‚Äôs in steamwheel port at Tanaris. Worked fine not bugged for me.
---
Goes for 250g on EU. Its nice but AoE tanking isn't a thing for tanks quite yet (outside of dungeons). Most people just pick up Shield of Retribution because it does the job in dungeons and more people will probably pick up more on fury tanking for dungeons soon.
---
Some of the hardcore raid folks see it as a challenge to clear as fast as possible. Kinda like trying to beat a best lap time in a race. Others want to be able to raid but not let it consume their day/night.
---
Thorgrim, get the book.
---
Love the sound effects. Darkest dungeon is sick!
---
On the other hand, lots of awful gear became great as blizz revamped it to include what people wanted- tons of high level gear featured cloth with int and str or agi or similar, and stats such as spell power or hit% were very difficult to find.  It may not have been 1.12, but one of the later patches retroactively changed huge amounts of items to be not just usable but in many cases now prebis.
---
With knowledge we have now, raids are going to be more accessible. More people in the raids, but not everyone is going to drop all the gold for the oozling
---
What an awesome story, thanks for sharing! It definitely made me laugh.

---
I see. Name of the addon?
---
You can't really be shitty when most fights are stand still 1 button press. You can click spells, you can eat, you can have 10fps, you can have 200ping, you can turn off your monitor and still perform on the same level.
---
Are you excited to post ‚ÄúWTS Pendulum of doom 1400g PST‚Äù for the next 2 years?
---
thats why fighting games are so much fun imo, you can even beat people with shit characters because of your skill.
---
Looks like a great AoE tanking weapon.
---
That part honestly peeves me the most. I'd probably have taken this a lot better if it was an email, I could have assumed some algorithm was on the fritz and it was a simple error. The fact I told this dude to his face *"I literally can not do this exploit and I'm the one who I reported him doing it"* and he just goes *"k byeeeeee"* is what got me fuming. Why whisper if you have zero intention of actually conversing with the person?
---
imagine charging for something you get for absolutely nothing.
---
That‚Äôs nice! Would be a fun holiday type of thing to do.
---
the emp use ironfoe a weapon with a mod "get 2 extra swings"  so that makes sense unlike the multi hits from normal Monsters
---
Oh been a long day.  Sub hammerfall for the alliance town then :P
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks for clarifying!
---
That is you assuming based on nonpremise in the statement. 
---
As the statement reads they‚Äôre at the sweet spot
---
probably exaggerated but not impossible, its very possible for a level 1 twink with full enchants to beat players in the mid to high teens. One shotting a 22 is unbelievable tho
---
That's cute
---
On second thought let's not listen to Carlos Danger. Tis is a silly person.
---
It has more to do with how bad the dps are. Way too much frustration fighting the dps for aggro.
---
&gt;One of the more balanced pvp servers that's for sure
---
You must be playing on Alliance. I hear them say that a lot. Every time I'm in a contested zone at 40-60, I see 10-20x more alliance than horde. Gadgetzan tonight had 3-5 horde and a few dozen alliance members, and that was an hour or two ago. I could just be experiencing some extreme bias, but it seems pretty heavily skewed from my perspective.
---
I mean they have to be good at *something*
---
It really depends on mob health and number of mobs. If you are nuking a single mob down before SnD has time to even be active it‚Äôs kinda pointless. Go ahead and Evis. If you are going to be swinging on the mob for a while, or are fighting more than one mob, I feel like SnD is better overall. My damage meters seem to think so. Also, SnD can be used on a second mob after the first one dies. It is one of the only ways to transfer combo points to a different target. If I know I have a second mob waiting and I have combo points on the current target who will die quickly to auto attack, I‚Äôm popping that SnD and using the speed increase on the next target.
---
I think yoda was in the same universe, he was just in a galaxy far far away.
---
NPC yells work different than player ones. NPC ones can be set individually by Blizzard to be zone wide (usually used for instance mobs) or whatever range.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as people make it seem, unless you make it hard on yourself. Farming gear isn‚Äôt THAT different from retail. Pot wise you need two/three flasks up, some healing, and some resist pots. Getting absolutely pre-raid BIS is a motherfucker for the casters but even that doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
Snow is too deep to open the door
---
Which is kept in the most prestine conditions...
---
Love it
---
Not if you make sure to hit every possible zone.  There‚Äôs more than enough quests to hit 60 off just questing in a group.  You just have to be willing to hit every zone possible
---
Had a mage in our Armory group last week who legit only used Blizzard. Didn't matter if it was a pack of 4 or just one guy left running away at low health, Blizzard was being cast from the moment the tank charged. And when he went oom (which was every pull) he would just stand there until he had enough mana to Blizzard again, never saw a wand once.
---
Eventually tank gets annoyed because we almost wipe cause the mage kept fucking up the aggro, pretty calmly tells him to quit the aoe and just focus the skull. Mage gets upset and pulls a pack, ice blocks, then hearths and leaves group. I swear mage is the new huntard.
---
They aren‚Äôt assuming you‚Äôre a dick because you‚Äôre competitive. They‚Äôre assuming you‚Äôre a dick because you‚Äôre kinda being a dick.
---
You jumped me unprovoked in Felwood a few days ago so this is a lie.
---
Lol. Hope you found one.
---
check if you already taught him 4 abilities.
---
pets can only learn a maximum of 4 usable abilities ( passives dont count)
---
And to the surprise of nobody, enh / ret all the way down on the bottom by a large margin.
---
This is why nobody wants them in raids.
---
Bagnon is a lot better than onebag imo
---
Great Gm, glad they're here to "help"

Rad.  That‚Äôs the plan anyway.  Thanks.

water psl
---
So it begins...
---
It is really as boring as the first couple of letters in my first name + the first couple of letters in my last name. Smash then together and you get "Daban", which is short and simple, close to my irl name so it's easy to make the connection for other people if I know them well enough that we go by first name basis, and it usually isn't taken in games.
---
That said it is a slightly worse nickname ever since "dab" became a term. Many think it's related to it somehow
---
Aah,  good old Goldshire.
---
try relogging, the whole pet training thing is quite buggy. Also you pet cannot have more than 4 active skills just in case there wasn't one showing there.
---
Try abandoning it and taking a new pet with dash already learned.
---
Yea this is my thought too
---
Apply Config didnt work for me using the initial link. Where do i go to "browse Configs"
---
&gt; The Enhance tree is for I dunno, sustained farming
---
Also PvP. Windfury one shot memes.
---
It is, in vanilla they never sent anything that had not been looted and left on a corpse. As long as it was player inventory, it was okay.
---
No BS guide to efficiently maxing out cooking, hope you guys enjoy! :)
---
It's due to 'lee way'. Its a doubling of the melee hit range / player hit box they added in classic to compensate for the delays in player movement due to the quality of internet connection in the early 2000s.
---
He knows Growl, Bite, Prowl. I think he came with the threat reduction ability though. Any way to unlearn it?

Magic stat improving armor makes gnome tanking possible.

I saw an assassins blade on the ah for 199g the other day but I wasnt sure if it was worth or not

I've been using this addon: https://willitclassic.com/view/1s7fJ2YrCReLRCJokeHN

"Show Me My Heal"
---
Seems to work great :)
---
This isn't about evading mobs, this is about hanging on top of buildings and using ranged spells on people so they may struggle to reach you to fight back and the guards of the town which exist to stop this from happening can't reach you.
---
Typical wow gm. Garbage response to an honest report.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Alliance hunters will still forget to buy enough arrows and inform you they will be flailing their little weak arms at mobs the last half of the instance.
---
One is abusing a mechanic that was only put into the game because of outside issues (too many players) and one is "abusing" an intentional design (8 debuff slots maximum). It's not like it trivializes the fight either, it's not like C'thun goes afk after you do it, it just gets rid of a debuff.
---
To be honest I think you embarrassed him so hard he just dipped out lol
---
Same could be said for Paladins. Think you‚Äôre keeping threat without Salvation?
---
Dad has ARMS!
---
Is this satire?
---
I mean yes and no. WoW become a lot more casual friendly as it got older because it exploded in popularity, but it wasn't really designed that way. A bit more accessible for sure but having played many other MMO's the game didn't scream "casual" to me, just a bit different and more fun.
---
I agree that without questing the game would be a lot more of a pain, but at the same time back at the start of the game when nobody knew where the quests were or any kind of optimal path, most people spent a *lot* of time grinding regardless of level. When Joanas guides started popping up for speed levellers one of the biggest points was that he'd managed to map out a path to level up almost entirely via questing with only a few "grind to the next level" bits here and there depending on how you'd progressed.
---
Even now with classic all people need to do is install Questie or similar and do a quick map check to get all the quests then map out the path to finish them all. My first round to 60 I had no clue how many quests I missed as they're scattered all over the world and often the NPCs are pretty damn hard to find.
---
Not in classic wow. You are assigned a layer upon login and remain there for the duration of your session unless you join a group with someone on another layer.
---
What's the 50-60 leveling route?
---
IMO, playing with friends trumps all other pros/cons. Undead rogues are really cool, it's what my main is for Horde and I love playing him

I upgraded to a mouse with 7 side buttons so now I use those 7 and those 7 + a shift modifier for ALL my hotkeys.
---
When I had 2 I would put a button I spam on one and an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù button on the other. As a rogue this was sinister strike and vanish.

Thannnnk you

Hellfire and Auchindoun dungeons were not "loot hallways" in any sense. Especially on heroic.

Getto is a really bad player of World of Warcraft
---
He has to go now, his planet needs him.
---
Yes, and even then Horde has a teleport directly to it from Booty Bay.
---
Just wondering what addon that js for the loot box? True shame fot the binding theres a guild on my realm that did that for the eye of sulf
---
Depends on the quest. Some take 20 min extra. Fuck that. You go make your own group for that.
---
I have no plans on raiding.... I really regret not being a paladin tank.
---
It‚Äôs part of elvui
---
well you'll get a decent amount from people who are eventually gonna make twinks but not sure how much return you'll get

I'd say the fact he didn't follow up is evidence that he's inexperienced and probably overloaded with issues to get through.

Yeah, even if we had fully perfect 1.1 talents/spells, MC would still get rolled in less than 2 weeks after launch, since we have all the best strategies, consumables, preraid gear, etc.

[Hm.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/875/484/13e.gif)
---
thats basically what everquest has been doing, and they are lots of fun. They progress through expansions but tons of players drop out and go to the new servers every time ones released.
---
I know it‚Äôs not unanimously accepted but if you are rolling need for an off spec set that someone else need for their main spec, you‚Äôre wrong. Group with a handful of pal lies lately that seem to need any stat gear that drops and they don‚Äôt give a shit who else rolls. The ‚Äúanything is hunter gear‚Äù meme rings way more true for pallies in my experience.
---
Hey dumdum. For some that is whats fun.
---
Run gnomer for MCP
---
Thank you !
---
No matter what you write on reddit, nothing will change because millions of people maybe once have gotten some food or water from a mage. Now, if you want to play a mage you are going to be known as the guy that can do that. That‚Äôs just how it is.

Enjoy your half game experience,l then,faerlina is a garbage server with streamers anyway

i am sick of people‚Äôs advertisements taking up more than half the chat window. just get to the point.

i love saying that is one hell of a pull too bad i am OOM..  evocation got 7 mins from that last bullshit you pulled without waiting on us to drink.

Saw someone suggest this rotation and it's great for getting mobs to stick right away:
---
Charge/sweeping strikes/berserker rage/ww/def stance/demo/battle/bloodrage/then sunder/revenges. 
---
You can do everything before sunders in like 3 seconds.
---
Without original datas, the developers of the servers lot of time overtuned the bosses.
---
Blizz CS at its finest
---
And then they ninja anyway.
---
What a jerk.
---
I was replying to his comment saying casters all make each other better except boomkins because that's all they do is make other casters better.
---
For levelling im not sure. For pvp i think not, for dungeon dps... definitely not:)
---
Like 80% of the braindead warrior noobs I see are so insanely shit at it you shouldnt have to care about everyone rolling this class.
---
No guild will take a warrior into bwl and gearing him if they pull a laughable 200dps because they are to cheap to buy the Edgemaster's Handguards so they wont glacing hit all day.
---
Try using this:
---
/petfollow [@pettarget,exists]
---
/petattack [@pettarget,noexists]
---
The mats don't cost a lot, and finding people that are farming the trolls for a different quest is super easy if you ask around. There are also a lot of people willing to help kill the elite so.. yeah its better to do it at level 30.
---
grinding wont give you reputation. grinding rep endgame costs a fortune
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Don't agree 100% with WoWHead's Classic Feral guide, but this excerpt about single target dps with Tiger's Fury is true. 
---
"Mostly utilized during your opener, this ability is a decent boost to your damage but has a pretty significant energy cost. You can use this ability outside of your opener if you happen to find yourself in a situation where you are about to be capped on energy and have no other way to spend your energy."
---
I can't seem to find pools in tanaris and was wondering why, im lvl 34 rogue on alliance with 208 fishing and big iron fishing rod
---
So can that GM not read or just doesn't want to lol
---
Only use fury as a filler. Like if you have between 30-34 energy and there is nothing else to do. Or before you engage if you are just waiting for the mob to come or right before doing an ambush.
---
Probably not worth it - unless you plan to make some twinks yourself!
---
No we used last night 1 tank 1 dps which was me on my mage and a healer. Another dps makes it easier.
---
going slightly insane- someone tell me Hand of Righteousness drops from Whitemane and isn't bugged? I've run SM cath so many times now and haven't seen anything but the headpiece and the amulet.
---
I see a few post doing bags. Maybe try a different item. Cool idea though.

---
Factually not true. You can, in fact, just arbitrarily change layers. It's not *common*, but it does and can happen. I've personally had it happen to me a few times. It's *very* disconcerting when it happens.
---
&gt;Pop cap isnt lowering from what it already is.
---
Fairly positive it is.
---
Oh. So that's where the Duergar in forgotten realms get their name from.
---
Just hit 30 on my Mage, whats the best way for me to level right now? Quest? AOE grind? A mix of both? Dungeons? I've been mostly questing so far but I want to catch up to my friends who are in the upper 30s/low 40s soon, so looking for the best way for me to do that as they'll be off for a few days so I want to catch up to them ASAP.
---
You try too hard, sadly someone took the bait, bet you feel good about that.
---
This just made me a little sad about dropping skinning to pick up alchemy at 40. Yanking devilsaur leather from Horde sounds like a grand ol' time.
---
Water? Happy to give for free if I‚Äôm not busy. Portals? At least pay me for the reagent. The worst is when I‚Äôm fighting a mob and someone asks for water and just stands there and watches.  If you want my help you‚Äôll get it faster by killing this thing with me.
---
THAT'S A GRUDGIN'
---
If you check my comment history you might see that a couple of sentences is actually quite a short response from me.  But anyway hope to see you in BGs.  I'll show you just how reduced my performance is :)
---
Take care!
---
And the endless pursuit of perfection, or in this case efficiency, is folly. What is mediocre about completing a raid where everyone is playing what they want &amp; having fun?
---
I agree with you about not settling for mediocrity, but if you need an ultra-efficient group composition to even have a *chance* at clearing, then you‚Äôre probably not as good as you seem to believe.
---
What if the winner rolled 2?
---
Iron Forge is sooo 2004.  Linked auction houses and the Ony head buff killed it immediately in Classic. 
---
But I remember, I remember the glory days of IronForge in 04 and 05.  Jumping from square to square.  Slow walk parades. Fighting over spots on the AH bridge.  Horde Locks and Priests getting up on the shop roof to the right of the bank, dealing death to all that wandered near.  And dueling by the mailbox.  Ahhhh the memories.  Good times.
---
I play a warrior and I always get whispered if I can tank something. My lock gets asked for porting or stones. Rogues get asked for unlocking boxes all the time.
---
This is just how it has always been. Just roll with it. There is no need for cringy posts.
---
You laugh but this is a real thing, and it works.
---
Thank you for bringing this to light. Decided to try out warrior and got to level 10 and I haven't even LEARNED hamstring. Figured it would be useless for me lol. Thank you
---
Heartbreak. It hurts.
---
Not really no, this whole theory is based on "if one of us is might be a cunt then we do get to be cunts as well" even if it hurts your party member who actually needs it the most.
---
If people used the system as it's meant to and what it was created for, we wouldn't have this discussion. Again, ninja looter mental gymnastics.
---
I would advise you to start grinding turtles, basilisks, or other mobs that drop high value greys until you‚Äôre 40.  You may even still not have enough, but you‚Äôd be surprised how much money you‚Äôll make doing that.
---
red herrings are fun
---
Literally just did this about an hour ago. I feel like I should have to vendor it now. I'm not worthy.
---
I mention that you get the alterac swiss from mobs, it can actually be purchased from cheese vendors. Please do not get scammed by someone on the auction house! 
---
Forgive my indiscretion.
---
Kargath is the spot.
---
I‚Äôve literally never been to Felwood. So that is impossible.
---
Aspect of the Viper was not in the game until 2.0.3
---
Well that‚Äôs kinda sad because this time around I‚Äôve convinced a few of my friends to try out classic and they‚Äôve never played wow before, this starting to become a problem as they legit can‚Äôt find anyone to go RFC/WC with them, and I have to constantly switch between alts to fill up the group, now I have a priest, a warrior and a Druid just to help my friends get pass level 20-30, they seems a bit disappointed as I told them how great and kind the wow community is.
---
trade chat, rune cost plus
---
Ask Harri to teach you how to prtscr
---
Maybe he places a value on community goodwill. Next time he's hunting a run and someone remembers this gesture he will be remembered fondly. Maybe his joy comes from written pixels of thanks rather than written pixels with a g after them. Don't harsh on how someone else chooses to enjoy moments.
---
Don't cater to the casuals

I mean, it‚Äôs STV. Lol

Today's 11th "that feeling of having many quests at once to turn in" post.
---
We must be guildies! See you out there buddy
---
Any recommendations on a threat meter? I tried omen but it doesn't seem to work.
---
Never knew about heartstone thing. Thanks a lot!
---
No pressure on the name creation lmao.  After a few years with the server live I imagine that becomes a creative writing challenge to find an available name
---
And maybe you can Harri how to piss off
---
I don‚Äôt usually allow myself to really pick a side of a fictitious conflict but I gotta say I can‚Äôt side with orcs. I can get on the side of every other race, but orcs are difficult. They have good sides and groups but every time someone starts showering orcs with love I just remember how they were such dicks in the lore
---
A mixture of quests/grinding is always the quickest, unless you know how to effectively AoE grind and you don't run into congestion issues with other people trying to grind your mobs too.
---
It's even easier than this.
---
/tm 5
---
/cast sheep
---
It's about weapon damage, not speed. Speed does typically mean higher damage though.
---
Sword is really good for human, definitely competitive.
---
Literally just a screenshot of Ironforge.
---
Good content.
---
Its not about not having beaks or hooves its about them being unusable.
---
You won‚Äôt have enough at 40, but you start making a lot more from quests and mobs after that. You‚Äôll get it in your low 40s. Don‚Äôt stop leveling just to farm gold, it‚Äôll come.
---
They have logs for everything. Everything.
---
you want to play an MMO without other players? weird
---
Can't afford it?
---
Any particular reason EU servers won‚Äôt fit the bill? Other than obnoxious spaniards/swedes/poles spamming /1 and /2 with illegible gibberish, which is a reportable offence. Also afaik spanish realms are being released with free transfers so that should take away most of the non-English spam.
---
Yes it can.
---
This evolution is brilliant.
---
I can vividly remember how many people on this sub said they would roll a mage and make tons of gold by just sitting in a major city and offer portals for 1g all up to 5g and also charge for food and water.
---
Nobody believed you'd be lucky to get a thank you much less any actual money for your services.
---
Priest - endless amounts of fun with Mind Control, pvp gods when played well, everyone‚Äôs best friend, always in demand

There should be a way to make a macro and kill sounds right after firing the shot. Or play a different sound to cancel it out and play one that is either silent or more pleasant.
---
I am 240 now. Will try the book later - thanks!

---
Best part is to let the other faction progress their escort quest like in tanaris and after the second set of spawns you just murder them and laugh at them and their failed quest, if they try again you do it again and they will just waste hours.
---
So much fun to see how mad they are
---
Thats why you should have pet attack macro'd to a keybind. He could have interrupted the skinning with his pet while stunned.
---
Found the retail asshole.
---
In order for your group mates to show up on threat maters they also must have a threat meter installed - possibly reason why it didn't work.   Details has a threat meter in it but requires you to find it in their menu, but for a simple one ClassicThreatMeter
---
Fuck that casual normie shit. I will ruin myself over classic! Im working on my second lvl 60 now. Im playing 16 hours a day average. Should have been more, but im physically unable to. Shower once a week, eat once a day. Classic is life.

I‚Äôm 52 right now and am leveling deep holy...boy is it slow. Killing mobs solo is ridiculous to the point where solo questing is questionable in general. It‚Äôs much better (obviously) duo questing with a guild is warrior.
---
I was ret 1-47 and respected Holy for dungeon grinding. I like healing as it‚Äôs my first time ever doing it. I would not recommend anyone level deep holy though unless you‚Äôre a glutton for punishment.
---
Sounds about right. Sooner layering goes away the better. I got 2 lotus in the same zone within 5 mins of eachother thanks to layering.

Every time I logon to my nelf I run through Ashenvale exterminating the Horde lice.

At a pet trainer you can unlearn all your pet abilities an retrain them.

Dual is right. I'm a warrior tank and it's kinda frustrating when people go full out retail dps while I'm still charging towards a pack. And yes, they have the audacity to scream they got aggro :)
---
oi
---
Er no that post does not say what you claim at all
---
Awesome, thanks for the help!
---
Lvl 30 is the biggest wall if you burst it then you'll make it to 60. It's going to get harder but I had a low point at 30 too and once you make it to 40 even if each level becomes super long you got a mount lol, you're no longer a scrub and can carry on leveling like a champ.
---
Ahhhh that's right I had totally forgotten about that requirement of classic. You just suddenly jolted me back to my guilds "mandatory addons" list in our forums.
---
Thanks üòä
---
Only takes about four brain cells to know when to quit spamming the macro and use a regular Maul.  Then again, the same could be said about not effectively silencing your own tank on a 15 second cooldown.  ¬Ø\\\_\(„ÉÑ\)\_/¬Ø
---
Give it a shot if you want, the ping will be pretty apparent with just a level 1 character. I do want to warn you from experience however that Herod gets some massive queue times. Hours of waiting at some points. Though, since you're playing from Europe, you might not get those since you'd be playing at irregular hours. Raiding hours will likely be a bit wonky for you though. I think playing on European servers would probably be a better idea, but you would have a better gauge of your own situation than I would. Good luck!
---
go back to retail
---
Blaumeux. Always high pop West coast and last I checked was basically 50/50 split.
---
RIP
---
I tell tank if I need to drink and warn dps if they're pulling aggro too often. Usually something like, "I can't heal two people at the same time and I'm always gonna prioritize the tank, so watch your aggro".
---
 Verdant keepers aim is better - it has more pure attack damage which means your aimed shot will do more damage.
---
There's only so much blizzard can improve on, you'll have to try it and see how it feels for yourself

Wait so you can't side with the orcs because of what they've done. But you can side with the undead?

Hey, he's not a frost mage.

Incendius is like that for me, luckily I work 3-11pm do I can play in the mornings and late late night

If you can afford it, yes. I had a bunch of extra level 1 instant poison left over, so I just used it on my offhand til it was gone.
---
That's why a smart paladin builds a "Fuck off" macro to ensure bubble hearth success.

A druid named Schwifty on the server Skeram ganked me in Felwood yesterday and you want me to believe that it wasn't you. Why would you lie about something like that?

Portal to Darnassus is at level 50 isn‚Äôt it?  I think you just get SW and IF at 40.

You're damaging the parts too much when killing them

Its the best TPS shield for warriors. Seen plenty and they go for 300-400g

Portal tips are common and don't make you a dick for refusing without one. People begging for water like you describe are acting like dicks, again, no issues with you treating them as such. Your PSA, however, lacked specifics so I based my reply on that.

On my server there is so many priests it's crazy.  I've been playing priest for over 10 years and it's so weird seeing so many bubbled up wanders....

There is never enough tanks, if you want to be wanted: Roll a tank!
---
You face Abraxsus
---
Sure. You search on Wowhead for the item. You see what the item is apart of crafting. You price it based on that final item.
---
Even as melee, I'm pretty sure you can hop up there to avoid the guards (and that that's also something GMs will warn you about).
---
Didn't they code bubble hearthing back into the game soon after the outcry, though? Hearthing becomes faster while using Divine Shield.
---
I wouldn't bother unless your stealthed and have the time to hit, wait to tick to 100, then open.
---
Oh, I‚Äôm not OP
---
nah tigers fury is doody
---
I mean, even a cheapass $300 "gaming PC" today should run Classic super easily.
---
I'm still running a CPU/GPU from 2014 and run Classic at 1440p near-maxed settings and almost never dip below 60fps.
---
Org. 1g per summon plus tips advertise on /1 &amp; /2. If you keep it up for a while you can build a rep.    You can also offer to travel to the other hubs to Port from the other areas for a premium.

Ignore the haters but beware haters and don't spam more than once per minute lest you get silenced from right-click spam reports.

Has a heads up - it appears all pets have been "normalized" in this patch, meaning broken tooth doesn't have its 1.0 attack speed and is mostly just like any other cat - the only difference between pets is the ranks of spells they start with.
---
depends if the next phase is going to come out soon. if not then not really.
---
The undead are humans who became victims of the scourge and were driven out of their homes after returning because of the humans views of the undead. They are people who went through terrible deaths, rebirths, slavery, and, after gaining freedom, banishment
---
I‚Äôd get at least one luv 60 before phase 2. Other no you‚Äôre good. 
---
You‚Äôll definitely be behind though you can‚Äôt have both.
---
hope his ass gets fired
---
Had Dickheads in Sulfuras doing this. Reported them as well.
---
That doesn't sound right...
---
Honestly OP, most times I think most people should post and black out the gms name. But in this case I Hope blizzard sees this. What a lousy lazy customer support rep. Extremely uninformative and unhelpful.
---
What's the rush? You have so much gameplay in front of you with more characters. Take your time and once you hit 60 with all 3 you'll be hyped with the amount of content and variety your account has (I think)
---
I had no idea there was a ten hour version this is fantastic.
---
It's not that bad, I got it done in a few minutes
---
That's the reason this screenshot is cropped all weird. On both sides of the image there's about 7 more horde ready to give this paladin the business

As a Shadow Priest, the two builds listed above can be altered to fit more your play style, and should really just be used as a template. As for BGs go, Shadow Priests aren't that great considering they have no nobility. So, always remember to pick up talents that help you in those situations, like improved CC abilities/shield/vampiric touch etc.
---
For PvE, your two major problems will be juggling threat with the tank, as well as being OOM quite often. So for a PvE build such as above, it's a wise choice to pick up Spirit Tap and the threat decreasing talents, as well as improved wand.
---
Either way works for world PvP though, Shadow Priests shine most in 1v1 encounters open world, and if played correctly, a PvE or PvP build will be more than enough to melt some faces.

Ultimately it's like. An enh shaman I in tbc can be even better, has better itemized gear available to look forward to, and also amazing party buffs! Vanilla is a time for cores really... Tbc is where hybrids truly shine. Wotlk was when they lost the unique buffs but got their damage better equalized with the cores.

Not sure why you even need gold as a Mage, you‚Äôll probably make 55g easy doing SM Cath runs and than some. Could even stay to 42 and not rush Mount right away don‚Äôt really need it there but still shouldn‚Äôt have any problems as a mage unless you trying to max tailoring and enchanting/engineering

6 slots &gt; 0 slots.

No, queues will increase because they'll be reducing server caps down to levels more suitable for a single layer (aka no layering).  That's what they're saying.
---
It's not rocket science.   Arbitrary values as example:
---
A)  Realm holds 15k people.  That could be 5 layers of 3k players each.
---
B) realm holds 15k people.  No layering.  Effectively 1 layer of 15k people.
---
Realm cap remains the same.
---
So why does the blue post say there will be queues when layering is turned off?  As a result of layering?  No.  They say there will be queues because they'll be reducing the realm caps back down again to a level that's suitable for a single layer's worth of players

Step 1: Take up fishing, Step 2: Cook fish. This worked for me, all the fishing recipes you need to skill up can be bought cheaply from vendors. Fishing is also a great money maker, I farmed for my mount at 40 by fishing wreckage nodes.

Even in Vanilla Ony was killed with only 3 people. She was never really that difficult.
---
That said in classic there are a few things that make her even easier like 1.12 talents, itemization etc. 
---
Also I was part of 2 Ony kills now and she did 0 deep breaths. I remember her doing more of them in vanilla but not sure.

Titled, dieing of thirst.

nah id say as long as you find a home by the start of p3 you doing fine
---
ive been clearing mc since week 2 , we already have 2 guild runs per week, i have 1 raid drop
---
it takes pretty long to gear people and stat wise pre raid bis is pretty close to epics available in phase one and two so there is no rush
---
there is no set time for p3 but id say you have at a minimum 3 months to sort out your character
---
and all guilds will have a few people who loose interest , the good thing about 40 man raiding is there is always a demand for new raiders
---
Honestly I wouldn't hate seeing this reflected in logs. FF14 implemented something similar with the prevalence of jobs that do substantial buffing, calculating both aDPS (personal damage) and rDPS (aDPS + the difference your buffs give the raid). Helps put things in better perspective

Yeah and that's hardware.  They didn't need layering to increase the realm cap, but without it, it'd be a shitshow.

That sounds exactly like the classic experience lol

You have a lot of options. Late 40s to mid 50s you can go to Ungoro, Searing Gorge, Felwood, or Feralas. Mid 50s you have both Plaguelands, Winterspring, Silithus, Burning Steppes, and Blasted Lands.

You sure about that? Might be the way it's presented to you in game, but something about malfurion having leaves literally growing out of his flesh,   and just druids in general just doesn't scream "I bathe regularly" to me.

In classic nobody has good AOE agro mechanics, not even warriors.  The best they can do is thunderclap which isn't a high threat ability.  Myself, I just autoattack a target, earth shock another, and stormstrike a third, then autoattack a 4th.

The reason is because public/private shareholders only care about increase in the stats that you share. So by not sharing certain statistics the company no longer has to endure shareholder grief about those statistics. You see social media companies doing similar things by not sharing total monthly users/posts/likes. It's the same reason why blizzard stopped posting the number of current wow subscriptions.

Where did the addon come from I can‚Äôt find it

I'm reading this on another screen.... and then look over to see two dudes doing exactly this in Gadgetzan. Didn't know that was an exploit.

&gt;Guards won't stop until you're dead 
---
wrong
---
the reason you're allowed like physically able to attack people in cities is because pvp is allowed in cities, guards aren't there to make pvp impossible.  How is a player supposed to distinguish between playing the gamenormally and "exploiting" by playing the game normally?  if I'm fighting players I can move how I want if I agro a guard I have places that are arbitrarily off limits.  they aren't labeled how do I know where I can and can't go?  asinine and unenforceable

I mean seal of wrynn is a sweet ring if you're alliance.

As a reference its about 350-400g on horde side on my realm.

Interesting he doesn't have a reply to this.

There is?? I was looking for ages and I didn‚Äòt know they eat spider legs. They won‚Äòt eat crab meat so I didn‚Äòt even consider spider legs

Always ask. I give every mana user atleast 4 stacks before dungeons

As others have said exploit green quests. Charge from mob to mob killing as you travel through mobs that are lower level but still in xp range. 
---
I jump from zone to zone a lot to stick to the green quests but when I do find others to quest with I stay super friendly and make them want to keep me along for as long as possible haha. 
---
I find being in a group as a warrior the most fun way to play. Especially with someone who can heal you a bit. You steam through quests and have a much better experience. You will also begin to get a feel for how your role as a tank should go do that when you do go to a dungeon your main tank leaves and everyone /points at you to take over you won't feel as overwhelmed.

Healcomm, but even that is busted atm from what I've experienced cause a HoT a druid or priest puts up on my frames shows the entirety of the healing it does during its duration. I don't like sniping heals so it throws me off and I'm assuming the person is being overhealed so I move on to someone else and that person ends up dying.

Right here with you man. Never gonna not play enhancement though. It‚Äôs what I have the most fun with. I‚Äôve never been an end game raider anyways, why should I stress about something I likely won‚Äôt experience.

It's not the removal of layering that affects queue times!  It's the reduction of the realm cap.
---
Phase 2s goal of the removal of layering goes hand in hand with the reduction of the realm cap, lest you end up in overcrowded zones with too many people online at once on your remaining single layer.
---
Layering and server players cap are independent values.

Yeah was it a troll hunter?

---
Classicwow.live
---
Will there or will there not be more queues when they reduce remove layers since they already have bypassed what they want on a single layer?
---
Yes the server could handle more, but they will be reducing realm cap to a lower level.
---
No, more layers don't increase the amount of players able to go on a server, but because of the layers they increase their maximum they allow on.
---
Without layers they will be reducing their set maximum for performance reasons.
---
Which my point was with the removal of layers there will be longer ques to get on for high population servers. Not all servers, but for a server like mine that never falls below medium population even at 9am, there will be longer queues.
---
Maybe your too dense to see a cause and affect to see that removal of layers will cause longer queues
---
Yeah. Most pugs set it to

---
Technically, 44 is the halfway point in terms of XP, but the late 40s-60s start to pick up. Especially once you get to. 52 or so and can start farming gear for 60, you have more of a mission than just leveling.
---
The quests become more densely populated with better rewards and higher XP.
---
Try outrunning a guard in a city and tell me how that goes. Guards were specificaly put in cities to stop "PvP" as griefers like to call it because it became a rampant issue in vanilla when some towns got overrun. Same goes for dishonorable kills and flight masters with a lot of hp and guardian gryphons, all implemented way back to give protection against it.
---
Called being 12

People actually do this? In dungeon groups sometimes the mage is so reluctant to make water I need to tip them 10s (level 30-40, I cant even afford all my spells)!

---
The fact that blizzard hasn't stopped the alliance transfers to this server and left it only open for horde seems like a real oversight. Stalagg is horde heavy, letting more alliance transfer off stalagg is just making both servers' problems worse.
---
Switch up what you‚Äôre doing. If you‚Äôve been quest/mob grinding, start running exclusively instances for a while. 
---
The playstyle is so different between questing/grinding and running an instance that it almost sort of rewards a different part of my brain.

THANK YOU

That's... really weird to hear. I'm a priest and I almost never drink, but my usual tank never slows down. He goes from pack to pack without pausing. Occasionally I get low and have to drink while he's pulled the next pack but by the time he's at half HP I've got plenty of mana again.
---
I tend to go through about 4-8 drinks per dungeon, and let spirit regen take care of the rest. Maybe the priests you've been with aren't making use of the 5 second rule.

The patch before the TBC pre-patch, just to clarify.  TBC pre-patch made a lot of classes much stronger than 1.12 did.
---
While collecting things for the Whirlwind Axe quest for Warrior I probably spent like 6 hours in STV just due to the constant fighting over the spawns of the trolls. Horde would always out number but eventually some of them would leave and some big dick lvl 60 Alliance would roll in. Which lead to the horde coming back and so on. Absolute chaos.

[Skeram is 65:35](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) so 70/30 isn't a bad approximation

Also works in everquest

typical alliance propaganda. forgets to mention that the same orc that drank the blood 1st, was the same orc that killed mannoroth and freed the orcs from the demon's control. the dark portal was destroyed and the orcs were left stranded. WoW classic takes place some 15 years after this event.

Lol thanks for the laugh.

There‚Äôs one right on the border of 1k and feralas.

On my server one devilsaur leather goes for 17-18g on the AH, so they are camped 24/7.
---
Water Elementals with no bindings. Longest quest that only needs 6 items.
---
People really started getting clued into fury dps just before BWL. It wasn't as refined as by 1.12, but fury warriors were absolutely undisputed highest dps wearing leather/mail when BWL started. Their problem was threat, and BWL was focused on threat management, meaning they were essentially hard capped at the max damage they could do by the tanks, who at the time didn't have nearly the threat generation they did later.
---
I sold one for 100g the other day but could easily get 200-300.
---
It is not pre-bis shield for raids due to Draconic Deflector having Defense. It is near impossible to hit defense cap before T1 due to the lack of Dire Mail gear.
---
That being said, Skull Flame shield is best for AOE tanking or gaining extra threat.
---
Let us know how it goes, this level of ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù is unacceptable from a multi billion dollar company.

Everytime a group of horde attacks me i do it and yell "I CAST FUCK U AND GOODBYE!"

I didnt go full demo for pact so i run void for the minor taunt and sac ability in pvp

How the hell did he sound like a twat by helping. Stick, leave ass

ret paladin in vanilla is more of a leveling and pvp spec.
---
You can still off tank ok as a prot paladin if you put in the effort, you are a great dungeon tank and you can heal very effectively as long as you got 20 points in holy, giving a lot of flexibility.
---
Though if you want to top the dps chart in raids, then you did indeed pick the wrong class.
---
God damn that was a good read.
---
Stockades has merits?
---
yeah no shit I understand whats going on not every player does, the vast majority of players don't.  if everyone were as smart as me we wouldn't be having this conversation.  how are the dumbasses supposed to distinguish where they can and can't go?  you seem to think this is limited to like 1 fucking place that you have to spend 20 minutes parkouring to and not the millions of places in game you can reach with 0 effort that 100% evade mobs.  people accidentally evade mobs all the time when they don't want to because it's so easy.
---
Do you understand what I say when I say arbitrary?  it's not clearly defined neither the act nor the places are clearly defined so how can players possibly keep track of where they're allowed to play the game?  you can look at gadgetzan and be like okay the top of the dome is off limits got it, so someone evades in the bank okay thats off limits got it so they go evade somewhere else okay nope thats off limts to.  players just have to manually track everywhere they're not allowed to go when a guard is chasing them?  incredibly stupid

Venture Co goblins in STV are level 36-38 and drop a bit money, greys and sometimes greens. There are also a few shredders that spawn witha chance to drop some engineering materials (Fused Wiring I believe) that I could sell in AH for 3-4g.

With no competition (night time) I was able to grind there for two levels and got enough money to afford a mount once I hit 40

Hunters don't scale very well. The difference between pre-raid BIS and pre-Naxx BIS is marginal. They're still better than the meme specs, but fall below warlocks and mages quite quickly.

Human male one about the ring and the 2 gnomes

Found out the trick for those is aiming for the matriarchs and patriarchs. Drop rate was most definitely higher with them than with the young ones near town.

Let us know the response!

Of course you're a paladin
---
You don't until ZG. Then you get the faster equivalent of the Devilsaur set (Bloodvine).
---
Honestly it was a blast even though your group wiped us in like 15 seconds flat lol
---
&gt; If you can 30 man MC with 58‚Äôs in the group

Perfect.  Instead of 40 players clear the raid, you can have two groups of 20 min/maxed players clear the raid and get double the loot for your guild.

Good day classic wow enthusiasts.

I'm playing a 52 dwarf rogue at the moment and have been researching the BIS gear and alot of them have hit rating. But since combat rogues get 5% hit already and expertise, wouldn't it be a waste to get all that hit gear that adds up to around 8%?
---
"So, I have this idea for a great movie. It's about two gnomes who find a bracelet of power, and they have to take it to the¬†Burning Steppes¬†and cast it into the Cauldron. They form the Brotherhood of the Bracelet. Along the way they're trailed by a murloc named Gottom, who's obsessed with the bracelet, and nine bracelet bogeymen. It could be a three-parter, called 'Ruler of the Bracelet'. The first part would be called 'The Brotherhood of the Bracelet', followed by 'A Couple of Towers', with the climactic ending called 'Hey, the King's Back!'"
---
Sure, but with a hunter that healere can do damage as well, while having to be less worried about healing.
---
Darkshore -&gt; Ashenvale -&gt; Stonetalon Mountains -&gt; Desolace 
---
is one way. I don't know if it's faster than
---
Stranglethorn Vale -&gt; Barrens -&gt; Stonetalon Mountains -&gt; Desolace
---
though. It depends on where you're starting from.
---
Im not jealous. Not at all üòÇ
---
There is no "horde territory" on Azeroth. The orcs literally invaded from another planet through the dark portal, and before the events of WC3, there was no horde like we know it now.
---
Proper way
---
Not since they fired half of them and pay the rest less than they used to in 2009.
---
Lol sounds like you never played BG. Pocket healer doesn‚Äôt mean shit if you get oneshotted. Not every class is strong even with a pocket healer.
---
Jokes on me there are no tanks on my server so I got 80 pre bis on my rogue and now my warrior is lvl 40.
---
This. 
---
Alternative is STV. Especially while skinning. Farm cats, raptors, and basilisks and gather every leather you can and sell it on the AH. Top of the map are the lower levels, and going down it gets higher levels, farm according to your level. At level 37-39 you can farm the level 40-41 basilisks, especially the ones at the south east part of the map, near a cave, that's a gold mine for thick leathers. Each run you should be getting \~100-120 heavy leathers and \~40-60 thick leathers. They amount a good money on the AH, and sell everything else with vendor. The grey drops stack to a good amount also, and sell green items you get on the AH. That's what I did levels 36-40 and got my mount right at 40.
---
Just dinged 34 and am seeing a lot of quests in stranglethron vale. First time wow player here, alliance warlock, and scared because of the memes. If i primarily play solo, is it even worth trying to quest in stranglethorn or should i just keep trying to do SM runs until 40 cause i cant get ganked once im in the instance?
---
Pay a warlock. You can get there in seconds.
---
Sure, but in themselves they are not all that special,  every class gets a lot stronger with a healer to the side, or a healer gets a lot stronger with a DPS to its side.
---
What. I'm a different user.

There is a warrior discord channel from wow classic live I believe that I copy and pasted the above from. Not sure how to link it via reddit and whilst on my phone...
---
Gotta take him out for with the Chuck Shot!
---
Play it if you want to. I was very upset about playing an elemental shaman, turns out they are strong af and I'm soon to hit lvl 60.
---
This time around we got more knowledge and 16 debuff slots right from the get go.
---
I wouldn't wear that at 51 not only does it not have damage stats it reduces my damage taken which means less rage which means less damage.
---
Or the Black Drake's Heart in the Badlands.
---
Well, for people who want to get their mound right at 40, and still need 60-70g for it, grinding is the only way to go.
---
Pet growl is so annoying. I tank dungeons as fury with a shield. I dont have a lower cost on sunder so I need rage yet this stupid pet takes one mob out...
---
Also for some reason I hate 2h arms warrior dps. They are so useless. Also so far all these warriors for some reason cannot help me pummeling cast. Like why are they even in battle stance, it makes no sense with tactical mastery.
---
Lifesaver. I will message them as soon as I‚Äôm back on my computer.
---
Mages were just warrior good back in the day. No stamina, no armour, hard to control charge machine, sunder and heroic strike = angry mage complaining about PVP balance on forums for a week.
---
At the level you can fist get it, the crescent staff from wailing caverns is actually pretty decent melee DPS even without the strength stat of a warrior.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6505/crescent-staff
---
It can easily do more damage than whatever wand you might have at that point, and sometimes you wanna save mana so go ahead and whack away.
---
If  [the Wowpedia article](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Parrot_Cage_(Hyacinth_Macaw)) is anything to go by, yes, this drop is *extremely* valuable. Good job!
---
That's not what I meant, there's no reason to really stay and visit 90% of the world, so the size loses its benefit since so much content has become irrelevant.
---
Mages don‚Äôt use consumables? You must be a new player
---
Obviously we don't know the exact numbers but talent trees were optimized by the end of vanilla and specs across the board did substantially more damage
---
If you don't believe that that 1.12.1 talents were more effective than 1.1 talents then okay we can start giong through the changes after I get off work but this seems pretty obvious that after 2 years of optimization they would have improved
---
I think Leeroy Jenkins says this exact thing near the end of the legendary clip haha
---
BM does better dmg as melee anyway, since your dmg is mostly pet anyway, the difference between being ranged or melee is negligible until rank 2 multishot
---
Spoiler alert, you can buy Classic gold for real money, just not from Blizzard.
---
I‚Äôm not Schwifty, I‚Äôm Crix. He‚Äôs a Guildie of mine. I just posted this since he‚Äôs not big into Reddit and it‚Äôs hilarious to me. 
---
Plus, I despise Paladins.
---
there is no conflag dude. read what patch we are in. the content is nerfed.
---
Gratz on getting it. Still need mine :( Don't wear it while questing since it's garbage for cat form but you are now god tank
---

I know, i allways play in a group.  But "give him gear and a healer and he is great?"  Oh come on, every class is great with a healer and gear.
---
Or they do and just do what they want
---
I rolled Warlock for the almost express purpose of tanking twin emps because fuck yeah
---
Will do! The rest of you stay over there

Keep on hoping your rend is dodged so you can overpower

I think it's called 'fifths'
---
Best customer service i've seen in a while.
---
Thanks. Yeah, only lt equips when i jump into bear.
---
This GM messaged me too! He gave me a warning even though I reported someone who was attacking. It didn‚Äôt make sense, so I offered to 1v1 him and he declined. What a wuss
---
Hahaha

Playing Alliance means a lot of walking, yes. Basically you either run from Darnassus, or, if you are already questing in Stranglethorn, you probably want to go Booty Bay -&gt; Ship to Ratchet (Barrens) -&gt; run through Stonetalon Mountains.
---
This has given me perspective on my hatred of Gnomer. I can act out my violent tendencies towards gnomes, I guess its great?
---
‚ÄúHorde never fight fair!‚Äù
---
Gives shown proof 
---
Still claims it wasn‚Äôt fair. 
---
Sounds Alliace to me.
---
Mix of quests and dungeons. Have not done one aoe grind!
---
Totally with you on this one, to me it seems like people always talk about addons how they shouldnt give any advantage but then stuff like this gets a pass.
---
For rets you can build +spell damage build and it‚Äôs perfectly fine to use cloth/leather/mail pieces for. Same thing with holy and + healing gear since you don‚Äôt get any bonus in classic for using all plate
---
Will try thanks!
---
Ignore but beware....
---
ahh lol my apologies
---
Is there an addon that tella you what defuff you got without you needing to hover over it?
---
I‚Äôm a die-hard Alliance fan because I like to root for the underdog, but I do realize that Horde is the underdog in RP... decisions, decisions.
---
I would LOVE to see the Horde side of the story in WoW Classic, I‚Äôm just not confident enough to RP as a Horde race. Troll would be my #1 choice, followed by forsaken, orc, and then Tauren, but I don‚Äôt know anything about them - what age are Trolls typically? What is their history? Those are things I ought to know to RP effectively, am I right?
---
and 30 of the fuckers.... lmao.
---
You should look into aoe grinding !
---
A random 60 war came all the way down from XR to help me with Weapons of Choice so my lvl 17 warrior could get that awesome demolition hammer.
---
And you are complaining about 1 rest worth of pots that probably means a lot more to whomever asked for them....
---
Suck it up an help out. Be thankful the next time someone else helps you out.
---
Have not been high enough for cath just yet, will be hitting 38 in 2 bars!
---
Played enough BG.  Just don't come and tell me that give a class a pocket healer and great gear and he is awesome.  Everyclass is that with gear and a pocket healer.
---
Will try it thanks!
---
The Bristol Pusher strikes again
---
Should have mentioned I'm horde!
---
Sadly it's working as intended. What you get when you cater to the #nochanges crowd.
---
I ended up accepting and dumping it twice, only to accept it for the 3rd time at like 4am, with barely any players in sight.
---
Even then it took me a good 15+ minutes, because I guess someone had picked them before me.
---
Shit I logged off after accepting that quest really hope it's not as bad as the tuskless trolls.
---
Then why even play on a PvP world?
---
You'll be fine. You might die, you might kill someone. At least it'll be an experience. Plenty of people on both sides to rally together.
---
Godmodding is mostly a problem if someone tries to fight in an RP, because dumbasses will just emote ‚Äú/em stabs you and you die‚Äù.  Proper etiquette is to describe what your character TRIES to do, and then a lot of the time you both roll to see if you succeed. People are way more lenient about silly shit like this.
---
Lol misread title, wear it for sure!
---
You're dead wrong.  Totem twisting with Nightfall is *the* reason you bring enhance shamans to raid, and it's the primary thing they spend their mana on.  If any enhance shaman is spending their mana on their very low personal dps instead of twisting for their melee group, they're wrong.
---
Some of the major changes:
---
Innervate is baseline for druids instead of being the 31 pt in Resto. Moonkin form didn't exist.
---
Survival was a melee spec.
---
Blessing of Kings is not the 31 pt. talent in the Ret tree for Paladins, insead of 11pt in prot.
---
Divine Spirit was 31 pt instead of 21, Holy Fire was a talent.
---
Rogues, Warriors and Mages didn't change too much. Warlocks talents didn't change too much but over half their skills got buffed in 1.5 (I think?)
---
Good advice thanks!
---
what do u mean
---
Draconian Deflector is better
---
They keep trying to sell it for 300g but no one is gonna buy at that price. People overvalue it like crazy
---
Hey. Have you already checked if the enchant stays if you switch from Benediction to Anathema?
---
Im too scared to test with mine.
---
All good. üòÄ
---
!RemindMe 16 hours
---
You can (or could) get a similar spec to old SV with MM in legion and it wasn't too bad, New SV was ridiculous fun in legion and very rewarding when played right, current form is apparently trash, but much simpler to play so :/
---
Fucking idiot GM.
---
Sure they are good,  Wouldn't say stupidly good, but give any class good gear and a pocket healer and they are good.   
---
Thing is, people are just using that as a saving grace for warriors.  Like oh they suck but give him gear and a healer and he is great, well, no shit sherlock,  think everyone would like that now wouldn't they.
---
For me it is only about making peoples life miserable if they somehow get in my way to do my quests, if its red its ded, if its green, agian ded with my warlock curse on his tagged mob(increase the atk of the mob)
---
sometimes it backlash but whatever, at least i try instead of waiting for monster spawn forever
---
well im an undead warlock. i am bad person
---
Healer is a nub then, 2H tanking is better than sword and board until the 40s-50s.
---
Being married doesn‚Äôt mean you stop being an individual, right? She has her hobbies, I have mine. Often we spend time together, but occasionally we take time for personal interests üòã
---
Wish she liked video games too, but since she doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll have to enjoy them on my own time.
---
It keeps them from gaining any rage from getting hit, which makes it hard to hold aggro.
---
Well if you stopped cutting down trees for your totems then the warden wouldn't show up. Damn Taurens.
---
Neutral AH for sure
---
In-depth WL guid? here you go:
---
1. Apply Curse of Elements
---
1. Cast Shadowbolt
---
2. Cast Shadowbolt
---
3. Cast Shadowbolt
---
If ever in doubt, cast shadowbolt.
---
Some questlines go really deep though. The defias one is a good example.
---
Imagine complaining that people organize and cooperate in a massively multiplayer online game.
---
The first thing that needs to happen is that blizzard needs to make a statement on the state of the game. Discussions of matters here are chronically muddled until blizzard weighs in.
---
No, the 9% hitcap is only for ur abilites, sinister strike, eviscerate etc but you can still miss your white hits which is your majority of damage.
---
I should say I am in the 40-50 dungeon range, so that was what the healer was referring to. Early on I just used a lot of stance dancing and only shield on the few hard hitting bosses in some instances.
---
Level 19 but i was standing in Goldshire :)
---
So what? It's levelling gear. Who cares?
---
Hey ranged taunt ain't no joke
---
I need to pick a rp server and faction.
---
What mod do you have for your abilities bar? Did you watch a specific tutorial to set them up?
---
Basically, you only bring one moonkin to a raid. Not as emergency healer or "dd", but to dance in front of everyone. This gives a raid-wide buff to morale.
---
Warriors need rage to use their abilities. They build rage by doing and taking damage. In a dungeon its mostly from taking damage. Shielding us starves us of rage. When we can't build rage at the start of the pull we can't get aggro. Without aggro there is no way to get rage to get aggro, and everyone dies.
---
Good to know, cheers
---
all mages do is press one button and it makes several. to fish i have to go to a certain location to fish for a certain fish and buy a recipe for 1g+. they‚Äôre not the same.
---
You are better off giving your NF to an off tank, totem twisting is at best a 4% increase for the groups damage done optimally and there is a very finite amount of time before they straight up cant do it any longer.
---
If you think you are being even half optimal being an enhance shaman in the group you are dead fucking wrong. Its a meme build and thats all it will ever be in classic and pservers have shown this time and time again.
---
Is there currently a way to learn Ritual of Doom as a warlock? I know that the quest for the ritual of doom spell won't come out until diremaul but is the green drop book Grimore of doom currently in the game or is there no way to learn Ritual of Doom as a warlock until phase 2?
---
That one doesn‚Äôt connect to stonetalon
---
We don‚Äôt do that here
---
Stockades is boring. Gnomeregan is long and boring.
---
Deadmines is amazing though. If I was forced to run a single dungeon over and over until I hit 60 (assuming all the mobs scaled with my level) it would be Deadmines.
---
Would I level faster as warrior by switching from arms and questing to prot and dungeon spamming?
---
Was this on Atiesh?
---
Its not bugged its just a spell effect that works like windfurry. One hit can proc and proc the next and next and next and next etc. It seems massively unfair but Windfury can proc in the same way and if RnJesus was on their side a Shaman could theoretically one shot a boss if they got lucky enough.
---
Did this one yesterday, there were 3 mages AoE farming the Satyrs - I just wanted to die
---
No such thing. It's the internet propagating broken English again.
---
Oh good to know. I thought you built rage with hits, not damage. I didn't know not taking damage would affect your rage generation.
---
So you can technically farm any mob at level 60 for an hour and get at least 13-18 gold, so this must be a joke or meme
---
&gt;Because you bring the spec that needs to be carried. You don't contribute, and you are only there because someone else wants your personality more than they care that you are pulling them down.
---
Wow, this mentality.  Who hurt you.
---
Mark a caster mob with a skull and let the DPS gank it by themselves, you just ignore it completely. Get aggro using sunder/revenge on 2 melee mobs, and then use concussion blow (stun) a 3rd once the dps pull aggro on it with their aoe. After the stun wears off taunt it and then start sunder/revenge on it. This way you will have solid aggro on 3 targets - any more than these 3 targets and you risk aoe damage pulling them off you.
---
Nah that was also there in vanilla.
---
Carry on then.
---
Long as you can live it‚Äôs pretty legit, ever since the demo shout nerf doing whirlwind and sweeping strikes with a 2h gives me roughly same amount of threat as tab sunder/revenge but with nearly triple the damage, especially if there is a shaman dropping wind fury. Key is to actually do it in defensive stance to give yourself enough survivability, using macros it‚Äôs possible to easily be in Berserker for less than a second to get your whirlwinds off.
---
Sorry noob question, how do you skin so fast
---
&gt;If you think you are being even half optimal being an enhance shaman in the group you are dead fucking wrong.
---
I don't. Nobody does.  But if you're going to bring one they better do the best possible thing for the raid, and that thing sure AF isn't personal damage.  I'll happily bring one of the lesser specs as long as they put the work in, farm consumables, and know the best way to contribute.  Totem twisting with Nightfall is far and away the best way for an enhance shaman to contribute.
---
Also it's really funny that you've tried to make this personal considering I never said I play enhance or even shaman lol.
---
mountain lion intensifies.
---
I'm not at all, I said for months here phase one content needed massive buffs, and that the rest of the raids would need them too.  I pugged MC yesterday and killed rag, 3 days after hitting 60.  Just think of that a pug killed Rag 4 weeks after launch...
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
This killed me lol!!!
---
No one made you click. You didn't have to open the post and be a prat. There are plenty of other things to get miffed over. This ain't worth your time.
---
Are rock elementals in badlands a good gold farm at 40? Or am I better off farming shellfish in desolace
---
Ive had a weird thing happen where I was able to vanish and cheap shot a mob without it resetting
---
There was a level 60 alliance mage just casting arcane explosion in there for hours. We ran armory most of the night and every time we left to sell/repair she was still there. That no life/high level thing swings both ways
---
AY'VE GOT THA BEST WIRES IN DA LAND!
---
Imagine bringing all that utility AND being a useful raid member by healing instead of auto attacking :p
---
Stone Talon. It's far less of a cluster than your other options.
---
Plus it's fantastic for all gathering profs which cannot be said of 1k for herbs or Ashenvale for ore.
---
And meat. They're vegetarians.
---
It's specifically for a bfa content patch.
---
in BWL you want Arcane/Frost spec. in AQ40 you want Fire (Ignite) spec. so when AQ40 is out, your guild is gonna do both raids every week. either suck at one, or spend 100g every week.
---
not that much fun, and imo it's incorrect to say "you're not supposed to be good at everything", because as a mage you are indeed supposed to be a good DPS class in every raid
---
If you want your mount at 40, you just have to grind but its way easier than people think. I made more tha enough gold for my mount between 37 - 40 killing tigers, gorillas and vasilisks. You don‚Äôt even need skinning
---
As horde: badlands/burning steppes area. 
---
As alliance: tanaris/ungoro.
---
MICHAEL!
---
Yea they're good, make sure to check out all spawnpoints incase one is contested by another player.
---
The trash they drop vendor for a decent amount, and then you can sell "Elemental Earth" on AH for a decent amount
---
DPS =/= attack speed
---
Isn‚Äôt cath 36-44?

  I usually tip half of what the water would cost me for the grind im about to do. I get it in sw ahead of time and lately with the grinds ive been doing i tip a gold or a bit less. My brother always tells me i tip to much, but its like buying from a vendor but half off and a player can enjoy the money. Win win. (Also my brother can rly say shit i bought his mtn and a epic 40 weapon and put fiery on it....maybe i am 2 nice).
---
You hope a guy loses his job because he hung up after an exploiter said "thank you"???

Good Lord that is some entitlement there
---
RP servers are amazing, for US there is only one option for a pure RP server which is Bloodsail Buccaneers, because it's the only pure RP server it ensures the population will always be high and healthy, both Alliance and Horde are pretty nicely populated with Alliance being slightly more populated, the community is friendly and helpful and because it's an RP server it has its own set of rules everyone must follow like naming rules
---
I highly recommend Bloodsail Buccaneers, great server, zero toxicity, no one running around with immature names, cities are lively with people walking around and socializing, it's awesome, if you do start out there feel free to shoot me a in game mail under the name "Broadin" and I'll hook you up with some bags and gold!
---
It really depends on the level difference and classed.
---
I feel like I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm strafe kiting properly when playing my warrior.  Obviously I know if it says the target needs to be in front of me I‚Äôm fucking it up, but I‚Äôm really not sure if I can tell a difference between me face tanking and strafe kiting.  Obviously once I hamstring there‚Äôs a difference, but beyond that I can‚Äôt tell for sure.  
---
Also, when leveling as a warrior, should I use 2H or sword and board?  I‚Äôve heard 2H is superior for leveling, but inferior for tanking content.  Is that accurate?
---
Nope
---
Feral druids were much worse than this back in the day.  Powershifting with Wolfshead wasn't really a thing back then, and no one knew about Gnomer weapon.  The current state of the game ferals are actually crazy strong, mid tier DPS with massive utility with 3% crit for group, innervate, and b rez.  Back in the day trying to get in raids as a feral was basically impossible.
---
Any update?
---
Hardiness - "when peon, me have bonk on head many times, now head thick, no more bonk"
---
As someone who can see both, I can confirm you made a good decision.
---
I feel that. With how tough work is physically I just cant play on work days. You're not alone
---
My Elf Rogue is level 13, I‚Äôm not sure what damage my weapons should be doing by now. I currently two hand two knifes dealing 4-9 damage. Does this sound about right? Where would I obtain/buy better weapons? 
---
Also, when and where can I learn to use a sword?
---
i must say my voidwalker seems to hold agro better than vanilla 
---
not that im complaining
---
Oi
---
Yeah I can't keep aggro on true aoe pulls, like 8+, but I can keep it on 4 without issue usually.
---
I'd have been much more likely to try shamans out if I found out they can tank
---
Why do you ask here and not make a post on the official forums?
---
The internet is rife with misinformation about memespecs. I've met maybe 1-2 shamans interested in healing or ele pvp, and at least 8 enhancement shamans by now.
---
I've been running Ele DPS since my friend group has a healer priest who is a decade more experienced and just flat out better healer than I am.
---
I place windfury totem for our tank and then pretend I'm being useful.
---
Split bone necklaces
---
Why is everyone bashing the GM? For all I know, the player who did the report could have been camping on the roof as well for a couple of minutes. In my experience people often tend to be very hypocritical like that.
---
You misspelled Brain Heal.
---
You need a macro that includes the command to set your pet to passive. The pet is still attacking for 1/2 second after you hit Feign Death so you need him to go passive before the Trap activates. 
---
I'm not sure exactly how it works I just know when you tell them to go passive they stop attacking sooner. I think immediately.
---
Normal dungeon runs will net you lower xp/h, however joining melee cleaves or 'tank' for spellcleave groups is usually better than solo questing. 
---
Neither demands you being protection though. So dont respec.
---
It's really not as bad as people say in my experience. Sure, you'll get ganked, but not often enough that it will cripple your questing. The main obstacle would be people camping nesingwary, but that usually clears up after 5-10 mins as people ask for help in /1.
---
Greedy goblins
---
That's not true at all they can still mass swarm people and skin if first because skinning is not tagged.
---
DPS is fun but being a tank would be so nice. You can find a group for any dungeon instantly.
---
Is retail even on Twitch? Couldn‚Äôt find it at all.
---
Sending it into a panic!
---
This, so much. Two guildies and I did a 3man SM Cath, slow and steady, b/c having two randos who "arrrmagawd just pull!!!" wastes more time than just doing it with 3 ppl.
---
AOE SM runs is the worst possible way to ruin your classic experience imo, there‚Äôs only that much content in phase 1, why rushing to 60 in the most boring way, what‚Äôs the fun in this?
---
For real what a fuckin nerd lol
---
he literally mentions that in the post. learn to read.
---
Two days later: "Wah I ran out of quests and have to grind"

---
This isn't rocket-science dude. 
---
If you're within aggro range of faction guards and those guards approach you and can initiate combat with you, then where you're at is in-bounds. Carry on.
---
If they can't? Then you're exploiting the terrain to avoid the guards so you can attack players without the guards being able to defend their faction members. Knock it off.
---
They obviously didn't put faction guards in the game for you to come up with ways to bug them out so you can attack other players with impunity. If there are faction guards present in a location then it clearly means that attacking their players is supposed to trigger the guards.
---
If you're in a spot where you're evading guards AND you're not leaving but instead attacking enemy players, you know exactly what you're doing and you should be thankful all you get up front is a GM telling you to fuck off.
---
Oh boy were you wrong! :p
---
Haven't, sorry. But I'm 99% sure the enchant stays.
---
Play what you enjoy yeah. People are laying into this guy for being a stereotypical hipster jerk.
---
Silk bags make a profit from buying the mats but mageweave don‚Äôt.

He doesnt care that they are asking, he's saying its ok to ignore them. try reading the post properly before commenting
---
Just keep questing. If you get any questions rewards or random drops that are better then use them. Don't spend valuable money buying something that you'll replace in a couple hours. 
---
Go to a weapon master in a city. You can ask guards for directions.
---
So as I was in the Searing Gorge, I was questing in the caves. I got my quest complete and was heading out when an annoying Dark Iron Slave aggros and keeps dazing me over and over. Aggravated, I killed it. And when I looted it, I realized he had the Warden Staff! We have a guild tank named Kleg, and he's a bear tank. We all knew he wanted this staff, so we all set up this little event for him. We quested for over an hour together to acquire the furbolg transformation item and then we led him to Stormwind Park for a druid themed event. Hope you all enjoy this as much as we did : )

Orcs don't belong on Azeroth. There is no argument to support their continued existence here.

---
You don‚Äôt think blizzard reads this forum? Get out a here.
---
Looks like someone was at the end of a shit shift and bowed out.
---
Honestly it depends when you go there. Some days stv was perfectly civil no real fighting, other days it was a fucking warzone. Go there give it a try if you get ganked a few times try somewhere else and comeback later.
---
I played wow since day 1. I know how the community was. Perfect, nah, but all those hours, and I wasn't ignored once. In classic I've been ignored 3 times already, and all 3 times have been laughable. Im not abusive or rude at all...
---
The game haven't changed, but gaming culture and culture in general sure have. Heck even the barrens chat have changed and for the worse...
---
Now I'm not saying you should never ignore someone, because that would be stupid, but there is something foul about this modern cultural climate where people love silencing others. I find it to be unsound, I usually never ignore people...
---
At least you know it'll come back for you eventually...
---
Basically, theres no stakes, most of the time its just incredibly unfair and one sided, wow pvp is great but in bgs.
---
I'm curious; what was your /played to 60? I melee cleaved as I said I would and reach 60 within the first week. Stop arguing stuff you don't know. ty
---
Couldn't you just kill him alone? Such a pathetic attempt to pvp
---
Bro I can change into a cheetah, it's dope
---
I get why but when I read parses I just kind of cringed and thought of retail.
---
Yes. Because he failed to mark the last line as edited.
---
so you were up there after all, as stated by your last sentence?
---
Yeah my autocorrect butchered that for some reason, thank you.
---
- I use the tukui client and install elf UI and skin through there as well as using it for keeping it updated. I don‚Äôt think you can get it any other way, I‚Äôm not sure though. Likely available for manual installation on their site.
---
On 2 mobs it can be more dps. Sometimes ill use it if I'm low on Mana and get a clearcast proc
---
For what it‚Äôs worth it‚Äôs happening to me and I don‚Äôt ever remember this happening in vanilla.
---
You think they do?
---
Yeah I have a macro, and it rarely ever works.
---
Finally. Thank you. I feel completely out of place when it comes to this because apparently I‚Äôm in the minority.
---
If Blizzard considers it an exploit... then either put an invisible wall to prevent players from getting there or allow the guards to shoot/teleport up there. Problem solved.
---
Running around telling people they cannot do X because it‚Äôs an exploit instead of solving the exploit just sounds wrong to me.
---
Hit is the most valuable stat until you get hit capped.
---
I was planning on going healer until I realized how much fun Shadow is. And we can still pull that solid C level damage. Good enough.
---
I spent a couple of hours on Sunday leveling fishing from 170 to 225 right next to Nat Pagel so I could grab the quest. I had plenty of alliance come and fish with me for a bit, one guy even bopped me over the head with his rod and /waved as he left. It was a pretty chill afternoon. 
---
I got ganked just as I got my fishing skill to 224.
---
It was almost poetic.
---
Obviously photoshopped *cough*
---
Only a little
---
I mean, I'm 99% sure I'm not going to be able to tank BRD and beyond, but it's been fun tanking low level dungeons.
---
Paladin is probably the best support, great buffs and great heals. Also very defensive and hard to kill. Everyone loves a good paladin.
---
Lol thats the point, in a 10s fight you want all the focus gone in a burst so  you can regen the focus and move to the next mob
---
Looks like video from the old days, still if there is demand for pearls that spot is pretty good, and rich thorium veins can spawn in that area too (land/water). Temple is part of a quest chain so some will end up there and kill some mobs, see the drops.
---
&gt;respected job
---
Yeah, being a GM is far from being a "respected job." They're paid utter shit for dealing with the worst parts of the player base day after day.
---
Can you please tell me how do you do the buble+heart combo? They both have same cast time and 1 sec cooldown between the casts so I always get interrupted in the last second of HS.
---
Courier 6 just wants a quiet life.
---

---
judging by the decrease of GM knowledge and service level, soon they will start conversation like ‚ÄúGOOD DAY TO YOU!! I am Game Master Koothrappali.‚Äù
---
"Hunter left"
---
I made that macro, works once out of 20 if I'm lucky.
---
True that, but uless you clearly see it is a guy 30 lv's above you you can still help your friends. That one ability might just go trough and swing the battle around.  And if he is closer to being like 10-15lvl's pluss you can do decent damage in many cases, and hit a good deal of CC's-
---
What is the chat command to write in third person?

Why, you wouldn't even know your own strength! Here you are, just trying to pet a wolf on the head and the next thing you know your razor sharp hands have sliced its head off!

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d82ddt/classic_wow_rant_thread_let_it_all_out/). 
---
I think it's too late. People have level 40-50 characters now, they aren't going to re-roll because of anything that Blizzard can plausibly impose, unless it's done in conjunction with a faction change with seems very unlikely. I think blizzard will just put their head in the sand unless it snowballs out to silly levels (90:10 servers).
---
Just got this axe. It was way easier to get than my attempts at the whirlwind axe. You need to ask for favors for the whirlwind axe, the process to the bone biter is smooth and you get a lot of gear going through SM in the process.
---
Neat, now be sure to give it to the guy who makes 60k a month who leads your cult for more epeen.
---
Wow, your innocent comment brought out the fucking retards. Imagine being elitist over a 15 year old game. Good Lord have these people really not achieved a single thing in their lives in the last 15 years?
---
&gt;This makes me hope Blizzard thinks long and hard about what to do after Classic and the horizon. 
---
This needs to make blizzard think long and hard about P2 and on.  All of the raids need to be buffed.
---
I‚Äôll have to keep an eye out for it if it happens again so I can get a screenshot. I‚Äôm fairly certain it was a caster because I kicked a mob that was casting right next to me and then immediately got destroyed. I looked at the numbers in the combat log but didn‚Äôt double check the mob name so I‚Äôll have to check it out again
---
ZT is the best damn server there is! Me and my GF are lvling up alts now  since our friends couldn't keep up. We're really focusing on lvling professions since we started with a few extra gold.
---
So keep a look out in Stormwind this week, we'll for sure give out bags and what not =)
---
I love how AOE isn‚Äôt being used but cleave is.  Also ironic because cleave is a melee term.
---
Can't expect them to put in more than minimum effort for minimum pay.
---
What does this mean tho
---
*floofie* :)
---
That's its weak point!
---
Kromcrush horde here, in my experience STV has been awesome, but definitely preferable (tho not necessary) to group with at least 1 person. 
---
Tons of pvp happens, but for the most part people aren't looking for trouble. 
---
If you enjoy pvp and dont mind the occasional corpse run then I think it's the best zone to be leveling zone between 30-40. Mob areas can be pretty congested though at times, depends on your server pop/what time of day. 
---
A lot of people I play with hate it or refuse to quest there but honestly it's such a quintessential zone I feel like not doing it is akin to wow heresy lol
---
Just read Rise of the Horde and currently reading Tides of War. The Orcs are giant dickheads no matter how you cut it. In RotH Durotan stands by and allows children from his clan to be tortured to magically age them up so the Horde will have a bigger army, and he's the most redeemable (orc) character in the whole book.
---
Yeah spriest off heals are sooooooooo nice due to VE. Frees up your healer enough to weave some dps in the mix too
---
By standard, combat swords is the best lvling build for a rogue. Do you guys recommend going all the way to 60 with combat swords build on a PvP server? Seems there's more dagger drops than any good 1h swords. Got a dagger \[Hypnotic Blade\] atm on my offhand due to lack of better sword drops and still got the Outlaw Sabre on main. Best regards, 36 lvl Orc. Lok'tar Ogar.
---
I thought this yesterday fucking around with a pally. Got him to blow a bubble and his o-shit heal. I thought it was funny until he stuns me just as a warlock walks around the corner and kills me.
---
i would kick you from group and put into blacklist for that.
---
Yeah the aggro range of the eye is messy. Sometimes you can go through a mob without pulling it and sometime you'll pull it from 15 yards aways.
---
Make sure to pull at least the first mob by standing next to it until you see it moving. After that it will be easier because your first mob will be pulling the others.
---
Fear ping-pong can be really useful while questing. If you need to fear something, but are afraid they will pull more, you can fear, then COR when they get somewhere dangerous, they will run back, then you can switch to another curse like Agony which will overwrite COR and they will start running again. Reapply dots and fears as needed. As long as your mana holds out you can keep them going indefinitely (Players will incur diminishing returns on the fear) Very nice for soloing elites.

Here's an example, just sitting in town switching into cat form I get two ticks of 21 before I reach full energy.  I've never seen a 19 energy tick personally, but the 21 ticks happen very frequently (maybe every 7-8 ticks on average).
---
That was so cool. I played a rogue back then and a GM once wished me good luck on not tangling myself in the shadows as a good bye. Me being a naive kid, i was shocked and looked around where he was hiding, knowing i play a rogue. :D
---
I tested this with my friend, and he still got rage from getting hit... Is it less or something? Cause he stopped attacking and his rage meter was clearly going up from taking hits.
---
Well dwarf Hunter is the way to go. 5 extra skills in gun. And that beard. Also storform is nice. But the BEARD
---
Reminds me of a fight in DAoC! Was a wonderful fight even though I died while the others lived.
---
What do you mean you don‚Äôt understand why he bubble Hearthed.?
---
Because he was getting smacked. Repeatedly. And did what most Pallys do when in the situation. Bubble Hearth. Lol
---
Yes... so when all the layers merge together every zone will be packed full several times more than in original vanilla, it's concerning
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
&gt;Gotta quest the last 10%
---
Only talking about that.
---
yeah i was wondering if i would make more just selling the bar after i transmuted myself. There is only about a 5g difference between the crystal and the Arcanite bar on the AH on my server. I am not sure if those are really selling like hotcakes yet.
---
Druids are much better at TPS (threat per second) which means they can hold agro better. This means the dps can go all out without having to worry about pulling agro off the tank. The druid themselves are more squishy and require more healing, can't use pots, can't parry etc so there is definitely a trade off. Warriors better at staying alive worse at threat raid has to hold back on dps, druids worse at staying alive, better at holding threat so raid dps goes all out and things die faster.

Competent people can earn higher wages, and that's expensive! To be competitive you must have each person in a position they're barely qualified for.

says the person rolling on the heavilly advantaged faction if your playing on the same realm. lol you're probly like 90% of the horde i see that run away when its only them and only come back with 3 more people.

hahaha thats the average wow GM alright :D

completely retarded.

What part of *"guards are supposed to be able to attack you or else you're exploiting"* is hard for you to understand?
---
I've played wow since 2005 and even I was caught off guard by how weak my rogue was at certain points while leveling him these last two weeks. Dual wield + no hit/bonus weapon skill = very weak character early on. Everyone saying do content 2-3 levels below you is absolutely correct. Also, do whatever you can to upgrade your weapons regularly. I realized half my issue around 35 was that I was using like a level 19 weapon. Even just grabbing the cheapest random stat level 35 green weapon (slow main hand, fast off hand) legitimately made the game 40% easier. One more bit of advice: find a way to get thrash blade asap. Beg borrow or bribe your way into a princess group as soon as you're eligible for the quest. That sword will happily carry you to 60.

For some reason i imagined someone at their computer with a massive pile of snacks and drinks either side. not a few dozen stacks of food in game.

that's how i felt in the early zones also

More ammo. And food

Shit you are way more efficient then me at leveling lol.

Brave of you to challenge the Barrenschat:

"Heroes! I present you this challenge, I--"

"GO F YURSELF, #ZUGZUG"

tweet them with it, best way to get a response/action.

Yeah but should go to MT or atleast a Tank
---
That sounds like the Orc way. My character is an undead and I like to think he's been finding skulls but pretending he hasn't so the fun never has to end.
---
Alliance without skills
---
Durotar is Centaur/Harpy/Quillboar territory though.
---
maybe you shouldn't talk if you play on the heavily advantaged faction. that actually lame
---
???  Dps wars are supposed to sunder as first gcd.
---
There is not many, if at all, Guild clearing MC with 20 people. 
---
Ony is cleared easily with 20 people tho. MC is for sure not. Even Onslaught, who‚Äôs NA 1st is not doing 20m MC yet. Pretty sure they‚Äôre doing 25man tho. However they‚Äôre elite AF.
---
Rather take the GMs word for it over this clown trying to get someone fired.
---
At high gear levels, it can be advantageous to fury tank because the tank will do more damage and output higher threat. This allows dps to do higher amounts of damage without pulling aggro. The tank loses the shield mitigation and will take a lot more damage, but if they have good enough gear, their higher armor will compensate somewhat.
---
Nothing against the pic this sub is just flooded with that kind of stuff
---
Is this a ~~Jojo~~ Warhammer reference?
---
But how do I make lots of the monsters aggro the eye? Do I have to run through or passed every single one? Or does it just take one monster to aggro me, that is further in to the dungeon than the rest, so when I aggro that one and it starts to run to get me, it will pull all the others too that he runs passed trying to get me, resulting in some kind of a chain reaction?
---
Don't they even have an email you can write to to report a gm?
---
Great guide! Highly detailed and informative. Thank you!
---
Sting ticks for 15s and its suuuuper efficient to use it on mobs when you level. A single mob while levelling should take \~15s anyway to kill. You just send pet, hunters mark, sting, and auto attack to keep your uptime. Hunter is great cause you never need to rest pretty much.
---
I tend to quest in higher level zones than my level, after sending my boar in, i do a sting, auto then aimed shot. Even with aimed shot, it never pull aggro from the boar, with cat you almost always will if you do it in the opener.
---
I feel like cat is super good vs anything weak, cause you melt it, vs anything strong, boar is very nice cause its armor will be better. I was already killing devilsaurs at 55 when i was in ungoro questing, my boar had like 5.6k armor, so mend pet becomes really worth.
---
In their spirit gear? ;)
---
I‚Äôd say 60:40. If had to guess.
---
I think the blood elf argument was that they are a mana hungry race, thats why it bugs me even more that they could play rogues.
---
The bigger issue you have to worry about is the bars jumping around in price. If crystals drop in price (they more or less have to, warriors aren't great gold farmers anyway) the bar will tank with it. At some point the market is going to correct downwards, and if you're holding a bar at the time you might lose 1-2 transmutes worth of profit.
---
I'd risk it for 8-10g profit, but if it's only 5 I'd just try to sell the transmute
---
lmao where is his mouseover pet attack at? :D
---
no guilds fit time schedule
---
I appreciate the kind words, thank you!
---
Grats on ding

I think he meant ‚Äúrespectful‚Äù, as in ‚Äútheir assigned job‚Äù.
---
we're better with guns
---
Reminds me of when I needed help from a GM to reset my password and I couldn't figure out my security question.
---
After doing all the checks and what not, he finally found it. We both had a good laugh at what it was. It's nice to see that sometimes they can be so relaxed.
---
It's not black and white, I don't want only 100% discussion, but right now this sub is like 90% memes, satire, and posts like ops. A healthy balance towards 50/50 would be better imo. Lots of good discussion gets drowned out in the low effort stuff
---
Omg, you are being a dick! Ignored!!!
---
Nah, that was the 3rd guy to ignore me.
---
1st one was a mage fighting a silver rare in the barrens. I asked for invite, but he declined and died. He then proceeds to curse me out and then ignore me. 2nd was someone trying to sell STV pages for 50s a piece, because according to him thats the AH price. When I told him the AH is closer to 5s, he ignored me.
---
The game is pretty much the same, but the playerbase and gamingculture in general changed. And I feel its changed for the worse. I still love the game, and most people I interact with are great, but this whole silence and cancel-culture has taken its tolls. Also I detest all those cleave dungeon groups...
---
Shit I always fill my quiver before I go when I get down to 400 I start getting conservative. I've a few times had to give another hunter who was meleeing arrows.
---
Very very rarely will it matter. There are some non elite mobs in scholo where I've had our 2 melee dps die and me the priest and mage had to melee a skeleton to death, it took forever. So there's one extremely random unlikely scenario where it will matter.
---
I'm surprised you were having issues with that quest, I've done it now with two characters and can also confirm on 100% drop rate. I would recommend dropping the quest and picking it up again (unless you've gotten far on the quest).
---
Cool thanks for your input!!
---
Yea I agree with you, why should you have to worry about your item disappearing because you joined a group.
---
Going up there and just being there isn't against the rules?
---
Attacking people when up there while avoiding guards aggro is what is not allowed.
---
Watching this as a warlock made me so mad.... like I thought it was bad when I was screaming why doesn't he sacrifice his voidwalker? Then he drowned.... A fucking warlock drowned... Like he fucking drowned guys.... He drowned.

Is that for real?

Grinding is required throughout the leveling experience of vanilla. No escaping it really. Luckily in classic dungeon grinding is very efficient and that is the perfect level for Zul'Farrak. Would recommend spamming as an alternative to grinding.
---
You may not of killed him - but you did defeat him.
---
I never understood why some players complained at this behaviour i always thought it was suiting of the class and fun for everyone.
---
literally the only relevant one
---
Thank you so much, i'm already doing better because of this post!
---
Wouldn't the wiki be updated?
---
Macros like this and with markers are a godsend for raids / team PvP
---
oh lord thats funny
---
When creating a character I went for a troll mage, because I thought I was mainly going to do PVE. But after doing world PVP I've realized I much more enjoy PVP and that I wanna focus on that instead. But I know undead is a better PVP race so Is it pointless for me to focus on PVP as a troll?
---
I used to raid like that and it was a blast. It also becomes necessary once all the raids are out since you still run all of them for BiS stuff. So if you're looking at a night of MC, Ony, BWL, and maybe some AQ if there's time, you'll likely be wanting to go as fast as possible.
---
TIL I nuked mountain lions too hard that all their blood evaporated from existence.
---
Since you have Mortal Strike you

want whichever has the highest damage per swing I think.
---
Slight correction, shamans get windfury totem on level 32

Wait, then what does their cooking trainer teach? How to make veggie burgers?

I'm struggling to find a group for ZF at 43 so I'm just gonna quest till 45. I'll be sure to check feralas, thank you
---
You mean compared to a year ago. Let's not disregard Blizzards customer service from then back.
---
SM is pretty good
---
As a general rule, if there's no ground path, mobs will evade. 
---
Mobs can't jump. They can climb steeper hills than players, but they can't go up walls or cross gaps. If your destination involved anything beyond "walk to point A" there's a good chance mobs will evade. 
---
Plus, you can just try attacking a mob and see if they evade. If you've played the game for a while, you probably already have a good sense of where mobs can follow and where they can't. 
---
But honestly, this isn't something GM's are actively monitoring; they respond to reports. That means if a GM is speaking to you, someone sent a report. In the OP's case the GM didn't pay attention, but if you're on top of a building so that guards can't get to you, expect to be reported and have action taken.
---
All 64 pixels are
---
You misspelled "being a priest, paladin or mage"
---
Phase 2 will add honor (rewards for PvP), but they don‚Äôt intend to add battlegrounds until phase 3. This means that players will have incentive to kill anyone who cons to them. But since there won‚Äôt be any BGs, the only way to do that will be to world PvP. Woe to any 48-59 trying to level when that happens.
---
You dropped the /s
---
As for questing: hillsbrad, arathi, alterac, stv/des
---
Yes, all 3 pixels
---
&gt; doesn't mean someone needs to poke your nose into it and provide you proof and explanation and the exact patch notes when it happened.
---
you actually do lol wtf you are on about. your fucking 15 year old memory is not relevant to any discussion. it wasnt nerfed. you were just bad and people had 1000000000x less knowledge than they have today. its pretty simple to understand.
---
As a melee, thanks to dungeon grinding I got 60 in the first week of release with Joanas times and server first in my class. Hunters and mages can of course beat a melee cleave to 60, but a good spell cleave will most likely still be better than any hunters if done right.
---
delay your visit till 38+ levels and you will be fine

South shore, desolate, stv, SM , ashenvale

Yes, the amount of pixel perfectly fits the Golden Cut

---
Gotta get that bag.
---
Questing wise 30-32 ish in duskwood and then desolace or stv. Otherwise dungeon grinding would be scarlett monastry like others suggested
---
Pretty sure there is an old 40 priest onyxia kill from vanilla retail back in the day.
---
So what your saying is he didn‚Äôt win but he reduced the severity of the negative outcome
---
I am also on the fence about RPing in classic as i have not done so in many years with retail, good to see there are good RP servers in classic. Anyone know if horde side is strong on any servers or is it mainly alliance?
---
Classic wow. A place to express fantasy racism.
---
Yesss Karen, name and shame that $13 an hour CS rep on social media. How dare they misclick/confuse two names and cost you literally nothing.
---
I like that pvp makes grinding more interesting since you could be attacked on any pull. But I can play at different times of day and enjoy playing alts so can switch toons if being camped. If that changed over to "attacked on every pull" and "will be camped, period" then I don't think I would stick around. 
---
I mean, if you have friends that's one thing but otherwise sticking around helps those members of the opposite faction who are targeting you. If it's this bad now what will it be like when they open up the pvp system and people start farming HKs?
---
can confirm
---
Yea, such a coward not getting ganked by 5 hordies.
---
True but also joint-best PvE healer and best PvP healer by miles.
---
Bingo.
---
Respective
---
WeakAuras would work well for that, but it can be kind of daunting at first to set up.
---
This new trend of people saying ‚Äòyou can do it so you didn‚Äôt break the rules‚Äô is super weird.
---
Never found the appeal. It takes no skill and to bully those beneath you.
---
Yes, please go to kargath, as a 60 i stay payin mages for ports there. When there are no mages im very sad to not be able to give them money
---
most glaring example is that bosses had way more armor now, so you actually needed to use some hardcore tryhard stuff (5x annihilator) to get the armor to 0, which is a huge DPS boost to raid. 
---
oh, and the melee cleave bursting out dungeons during all levelling? did not existed. mobs didnt died that fast and also dealt way more damage.
---
I have no issue with people trying to make money.  All I asked at the time was how much the reagents were before I got whispered by the rogue.  It doesn‚Äôt bother me that they were charging 60s, I just thought it was precious that the rogue put me on ignore.  I was polite throughout the entire conversation, they lied and said the reagents cost 40s and that 60s was fair, then I checked and found out it was 20s and told them and they put me on ignore.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care that a rogue put me on ignore, I‚Äôm never going to be in a situation where I need that rogue for a group.
---
This is fascinating to me on an academic level.  One of the things I was considering pursuing a master's or doctorate's in.  The small groups that form through various mediums, like video games.  Please keep me posted if a group forms.  Truth be told, you might be the first to make such a group.  I cannot recall any guild or clan in any game based on medical diagnosis.  
---
I wish you the best in your recovery and your search.

Spamming SM Cath.
---
Exactly my experience. I've had a total of 4 interactions with GM's, and every single one was very polite in that slightly cringy RP manner, and they've always ended with: "Is there anything else I can help you with?". But yeah, if half the staff was axed and the rest underpaid, I can't really blame them for the half-assery.
---
Yes haha
---
Were you wall jumping?
---
There are a lot of people out there who will point at this to exclude certain specs, so while you don't need it it won't hurt to have
---
Well it‚Äôs a private channel after all
---
Cool thanks! Sounds like it works well :)
---
What class did you have boosting you?
---
Damn son. I might do the same when I level a bit more, that‚Äôs a great idea. What server you on?
---
Where is the other one?
---
Fish iron lock boxes in dw and turn your catch into silk packs.
---
On Hydraxian Waterlords EU, the alliance enjoys about a 2/3 majority according to census addons.
---
Not so sure about other servers, haven't paid attention outside of my own.
---
So the aggro problem is real. How you handle is this.
---
You need 1 mob to agro you. Once u have atleast 1 melee running after your eye of killrog you use that mob to run trough other mobs = aggro.
---
For every pull you want to have health stone + voidwalker (for sacrifice shield).
---
Let the mages do some aoe first to gather all the mobs in nice stack.
---
Pop sacrifice, priest shouls also shield you. Get in the range of mobs (far enough for melee not reach you) and start doing some serious damage with hellfire.
---
Once mobs start dying and all of them are relatively low on hp use drain soul to gather shards to summon new VW and health stones.
---
You really need to define ‚Äúpointless‚Äù.
---
Is Undead better due to the forsaken passive? Yeah. Will it make or break your experience? Not at all. If you care about min maxing then go for it. There will be plenty of sub optimal races doing pvp so whatever makes you happy.
---
If you have had zero wipes that just means you‚Äôve had groups that don‚Äôt accidentally pull too much
---
It also turns you and your party party green.
---
Pretty much. Best for the horde of course as you can set hs at brill and be available as soon as group invites you
---
No, races make extremely small difference.  A good troll mage will still beat everyone worse than him/her.  Play what you like
---
Dishonorable kills is a shitty system and should never have been added, they removed it for a reason.
---
If you play on a PvP server you get to live with the downsides of having areas being raided by the opposite faction some times. That's just world PvP.
---
Also, Guards only prevent smaller group incursions, but a raid will absolutely destroy any town, even gadgetzan.

Mechanically how is it any different to aoe farming SM....or grave farming in ZF?  Its the same thing.  Just twice as fast.
---
I understand why they did it but it seems arbitrary as hell to say "this unintended aoe farm over here is fine.  This one over there?  Nope!"
---
"gotta go my zug zugs need me"
---
Should probably stick to SM spellcleave groups especially if aoe spots are stacked with other mages
---
Given the improvements in chat bots in recent years I wouldn‚Äôt be sure that was a human being.
---
No changes?
---
This is how it worked before.
---
/world channels are a pserver thing so #nochanges please, huh? :)
---
Of course not, wotf is usually only a big factor in duels, 1v1's etc but considering a lot of the pvp will be in battlegrounds, 10v10, 15v15 its not a dealbreaker by any means.
---
Nobbel87 as well as Bellular YouTube channels tend to keep on top of the lore aspect of things, I haven‚Äôt played since Cata and I‚Äôm pretty up to date.
---
The layering exploit is kind of that big mechanic lmfao
---
Sure, most people probably also have hobbies, like... gaming?
---
Get Sword of Omen from the quest Into the Scarlet Monastery. That is a good stopgap. At level 37 (if you can find a group at that level) you can get Vanquisher's Sword from the quest Bring the End. It is slower than Omen so a better MH weapon.
---
After you kill the first one. Start the stopwatch. After 7 mins they will have spawned again
---
That gm would command more respect if he openly admitted his mistake and apologised instead of acting like a 12 y/o twat. 
---
Send the screen print into blizztard, see if it gets his knuckles wrapped.
---
but why would someone be so picky with their murloc heads
---
Use the raid icons to focus mobs down if you have trouble with group aggro, it‚Äôll be something you‚Äôll get better at with practice :)
---
Accusing people of being bots? That sounds like something a synth would do!
---
Of course it's not. The only thing you will be missing out is WoTF and that is like one tool out of 50 in your arsenal. Unless you really want to push beyond the boundaries of what's possible in PvP - you're ok staying as troll, but even if you have to skill to push them, you will be fine as troll.
---
&gt;tank pulls regardless of party mana
---
I felt that in my fucking soul.
---
Meanwhile "Leveling with our guild!" :P
---
Layering shouldn't even exist and this wouldn't have happened without a broken fucked up system interfering.
---
Depends... do you want lore and exploration or do you want levels? 
---
Grinding SM is great for XP, money and loot. Questing is the way to go if you like to immerse in the world as you'll visit four or five different zones and get a lot of questing done.
---
i never knew about this %t  wtf
---
That's the wrong kind of spelunking.
---
In vanilla the item would've still been there because layering didn't exist. Are you daft or high?
---
I mean, yes, you are right. But what are you trying to tell us here?
---
Wait for people to get gold then sell it for an obscene amount.
---
Ah playing on Shazzrah I see.
---
You get a properly working AI that doesn't just blindly follow a single dude?
---
Are you Horde? My son quit Earthfury after complaining how awful it was getting groups. He showed me last Friday around 2:30 PM there were 9 people in Deadmines and also 9 in Zul'Farrak. That was when he rerolled.
---
You can kill him at almost any level. Just kite him into town and he goes down quick. Did it a few times on my ~24 hunter.
---

They are asking you to summon and find 2 helpers.

Just ask for 5g or what you think is reasonable for that effort. If no one is around just don't lol
---
Summ pls
---
There was a dude on Esfands stream the other day who said they had a paladin as top DPS on Gate.
---
snitches get stitches and frankly its a shame he didn't ban you.
---
Lvl 39. 73 gold. Want to get my mount and respect to shadow at 40. Best place to do this? Swamp of sorrows might work but is there any other places?
---
The game developers are huge nerds. No doubt some of them were reading the series. Don't think Tirion Fordring is a reference, though. Metzen probably just liked the name or, potentially didn't even realize he was copying the name when he wrote Blood and Honor in 2001.
---
Kromcrush was right near 50/50 when the population was posted last week
---
This is how it worked before. \#noChanges means also: The one who owns the channel can do whatever he wants to do with it.

LookingForGroup is the blizzard controlled channel that's supposed to be used for basically what world gets used for.

Don't think they're actually vegetarians (cooking quest in Teldrassil gives Spider Kabobs, for example), they just don't farm meat.

lol this sums up warrior leveling so godamn well
---
Iirc, this was a fake pic.
---
SnD, expose armour (for elites or higher lvl mobs), evis, from memory anyhow
---
2h warrior tank is extremely cursed
---
I can see Titanpanel and Bartender. Not sure about the map or party frames.
---
No str or AGI? Looks like vendor garbage
---
If I understood the GM correctly, it's not an issue unless you do it *specifically* to avoid the guards. But I might be wrong.
---
Did anyone actually get it yet?
---
I stopped at legion and this would be really cool.
---
If someone needs, then doesnt equip. Add them to blacklist. Its better than stealing items from people and being the bad guy yourself.
---
I suspect that a lot of paladins are either traditional ret, 21/0/30 or 21/8/22, even if they mostly heal. The content that's out currently isn't hard enough to justify a full healer spec, and for whatever flaws ret has, it sure kills a lot faster than holy does.
---
And I guess the Dwemer in Elder Scrolls
---
I began during the vanilla beta and didnt know this either. This will help in my RP
---
keep on trying to hit the enemies as long as there is dodge, parry, miss, dodge
---
If you want to stay in the area you are clearly not going to bubble hearth, most of the time you are just trading the bubble for the corps run.
---
welcome to 21 days ago. Yes its true.
---
That's some socially inept behavior.
---
I thought this was meant to be tuned to 40 man? Something can‚Äôt be right if 24 people are beating it haha.
---
Ironically grinding hydroxian warlords rep.
---
Mid 40s. DPS is fine. Mana is terrible. If you love wanding you're gonna have great time.

My brain is off.
---
Druid Bugs are insane anyway.

Waterform getting canceled on surface.
---
The Energy ticks.
---
Delay on Furor talent and wolfshead helmet
---
Noggenfogger not cloaking shapes, etc. :(
---
You don‚Äôt have to stop leveling to farm gold. You can actually level faster while farming gold if you can chain pull yellow mobs or a mage with improved blizzard
---
Wand damage isn't enough to classify as DD - you will burn through your mana quickly and pulll aggro like a tank.
---
You will need one Shadow per raid to boost the warlock DPS, though (with the stackable debuff).
---
oom all the time
---
Otherwise good advice, but what's stopping the person slacking in OG next to the flight master from accepting the summon and running off toward the horizon without paying?
---
So before a BFD run, my priest PUG friend accidentally started this elite escort quest. We left the orc to die and braved the dungeon. On returning. . . he promptly started it again.
---
I liked it.
---
Warriors are a very hard class to PVP with BUT one of the most rewarding.
---
I had a very well geared DW Fury warrior in Vanilla and constantly did BGs and WPVP.  I dominated the piss out of a lot.  Being dwarf allowed me to break blind.  However, DW is sooo dependent on gear.  I had felstrikers for PVP.  A dagger that give the next 3 hits as guaranteed crits randomly.  I also had BWL gear and weapons.  
---
Leveling as a warrior is good if you have a healer to run with.  No other combo is more fearsome.  Level arms as warrior.  Go for that 2h damage with Mortal Strike.  DW Fury is absolute dogshit before 60 and even then you need a lot of hit and crit.  
---
Warriors can be good at PVP, but if you want survivability, look elsewhere.
---
Herod Ally here and I can confirm that it is pretty rough. Hopefully the faction balance gets closer to even one day.
---
Hes deleting a mount. Mounts are xpensive
---
Easy times leveling solo and pvp beast
---
&gt;raid leader
---
No, you want someone who's in the back with a good view of the fight and an overview of the group, not someone with a screen full of the boss' left toe-nail.
---
Raid leaders are usually ranged dps or healers.
---
Most of it comes from vendor trash.
---
That is not the classic ticket experience.
---
Shadowform is cool
---
He was, but that isn't against the rules.
---
I must have missed the patch that nerfed shamans so that they have to wear cloth instead of mail and shield
---
pretty sure it means that a player died once again
---
Is there anything special in-game about RP servers, besides the obvious rules to RP and such.
---
Anger issues, teen, or both. Hard to discern.
---
i always let trade chat know not to buy whenever they spam it but they just make alts to circumvent that
---
?he was just doing his job, no need to insist. When ?he realized that you where the reporting player just went on with h[is|er] job
---
I Rp'ed between WotLK and Legion, and I never knew it either
---
The UI is 'GW2UI'. The arrows and healing is done with 'HealBot'. That is a really awsome mod for a healer. I dont have to target people, and i only click on the playerbars. Target will not change. Main click is Heal, Cltr click is Renew, Shift click is Flash Heal, Alt click is shield. So i can do most of the healing with those. If i need to heal less i pick the lower ranks manually. Damage and heals meters are Recount and !Details. Invisible: Leatrix with alot of gameplay enchancing features. That is basically it.
---
We should all try and use /join dm /join sm /join strath to keep it clear. But thats only working if everyone is doing it.
---
So... it will never happen.
---
Want good employees, gotta pay more.
---
I'd bet a solid dollar the actual problem is the number of GMs blizzard has on hand isn't nearly enough to cover Classic's demand.
---
A rushed inconsiderate job without investigation sounds like "I have 15 more tickets to clear in 10 minutes or I don't get lunch today."
---
Hey, check my previous reply!
---
I just feel like there's been no posts about people actually getting banned from this. At least not on this subreddit. The only post I've seen was like 1 day after the announcement, it was a image of a e-mail that said 1 month suspension. But that's pretty much it.
---
Yup!

Don't duel a GM; They have a kill player button.

The Light abandoned the humans of Lordaeron before they were pressed into service as the Scourge. Why continue in service to The Light now that they've been freed and joined The Forsaken?
---
You literally just have 1 long cd as ele and that‚Äôs either EM or NS.
---
What are you even talking about lol
---
Second this, we did 14man MC clears in AQ40 gear. Without breaking a sweat. Like fast clean clear without use of any specific classes/setup/potions etc.
---
BY THE LIGHT OF ELUNE!!
---
Yeah people are pretty stupid about that sort of thing, they get blinders on and don't even see how they're shooting themselves on the foot. Questing in classic is just grinding with a built in stopping point. Go to area, kill everything, it'll get done on time. Time spent on mount wandering around a mob zone is XP lost.
---
The other problem is people completely ignoring bears or paladins, which are fine for dungeons. But people assume because you don't raid with them you don't play with them full stop.

I submitted a ticket when our tier 0.5 quest bugged and the cage wouldn't open in the baron run. GM rocked up and I'm like "can you see the closed cage" while I was standing next to it. Response was "yes but I don't believe a night elf will fit in there".
---
Amusing, even if they ended up saying "yeah do it again kthx" for the resolution.
---
Why would I need to kill the extra mob and not you?
---
Pawless Tigers (Barrens)
---
Bloodless Mountain Lions (Hillsbrad)
---
But my fav is the cave of Yetis in Hillsbrad where you can massacre every last one to find no rod.

These guys try to play it off but I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre working for the other team.

Can I still call mods gay if I apply?

But, honor?
---
Correct me if I am wrong (It has been a while) but arent the Draenei to blame for everything if you really think about it?
---
They decided to land on Draenor which in turn brought the attention of the Legion down on the Planet and the people on it.
---
That and the whole Shadowmoon clan business could also be put to blame on the Naaru, which would not have been there if it was not for the Draenei.
---
Once again: Correct me if I am wrong but this is how I remember it more or less.
---
That does not excuse the Orcs though, they are still jerks.
---
Please feed that back, that's just ridiculous.
---
Someone is being paid to do that.
---
In a game that isn't classic wow...
---
I am pretty sure it's because of pronunciation. "Rouge" is much closer of pronunciation than "rogue". Tbh if you have never seen correct way of spelling rogue, then rouge makes much more sense.
---
Ya use it on an alt. It's too low level in the 30s for a twink item. Now if it was upper 30s use as a twink I would say keep it till the next phase then sell.
---
Sell it. No one is going to take another mage over you because you're not sitting on Freezing Bands.
---
Charge, Demo shout, thunderclap, sweeping striktes, whirlwind -&gt; most of those fuckers are now glued to you... Til they slowly go on their journey to the Blizzard mage....
---
Addendum: in case it's new information to you, druid shapeshifted dps is entirely unrelated to the dps of your weapon.
---
&gt; Azeroth will be there when you get back.
---
Pfft, they said that last time, then you turn around and Deathwing's just destroyed the place!
---
Yeah it seems like lag, also it's fun to see if you can get to whoever you needed to get to before your mount vanishes beneath you.
---
Really, it's a a feature when you think about it.
---
If you reached Winterspring you should know by now..
---
AcKshUalliE you knOw to maHshimize dEEPS you need to wash your poopsock 3x a day!

My point was the "rotation" is boring as fuck and wasn't meant to really inform OP about max DPS, there are guides for that and that's not what they were asking for anyhow.
---
This is America, dont get you slippin up
---
I just kill the mobs i need because i do not practice killing for sport... Sheeesh. If the ranger asks me to kill 10 starving hulking lions, i don't go and kill 10 turtoise as well. Maybe that's why the lions are starving, we overkilled their natural prey. I'm bummed how people think only avout themseleves and never at the consequences they do to the enviornment.
---
Yes but you would expect at least some posts from friends or guildmates exposing some of these people. There was a post here when the announcement was made from a guy who had people in his guild who had exploited this. He would update if anyone actually got banned. So far they have got nothing.
---
This
---
No thank you, fire is just more fun to play. Not every mage has to be a blizzard spambot.
---
Classic was never hard, people are just starting to take off their rose tinted glasses.
---
I've always be proud of Blizzard//wow gms. They always do jokes and try to be super gentle, I really like them. Looks like last days all has change..
---
I am very curious what the solution to this will be. I started on Bigglesworth when it was low pop at peak hours thinking I was dodging the population issue, but it's now also a full server. Am I supposed to abandon my guild that I like and my server friends and take my 50 levels of progress to a new low pop server?
---

Sadly, VT was only introduced in Burning Crusade. Also, WTB Mind Sear T\_T
---
One time, a noob asked me for a gold. I sent him out to the Barrens to collect 10 Dusty Kodo Scales (a grey drop from kodos). I got a whisper about half hour later that he couldn't find any as he had gone to Mulgore and the kodos there don't drop that item. 
---
The moral of the story is that you should always read the quest text.
---
People have fun on retail!?!
---
Damn nelf druids, always there when you don't need them.
---
STV is where the horde plant the seeds of vengeance in the hearts of the alliance. They f‚Äôd with us too much when we were lowbies... 
---
Must say though, on Bigglesworth, the horde is way more organized in world pvp :( Gotta give em props for that.
---
Ya, that was very popular in Vanilla!
---
You can‚Äôt train weapon skill in PvP
---
&gt;Waterform getting canceled on surface.
---
Well it has kinda always done that (and still does on retail). Super annoying but I think it's just way how game handles in/out of water.
---
millions of boars
---
Nothing tbh. Civil agreement. Scum bags get /ignore and you lose a few min of time and a free reagent or gain some money.
---
How about the community learns to problem solve on their own rather than involve Blizzard.
---
This made my day üòÇ
---
Not necessarily much better, but do full AH scans whenever you got some extra time / are about to go make a sandwich / crack open a drink or something. If the item pops up during one of those, it should be logged by the addon and you can at least see what one has been up for before (although seeing an item a few times does not mean it actually sold for that amount - I can put up Moldy Gorilla Hair for 100 gold, but doesn't mean it's worth more than the 2s from vendors).
---
What?
---
There is plenty of great mail gear with Stam spellpower and spell crit.
---
If (big If) you plan to play ele in raids ofc you take the damage optimal pieces which often will be cloth and no board.
---
If that‚Äôs the way you gear for pvp my god no wonders you got problems vs melee
---
Perhaps, altho seems pretty clear to me that if you kill the same boss minutes apart once or twice it's accident. If you do this repeatedly it's not.
---
Sell it ! You want 2x Ring of spell power from mc.
---
(Can drop from 4 different bosses)
---
HAHAHAAH #truth.
---
The xp per hour isn‚Äôt even the best part. You can have 500+ gold by level 60 if you do it right
---
Why are you even surprised, they are obviously night elf druids on nogg. They don‚Äôt have horns.
---
Didnt every Alliance race (and Horde) invade Troll lands?
---
They "chose" this patch because that is the one they had the data for.
---
Watch the new GM reply to you like " We just want to inform you that giving a player a warning for an exploit he didn't commit is poor standards for a GM...please perform your job better."
---
Found the Mage. ;D
---
Paladins are the best leveling dungeon tanks tho so there's that.
---
The /p is said right at the start of poly's cast right?
---
That's literally what I said.
---
The population on Arcanite Reaper is low but at least it's balanced. You and your guildies should think about jumping over to there. I bet they will open up free transfers again because the plan for now at least seems to be to squeeze the players off the megaservers by reducing layering and *increasing* queue times to encourage people to move. 
---
Adding a balancing mechanism to prioritize players in the minority faction in the queue would have drawn howls of protest. So it's easy to see why Blizzard didn't go that route but there was no excuse at all for announcing that BGs would be cross-server. Otherwise there would be more of an incentive for players on the dominant faction to allow their opponents to level up. The fewer level 60s on the smaller faction the longer the BG queues of the larger faction would be. 
---
That as an unforced error. BGs weren't even coming out with launch so if there was some problem with restricting them to single servers they could have simply changed it later. Just dumb.
---
But you literally admit you were up there in you last sentence, before you said you didn't even go up so you were lying...
---
you have to have your pet stop attacking too. Never failed for me once.
---
&gt;Also slow wep 2.6 speed or more will proc crusader more often which means more threat again
---
Doesn't Crusader have a fixed ppm?
---
It's not the prettiest of the zones but its active. I prefer chilling on Thunder Bluff or Thousand Needles.
---
Is this Runescape?
---
Problem is the max dot amount of a boss is 16. So it doesn't matter if you are good or not, you are gonna use 3 of those dot places as a shadow priest. Just having 3 warlocks and a warrior is enough for the dots to start overwrite themselves.
---
In my opinion they should remove the cap or atleast increase it, as it's one of the main problems with vanilla Raiding.
---
I know.  But what i point at is that a warrior is only good with a healer.  Without one he rappidly drops down, much more so then other classes.  You don't get magically great at lvl 60.  
---
It is rather unfair for those who believe that.  First off you will need a ton of gear, a healer friend, and well hope the warrior player him/her-self is up to par.   Unless all those things are filled, the warrior is realy not a difficult foe to take down, be it in PvP or PvE (by a mob). 
---
The reasons it levels slow, translates to PvP as well.  No healing, gear dependant.  And that only gets aleviated by a healer. 
---
Just that a warrior and healer gets a bit of an edge over other comboes, isn't all that wowy.  What my point is, is that every class gets better with a matching support and gear. But the warrior is  just so much more dependant on it, that it as a class alone is not all that strong.  It is a class that swings a major lot from absolute shite, like going on crutches when alone and poorly geared, and only when you finally get good gear and a healer then you can be a badass.  But so can most other classes.
---
*only if the guards would have otherwise aggroed to you. So attacking from atop buildings in places with no guards is allowed.
---
Congrats!  
---
Saw you guys spamming in LFG all yesterday.  Nice to see more people on the server getting into raid content.  No fun when it's just two guilds doing everything.
---
Silks not worth that much lol.
---
One 5 lvls higher than me just snuck up on me when I was fishing... was half asleep so I could react fast enough to equip my daggers. Can‚Äôt do much with fishing pole. Felt sorry for him. He‚Äôs a douche and I‚Äôll find him later
---
Not sure.  
---
I'm selling skins to vendors, because on AH they are for almost for same price.  
---
Too many people are leveling with gathering professions, market is oversaturated with resources.
---
For those that run COMPLETELY solo and dont wanna use an Alt to logout/reset instance. 
---
BUT if you obviously have a buddy that can reset it for you after a logout, when you login you'll pop back at the entrance to the giant pool at the start just like if you were to use the sceptor for a portal with a fresh instance! Happy Hunting out there :)
---
forgot the dynamite
---
Yup, had a horrible GM experience recently. Opened a ticket because I show up on my friend's friends list but he doesn't on mine and can't receive any friend requests from me.
---
So far I've been through 5 different GMs, two told me there's no problem and it's supposed to work that way, one told me to reinstall which I did and the issue was still there and then another told me there's no problem again even though the previous GM acknowledged there was and now I'm back to square one.
---
And my point was you present so much misinformation on the most fundamental ‚Äûeveryone playing 1 week will know better‚Äú level, that you should realy think twice before giving advice to people and making it worse for them.
---
Flame shock 4x Lightning Bolt Flameshock WHaT?
---
How proud can you be to be an asshole. 
---
I guess upload a youtube video + reddit post proud. 
---
inb4 "It'S a pVP SeRvEr" :     This is not pvp.
---
Should be zero guards on PvP servers tbh.
---
Tell the priest to not shield you unless they have to.  No rage from shielded attacks makes starting a pull with a shield really really bad.
---
I think over 2.6 it‚Äôs 5% under it it‚Äôs lower. That‚Äôs why you enchant agi on ur fast tank weps.
---
Happened all the time in vanilla.  Don't care.  Don't roll PVP if you don't want to die from other players.
---
Patchwerk, which was widely regarded as the ultimate vanilla dps check, has an enrage timer of 7 minutes. Guess how fast those private server guilds can kill him when they min/maxed (like what people claimed naxx was about?) 2 minutes.
---
Druids have the only battle rez, and can off tank and off heal in a pinch. Can really help stop wipes from happening if you‚Äôre good. Pvp wise druids are the hardest class to catch, and are kings of wsg.
---
People did this quite a lot. Any word if Blizzard handles this as exploit and takes actions? Of course it's not super obvious that  it should not work like that.
---
Got one as well. Someone posted theres on AH for 275g and it didnt sell, saw they reduced to 250g now. Banked mine hoping its worth more later..
---
Whaha, could have been my wife that you met \^\^
---
I've been leveling on Smolderweb and its been a great community, west coast pst server.
---
They made them harder, not by accident, by design because of how easy it was for most people.
---
This was my exact look in 2006, honestly made me laugh.
---
Someone want's to play WoW, but has extreme arachnophobia and want's to know if theres a way to avoid exposure to spiders in game.
---
Seemed pretty straightforward to me.
---
You know you could level and make more money questing. 2 birds 1 stone
---
Cock and ball GM
---
This isn‚Äôt not always true. Good employees know they are good, and know what their goals and ambitions are. Do people want to stay in help desk for a long time, especially if they are over qualified? Think about it. 
---
Those guys have to put their own goals aside for something from the company, especially if they are the best employees.
---
Give me the link. Now !

In Classic there's no API that return threat values, so we don't have 100% trustful source of info.
---
So picture this:
---
South-shore Mines in Tarren mill.
---
* (me) Shaman, solo, just ressed, no totems up, no buffs to share
---
* Aoe-ing mage strolls by with 6-8 mobs in tow, one more mob just spawns and proximity-aggroes the mage. 
---
* I seize my chance and snag the tag on the fresh mob with a instant cast shock. 
---
* Success! I snag +tag that 1 mob. 
---
* Mage dies
---
* All the 6-8 mobs that were on the mage (gray tag) now swarm on me ...
---
* I die ...
---
* ???
---
Yea what‚Äôs with the asshole GMs I was posting dungeon group advertisements and a guild reported me for doing it 3times and a GM looked into it and gave me a 2day chat ban. The only thing I learned is you can‚Äôt play the game without communication and GMs are assholes
---
I have legitimately no idea what point you're trying to make here... are you agreeing with me? Not? Making some other point.
---
Sorry I just don't know what you're trying to say.
---
My shaman is wearing half str/agi pieces and half int/spirit pieces because I take what I can get and I need every stat because my enhancer is half a caster. I‚Äôm fighting with an int/spirit staff because it has high dps. That‚Äôs how Classic is.
---
In the end in dungeons I‚Äôm oftentimes a healer anyway and the times I‚Äôm not, I still keep an eye on the group to help out with heals if necessary.
---
I see some friendly competition here. I like it!
---
You may hand out bags but you do not have Urmagh's high quality bags! ;P
---
Awesome to see other people enjoying supporting new players aswell!
---
Ravager easily, for dungeons, you should however keep another weapon for solo-questing
---
Are they helpful in a dungeon when you need them there for dps?
---
Keep in mind that if she ever tries PvP that one of the hunter strategies is to use a spider pet specifically to take advantage of people with arachnophobia.
---
I reached level 40 yesterday. So far it seems to me that there are more quests than I can do. There are entire zones such as Badlands that I haven't had to visit. I never went to darkshore, ashenvale or swamp of sorrows.
---
On the other hand, I had two characters in vanilla get stuck at about level 49 where I couldn't figure out what to do besides grinding mobs, and I gave up the game, never reaching lvl 60
---
It put his account under automated monitoring too.
---
I wonder about that too. Its very odd too because most dps warriors give 0 fucks about not pulling threat.
---
I have very low standards for groups so it doesnt bother me. It is very strange though.
---
That might be it! Kind of annoying considering I don't play BFA...
---
Hi I am leveling a warrior tank. Question for the weapon speed of the tanking weapon.
---
Is it more beneficial to have a faster weapon, so I can hit more enemies faster with autoattack while tabbing through the mobs? 
---
Or do I need a slower weapon which generates higher threat due to high damage values?
---
Or does it not make any difference at all?
---
Good thing i don't have any friends who play WoW. Otherwise i would be playing horde on a normal server aswell and could not focus as much on professions and taking it slow. :)
---
I‚Äôm not the streamer... he just sent it to me and I thought it was some funny hijinks
---
Well yeah but that's explicitly a Classic addition so no big surprise there. Imagine if we found out mind controlling some trash in Naxx let you one shot 4 Horseman or something ridiculous, and it was there in Vanilla the whole time just no one found out about it. Or if there was some weird interaction with a lowbie weapon (like MCP) that meant you could stack +10,000 healing and it was better than Atiesh.
---
Don‚Äôt be surprised that he saw you on the box and thought that was an exploit. You‚Äôd be surprised how clueless some GMs can be and in my years playing I‚Äôve only had the displeasure of meeting one. All the other gms I‚Äôve had have been super helpful/professional.
---
I would make another ticket especially since this guy went ahead and gave you a warning for something you did not commit, hell id chase that kind of thing till they apologize and remove it.
---
Dang! Does turning off the battle.net launcher help her??
---
Yes, originally the Eredar were such gross weirdos that Sargeras decided no universe that housed the Eredar could be allowed to live and decided to destroy everything.  There were no non-weirdo Eredar, i.e. Draenei.
---
Well, the next raid is BWL, and the second boss is infamously the guild killer boss because many guilds couldnt get past him back in vanilla and broke up. His enrage timer is 3 minutes, and modern private server kills have done it in as low as 30 seconds.
---
Those fights are great, and really give a bit of faction pride, and building bonds with players, be it friend or foe.
---
I have a Windfury Totem and Arcanite Reaper
---
In my experience; trying to focus completely on one role is a bit pointless, there is always another class that do whatever you do better. However you are probably the most flexible and adaptable class.
---
In dungeons, you simply switch role on the fly for whatever is needed in the current fight. Unless you're the main tank, or main healer I guess. So I guess only if you're there as DPS.
---
In PVP, I have quite a bit of success, because I always get underestimated. Mages in particular have no idea what to do when I can break free from Frost Nova, and I'm immune to Polymorph. Late game raiding, everyone will force you to heal though. Although I have raided as cat and kept my DPS on average or above.
---
I looked through old forum- and blog-posts and only found indications that it's proc-per-minute, so weapon-speed is irrelevant in this case.
---
That would be absolutely splendid.
---
many of these aren't bugs but actually exactly how the game was...
---
Cenarius and the Nelves started it though.
---
I think it's the same on most big servers honestly, my server Firemaw (EU) had some guilds working together as well..
---
Yes indeed.  Earlier I was at Raven Hill with a couple of level 25 allies when a 44 orc rogue came to crash the party.  We killed him three times before he decided to leave.
---
**Hooray!** So glad it helped :)
---
Sexymap
---
Not in the way people think. Layering doesn't increase the size of the server. It just means instead of slamming 2k people into elwynn forest you get 5 elwynns
---
üßê but has warhammmer in unnamed
---
Because the mobs are on a 30 second respawn timer (really short anyway). Every other dungeon farm you have to go out and reset. Torchruns give 80-120k xp/h with virtually 0 risk.
---
Did you buy it or get it as a drop? Still trying to get mine.
---
I enjoy wearing robes as a paladin.
---
But that's not due to layering?
---
While they might not perform very good in pure output (dps or healing), they definitely have a place in raids. Innervate and combat ress can make a big difference and I really hate playing without them. 
---
So if you don't care about pure numbers and are fine with a more supporting role, you're completely fine playing your druid. Also you will have a pretty easy time collecting your tier sets because druids tend to be rare which means less competition ;)
---
Is it good RP etiquette to to run up and spit on Alliance scum?
---
Has she tried therapy for it?  I know that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has shown promise in being able to lessen or even entirely override peoples extreme phobias.
---
‚ÄùThose are rookie numbers!?‚Äù
---
All jokes aside though, please don‚Äôt go overboard and take care of yourself my friend. Let us who have nothing else in life but the game do these crazy unhealthy binges.
---
Def buy it. Getting enchanting up to 70 as a low level is both expensive and time consuming. On my tailor/enchanter I basically abandoned enchanting until I can farm properly. Only got it to 40 lol
---
That might work, GOOD LUCK! Tell.me how it went üòéüëç
---
Mate, don't take their shit.
---
So long as you're doing preparation (as in learning the dungeons before trying to tank them) and doing a serviceable job, you don't need to apologise for anything.
---
At the start of a run you should say that you're new and still learning the role, and that the pace will be slower than normal. If you're party leader, kick any rude cunts after a warning. Don't be afraid to straight up boot cunts from the party.
---
Lower speed is better for warriors because your abilities are based off your weapon damage and lower speed weapons are going to have a higher damage (not DPS).
---
It is the experience about the raids as well as the Information available on BIS items etc.
---
Back then People thought they where good to go with their T0 gear. Which was crap for most classes. 
---
Today every1 has his PRE-BIS list which makes them twice as strong as T0..
---
Blizzard claims they are going to get rid of layering by Phase 2 and won't increase the realm caps. I would expect those queues to go back up. All of the big servers have too much population for Blizzard's plan to work so either they will give up and just let layering continue forever or they have to get a lot of those people to transfer. And 40 minute queues aren't doing the job so expect them to get significantly longer. 
---
So maybe your friends will see that you made a good choice.

---
Faster weapons generally mean faster rage generation. The meta is fast weapons at least 1-55
---
It makes an evil sounding laugh when you target something immune to fear.
---
"Dude I'm so high right now"?
---
That's basically our "Okay, we're ready" moment :P
---
It depends on the situation. Say that you've been a general dick in pvp before, and the occasion to bubble hearth is because reinforcements were called in.
---
"Go BaCk To ReTaIl"
---
He literally said why in his post. Because your xp/hr will also be higher. Time wasted by running around waiting for a respawn that doesn't happen is time not getting any xp.
---
Well 1s is basically nothing at that level. But I guess to others it would seem like the mage is charging money for drinks just because he can / he wants to be a dick.
---
It's just a rabbit hole of silliness. How many things get killed in a raid if the tanks don't tank anything? How much dps do people do if they don't get heals and die to raid damage? Does that mean you attribute that dps to the healer?  
---
The smarter thing by far is just assume by default everyone uses their abilities that help the raid as you'd expect, and compare the dps classes on their own merits while acknowledging the big ticket synergies (such as a priest bringing shadow weaving or someone being a nightfall bot) - which is pretty much what people do now.
---
This is actually true. Doing the warrior Brutal Armor quest line an undead armorsmith tried to make a joke and realized she's not funny because she's not alive and instead a monster.
---
Fear had weird interactions with collision. You can do this to fear thru gates too.
---
That's the age old debate. 
---
Slower weapons will do more damage while faster can give you rage sooner. 
---
An example of what I mean by sooner rage is if you only needed 5 more rage to use an ability, with a slow weapon you'd have to wait longer to get that rage even though when you hit you'll get much more rage then with a faster weapon. 
---
Most too performing tanks just want the damage. With good gear you'll almost always be swimming in rage so go phat and hit hard.
---
How do you know they made them harder on purpose? People have always asked it to be as vanilla like as possible.
---
I think the Pserver People just got the numbers wrong and People were happy with it because they didn't remember right
---
So before i go questing or do some dungeons, i make 30 deadly ones and &lt;10 instant poisons. It works pretty good
---
I‚Äôm totally fine with not capping the meters but I worry mostly for pvp as well as finding a spot in a raiding guild.
---
Keep a stack of 20 IP on you and mail yourself a bunch of mats to make extra poisons for when you run out, this way you won't need to fly to poison vendor in cities every time (:
---
Just rememember to send/return the mail every 30 days else your mats vanish into the nether.
---
Shamans without anhk. Druids without seeds.
---
Pretty good for a clicker.
---
/e  works fine as well, its for 'emote'
---
What is exactly wrong in my comment? It is just not what OP meant, but it is certainly a thing.
---
Lucky you. I rolled up pure hordies this time around and duskwood isn't on my adventuring checklist. Instead I have *the barrens* and *stonetalon mountains* to look forward to  in that level range.
---
Currently adventuring in Silverpine cause it's the next best thing, but it's still no duskwood.
---
oof make it party chat at least
---
Spellbatching.
---
Never had this perspective when running across the barrens. Thanks!
---
am horde, can confirm.
---
The Eredar sided with the Sargeras. The Draenei are exiled Eredar who sided with Velen and refused Sargeras. Also the orcs massacred the a lot of the Draenei after drinking the demons blood.
---
Old habits die hard ;)
---
didn't even know standing on roofs was considered an exploit. what would you do if you're wearing magic toilet paper and there's a hungry melee trying to put your nuts in your neck?
---
also, no puns coming from a GM? weak.
---
At level 60 I plan to respect to bear form but will that also translate to pvp? Or will I have to respec when I want to pvp and when I want to tank?
---
You can carry them as many as you wish, 20 or maybe 200 - up to you. Just make sure you don‚Äôt run out of them since not all the towns have poison sellers.
---
Yeah exactly. And that is the problem. #nochange boys just blinded by their desire for an "authentic" experience resulting in litterly trying to justify people hijacking a well known chat channel.
---
The thing with drunk and high players is something to keep in mind of when playing. It‚Äôs easy to forget that others are not like you when those others are not directly next to you but just in the game. I‚Äôm not drinking or smoking but some people do. Some people are a bit tipsy when they play and some people are completely wasted while playing.
---
I mean, it wouldn't really flow if everyone qualified every interaction as an 'attempt.' that's why the /emotes all just do the thing they say they do, like spit or kick, even though it's just saying that.
---
I just keep a stack of all poisons, I primarily use instant poison so I'll keep 2 stacks of that.   All the poisons have situational uses for me so I dont use them often but like to have them on hand when needed.
---
I don't know what this originally said, but if you think druids suck, you haven't met a real one.
---
In what world can you solo the WW quest at level 32/33 lol.
---
Yeah, it's for people who come from other platforms. Same way /tell, /t, /whisper and /w all do the same thing.
---
Is this Ashbringer? Seen that mage in Org and I was mad as fuck that I didn‚Äôt think of that name
---
What is proc per minute
---
What‚Äôs the UI looks hella sexy?
---
We call that house rules. It‚Äôs adds a lot of fun to rolls!
---
Removing the cap would fuck everything up. They'd have to rebalance all the raid content.
---
Well that's true, I guess that's just what I first thought when I read that, since playing a melee class gives you this kind of suffering on a daily basis while playing with mages or anything that can root mobs.
---
Autch :D
---
The Night Elves weren't part of the alliance... and Grom had kind of a self sacrifice redemption arc.  
---
Then Garrosh happened and Thrall being stupid for the plot not realizing that he is retarded.  
---
Then the rest of the Horde leaders being retarded for the plot not realizing that Garrosh is retarded.
---
You know what?!  
---
Wrath was the final WoW expansion. Cata and beyond was just a looooong bad dream.
---
[https://discord.gg/YnvsqsB](https://discord.gg/YnvsqsB)
---
Okay so jump in there then go to the Levelling FAQ section and it's in there, there is an expansion to more weapons, the above table is just the horde starter zone stuff :D
---
You should probably explain that the issue is statistical. Across X minutes there is no difference in rage gained between a 1.9 weapon and a 2.6 one. The issue is that tanking is not a statistical process. A slow weapon means that a parry/dodge/miss is more devastating to your rage gain. Imagine you have a weapon with 1.0 and another with 10.0 speed. The first generates 10% of the rage every second, while the other generates 100% of rage on the first swing and then nothing for 10 seconds. You afford losing 2-3 swings from the fast weapon, but losing the one big swing from the slow one would cripple your rage-gain.
---
To be fair, he probably has characters on both sides (not sure if you can do that on a PvP server, but you can on RP servers).
---
"even if i was just exploring up there and didn't fight anyone?"
---
I was the opposite. I've always been a shadow priest main, but after getting shadow form and seeing how useless I am outside of solo content, I decided to respec healer.
---
i blame the elves for everything.
---
Every bubble hearth is a win in the open world, it's not like the paladin wants to take a flight path out of where they were actively farming/running just to avoid a death.
---
If they wanted to hearth, they would have done it before they set out.
---
the problem here is you're watching youtubers
---
And thats why you never loot the beast before you check around for opposite faction, then loot-&gt;skin
---
Damn, you literally couldn't be more wrong
---
Hamstring\*
---
Because you need exactly one in a raid and somehow people think this means they'll get a raid spot when playing one?
---
Yea I like to think that or it's covered in tumors and useless lol
---
Damn I completely forgot you‚Äôre not allowed to like or play both. Shite thanks for reminding me.
---
no it's not, look at parses, barely anyone is bringing sp to the raid, and even then it's one person
---
If my quest is done I am not going to farm more mobs.
---
And not everyone is trying to go for most xp/hr.
---
It‚Äôs not a big achievement either way
---
You would if you knew better
---
Yeah, it was all guesswork and people having faulty memory about the game being harder than it was
---
What if I need the money to buy an equivalent upgrade for my class?
---
Yesterday, in the burning steps, I, a 60 mage was just questing in the area till I see a 51 dwarf paladin, he was basically dead at around 1% health and oom. He casts 1 heal that brings him to around 20%. 
---
So I thought oh I‚Äôll sheep him to heal him up!
---
So I sheep him, he gains 1 tick of health and instantly bubble-hearthed.
---
I laughed so hard as my intention was only to heal him but he was probably so used to being ganked he just went full auto and bubble hearthed the poor dude lol
---
Well neither is your comment
---
I feel like that is what ruins guilds if you need to provide factual evidence that your guild should take you into a raid. If just getting into a raid is an uphill battle like this, I'd rather not play at all, heck I'd leave such a guild.
---
Discussion with your raid leader about what specc to use is fine, but not getting to a raid by just a virtue of being class seems like depressing future for Classic as a game. We already have FOTM-mentality and ilvl-shenanigans in retail, why bring those to Classic too? Why ruin the community with it when the game's difficulty doesn't require it?
---
Pvp druid is dank and you will for sure be taken to raids
---
Most of the horde dies in the 2nd war. Grom gets redeemed but dies. Orgrim Doomhammer dies. The player kills Kargath Bladefist. Kilrogg Deadeye dies. Teron Gorefiend dies like twice. Their planet gets blown up. Horde goes through a civil war in which tons of orcs die, and Garrosh gets overthrown and then eventually he gets killed too, by an orc. 
---
Then there's a whole expansion that allows the player to bend time and space to kill all of those guys ALL OVER AGAIN along with a whole entire new horde of orcs to massacre. 
---
So I mean, how many more orcs do you gotta kill before you've "dealt" with them? Especially as the major orc faction remaining are the ones in the Horde, who I remind you didn't side with Garrosh, weren't part of the Iron Horde, probably didn't fight in the 2nd war, and have contributed to saving the planet a couple times.
---
thats a hypothetical statement
---
But them bubble getting successfully is the best outcome. 
---
They are gone from the area until they run/boat/fly back. So they aren't going to interrupt your questing or call for help.
---
What do you mean Classic is "toned down"? The content is just super easy, there was a reason why EVERY single serious private serve had buffed bosses (almost all bosses have an extra 30% hp, do more DMG etc)
---
quick question about shadow priest since we are already talking about it, does the vampiric touch that heals 20% of your damage to party mean it heals 20% of my damage to everyone or does it heal 20% split between them so everyone only gets 4% ?
---
Armor + Stam + Defense.
---
Perfect for druid tank (gets exponential Stam and Armor in bear form)
---
I killed a 58 mage as a 50 hunter with my 52 friend. Then I killed him 1vs1 fair fight both full hp when he came at me. He wrote...mean racist things :D about me, saying horde only fight when it's unfair... bro you lost 1vs1 to a gray... he ignored me already though.
---
But... If Durotan hadn't allowed that the entire Frostwolf clan would have probably been raided.
---
That staff is sweet. So much tasty armor.
---
How come if I tried /w %t "message" it gives me "no player named %t is currently playing"
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
Would be cool to have in game GMs again!
---
Haha as a skinner I thought of the same thing!
---
Just use Opie (specially as a mage it makes your life .. well actions bars a lot cleaner).
---
It should be your responsibility to tell the tank when you are close to oom,  not his to pay attention to.
---
A 60 Hunter killed me twice in Un'Goro while In was questing. I was a 52 warrior who didn't stand a chance. But I did get my revenge. While he was fighting the Devilsaurs later I killed his pet so he got chunked by the dino. It was very satisfying.
---
mf I dare you to go and play TIBIA right now.
---
Ye cuz everyone just raids
---
Can someone explain to me all why Classic Ret builds take Improved Seal of the Crusader? We all use Seal of Command, so I dont understand why I would take 3 wasted points of using a Seal I dont even use.
---
Due to the limit debuff on bosses, nobody is going to want any Ret paladin debuff on it (assuming they even take ret paladins to begin with).  Therefore wouldnt we use Seal of Command since it wouldnt cause a debuff?
---
Even if the other ret talents arent totally pve worthy, id rather take some pvp talents in there where i could possibly have some use rather than use Improved Seal of the Crusader where I dont even use the seal to begin with.
---
Somebody please explain this to me
---
Ret paladins would like a word

1g per plus tips? I asked a mage the other day and he‚Äôs said 35s plus as that‚Äôs what it costs for mats.

---
That‚Äôs it, if I ever make an alt (not likely tho) I‚Äôll definitely go druid. Never played vanilla druid so curious how it would turn out!
---
Those elements was spawn camped by a billion people when I was there for the quest.
---
ZF farm has a hard cap, no matter how fast you can clear the GY you are limited to 5 clears per hour.
---
I‚Äôll stick with my Worg Pup! I just wish we could name them..
---
If there is a mod that do that, i'd actually try it.
---
You forgot "we have too many melee"
---
It should be a purple with that droprate. Cmon Blizz stop being lazy!!!
---
It will be very rare to have a choice between equal dps weapons (one slow, one fast) during leveling. In raids, fast weapons allow you to dump rage faster into Heroic Strike so you don't cap. Capping on rage is not an issue till BWL though.
---
I wouldn't worry about it during leveling, just go highest dps.
---
It's like that on other servers too. I did SFK the other day and I waited quite a long time too before the group was complete. Maybe you can start asking in the nearest by town that's what I did and it worked better than there.
---
youre gonna get absolutly shit on in pvp if your wearing your leveling gear vs people with pre raid bis or even epics.  it wont be fun
---
For deathmine dungeon, as the warrior tank should I be camping defensive stance with a sword and shield or can I actually camp battle stance with a 2h so I can DPS as well?
---

If you get crit and you have auto attack turned on and your target is out of range , you will not store a charge of reckoning. Heres some videos that will probably help.

The trolls without ears in strangle thorn are great too.

Spamming LFG sometimes works, but often is not enough.
---
There was a Paladin back in my early 30's who emote spammed me and did something before he started hearthing, I KNEW he didn't have enough time to hearth out so I waited for his bubble to time out and I feared him the second it died into a bunch of mobs and watched him die. It was so satisfying.
---
In all fairness it's really hard to understand what point you're trying to make either. Qualified people want better jobs / pay? Uhh... yes?
---
We don't even know if there will be future updates. We don't know anything, just stop with these posts.
---
You‚Äôre on Skeram right? That pally looks familiar
---
No he didn't, he never even targeted the pet. The pet was glitching on the devilsaur corpse
---
The guy above said that "Nobody at that level HAS 1g" which is what I am getting at.
---
Does the content update for retail concern us as far as downtime is concerned?
---
At some Point don't you just decide to make your own Group? 
---
Usually it goes much faster for me if I look for members instead of a Group because nobody actually wants to make a group

So glad they keep hotfixing things after they've allowed enough people to abuse them but just before most of us get the opportunity to try it.
---
Ah ok. Im sure its % actually.

If i missprice an item, even an obscure patern, a bank alt will buy it INSTANTLY.  
---
What addon do people use for that ? Does it parse the AH every sec and buy eveyting that is underpriced ?
---
I am an alliance and I fully approve this interaction.
---
When things are tight, $300 for a new computer just to play games is hard to justify.
---
Has anyone tried mixing arms+fury for sweeping strikes + improved cleave?
---
Sweeping strikes makes your next 5 attacks attack twice, improved cleave increases your cleave dmg by 120%
---
This makes each cleave do 8.8 times weapon damage, if you save up 90 rage then you can sweeping blade into 3 cleaves, doing 13.2 times weapon damage to two targets at once.
---
There was a way to play the song power of the horde  by elite tauren chieftain in game. Just as a sound file not make them appear.
---
Depends on server time.
---
Also the general population are way post sfk. Most players are between 35-45 now so SM is absolutley popping off
---
I saw dafran do this a few hours ago
---
I killed so many reds and skulls while leveling. Must feel bad dying to a gray lowbie. Much shame.

If you can‚Äôt find a group in LFG how can you find it on Reddit?

DPS will have a harder time looking for groups because there are so many. You want instant invitations you roll tanks or healers. 
---
You can still enjoy questing or knocking enemy players‚Äô head in. Your level is perfect for raising some hell in Hillsbrad.
---
It doesn't speed up that much - basically, you end up with two other DDs in about 5 minutes and continue looking for a tank and heal for the next hour - at least that's my experience

It probably just feels like it right now.

I dont see particularly many spriests.

And if I do I can be almost sure they won't be anymore at 60. At least for a while

Jokes aside, back when I used to RP on Ultima Online, every server used to have an extensive set of rules that prevented you from forcing an emote onto another player. The good old days of having to write a 100 page story as an application for every race and class that was not human, so that the GM's could verify your ability to place the race right. We were such nerds back then.
---
Shattering Throw has way more counterplay, as it has a longer cast time and obeys line of sight, on a melee class while at it. It's also got a cooldown unlike MD.
---
It was peculiar that it was ever even added though as paladins were ass in both vanilla and TBC, the counterplay to paladin is to not be a paladin, you don't really need more counterplay. :x
---
Within the context of the OP post - Garrosh and his followers. Kill them.
---
Spy does that, but only shares with guildies. Not sure there's a way in-game to share info like that without being in a guild or group together.
---
He is trying to tell you hiring idiots on a help desk to save money is stupid. 
---
He just did not get down to your level of intelligence or snark.
---
I wonder if anybody will ever come up with a ranking list, instead of a BIS-list
---
Also the best way to quickly get rid of those pesky totems ruining my day
---
Just saw i could abort flight and land at closest fp, is this a classic feature?
---
OG Night Elves were corrupted like fucking 9 times.  First to become the High Elves, then Naga, then Satyr, then Demon Hunters, then the EK High Elves and Nightborne,then the Outland High Elves, then Blood Elves, and lastly as Void Elves.  The lore of the elves is that they become mana addicts to literally every fucking power source that comes their way.  The only difference is that addiction to the Emerald Dream and wild magics is not bad, according to the elves that are addicted to that particular magical energy.
---
If you have a fight that goes on for 2 minutes it would not cripple your rage gain. Especially not if you consider windfury generating extra rage on high dmg hits or hoj.
---
It would be a massive spam if it just shared with everyone. Spy does let you do this between guildies.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for :)! So does it permanently mark them for Guildies?
---
So what you're saying is the only way to win is to kill all the incoming enemies until there are no enemies left? 
---
/s 
---
That is not possible because they corpse run and come back. If you kill one guy in pvp that is a kill for you, if they get backup and 10 people come. That is not a point where yo are likely to kill them all. So if you bubble hs, you got the kill and still got out of there.
---
Doxxing someone like that is definitely an offence or crime. Nothing else you described is.
---
Shaman utility ftw!
---
From what I‚Äôve read druids are jack of all trades master of none. Apparently they get worse as new raids are released and other classes get better gear. I‚Äôve herd they make good off tanks but still lots of people say they are a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù spec. In pvp lots of people say they are only good as flag caps which I‚Äôm personally fine with but are not very good other than that. I want to be proven wrong lol.
---
GM could be in trouble, blizz is known to check this reddit, and it has his name on it lol, definitely not a good look for him
---
I'd posit that the guy who's ganking looks like a noob but eh
---
No
---
Yeah very true but I have no other classic wow experience.
---
Sprite Darter Hatchling, starts with [this quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2969/freedom-for-all-creatures).
---
Didn't know the hearthstone trick at the end and that's actually useful
---
You are wrong, poisons aren't on procs per minute but static proc rate.
---
Why do you keep making these low effort posts?
---
Shitty video
---
Mage hunter lock are all top notch for farming. Rogues can stealth farm but it‚Äôs a bit more niche. Come phase 2 locks/hunters should be running Mara/DM Tribute and mages typically running DM east lasher packs. If you have a good tank friend carry runs for strat live and DM East bow/arcanite farm can be lucrative.
---
&gt; Does blizzard take these things seriously? 
---
Only the doxxing part. The rest is up to the players to handle.
---
Thought so. Odd it was added then
---
Pretty sure this is abuse. Blizzard will not appreciate this :(
---
I haven't seen him in clearlynotrobots so that is evidence of him being a bot!
---
Entirely possible that some of their GMs don't even play the game/understand game mechanics, so they wouldn't necessarily know what melee/shadow word: pain is
---
I'll likely be hitting 60 today. I work full time (40 hr/week) and the only 'cheese' I did was a level of BRD torch runs from 55-56. I was halfway to epic mount gold too, before I bought a Warden Staff. Fishing and cooking at 250+.
---
It's possible if you play efficiently and with a goal in mind. I totally respect that not all people do this, but it's kinda fucked up that people just assume your a basement dweller.
---
Isn't ability damage normalized in 1.12 (skills like Thunder Clap and Revenge)?
---
%t is your target.  Don't make the mistake of having yourself highlighted...
---
Hi, /u/Lord-of-Rats
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d83631/what_is_the_warlock_rotation_while_leveling/). 
---
Yes, you are invulnerable to the other party's damage when they cannot hurt you, easy
---
I've taken a few. Tbh I take anything aslong as correct level. They are okay. They are better when it's single target dps and off healing is always a plus if needed
---
Do Horde run Deadmines or I shouldn't count on Deadmines loot when planning out what to get during leveling?
---
Hahah have experienced this just now
---
For a second I was like "why would you hamstring after a dodge..."
---
Man fuck people like you honestly. Here, [patch 1.10](buffs everywhere to classes and early loot as well as nerfs to instances)
---
The only one going down a rabbit hole in this scenario is your example. Putting a parenthesis around a druid or shaman to show the extra DPS they provide to a team based on Leader of the pack or what ever support buff shows a realistic picture that that support class is bringing to the picture besides their personal DPS.
---
That's not what he is saying. If you need your quest, kill mobs even if it's not the ones you need but can respawn into the ones you do need 
---
If your quest is done you can go and turn it in.
---
I did this yesterday, and we was there for over two hour killing all the mobs multiple times, we never stopped getting xp.
---
Murloc heads in Dustwallow... took me nearly 2 hours for 12 to drop.
---
I think auto buying and selling is against the rules? 
---
But there are add ons that can scan the AH for everything and I‚Äôm assuming it could tell a user if something is ‚Äúunderpriced‚Äù
---
Does he have that talent that reduces rage decay by 30%? Cause that talent will give you like 1 rage per 5 when in combat
---
It's because the feature was already in the engine and you could accomplish the same thing in vanilla by disconnecting and waiting. 
---
So instead of removing this feature from the engine and having to add in a complicated and unfriendly way to perform it, the decided to leave it in. 
---
There's a blue post about it.
---
More dps
---
Put him in ignore list and move on.
---
sure, if you're 14
---
People will downplay this, but the patch we're currently playing has significantly powered players up through gear, itemization, buffs to classes and nerfs to bosses. I don't personally care too much if it's 100% the authentic experience or not, but here is some patch notes from back then regarding some changes: 
---
1.3 
---
* Players who have completed the Molten Core discovery quest can now port directly to the zone, bypassing Blackrock Depths.
---
* Onyxia's fireballs will no longer result in a confuse effect (Engulfing Flames). The impact damage of these fireballs has been slightly increased to compensate for the loss of the damage over time. 
---
* Increased the delay before Onyxia will try to tail sweep.
---
1.4 
---
* **Raid Itemization:** 
---
* Onyxia, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and all Molten Core boss creatures have all received some new items on their loot tables.
---
* Most of the non-class set items that dropped from Molten Core and Onyxia have had their effective levels increased, resulting in higher DPS weapons, and/or better stats and effects.
---
* The loot tables for some of the Molten Core bosses have been improved so they drop an additional epic item per kill.
---
* Future patches will include even more item rewards for these raid encounters, as well as improvements to the statistics, effects, and set bonuses for both tiers of the raid armor sets.
---
1.5 
---
* The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now always happen while Ragnaros is in combat. However, these lava eruptions occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.
---
* Additional new raid items have been added to the treasure lists for Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and **bosses in Molten Core**.
---
1.6 
---
* The loot tables in Molten Core have been revised slightly.
---
Etc. I don't want to go through every patch up until 1.12, but you can see already by 1.6 there's been quite a lot of changes. More or less all of the changes are really good, but they also serve to tell you just how shitty gear was back then as well as some annoying mechanics. 
---
I only included what I thought to be the most significant from these patches, but truthfully there was like 20 smaller things changed, added or removed. Stratholme and Scholomance saw between 20 - 30 added blue items for example, which helps gearing people up for MC and Ony. 
---
I do all the mythic raiding on live and I didn't even play back in Vanilla, but the sheer fucking arrogance coming from parts of the WoW community regarding difficulty of Vanilla has me really annoyed. What we're playing right now does not reflect the time when this game was released - period. I hate to see people in similar positions like me just say that people back then were just stupid and terrible players without any of the context of the time.
---
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES!!??
---
You can't report anyone for removing you from a group, no.
---
&gt; Even spewed this bs in global, undoubtedly hurting my chance to get in another group
---
No, it won't. Nobody with a working brain would give a fuck for someone spreading bullshit in a global channel.
---
The entire book he pretty much uses that excuse to sell out and erode every one of his morals and principles. Its also made fairly clear that he holds a lot of sway and his voice could disrupt the Horde leadership at the time. At some point you have a responsibility to take a stand, especially if you're a leader. Standing by and ticking off the torture of children is irredeemable in my eyes.
---
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of Evil is that good men do nothing."
---
I mean he‚Äôs still screwing my chances from finding a group though
---
no you can't report people for warning others that your dps is laughable.
---
Too many people with too few brain cells.
---
My point was that it's all on Blizzard for not always having amazing front line staff. It's *very* hard to keep good staff in those jobs, so you end up with a few less than stellar people.
---
Add them to the ignore list?
---
I‚Äôm usually the first to flay asshats like that mercilessly, but you‚Äôre being a bit of a snowflake.
---
Mix cum, shit, puke and pee together in a bucket. That outcome GM
---
Farming SM or ZF you reset the instance. BRD Torch room uses mobs that infinitely respawn (so you never reset the instance) so there's definitely a difference.
---
the massive open world fights out of nowhere in all level ranges?
---
This doesnt solve the issue for the OP though because other people can still see all the things the toxic player says in global.
---
As someone who has never played a mage... how much water is conjured per cast? Like, how much effort goes into making max level water? What's a reasonable amount to ask for and how much to tip? I don't want to be annoying people but god damn do I go through water fast as a hunter spamming attacks. Mages of WoW teach me how to be a water begging bum!
---
Toxic behavior is only toxic if you let it *be* toxic.
---
DPS issue... I play warrior and get up to 4 whispers per hour if I do want to join a group to tank xyz... Classic is a challenge, especially tanking is a bit more responsibility and requires more skill than in retail... people seem to be afraid of that.
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
So cute!
---
You can use them for world pvp, but you must obviously be careful not to level up (since you cannot lock your xp gains in classic wow).
---
True. But I mean. I throw Marks for everyone. Mage won't ususally even buff back. It just feels a bit bad sometimes. I understand people not buffing at all in the middle of their mob-killing of course.
---
Always be queue a bigger heal spell on tank but cancel before it goes off.
---
Renew on tank on pull is low threat and buys time. 
---
Only flash heal and renew on dps, they do not need to be topped. 
---
Pre bubble a mage on aoe pulls 
---
Use inner focus + prayer of Fort to avoid another big drink delay
---
Use inner focus + prayer of healing for free group heals 
---
Avoid temptation to dps and waste mana, mama conservation is KING for inevitable patrol adds and oh crap situations.
---
Always chosen Alliance before Classic because I am just a sucker for night elves. Played only a little bit Horde. 
---
Made the switch because I wanted to see what being Horde is like, and the coin flip decided against orc, hence the undead rogue.
---
Can we get level 1 warrior duels happening on roofs on a normal server and see what the BFA GMs say?
---
Horde can enter and clear Deadlines but it's seriously not worth it. Horde have no quests for it and getting there at an appropriate level for the dungeon sucks, especially on a PVP server.
---
Send them some of the buff food you can make and soon they'll be begging you to cook for them :)
---
"This jump is a shortcut!" ... --&gt; "summon him pls Warlock..."
---
I got a whelpling drop and thought ace that's my mount sorted.. Wrong.. No one wants these just now. ha. Hang onto it and will sell in the future.
---
On the same and use it when I‚Äôm working away was able to level perfectly fine with a few add ins, never skipped a beat.
---
We had a shaman tank Onyxia back during BWL tier.  He actually held threat with earthshock.
---
&gt;Noggenfogger not cloaking shapes
---
Are you certain that's not just a private server quirk
---
I do. The OP's at full HP/mana whereas the paladin's at 75%/50%, we can deduce who initiated that fight, and not liking his chances vs a class he can't kill anyway (travel form cya) he bailed. The butthurt over a bubble hearth is peculiar.
---
Depends on the healer, but in all likelihood sword'n board. Healers have limited Mana in classic, especially early on. You're going to want to monitor your healer's Mana as well, especially before pulling additional packs after fights.
---
Badlands...nobody wants to run there
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my DPS dude. The guy is making shit up...
---
If u grind saytars in felwood and ashzara u will get felcloth aswell
---
and is this not the same for people who drink?
---
Spy, it‚Äôs the best
---
I haven't played since BC and I am having the time of my life playing classic. I'm glad everyone I meet in the game is patient though lol
---
It's all common sense. If you expect something to happen like a mob following you and it doesn't *and* *then you decide to keep doing this to exploit that unexpected behavior*, it's against the rules. In real life it's physically possible to rob a bank, but you still know it's against the rules.
---
90% as good at everything, as any class. But able to do all other roles at 80% at the same time. Druids are more than fine
---
It's pretty clear he was up there if you read between the lines. Which is against the rules, I got a warning for wall jumping in Ironforge back in TBC.
---
I wish we had a fuck you to warriors, they've needed it for more than paladins for nearly the entirety of this game!
---
judging by you making this thread asking if someone can be reported for removing you from a group or calling your dps bad I'm gonna make a real strong guess that your dps is actual dogshit and you're 100% oblivious like 99% of rogues
---
Screw him back! Srsly tho that backlashes 9/10 times. No one likes an asshole. Also why are you having trouble deepsing? Link your spec!
---
You gonna start paying the healer for heals too then?
---
Or the headless murlocs in Hillsbrad
---
I don't understand the rogue hate. Good dps with minimal downtime and can cleave pretty hard if needed.
---
implying that horde players were ganking for any higher reason than their own epeen.
---
this comment gave me PTSD holy shit. me trying to get raptors as a warrior with mages and hunters around me. literally took me two days to complete that shit
---
What if....these so called "NPC's" are actually hardcore roleplayers employed by Blizzard?
---
GM gay
---
That rogue was SO. FUCKING.  BAD.  Did not even stun lock you when he opened, I can‚Äôt believe how shit that was.
---
Congradulations.  You have the BIS feral tank weapon for all 6 phases.
---
just charging in the opposite direction
---
Costs mana but does not take up a slot in bag.
---
He didn‚Äôt remove me from the groups. On two separate occasions he convinced the leader to remove me before we had even started
---
Wrong actually. For one, we didn't get "useless bank teller types". We got smart and capable bank tellers who wanted to do something different but still enjoyed customer services and dealing with people. Because IT is, at its core, a service industry.
---
Basic helpdesk work is not hard... the vast majority of our calls were locked accounts, "how do I"'s, and other simple issues that could be solved by following a flowchart and basic troubleshooting skills. All of that is very easily taught to anybody who is inclined to learn. They were especially great at helping staff who didn't know how to do things because guess what? They'd spent years doing those things themselves as tellers and *already* had a ton of knowledge on the actual usage of programs and their quirks. Frequently more than me, because I never used them beyond making sure they opened up for people.
---
Anything more complex is simply sent to level 2 support, where we employed actual IT people to resolve it. 
---
But you know, I've only been in the industry for going on 20 years now, the fuck would I know?
---
So [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7y6cu/shoutout_to_resident_gnomeboy_urawizardhry_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  isnt you?
---
The trolls were the invaders and actually were on the verge of wiping out the high elves and only an alliance with humans from Strom (now Stromgarde) drove them back. This is from way, way before even the First War. The reason the high elves joined the Alliance in the Second War was because they swore to come to the aid of any descendant of that group humans, and Lothar was the last surviving member of that bloodline.
---
Most notably, a lot of the spellpower gear was *terrible* before optimization changes. Like Shadowweave and Felcloth gear was at about half of their current values.
---
It‚Äôs the earlier version of Razer Naga (I think Chrome or Chroma or something). If I‚Äôm not mistaken - trinity has a detachable thumb-pad buttons to switch for other ones. Mine does not detach.
---
Either way, it makes a world of difference - highly recommend. Though the right-click button tends to be the first thing to malfunction since I use it so much in WoW.
---
It‚Äôs known for melting faces 1v1 in PvP and it‚Äôs very easy to do so with it. Not highly gear dependant either.
---
" Wrath was the final WoW expansion. Cata and beyond was just a looooong bad dream. "
---
I'm with you. Not only did the game itself mostly get worse beyond that point (other than early Cata which was very good pre-patch and is criminally underrated), but the lore got incredibly bad as well. Best to just consider everything post-wrath fanfiction.
---
Hello, I play on Zandalar Trive a RPPVP server in EU. For a while now I have been interested in setting up a little side hustle type thing in game where players could come to my shady nook in org/UC and gamble a little bit over some bonedice. Nothing insane, I figure max bet depends on level or is just like 10 silver. However, I have heard rumors that gambling is not covered by the ToS of the game (which I find funny because the whole game is gambling). So I just want to get a definitive answer if I could pull this off somehow, or if I would just get banned for doing it.
---
I'm not trying to steal money, just role play as a shady bone dice dealer...
---
We did
---
TSM can scan the AH actively and you can set up a button to buy items in the list instantly. So if you set up a scan for items sold at like less than 50% of their usual price you can get mostly mispriced items to show up and buy them. That‚Äôs called sniping.
---
Slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken.
---
He never said he wasn't up there, he said he didn't fight anyone up there.
---
Still assuming on the hypothetical basis,. Also not breaking any rules as he didnt use an exploit to his advantage, while his counterpart was using it to avoid guards while pvping?
---
Worse Rend, just to rub it in.
---
Not that Wyvern Sting is any good in PvE, but atleast it isn't a slap in the face to pick up.
---
I'll give you part of that if you accept that those corruptions (save demon hunters) all descended from the Highborn who Night Elf society in general shuns because of said corruptions. You wont find many modern night elves roaming the streets shouting, "Go naga!" Then again, you wont find many modern night elves anymore, period.
---
Only those who abused it hard got banned. Some got away with it if they only did it for a little while.
---
lol all of the butthurt about bubble hearth. Paladin's a complete free kill in world PvP, there's literally not a single class they can kill 1v1 without a significant advantage, obviously they're going to bubble hearth out instead of getting camped. Calling them cowards for it is ironic as you're the coward for initiating a fight with someone who can't ever beat you.
---
Now available for craft on Thal-nos Alliance! Whisper Ryuke &lt;Spectrum&gt; in-game for crafting details! I'm actually still mind blown I got this.
---
Depends on the character. On live I have it bound to Healing rain and dispel.
---
On my classic shammy I've got m5 bound to grounding totem and m4 to warstomp. On a pvp server you want abilities that will be useful in a fight so you can always hit them with the quickest reaction time.
---
do more damage
---
yeah I really don't get it, how on earth can that be fun for anyone? but hey it's a free azeroth
---
they must have nerfed the droprate on retail. I was farming it for hours on retail. But dropped like 8 of them when exping in westfall in classic.
---
It is a good option when your opponent is immune to bleeds
---
&gt;	How do you know they made them harder on purpose?
---
Because the people running private servers have confirmed this, it's not really a secret.
---
The data they had wasn't that far off the real values, what was the hardest where timers for abilities, but after all these years they got pretty damn close, and then they turned hp up to make bosses harder.
---
I tend to doubt it. Besides some unverified screenshots of suspension emails posted when people were bloodthirsty to hear of bans, I haven't heard anything.
---
You've come to the wrong place friend
---
sold for around 310g on mograine
---
If they don't suck they are. Particularly if one or both of the other DPS are melee or hunters.
---
They weren‚Äôt a gear check back then either. Apes got world first rag with almost half of the raid between 55 and 59. No dungeon gear, nothing. 
---
The reality is that the bosses were easy and the average player was horrendously bad. Like doing half of the dps they were capable of, unable to move out of fire so they wore a full set of resistance gear so they were doing like 30% less dps on top of that, etc. 
---
I know. I remember it being an expectation that melee would have like 150+ fire resistance going into MC. 
---
I remember in ZG, the exploding bats would take multiple people with them every single time. People just didn‚Äôt know how to play at all.
---
You forgot, can‚Äôt frost nova, can‚Äôt conjure water, and can‚Äôt kite.
---
I use one for movement abilities like charge/blink and other is autorun
---
Just another alliance player lul
---
Addons back then used an API that allowed them to do waaay more.
---
Addons today can't be made anywhere near as powerful because Blizzard limited what's possible.
---
I don‚Äôt have the time to dedicate to both games, and between the two, I like Classic better, but there are things in retail I love (the new races, for example, or Boralus - amazing atmosphere and music)
---
Like Valve
---
No, they said they didn't fight anyone up there. He was asking if just being up there doing nothing but exploring constituted an exploit, because that's what he was doing.
---
Yes mate, and Method are the average WoW player.
---
I tanked both in vanilla and classic, and yes, people in vanilla were often not good at CC, but they would *let you do it*.
---
Lol of course.
---
&gt; line 4512
---
That by itself is a crime
---
RIP Injured Soldier #2, lost too soon.
---
/LookingForGroup is the default world chatting server on my retail server. It was funny to pop into it in classic and it's actually just lfg spam.
---
Danish guild? üòÅ
---
Regarding swoops, birds around 40+ have a chance to drop Giant Eggs, which auction for a good amount. When I was farming the eggs they were going for 50s a pop (depending on your server economy ofc).
---
Thanks, will check how the CTMod unit frames look.
---
Those aren't more powerful - they are equally or less powerful. 
---
Perhaps there's a couple addons with something cool that didnt exist but that doesnt make up for all the stuff that existed back then but CANT exist today because Blizzard limited addons.
---
Lol, that‚Äôs hilarious. Also 1s is nothing and really worth. Gotta get that mount some how.
---
 Hkw  so I do it without literally making an aura for every debuff ingame?
---
I keep seeing it mentioned but is it really viable? As someone that wants to PvP as Ele but is also willing to heal in raids, it would be amazing. I know you lose Mana Tide but what about the rest? How would a pure raiding Resto build look?
---
No, I was alliance lol. I got a warning for wall jumping, just like OP. Not trying to be a dick, but if you knew how to read between the lines, it's very obvious that he was up there.
---
I would love to see it separated by faction so you could see how much of an impact Windfury totem is vs. Paladin stuff.
---
Draw me like one of your French girls
---
real life can't just make robbing a bank impossible LOL are you actually serious?  have fun following laws blizzard makes in game Im gonna grief kids until a gm messages me then tell them they're retarded
---
Even if it's cooked it's still a heart my dude
---
OG Silver Hand reporting in ‚úã
---
Naw, the dicks are people who get indignant when someone charges for their services.
---
To be fair, I'm pretty sure the Orcs didn't willingly drink demon's blood and willingly got corrupted. They were just told "drink this, it will make you powerful" - Which it did, but they got corrupted.
---
The only time Orcs willingly drank demon's blood was when Grom wanted to beat Cenarius and turned him and his army into red fel-orcs.
---
You said 50%, so that means that you have a spreadsheet that you can reference or you are pulling it out of your ass.
---
**OI**
---
It is fine, you have Windfury totem that makes Warriors and Rogues do way more DPS.
---
I can agree with that
---
Two of those don't count. One, he has one, medicore damage attack (Raptor strike) on a 6 second cooldown. If the healer started wanding he'd probably out dps that hunturd.
---
Holy shit. I remember winning that roll back in vanilla. I was like 13 and fell out of my damn chair.
---
If a dps requires anything more than a HoT and lesser heal they are doing something wrong.....
---
Only exception is I pre bubble mage on known aoe pulls. 
---
Repair bills are an effective teacher.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Solid info on the class.
---
New mage players dont even know they can decurse, had to teach 2 mages in my guild they can decurse in an UBRS run
---
Because alliance doesn‚Äôt do the same shit? Everyone thinks alliance and horde are actually different when both are being played by a human. It doesn‚Äôt matter which faction it is, both sides play dirty.
---
It averages 600-800 on Razorgore-EU.
---
Back in the day trade chat would be spammed by people running /roll 'casinos' I do believe blizzard cracked down on this by saying people can't advertise that sort of thing.
---
Part of that may be that it takes way less threat to rip aggro in melee.
---
Ranged have to be at 130% of current target's threat to get aggro, and melee only have to be 110%.
---
Druids are the best class imo. Which is why I play them.
---
You are completely viable in any way you want to play, Resto is great once you master it. Feral is the bomb at tanking, I've been kicking most warriors asses in UBRS in terms of survivability and I'm not even half preBiS. 
---
Just remember that dudu is a Hybrid class, master of none. When it comes to specifically min-maxing a job you would probably take a class specifically designed for it. 
---
People hating on druid are only looking at pure numbers, which will normally not look too great for druids. I can tell you however a couple of druids in a raid even can do so much more than just keep GotW and thorns up. A quick Regrowth/Rejube on someone and back to form might hurt your DPS a little but assist healers in a time of crisis. Go for it.
---
I had something similar yesterday in ZF: Lvl 40 paladin doing less damage than the healer (lvl 40 priest), who wanded when she wasn't healing. Recount said he did 7 % of the group damage. We carried him through nonetheless until we wiped.
---
The paladin started to attack the priest and even asked for the priest to be kicked from the group. The group leader kicked the paladin instead and we had a very relaxed run after that.
---
Shameless ad :p jk gz buddy
---
Amen brother
---
&gt;If you need your quest, kill mobs even if it's not the ones you need but can respawn into the ones you do need 
---
Why would you do that instead of just kill the ones you need and move on? You're assuming that I need to wait on mobs.
---
Wait, Valve has customer support now?
---
People like to put there in game energy into thinking about or stressing about or fretting about funny things
---
That's what 60 priests want you to believe. Truth is many Shadow priest myself included just heal in 60 instances / raid incognito.
---
The perk ? I can't lose in a 1v1 pvp situation, i can farm and solo maraudon for golds.
---
Druid tanking is lovely. I never get the random "come tank" whispers since people search for warriors. But when I do LFG I get instant invites pretty much. Also leveling is nice.
---
Also innervating your healer is a great feeling, stunning and battleressing that warlock who wanted to hellfire etc
---
Thats a hunter epic quest item
---
Might be worth a few gold to anyone whos gotten the leaf already
---
Seriously: Does anybody add someone to their ignore list because someone is talking shit in general chat? 
---
Maybe I'm the minority, but I don't.
---
Bloodscalp Trolls without ears...
---
I absolutely agree with you, if the group is a lvl 59 group aiming to do BRD for gear / xp, or something similar, then that's completely alright. My point goes more towards groups that rejects healers purely because they read on wowhead that ST is 50-56, and the healer is 49 for example.
---
This one fucks me up
---
Take time to make friends with people who want to play with you as a druid.
---
Please keep us updated if anything happens
---
I feel attacked on a personal level D:
---
Yeah no. Mages make short work of warriors 1v1
---
I'm pretty sure that was the rule back in vanilla.
---
I just tune in for the drama.
---
That is my point.
---
shoot me a message on reddit if you set this up i have an orc that whould like this
---
I worked in the industry for 10 years and I fucking despise people like you. And every single technical environment I've been in there's been 10% of the team carrying 90% of the work load because you keep hiring people that don't know anything because you don't want to pay the people that do. You're fucking right I'm going to fight for a promotion nobody dreams of being a help desk technician.
---
Then that depends on if you want to put in the energy to asking each group leader why their group requirements are what they are and where they got their information.

At the level they get the rank, say 50 for the level 45 water, they get 2 per cast and then are able to make increasingly more when they level towards the next bracket. I usually get 240 water and like 60 food(at level 60) when I log on and tip 3-4g for it. I always go on the "who" tab and find a 60 who has no issue making it because they make full stacks every cast.
---
why would you do that ?  
---
For Twink , then maybe , but any other reason, No not worth it...
---
Unpopular opinion, stop whining about it. In a game of war you'd use terrain to your advantage, and avoid guards however you can. This is part of the classic broken troll filled experience. It's part of the nostalgia.
---
Wand?
---
Yes it should first and second, then other offtanks and such. But that's assuming it's reserved or a guild run. Clearly wasn't either
---
That's exactly what the OP and I are assuming.
---
We had a roll between our two tanks for ony head. I rolled a 25, thought i lost for sure then he rolled a 13 haha
---
"Everyone rolls need on epic" should be common sense, there is absolutely no reason anyone should have dibs on some boe epic which could potentially be worth hundreds of gold just because he currently happens to play a spec that can use it.
---
"I need quests" should also be common sense. Unless a dungeon group is strictly advertised as "doing x out of y" or as a strict aoe-farm or "no-quest" run, it should be normal and not asking too much to go out of your way a little and kill an extra pack or two to get a quest for someone or to let a hunter tame something. The only exception to this would be the milking quest in LBRS.
---
Omg... forgot about this lil guy... i miss him
---
blasted lands has some good grind quests in early 50s
---
If you type 'Yunara cuts your coin purse, stealing all your gold" do they give you money?
---
Sure if you pay the mage to do damage then?
---
i do this a lot actually lol, ur grey or green ill probably just troll you for a bit, even levels get these hands tho
---
No one cares
---
It is known.
---
Well... they test their lotions on animals. People complain.  
---
They test their lotions on people. People complain.
---
People are the problem?
---
I'd say yes and no, it obviously depends on the group. If the tank is barely meeting the level requirement and is a dps warrior with a shield / weapon slabbed on then it's probably going to be tough surely, and I'll probably have to drink between most pulls. 
---
But I still stand with my point that a 48 healer with good gear / talents in the right places will outperform a 50-52 healers with a dps spec that just slapped on some int/spirit gear.
---
*pounds a stein of beer* WOT CAN I GET FOR YE TODEY?
---
Main issue is that if the event starts and the first heals go out the healers get targeted first. If theydie its game over. I just keep my Divine Shield off cooldown and watch the hunter pets HP bar like a hawk when we jump down. If it takes damage, I wait a couple of seconds, shield myself and BoP the other healer then hope like hell that mages and warriors react fast enough with CC and tanking for most of the group to survive before the second wave comes. 
---
It feels wierd to prepare specific counters to such things.
---
You won't be the best at any single role, but most guilds don't care about having a perfectly optimal raid group. And you'll be the one who rescues the group or raid when shit hits the fan and a tank or healer dies, plus you'll have a bunch of cool utility stuff like Innervate. So you'll definitely be useful - as long as you can find a guild that isn't full of YouTube-worshipping idiots.
---
Please play the game in exactly the way you want
---
After so many years, I finally started doing this yesterday. I'm still in the exploration stage to find out were I can jump back up.
---
I remember raiding pre-MC and it was some of the most fun i had in vanilla.
---
How do I downvote more?
---
What are you talking about? Every second rogue I get in my group is a tank, or acts like onw.
---
How do I downvote more than once....
---
Hmm if you say so.
---
I understand that it is way easier on real classic. 
---
I just can't believe that they (on real Vanilla-Like Classic Servers at least) tuned up the HP of Raid Bosses because their only Goal all the time was to be as Close to vanilla as possible. Why would they just Play with Boss values then?
---
They got some Boss abilities wrong. Maybe they tried to compensate the "difficulty" with higher HP numbers? Or they got the damage too low and compensated with higher HP?
---
Well if you say it was on purpose I'll believe you but I have a hard time getting it in my head.. :)
---
Weird assumption. Even if you think the majority need to wait, you would still be wrong in a large amount of cases.
---
Only time I remember looking for a specific type of mob was with the Ogre's in Loch Modan. That's still only one time out of the dozens of quests that have the same model that I had already done.
---
Onyxia, since Onyxia existed, was easier the less people you had in raid. The optimal number is actually 25 men for Onyxia.
---
Yep, as much as I want to memespec ret, I'll only do it on MC farm clears when we eventually get a sulfuras drop. Every time I read about "im ret and look at all this I bring" is literally nothing more than holy, and you can still dps in holy (i do 100 dps on some bosses during dungeons, big flex lul). A ret doesn't carry their weight in dungeons, you just eat a slot from someone else doing damage.
---
That said, I'd never not invite a ret paladin to a dungeon, I just recognize that they are inferior in every single way and trying to justify ret as bringing utility is a meme in itself.
---

Is he holding threat or you feel you should go after ‚Äúwarockrino‚Äù instead ?
---
Feralas? Swimming is faster.
---
Given that 4 of the 9 classes are healing, there are tons of healers at 60 for the amount of tanks. Therefore a lot of Priests I know have switched to Shadow just so they can actually get into groups. There just are not enough tanks to support the amount of healers that exist.
---
Another fan favourite is someone ass pulling the pat that walks between first and second stairs and then jumping down. Usually happens when people still drink or are semi afk and lag behind.
---
I can't blame my friend that he suggested this, he was playing the game for 10 years or more, and maybe all that I wrote down is normal for him, he got used to it. I just want my own fun first and getting familiar with it, what I can't do if 75% of the time I'm a whisp, lol. I may come back later on to my first character and try to level it up, but at the moment, it's out of question.
---
Tried and true for how many people? Those progression servers even have changes.
---
It's a 0.1% drop, with the exception of the world boss Azuregos, and one of the hardest drops to get, it's worth a lot more then a few gold.
---
I obviously can't talk for your previously bad experiences, but my point is that if the healer knows what he is doing and isn't just some random derp that saw the name of a cool dungeon and tried to join, then he should be aware of where / how to avoid body pulling.   
---
Also talking to the tank beforehand to make sure he is aware it might happen is an excellent idea.   
---
obviously if you're just there to clear the minimal amount of trash and just corners to skip trashpacks, then for sure i agree you won't be able to bring someone lower leveled.
---
I found that mobs 3 levels below mine started aggroing in hinterlands tonight from distances they never should have. 
---
This is new in the past day or two and I think it‚Äôs bugged.  Maybe related?
---
What is the community suppose to do exactly? In many cases these are some of the largest 60 populated Horde &amp; Alliance guilds on the server. Exclude them from groups? They don't join PuGs.
---
Check price of bar before transmute. Check price of bar after transmute.
---
Find the difference and you should probably charge a little less than that and you will be good. The lower you charge, the less time you have to try and "sell" your transmute.
---
In a world where probably most players a streaming, why should we exactly care for yours, Mr. Cringypose?
---
You can get the launcher to automatically close itself completely once you‚Äôve launched WoW.

Go to settings in your blizz launcher (click on your username top left &gt; settings) and change the option from something like ‚Äòminimise the blizzard launcher‚Äô (not sure what the exact name is, it might be on a different setting for you) to ‚Äòexit the blizzard launcher completely‚Äô.

Man...my vanilla/tbc guild was &lt;Invictus&gt;. So much nostalgia in one pic!
---
I simultaneously feel like it should be the way you describe, but also feel like it'd be too unfamiliar at this point for me to like even on principle.
---
Yeah but on the other side it filters it to something like "&lt;Yourname&gt; makes an odd gesture" or something generic like that.
---
It was some of the most intense nostalgia I‚Äôve felt for a while.
---
Nearly every priest I see that isn't 60 is running around in Shadowform.
---
And when the mob is 10%.. they kill you and steal the tag.. or maybe not everyone is as satanic as I'm.
---
Where do I find that? The green box is bugging me D:
---
the good thing about classic is dps is not everything
---
you don't need a raid with 30 warri DDs, you need a raid with a balanced composition to fill out all buffs and utilities

Four hooves from seven Zhevras.  Easy game, easy life.

Troggs in Loch Modan. Those things spawn in what feels like less than 60 seconds. I'm fighting them off with my brother and they spawn back nearly as fast as it took to wipe out their pack.

Or buy the cats in Elewyn Forrest for 40s each and sell them on booty bay AH for 5g each as it's the only way horde can buy them. I also sell the rabbits for 2g each. K

That is exactly why I made this post. 8 out of 10 times when I ask why they decided to not invite me, then I get an answer looking like: "Dungeon name X-Y lvl".
---
Maybe just a little :P
---
RFC. Imagine killing dungeon bosses and they just drop no loot at all lol
---
Chop em gently so you can use the limbs lol
---
I have tried this and unfortunately it doesn't work.  But hey, thanks for responding!  I'll keep messing around.
---
Everyone says it's a facemelter in pvp but the reality is that one hunter will kill you unless you get a drop on him and in wpvp you will be ganged up on by the virtue of being a priest and easily trainable. 1v1 rarely happens and when it does it's not because you chose to, you were just lucky to land in such situation.
---
Better race than undead? You mean to tell me there is something better than cannibalizing and then spitting on your alliance kills?
---
Tru
---
Like a ring of fire
---
Details is the way to go
---
The most reliable way is to find a nice quite spot and just farm mobs of green level to you, this will net you 25-30k exp/hour and 5-10g/hour.
---
Avoid traveling to much and avoid downtime.
---
Instance is the fastest way to level IF you have a good cleave group.
---
1999, EQ Incoming %t
---
I rarely tap below 60% mid pull, between pulls though.. I'll tap and bandage and canabalize. I'm perfectly happy sitting at around 50-60% hp and just topping with drains. The only drinks I've used 1-50 so far are drinks I've found on mobs.
---
A renew is usually great, but if I'm bandaging and canabalizing don't throw me flashes then sit back down and start drinking as a sort of mini protest :P
---
I do love getting a knowledgable healer though, that just pops me renews after a couple taps, or pre-shields me on a hellfire pull
---
While I keep 3 stacks of bought drinks, two stacks of mana potions and one stack of dark runes as an emergency reserve I reserve the judgement on how to use them. If you want me to drink two sips between pulls and have me waterwalking after the charging tank you'll better pay the water bill. Hey, if you want to be a sport about it just all pass the first green/blue two hand nobody needs and I'm fine. But why should I spend a couple of gold in water and mana potions when the run is doing its utmost best to wasting these supplies. 
---
Fun fact, if the warrior uses a shield, pulls one group at a time and all kickable aoe attacks, heals get disrupted + CC is used when convenient a healer doesn't need water for the whole run. 
---
I've run a  damage taken - meter now for almost all of my runs. It's interesting to see that in the same dungeon the total group damage taken can vary by a factor of 10 and still be a full run with no wipes. 
---
In the end a dedicated healer with gear, experience and talents can keep a mage or warlock tanking full pulls in Strat and Scholo alive. Just expect him to blow through every consumable, cooldown and nerve he has.
---
What population did your pvp server have (low mid high)
---
So for hunters BM is the leveling spec and MM is the raiding spec. Is there a time before 60 that's good to switch or do I dungeon, get pre BIS, and then switch over?
---
I agree, the group decides who they want to invite and that's fair.
---
Well.  
---
"But thank you for following up"  
---
"Thank you, have a good nigth"  
---
Is a pretty clear conversation ending for me
---
Guess someone needed to fulfill is quota.
---
If the alternative is death, bubble hearthing is a clear upgrade, and therefore a win
---
I came from a PvE realm back in Vanilla and decided to roll PvP realm in classic. Back in vanilla, I really didn‚Äôt know that I picked a PvE server, I just found a decently populated realm at random.
---
I‚Äôve got to say, I‚Äôm in love with PvP realms. Yes, getting ganked can be frustrating, but it‚Äôs helped me learn some valuable tactics against certain classes that I‚Äôve never known before. Yes, when you see a skull level enemy roaming you feel helpless, but when you and a group of frustrated individuals and lure him into a trap and kill him, then proceed to camp him, it feels incredible. 
---
I‚Äôm level 51 rogue on a highly populated classic realm, and when I fly into a lower level zone and I see people saying their getting camped, you bet your ass I‚Äôm mounting up and riding out to help. 
---
All these moments have made my experience on a PvP realm so valuable and interesting. And trust me, I totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from. It hurts seeing people mad or sad that their getting camped and ganked, especially when theres level 60s in a level 20 zone because they can‚Äôt make it into a raid group. That‚Äôs why I try to help out as much as possible, even if it‚Äôs an out numbered situation, I can at least distract them from the people questing (I don‚Äôt really care if they kill me, 1 durability loss to a random piece of gear is meaningless lol). 
---
Hope you get back to having fun with the game and enjoying it!
---
only 11 more arcanite bars to go....
---
I am a tank on Dreadmist alli side. After every instance, if I feel that ive enjoyed the party, I always tell the guys to add me to their friend list if they ever need a tank. I'm receiving whispers daily to go and tank for these guys. It is a win win situation. I dont have to look around and organize a group, and they dont have to spam chat all day.
---
Bruh....druids are viable tanks, healers and dps throughout leveling. Also has the second fastest leveling speed behind hunters due to heals, travel form, cat form, beat form, etc. at endgame pve druids can heal and tank efficiently due to it being patch 1.12.1 however dps isn‚Äôt viable unless min maxing feral  and remaining middle of the pack. Endgame pvp druids are the only flag carriers and strive in 1v1 especially against melee and mages. In group pvp they provide offheals, dispels, stuns, roots, solid pressure, good spread damage due to dots and decent overall dps. So yes in general druids are viable...in my opinion top 3 overall most viable and probs top most viable in every aspect of the game...they don‚Äôt really have any downsides considering they can do the 31/20 build throughout their entire wow lifetime.
---
It originated from Everquest fun fact.
---
I don't think it's a secret so, it's StoneSpine (Usually high populated, early in the days it's mid)
---
They do this in retail. And it doesn't work.
---
Alliance in retail pretty much always have a constant 30% bonus to Rep, gold and anything else you earn from World Quests in the game and they are still the faction that gets stomped on the most in world PvP. Horde comparatively gets 10%.
---
'Again' means that he stopped, he would have said 'still' otherwise.
---
nice for warlocks but no BiS, since it's only direct damage it's no shadow item
---
Is ur reddit name from tales of vesperia
---
We did it yesterday with 40man the first time on one of the new servers and it was an absolute joke... first try no deaths
---
Sure they don't *need* to but it makes a massive difference if they're 4-5 levels higher. Can do bigger pulls and less time spent drinking can make runs significantly more efficient.
---
That... Doesn't sound right. They shouldn't be able to see your passwords. They're not stored as plain text I hope.
---
Would you be so kind to share the weapon swap macro? Also big gz on the staff!!!
---
Banic*
---
I‚Äôm actually looking for a place to settle in classic. Made a few characters on different servers and can‚Äôt seem to find a place. What faction are you playing?
---
I was sub since level 10, it works, I wouldn't say it slows down levelling when you can survive a lot easier. You may not be able to chop things as fast from the front in comparison to a sub rogue but you can chop them from the back twice as fast, if you crit you kill mobs in about 4 seconds.
---
I think it would be very useful for cross class comparisons. 
---
Within each class it would just be junk of course, like for warlocks whoever has the curse most in line with the raid comp will have the most 'damage'.
---
I just wish people could keep their LFG spam to the correct channel instead of flooding the tradechat..

---
I saw it for 40g on the AH presumably because someone lost a 0. It stayed there for 10 minutes but I only had 25g...
---
Sounds like you're gonna run out of mana after 1 mob
---
Remember the Chen-Pudge fountain hooks from TI3? That shit is an exploit on an even greater level than this, except that it was completely legal. It‚Äôs simply an interesting use of game mechanics, and there is no reason for any reasonable player to expect it to be a bannable offence (*especially* in an **RPG** of all genres). Instead of banning these players for ‚Äúexploiting‚Äù, they should simply fix the unintended mechanic. Arbitrary, non-sensicle rule.
---
For the best xp/hr do just 1-2 Uldaman Questruns to get the XP from the \~6 Doungeon Quests. After that Uldaman is not worth farming it for xp.  
---
Better do ZF grinding it was for me the fasted method until lvl 50-52. It gives you about 50-80k xp/hr depending on your group.
---
What the entire fuck. I know we‚Äôve been shlepping classic dev jizz but this is incredibly disrespectful. Lack of respect will ends my subscription faster than anything at all. Need this to be out more.
---
Leveling minority Alliance as well und had a ton of fun in Vietna- i mean Stranglethorn.
---
My levelspeed sucked, but I am just the PvP kinda guy I guess.
---
I shreddes that horde scum to pieces.
---
Sometimes they did with me as well, only 1 group camped me which I then returned the favor after getting a lucky 1shot crit.
---
no, this is a superior version of pvp, called wpvp
---
Lvl 60 preraid bis dps warrior here.. I got bodied by 3 mages and a priest last night very easily so my pride is completely gone and im sad
---
I love that shit! This is what classic is about. I always carry extra potions for warriors I see along my journeys.
---
That's where you're wrong because nobody signs up for groups in their main spec, everyone is just filling whatever roles are needed in order to get gear for leveling. And even at 60 you may choose to fill a tank or heal role even though you main dps or vice versa. Doesn't mean you have any less right to roll on the gear for your main spec.
---
I did it this weekend. It worked. Dont know why a GM would say it doesnt.
---
Nope, life tap if you have to and drain life when you don't have aggro. You're good to go.
---
Which level would you recommend me to start doing zf? 43?
---
I understand that it's really annoying having that as your first experience but let me tell you a story I play on zandalar tribe eu where the sides are pretty even so when I kept having to somehow get sin'dall I called out in general chat we got a full group of annoyed hordies and just started deleting the alliance until they did the same classic isn't about the game it's about the people you meet in the world of warcraft
---
not using questie
---
this was intended for 1-25 levels so you wouldnt be going to booty bay or being a higher level questing. I feel like the bunnies lose their worth after lvl 30 and you could just make more questing,grinding, selling tailoring items ect
---
That's awful to hear. I hope you can find someone who will make you happy.
---
Don't want to brag, just want you to know that yesterday I went to SM Armory and found the love of my life, Herod.
---
Before the dungeon, me and shaman wanted the axe and shaman #2 wanted the helmet.
---
First he dropped an axe for me, then the helmet and then the axe again. I love him so much.
---
I believe everyone can find that one NPC who will love you back :)
---
Why is it so good for pally?
---
lol, no I mean face. My character looks like a dwarf priest just told him it has an undead fetish.
---
Then how do you see quest icons on the map?
---
true that
---
How'd he get your private personal info in the first place.
---
you don't want to be in such groups anyway.
---
it sucks, but move on and if you find a good group add everybody on friend list and be proactive in keeping in touch, as a rogue the fact is you are in less demand and you have to work extra hard to get a good reputation
---
You would be surprised how many people smoke weed but neither look like it nor tell you

"Heartseeker is just as imba as Stalagg, just in the opposite direction.
---
There are more 60 human warriors online than there are 60 horde.
---
Trade, LFG, and World go by on Heartseeker Alliance almost as fast as Stalagg Horde, but all three channels are dead on Heartseeker Horde.
---
Heartseeker Alliance has 22.6k auctions of 2463 unique items while Heartseeker Horde has approx 12k auctions of 1100 unique items.
---
There are twice as many level 28-40 Alliance in STV as there are Horde in the same level bracket.
---
Don‚Äôt let anyone fool you. I thought about transferring and it‚Äôs just not worth it."
---
For anyone curious about my claims, I made a character on Heartseeker and did /who (and joined the appropriate channels / ran to a major city). On Horde I only had to break STV into two level brackets, 28-40 and 41-60. On Alliance I had to break it up into 4 brackets. For doing /who 60, as Horde I had to /who 60 class. on Alliance I had to /who 60 class, and for warrior I had to /who 60 class race. For Human Warriors I had to further /who 60 warrior human zone because there was more than 50. There were 77 level 60 Horde and nearly 100 level 60 human warriors. There were 5 level 60 horde hunters and 55 alliance ones. 
---
This was around 11pm EST (8pm PST), a bit late for the server but not so much that there should be that big of an imbalance.
---
Of course, and I completely agree with you. This post isn't made to force people into inviting lower leveled healers, but to make more people aware that healers chasing a dungeons requirements with 2 levels could heal it just as fine as a healer just beating it. Especially if the lower leveled one has resto talents and proper gear for it.
---
I never played private server but played WoW Beta and the entirety of Vanilla. I remember what OP‚Äôs describing too.
---
This has to be user error, either yoire not adding the tight bnet tag or you're already friends and he's ignored you accidentally.
---
Unless you got good gear. At 30 i feel better than ever before.
---
Cencus addon can clear data after 30days inactivity. 
---
How ever the cencus addon has been shut down by blizzard.
---
Yeah that is the same for me. Shadow is the leveling spec.
---
I'm just saying I don't see more priests in General than I should be seeing. There is no Obsession with priests. It is just that you Level as a shadow if you don't plan on doing dungeons all the way to 60
---
Viability depends on the people you play with and the friends you make
---
How were the trolls the invaders? They've been around longer than pretty much every other race.
---
I'm the "Dude, I'm so high right now" guy.
---
You're welcome.
---
Thank you for sharing your experience, I might come back to this server later on and try to level up and help lower level fellas who sharing the same pain as I did!  
---
I find myself a rather helpful person, always sharing stuff and help where I can, so I can definitely see myself doing this in the future.
---
Everyone is cute when you‚Äôre that drunk
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Promoting/Demoting are restricted functionality. Addons cant do it.
---
Most dungeons dont actually need tanks. You'd have to go to like ST or BRD before tanks become a necessity (you can actually just outheal it on a fury warrior. Works in brd and strath).
---
I generally send the VW in, when he makes his first hit I cast immolate, CoA, corruption, life tap, shadow bolt, want until dead. If my hp starts dwindling I'll sub shadow bolt for a drain life or 2.
---
big oof
---
Never understood why this is a problem to begin with tbh.
---
If blizzard designs guards badly, I should be well within my rights to use that to have fun.
---
Its not like it yields any tangible benefits like the layering abuse.
---
And also, if someone else is doing it I cant go up there to kill them because now Im also liable for punishment.
---
Its just stupid.
---
That's explain your issues then basically on high pop servers all the layers are full but don't account for how many horde/alliance are on it resulting in what happens to you. Sometimes I only see horde sometime I only see alliance even knowing we have a 56 44 balance
---
IF you enjoy ret then i say go for it. not many can say they enjoy auto attacking everything to death. as long as you find it fun and your willing to except the fact you wont be topping any dps charts then i say go for it.  as long as your able to reliably show up for raids then i guarantee a guild somewhere out there will accept you.
---
Looks like dw tank is not meme build
---
Tearing up requires investing in the community. It'll come down to finding the guild whose time requirements match your time commitments
---
also, their inns are a single open-room with one bed, no table and no chair
---
Lol shaman average/below is that why they share seats with priests in raids?
---
The server won‚Äôt be at max capacity, they will be at vanilla capacity as they‚Äôve stated numerous times(~=3k people)
---
Same thing applies to serious spelladins, ie the only right way of playing ret pally.
---
GM GM  - Did i do this right?
---
But Voone is dropping the rosewine ring, which I thought got put in his loot table way after 1.12
---
How did you know? haha
---
If you're hiring IT specialists to do helpdesk stuff then there's your problem.
---
Most IT specialists I know of /hate/ helpdesk stuff. They'll suffer it if it's part of the job, but they didn't get into the field to do glorified customer service, and quite a few of them that I know have taken a pay cut just to get out of helpdesk work.
---
Personally I dont tank dungeons I am not very familiar with. Despite the fact I actually like tanking a lot.
---
Some of them are special Argent Dawn rolls they work in a different way :)
---
It's pretty good, very light read, the pacing is a bit weird at points.
---
for all who dont get it, this post is sarcasm. its directed towards daily posts about how someone has 8 completed quests in one place.
---
&gt; around our age
---
You were five months old when the game came out.
---
More of a blood elf NE's are not that pretty or skinny.
---
what the fuck
---
Crossing the bridge in to Menethil i come across a rogue standing on the edge. I cry out DON'T DO IT! He says he was only posing for a picture,  and proceeded to rob me because as he said, he was a rogue. Luckily he believed that i only had 1 copper, and let me go. This is btw the tldr version. Whole thing lasted a good 10 mins. Love these encounters.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how it‚Äôs BiS until like phase 3-4.
---
Opens by using FROST NOVA, literally all this guy knows how to do is aoe farm lmao.
---
They weren't looking at my password. They were looking at my security questions.
---
Nice! Me and my friends ran into that guy in Westfall the other day.
---
I remember this because I ran up to him, yelled "YOU'RE A WARLOCK, HARRY!", and ran off.
---
Oh they in season now huh 
---
Too bad I forgot about the summer fish
---
Unfortunately it seems it was a rough, unlucky 2 days for me, then. At least the game provides options such as moving to a PvE server for cases like that.
---
Drink the bucket GM
---
&gt; Well there are a few "cheats" (addons) 
---
LOL
---
Addons like Questie are standard amongst the majority of people calling something like that "cheats" leaves a bad elitist taste behind.
---
What OP is looking for is something like aoe dungeon grinding or farmspots that could be lightly exploited.
---
That is completely okay, this post wan't made to force people into inviting low levels healers, and there is a ton of reasons a group can have to invite higher levels healers, like you just described. I'm just trying to make more people aware that the level difference alone shouldn't be the sole factor in deciding whether or not to invite someone. But other than that I completely agree with you.
---
Heal as Ret then. Interesting. I take it he was bottom of the meters?
---
Mine is the tank not bothering to switch targets or actually bother to cast any shouts in the first few rotations for aggro.
---
Dudu tank here, I agree. Its basically everyone. I need bloody time to make sure i got aggro on mobs before people can go to town with aoe. 2 mobs is easy, 3 is slightly more RNG and +3 becomes a tab targetting swipe spamming, sometimes weaving in maul - nightmare.
---
Rogue question:
---
I am currently lvl 51 and running the Combat build.
---
I got the thrasher Blade and the rfd Blade (forgot the Name). Yesterday i picked Up the Epic bloodrazor.
---
Which Combination do you recommend? Overall statwise the Combo bloodrazor and rfd Blade seems better but i am not Sure.
---
Well, Gnomes are almost American Football sized and probably fairly aerodynamic.
---
Gnomes are for punting, Dwarves are for throwing (like hammerthrowing) because they are so cubic and dense.
---
The circle of life can be cruel...
---
Human's reaction to the Orcs is because they literally committed genocide on half of the ***continent*** during the first War, and tried to wipe out the rest of the humans in the second war. And even then, after being wiped out of existence the humans decided to imprison the Orcs, rather than wiping *them* out in return.
---
Meanwhile, many Horde people like to point out how irate and downright evil humans are in Warcraft. Poor Orcs and Trolls.
---
There is that phrase again that people do not understand what it means!
---
Bug abuse != clever use of game mechanic
---
KEEP YER MEAT UNDERGROUND
---
Ok
---
I watch a very very very small streamer who plays his druid very well, he also explains a lot of things about his class. Watched him level to 60, raid MC, raid ony, explain the different specs, different play styles, but most importantly he explains that druids have a high skill ceiling. He constantly 1v3s in the open world when farming, and talks me and the other 6 or so viewers through the thought process. Yesterday I started my druid because of him, and he sat and explained to me what talent points in feral I should get first, and that if I have a mage buddy by the time I'm high enough level to get insect swarm that I can just grab 200 water and play balance aoe grind. Not gonna link in case it's again sub rules, but feel free to PM me if you want link to him.
---
Tldr: druids not weak, just not as straight forward as the other classes, have high skill ceiling and I watch someone who demonstrates this 6 days a week.
---
So, I can explain, given I‚Äôm the one who named the guild. 
---
We had a Discord server for IRL friends playing games together, we slowly brought new players in and the community grew, initially, it was called ‚ÄúThe Ferret Den‚Äù, as one of our friends is named Ferret, we started playing Rivals of Aether, which is a great competitive smash clone. We wanted to rebrand the group, as it felt unfair that the community was named after just one player, we decided to rebrand in 2016 to just ‚ÄòDEN‚Äô, starting with my annual SmilesLAN at my house, which became DEN-LAN, this worked out nicely, as our name would fit as a 3 character clan tag on Rivals of Aether, and we just thought it looked better in caps. Then the same group decided to form a WoW guild for Classic, to relive our glory days of Vanilla, and here we are, just a bunch of WoW Hipsters.
---
I'm afraid I can't resist pointing out that "nobody says a word" is literally surrounded by player quotes.
---
Wyke!
---
BUT they get to wear their tier sets.
---
(just saying they're gonna remove layers In a few months, can't wait until we actually get to play the game again
---
Link?
---
This is so funny, I always type out "one sec" I could have made bank with your strat
---
Hey your name is familiar! Is this on razorgrore?
---
I think we ran an instance recently though I cannot seem to remember what it was lol.
---
Its not offspec though
---
They can ride Baron Rivendares Deathcharger.
---
Im in the eu rp realm
---
Did you have a small stroke?
---
Switch that around mate
---
Bears issues aren't survivability so no, I'm not
---
Balance and survival are dead specs oomkin can work in pvp but goes oom to early in pve
---
This is what happens when you fire more than half of your current GM staff, and likely farm out the void created to a cheap Indian sub-contractor that only cares about meeting quota.
---
Its important to always secure your loot. There might not even be logs for unlooted items so they cant be recovered.
---
We use shammy tanks too... Theyre super good for generating aoe aggro...Slightly squishy tho...
---
FD trap is supposed to work even if you have your pet out, with the entirety of Kalimdor beating on it, and it's soloing Ragnaros while being beat.
---
FD removed combat on cast, regardless of the pet's combat state. You'll eventually re-enter combat because of the pet, but you did leave combat, and there's both PvE and PvP videos from vanilla proving it.
---
Even right now, you can occasionally see combat working correctly, where mobs pull onto your pet and attack it, but you don't personally enter combat.
---
lol that gimmick existed in dota 1 and nobody cared until dendi wins some TI games.  people even knew they had "tested" this and thought it was a joke not something they'd actually try on a big stage.
---
I've got most of the arcane crystals just need to pay some alchemists for x-mute for my personal helm
---
Then you get corpse-spawned for hours by hordies, effectively wasting more time than by heartstoning away.
---
Only if you reject, if you ignore it wont.
---
Bears main issues with tanking in vanilla isn't survivability so this staff doesn't help solve those problems
---
Warrior question;
---
Looking for an addon that shows me a "timer" for my auto attacks in the Twitch app. Looked for auto attack timer, attack timer as well as swing timer but couldn't find one.
---
I already got Details installed, not sure if they have this kind of feature (i couldn't find it) so if it does, could someone walk me through how to turn it on?
---
Feeling like a hacker When you macro mortal strike and startattack together B)
---
I wasn't always running, when I saw a little bit of chance to fight them, I tried to do so, even if I ended up dying most of the times. It's part of the game and I can't say it's not fun at all, PvP has it's own magic and fun to enjoy. Just not the way it's presented most of the times.
---
I'm using elvui but it's a complete new ui
---
Holy paladins are quite good with consecration actually.
---
I ganked a 34 warrior for hours around Sin‚Äôdahl location in STV for like 2 hours on Saturday. Was that you?
---
He was so helpless, and I was farming elder tigers in the area so I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from just ending him every time he respawned.
---
I am lvl 35 too and I hardly get into pvp at all on a overpopulated pvp server.  It really amazes me how peaceful questing is,  most evenings I get killed once. (and I kill them too sometimes)    but 9 out of 10 times  the red player and me run past each other or even quest peacefully side to side.   Maybe it helps that I am a fluffy druid, either in animal form or a big cuddly tauren....    Maybe it helps that I am Horde, although to my knowledge we don't have that big of a population advantage on our server. 
---
You have to play a bit smart and AVOID the  quest bottlenecks where both alliance and horde compete for exactly the same quest mobs.  The famous Yeti Cave in Hillsbrad Foothills is a prime example.  Going there as alliance on your own is suicide.  But if take care  you really should be able to  dodge most unwanted pvp.
---
Note: I say most, not all.  there will always be some trigger happy ganker, but it really isn't that bad.
---
Stephen King said it best
---
you don't have sex just to cum
---
*unless you're trying to get pregnant*
---
I aint going to lie im the kind of guy who likes a nice kill 60 boar quest over take this letter to this guy for 800xp and then another letter to this other guy
---
That's the problem though, you should be able to trap even if your pet is out and attacking. Currently you can't and that's a bug
---
Gratz
---
And then you work them to death, so they're pissed and don't care.
---
only if y'all pay me for rep-costs
---
Swing Timer = Your auto attack timer
---
I didn't know that, thanks for the information. I may check back that time, then.
---
Underrated comment \^
---
&gt; If blizzard designs guards badly 
---
The problem is, they can't just "fix" the guards and change their behaviour, because then people would scream \#nochanges
---
This Vanilla/Classic is a tricky business
---
after all you're regenerating 5 health per second and there's nothing anyone can do about it
---
Many are using a macro that also puts their pets on passive, which is enough to satisfy the condition of dropping combat.
---
The problem is the results are inconsistent. If I test it now, sometimes the ice trap will go down immediately. Sometime there will be a slight pause which I might attribute to spell batching. Sometime there seems to be a extended wait that looks like 2 GCD's before I can drop a trap while still on the ground - it's that last part which causes issues in PVP.
---
There are still MMOS around to this day exactly like this .
---
I love MMOs like that you dont always need a quest and a carrot in the stick.
---
I'm a rogue and I completely agree. They are also fun to play.
---
Does %f work, since you're his focus?
---
In what order should I spend my skill points? As it is under build in that link?
---
it's alright you don't lose too much and you gain more int. you're less efficient so if fights drag on thats when you'll notice.
---
I will still kick out a lvl 23 healer if they try to come to Gnomeregan with a 30+ team.
---
I would imagine watching all layers for people doing this shit in several servers would be tiring. I'm sure GMs are understaffed for Classic so I would give this one a pass.
---
Ret Paladin is competitive in PvP and can make his Pre Raid BIS/PVP Gear work a lot longer then most other classes. Just don't expect to compete on a even playing field in dungeon blues when the enemy is fully BWL geared. 
---
To get access to raids you'll either need to heal or have a very understanding raid that is willing to fill empty spots with Ret Paladins. 
---
Even getting high PvP rank gear might require you to specc healing for premades, it's not that Ret is bad in PvP it's just that a healing paladin offers more. 
---
A 20/0/31 or 21/0/31 specc should help you. Shockadin or Reccbomber are an alternative but Shockadin will at least require ZG loot and reccbombers are fairly good in 1v1 but they either lack damage or healing compared to ret in group situations.
---
Hey man, it's not a race it's a journey. 
---
All that matters is having fun and moving at your own pace
---
Not from 3 delivery quests
---
*Laughs in standing on the boat like a chad not caring about 1-2 minutes waiting*
---
Hey I have a benchmarking question. I see your stats and items. Can u tell me your dps at couple dungeon bosses and raid bosses so I can compare with mine. How much difference will it make to go from 600 ap to 700 ap or from 180-200 to 200-230 damage?
---
Yeah, would prefer ro stick to the original ui tbh
---
Ret paladins don't get raid slots because why would you bother when you can get literally anything else.
---
If they are going by the rules from vanilla, yes, you could get banned for wall jumping back then if someone reported you.
---
https://classicdiscord.com/ has a list of a lot of classic wow discords - per realm, class, etc
---
ROFL
---
same. i had an issue with a quest npc not giving me the turn in for an uldaman quest. the npc issue dates back to vanilla wow and requires a server/npc reset before the quest can be completed. the gm told me there was nothing he could do for my "achivement". not kidding. achievements arent even in the game buddy.
---
It'll happen when the next raids and pvp system comes anyway have fun on your pve realm!
---
Yeah, so dont change it?
---
Terrain exploits were a big part of vanilla, policing them now is super anti classic tbh, just like taking out walljummping.
---
Going into hyjal or top of Ironforge were some of my fondest vanilla memories, and now I cant do that.
---
Sure thing, but I don't imagine someone would try and join a dungeon 6 levels ahead of them. This post and my point entirely revolves around 1-2 levels behind the requirements.
---
Given a tanky build and appropriate resistance type, BM is dps and offtank at the same time and should help alleviate the healer's job while grinding the dungeons while you get your bis.
---
I have to comment just to say this is factually incorrect. I was a GM for 6 years and was a part of the first layoff that happened. You're not on some list to watch, etc. There are thousands and thousands of requests that come in a day. GM's do not have the time to go and keep tabs on someone.
---
What most likely happened to the OP was that they were somewhere they weren't supposed to be (on a wall or on the top of the arena) and the GM saw them and anyone else on it and whispered them. If they caught someone in the act, they would have taken action. You were just warned. Just like if you report someone for language, they are going to look at both sides of the story and if both parties cursed at each other, they'll either just consider it an argument that's now over and will do nothing or they will action both of you.
---
Oh and lastly, the GM did nothing wrong when it comes to the policy or procedures. So reporting them will lead to nothing. Save yourself and the GM team some time and don't submit something reporting them.
---
Hope that helps OP!
---
&gt; Greetings, got a moment to speak?
---
What's wrong with that? Apart for being a tad informal.
---
Should be "Greetings, do you have a moment to speak"?
---
It is a cheat if it gives you information you shouldn't have.
---
Except the Draenei didn't consciously draw the Legion to Draenor. That was an accident, and accidents aren't evil.
---
As a combat rogue I am 99% of the time on top, I use Details!
---
You can start at 43 or maybe even 42 but you'll be locked out of certain A-tier strats that require everyone to be 46+ or so to pull off so its best to form a group of all 43-45's so that no one is annoyed by this. Also don't be hurt when people want 46+ or even higher. People are doing this until 50 and by the time they're in the high 40's people start to expect a pretty fast pace.
---
No ice barrier or blink or anything, it hurts to watch.
---
Then you could use elvui and only replace the nameplates (the things over the mobs) and keep the rest of the ui classix
---
What‚Äôs a good place to farm wool cloth at the lower levels?
---
It's a common problem in high populated areas during peak hours. I can already think of a couple of examples: troggs in loch modan, harpies in stonetalon, South of ratchet, kurzen compound in stv, swashbucklers in stv, ...
---
WoW lore has trolls being the first race. Elves are corrupt trolls, naga and satyr are corrupt elves.
---
More information leads to better decisions and outcomes for everyone.
---
What you never enjoyed a little torture while growing up?
---
Are you trying to tell me you're too good for torture?
---
leave STV and go to Alterac Mountains / Desolace / Swamp of Sorrows / Arathi Highlands
---
Avoid caves and quest areas where both alliance and horde need to kill the same mobs.  With this you can avoid most unwanted pvp and you still will have enough quests.  Disadvantage:  more travel time, as you will be forced to go to more zones and do travel quests.
---
It also absolves the perpetrators of responsibility and places it on the targets. It‚Äôs a terrible mindset.
---
Maybye promote the fucking helpdesk guys?
---
Newsflash not everyone wants to sit on helpdesk for 5 years LMFAO.
---
The way you said that like "how dare they want to advance there career fuck them"
---
Keep on charging the enemy so long as the healer has mana
---
FTFY
---
Ahh a fan of OpTic as well as classic wow. A good man  ü§ù
---
memories &lt;3 the hours I spent farming this in vanilla. never seen a single one.
---
‚ÄúHey, is there an aldor quest, where the objective is to sleep with my mother?‚Äù
---
Hmm, i'll try it out when i get back home
---
Thanks
---
Best thing is in the only rogue in my guild and I start raiding MC/ONY this week. I‚Äôll probably be geared in 2-3 weeks with most my BiS gear.
---
You are a very viable healer if you are speced to shockading, since you have to go through the whole holy-tree anyways. 
---
Also, shocakdins aren't unpopular at all.
---
I try to weave a raptor strike in my rotation. For now, at level 35, it does similar damage to 2 bad autoshots. At most you lose 1 autoshot during this, depending on weapon speed. 
---
Might be fun in raids with windfury, on certain bosses that allow it!
---
Havent had a chance to dps a boss yet with it sadly most dungeon bosses will die withing 10 combo points so theres just no way to extract any crude data  regarding that
---
Good luck not having aggro when you're spamming sb
---
‚ÄúWHY DO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WANT TO ADVANCE IN THEIR CAREER INSTEAD OF WORKING AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB FOR LOWER PAY INDEFINITELY?!?!?!‚Äù
---
At 60 its usually down to the fact that several of the prebis items are shared betwen warriors and rogues, and if a warrior makes a group and tanks the dungeon he can pick and choose who to invite.
---
Why run strat baron 60 runs for cloak when you can run it 30 times right.
---
Haha. Every time!
---
It is not a offense if it annoys you /ignore em
---
In other words "I received a verbal warning for PvP exploit while participating in PvP in off-limits areas, explained the GM that I didn't exploit, they said "Thank you, have a good night", didn't follow up anyhow and disconnected."
---
WOW WHAT A SHIT GM!
---
Blizzard literaly devil since Activision took over!!!!
---
This outrage culture is ridiculous.
---
How do I disable default auras (in the top right corner)? I have setup weakaura, so don't need those now.
---
Nobody wants to give gear to a shadow priest either, your only being taken to buff warlocks, who will get all the gear shadow priests would otherwise get. 
---
Also, no teir gese goes to shadow priests either.
---
Most guilds will also rather have one priest go a gimped healing spec than actually bring a shadow priest.
---
the summer fish doesnt make anything useful though, just make tendor wolf steak instead
---
I read it when it came out. For glorified fan fiction (which all WoW books are), its pretty good. Definitly worth it if you love Warcraft.
---
Oh my bad, search "WeaponSwingTimer" with no spaces and you should find it
---
The title makes no sense lol
---
Just try
---
can confirm fear is unusable outside pvp
---
You mean you bully those lower levels or already engaged, and run from a fair or evenly matched fight. Yeah I know how the alliance works.
---
It's funny that reminds me I was in hillsbrad the other night, level 27 hunter (me), up runs a 28 druid who immediately moonfires me, before my brain catches up.... Cheap shot by a 32 rogue (32- that's red to me BTW).
---
These cowards didn't realise I had a pet rogue of my own in hiding (same level as me), he jumps on the druid as the rogue chases me down, he gets the hunters mark and my pets fury, followed up with a wing clip, run till Bow distance, serpent sting, aspect of the cheetah, now you're fucked!
---
By the time this idiot nelf realised there ain't shit he can do he tried running back to his druid boyf but alas my rogue had dispatched it. From there it was just auto shoot until dead.
---
Anyway..... You can't intimidate the Horde when this is the kinda plays your lot pull off!
---
/cries
---
Exactly helpdeak is the step in the door.
---
No persin dreams to be on helpdesk lol its a foot in the door.
---
Nah he did well, still a paladin at the end of the day, probably get a hybrid build if you're really worried.
---
No problems so far. Maybe find a tank who can hold aggro?
---
I don't like to generalize on this matter. Not **ALL** of the Horde players are abusing gank squads and even though I never seen any, but I'm pretty sure there are alliance members who do the same as well., it's really just player dependent. I've met some horde players who waved to me, dance with me, blow a kiss and just moved on.  
---
About questing, I never tried to go into places where there was a horde group questing together, but sometimes they have tasks to do the opposite way I was running, and they turned around and chased me down through half of the map just to kill me. That can be somewhat frustrating, like "You have nothing better to do?"
---
Best all around spec at 60. There is a tank shortage so you can tank your own dungeon groups and charge others for your tanking.  You can also heal all content in game
---
It's time to remove the horde faction
---
First UI i actually want to try! What is it called? Just GW2 UI?
---
So aggro | castbar | dot duration | dbm ... are all considered cheats by you ?
---
There really isn't. The mobs that will drop wool on the low side of the level range tend to drop linen, too. The mobs at the top end tend to drop silk. Find somewhere with level 24ish humanoids and go to town on them.
---
It's a server side issue there is nothing you can do
---
this mage is just very bad. If you're so static in your gameplay, don't roll on a pvp server you're just going to get destroyed every time
---
I'm way to paranoid about running out of ammo personally. Even If i have like 12/16 slots full of ammo I go get 4more stacks just to be safe

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-dungeons-overview
---
Depends on the shit
---
If you're in dungeons yeah but seeing as the question was about general leveling I assume it was rotations to use while questing and there's no way you're vw can hold aggro that well
---
Thank you very much! I hope you'll have a great time playing the game as well!
---
Thanks for the info man!  
---
Btw, how did you manage to speak to him without being transformed? If you have the rod in the bank you can't really use it to speak to him, can you? That's what I thought yesterday.
---
Hello warrior friend. Get "weapon swing timer" from Curse addons webside for wow classic. PM me if you want some hidden pro tips with it too. ;)
---
And when they did it once, they went and did the exact same thing again. That's beyond accidents.
---
We still had guides. Deadlybosses or deadly-bosses was a website before even being an in-game mod, iirc. Not literally right when the game launched, but millions of people were playing the game and that produced plenty of information about the game.
---
One thing that's different is that the people who are 20-somethings now and smack in the middle of the reddit demographic aren't 8-12 years old anymore and thus are much better at understanding numbers and game mechanics.
---
Why is this classic wow
---
Well you know what you Need.
---
Why don't you just answer yourself? :D
---
I don't know what is needed. List it to me and I may answer your question
---
It‚Äôs interesting how some fights go. When I was lvl 33, a lvl 39 warrior charged at me while I was running around in Dustwallow Marsh. Apparently he didn‚Äôt see the 2 crocs between us and the 1v1 turned into an easy 3v1 lol.
---
R/imgay
---
What ?
---
I mean, who the fuck would voluntarily roll on a streamer server and put up with its bullshit queues to then join a guild tag advertises as being 'anti-streamer'.
---
Oh absolutely, I assumed he meant rotation for dungeons. Anyway, it would be the same solo, but with less SB and more wand.
---
I think a better way to get what you are saying, across to the community is that the minimum level requirement for a dungeon is usually ok for a healer.
---
You do have to be a bit more careful with aggro but it's usually ok if the healer meets the minimum, since they are focused on the group.
---
-cheers
---
I make good use of thorns, Ret-aura, Naglering, and on-use trinkets like Heart of the Scale &amp; Ramstein's lightning, that help keep the aggro passively, but it requires that you inform your dps when they're able to cleave/AoE.  
---
I run a lot of Strat Live, and i tell them on 4 targets, they can AoE/Cleave once skull is dead, and on 3 targets i just need 2-3 seconds until they can go nuts. The way i keep the aggro is simply i spread my threat around with sunder, shield slam and revenge's and then keep applying sunders on targets that needs threat, and then stun/taunt skull as needed, after ofc having applied a little threat on it on the pull with a shield slam/sunder depending on rage.   
---
On bigger AoE pulls 5+, you need Holy water, Engineering grenades or use your on-use trinkets to have any chance, demo as you charge in to keep mobs off healer, maybe TC, then start praying that dps aren't retarded and can keep themselves alive. Because you're bound to loose aggro on some of the mobs, immediatly taunt them and then use what ever abilities you have available to use.
---
I give away so many potions when I'm in groups. I'm still working on my professions so I have way more herbs than I could ever use and some of the potions that I make to free up bag space just aren't very beneficial to me. My group mates are always super thankful and it helps us keep questing. Everyone gets int, healing potions and armor potions. Casters get mana potions and melee get strength potions.
---
Congrats, Grad
---
I will with things like https://youtu.be/jZXNIvuEuko
---
Yes, but then you have to be the nanny for 2 hours.
---
Thanks a lot, I have installed it! It's kind of stupid how it can't find things based on keywords. Like it came up with no results for Swing Timer but when i write it as you said, it shows the plugin.
---
Nah, I've submitted screenshots of my friends and ignore list to GMs. We can both talk to each other so I'm not ignored by him either.
---
I see one in this picture.
---
It's seems pretty balanced.
---
&gt; for the absolutely worst-possible leveling experience of any class
---
If you're a dedicated solo player, determined to do quests and never socialize with other people, yeah.
---
Grab any other person you run into and quest through a zone together with them, and suddenly you'll see warriors are just godly at anything that's not 1v1ing mobs. No downtime, some of the best damage, great cleave potential. Not to mention you never have to wait to find groups for dungeons, you're the tank, you're the person that other people wait for.
---
Even at solo leveling though, paladins and (non-Feral) druids have it way worse, but of course warriors never see that because they're privileged like that, thinking getting to be the best class in the game is somehow a reward for their struggle. :p
---
Wrong sub. Drama about people on yt/Twitch whatever goes to FB or any matching sub.
---
He has me added through Bnet but I don't have him and can't add him.
---
Dude, charging for mage water a non-guildie / random dungeon team member is absolutely fine. We non-Mage mana users have to buy our own water and a stack of it costs well over 1 gold. If I get a few stacks of max level Mage water for 1g, I'm more than happy, dude - I already have saved a lot of money this way. ; )
---
No, he's not on my list at all.
---
How is Zandalar Tribe on the horde side? I've never played horde and want to start as RP
---
Fwiw arms 2h tanking is actually better than prot until 60. You just generate no rage/threat as prot in the early stages and the mitigation is actually worse too once you factor in mobs living longer. Of course this does mean healers have to be a bit more on the ball.
---
Note: they should have a sword/board for overly hard hitting things.
---
After a long day of yanking we just want to kill some tigers
---
That's not a fair comparison, tanks and healers are *always going to be in more demand* than damage dealers. Unless you truly want to tank or heal -- I wouldn't fret it.
---
I'm assuming that she will tank and y'all are new to classic in which case welcome enjoy your stay so basically tanking is a bit more than tank and spank especially for damage dealers people use the 5second rule you just wait a bit for the tank to get agroo on the mobs before attacking them that's everything you will need for now
---
I totally agree that Heartseeker is a lot more alliance than horde. We need horde!!!!
---
However, my biggest point was:
---
If you are playing alliance on a server that is 60%+ horde, or worse, you either transfer to a server that has a lot more alliance, Heartseeker, or suffer with all of the horde and hope your server improves.
---
Last resort, re-roll. But, most people have lives and not enough time to do so. 
---
Heartseeker is probably imbalanced, too, like every other server at this point. Blizzard, it‚Äôs ridiculous. At the end of the day though, I rather send my character to a server where I can group up, find people to level with, and guilds for raiding, rather than one that has barely any alliance=constantly getting ganked.
---
&gt; Oh.. pay better you say? Cool, you have fun explaining to sysadmins and network engineers why the helpdesk guys are making as much as they are with no responsibilities and a lot easier work. Best pay them more as well.. annnd now the helpdesk guys still want to move on because those other jobs are better paying. And that assumes they don't want to move away regardless simply because the work is more interesting.
---
None of that is a good excuse for not just paying them better. What other people in other positions make is irrelevant to what the help desk people make. Paying people better to stay in that position is the solution.
---
Oh my bad. Sorry.
---
SM cath bosses are level 42, ppl would generally not take you at level 35
---
My first 60 in vanilla was a paladin. I leveled as holy, just healing, melee, and eventually holy shocking. It'd be especially easy to level as holy with a pocket mage.
---
Hey, not an overly experienced player myself, but I believe thrasher blade is probably the best main hand option out of those you mentioned. The on hit effect of thrasher blade is really good, even if it is a tad infrequent. Stat wise - the Bloodrazor is a damage upgrade over the thrasher blade, but only minor - yet its on hit effect is pretty worthless imo. 
---
Because of this I believe thrasher blade is the best option for main hand, this way your sinister strike spam might trigger the on hit effect. Bloodrazor in offhand is probably strong because it is obviously an epic and a strong weapon, however opting for any decent offhand with much higher attack speed might actually improve damage over the bloodrazor. Higher attack speed = more chance at sword spec procs  and also maybe more poison procs? (Might not proc more poison, i cant seem to find out if poison in 1.12 is ppm or just a chance on hit)...   
---
Anyway, if I was u I'd run thrasher main hand for the awesome on hit effect, then a fast aps offhand or maybe bloodrazor. 
---
Some will argue that bloodrazor is a better main hand for the overall damage improvement, but I like thrasher's on hit, it just feels awesome seeing extra numbers fly everywhere. 
---
Anyway, correct me if im wrong about anything, again im kinda new to classic mechanics. Whatever u decide to do - both bloodrazor and thrasher blade are probably good enough to last until u get bis.
---
it also depends on the exact level and if the priest gets new healing ranks in another level or two...
---
Don't tell em that that's too true
---
Just hopping in there to advise you to lvl up with arm spec even if you intend to mostly tank in dungeons.
---
details is good as it comes with a fairly powerful threat meter, if you are interested in staying under the tank threat and maximize DPS
---
Also, we are playing on the 1.12 version on vanilla. Itemization buffs and what not. In 1.12, 14 years ago Onyxia was easy too.
---
Dude... Im on a low server, and I have No problems with getting a tank.
---
I have never once seen a group do Jailbreak that wasn't explicitly advertised as such.
---
Best places to level at Level 43? I cleared all the Tanaris low 40 quests, now they're all super hard and +46.
---
that would depend on gear more than level
---
It's nothing about pet aggro. It's the fact that if you slightly turn, no matter by how much, the entire spell is cancelled.
---
They changed spmonething with classic where it detects turning more than retail, making it a lot harder to kite, fd and drop trap in one go.
---
Plus there's issues with mobs that are near you throwing an auto attack in before they reset whilst your FD which cancels it. Either input lag or server latency.
---
It seems to work a lot better if mob is outside auto attack range. But if your pets dead and you can't get away then FD gets super risky due to the bug.
---
0/0/50 mage. I don't spend 1 point for good luck. Anybody who doesn't like it can pound sand.
---
I mean people make mistakes and this one seems pretty freaking minor.
---
maybe this is the dwarf way of wishing a dude luck finding a sexual partner
---
I'm sorry to hear this, seems hard to solo 2 of these at a time as a non pet class.
---
I'm a hunter, and now I feel like it shouldn't be this easy for us.
---
At least your melee class will do nice damage in raids! (assuming warrior or rogue)
---
"Huh, that one worgen has a suprisingly high aggro dista..."
---
Lol, goblin one cracked me up much better than the dwarf one
---
It would have been OK if he would say - thx for the report theyll get warning too or somethig and you get it too for the rooftop stuff...
---
that would be it. At least you would be like - ok fair enough.
---
Unless they use retribution aura, cause it wont proc then :)
---
There is a warrior in my guild who sits in LFG channel for HOURS trying to find a tank for his pre raid bis farming.
---
Came from Ashbringer to Earthfury, definitively less populated but so far I didn't have any issue finding group, hope the population will continue to grow tho
---
&gt;like most pet parents do
---
No.
---
I'm wondering if that's what happened to me today. A group of us jumped a Paladin in STV and he bubble hearthed but it seemed like he used hearthstone a second after bubbling, and at the very end (I'm a Rogue) it said I did damage to him and my poisons applied as he hearthed. I'm wondering if he hearthed and died because he was at like 1% HP.
---
That's no fun though, priests have access to all their obnoxious abilities in mind control.
---
Someone probably has the quest in his quest log but "failed" it and hasnt abandonded it. This was the case on my server
---
Lol GMs existed in 2006 too, and they would tell you to get down and stop doing that.
---
Milwall fans?
---
damn.. played about 10hours this weekend used about 100mb-150mb. Made all all updates where turned off and noticed when i went on Discord for a few minutes it was guzzling data.
---
I kinda agree but a good tank will be checking on me to see my mana. I check other people's Mana / pet health. Tank can too. We can all work together :)
---
Threat isnt generated instantly. She should have an ability called 'Righteous fury'. This should be activated if she's trying to tank, as it increases threat generated by your holy abilities. It does NOT increase threat from white numbers I.e Auto attacks. She will need to use Judgement and seal of the righteous to do holy damage and generate threat. 
---
Having said that, even with the increased threat, mages do a lot of damage which generates a lot of threat too. 
---
As a mage, you shouldn't be getting hit from mobs anyway. Slowing mobs with frostbolt and rooting them with frost nova while you run back and keep your distance is how you should be playing.
---
Raptors without eyes. 
---
Also I think mountain lions without skin in Hillsbrad.
---
Only wowhead can write an article that lists raiding warlocks as 'affliction' despite saying themselves they rely mostly on destruction damage and talents (sbolt spam) and that most pick ds/ruin which doesnt even take affliction talents and that even those that take affliction talents still focus on destro.
---
.. And this is one of their slightly better articles.
---
That isn't always an option. Don't be silly.
---
That's literally not dual spec at all. lol..
---
If you are Horde I would suggest Kargath and badlands. Elementals and beats lvl 35-38, drops alot of grey items with decent value and theres vendors really close to farming spot.
---
Swamp of sorrows beast and green dragons are also nice value, especially with skinning. These drakes also drop a pet, so if your lucky you get a nice boost in your gold per hour.
---
Same with Turtles in Tanaris, valuable greys and vendor is super close, fill your bags, sell, repeat :)
---
If you want more mindless lowlvl / half afk farm while looking youtube you could kill low lvl drakes in Wetlands for Small flame sac and greens and possibly a pet you could sell.
---
I kinda agree with this one. Can healer heal when 3 levels lower than requirement? Absolutely. Is it overall smoother experience if he is at required level? Of course.
---
Point is that healer can heal whole dungeon if requirement is 50 and he is lv50. But DPS can't do that as usually last boss is something like 56 and just miss every single  swing and you can't down the boss.
---
You can, it just costs you
---
Where do you fish them? On my server fish costs nothing but maybe squids are ok. Also how much for 20?
---
Full frost? I guess it should work good
---
Blizzard isn't owned by Activision
---
Hi,
---
Pretty much, yes.
---
I'd usually suggest you keep a main pet and open the 2nd stable slot for putting it there when you go tame the pet that has the ability that you want. Use that new pet until you learn the ability, then go back to your old.
---
Either that or keep your new pet, if it's your level.
---
I‚Äôve never heard pocket mage before but man does that sound useful IRL
---
You're comparing a $12 subscription with $300 + a $12 subscription.
---
I don't know how confident you are with math but those work out pretty different over a year.
---
Swords will likely be faster all the way to 60, even with losing PvP fights. It is significantly stronger than other rogue specs until the very later levels. At least I think so 
---
Swords aren't hard to come by, get a carry in maraudon at lvl 45 for thrasher blade and bang your done with weapons until bis.
---
I read it in Asmongold voice.
---
Isnt agi give ap for rogues and druids?
---
How is it not dual spec, if you invest basic points into heal you can heal you might need a lot of mage vending machine water but you can heal and solo quest
---
night elves think it's best to use all parts of the animal, including the meat, so they're not vegetarians.
---
Have you been in feralas? There should be some quests. The arathi elites would be around lvl 40 aswell. If all fails start grinding zul farak.
---
Thank you kind sir. Honestly so far I got all my addons from Twitch so if the one previously recommended works as I expect it to, I don‚Äôt think I will take you up on your offer. 
---
But if it doesn‚Äôt you will hear from me :)
---
I play(ed) an Orc Warlock on Waterlords and the community was nice. Not extremely but i had mostly positive encounters.
---
On ZT i rolled a Tauren, asked a question in general chat and was shut down and mocked for it. This may just be a single experience with someone who had a bad day but it made me reconsider and roll Alliance for ZT.
---
Melee cleeving worst-possible leveling experience?
---
Warriors have it super easy with leveling now. The fastest ones arent going to be a warrior, but for most players cleave groups are way easier than questing.
---
Warriors are the most privilaged class in Classic (followed closely by mages) - top dps, only raid tank (&gt;99.9% of the time), easy leveling, really easy dungeon group finding.
---
Yep pretty good farm
---
Gnome??Druid gnome?
---
That's what I am doing. It's not my first rodeo.
---
I was just "theory crafting" ... If that is the right word ... And could decide which solution would be beneficial.
---
Thanks for the advise though, appreciated! :)
---
You won't get a fair comparison with tanks and heals. That's not a lock thing though, but rather any MMO as DPS with the holy trinity, ever. There's always more demand for tank/heal as the majority of players play DPS.
---
Anyway, locks definitely are fine. Aside your damage you're also bringing summons, curses, health and soulstones. Don't worry about it.
---
Casually or competitive? pick one
---
The thing is though, as in every industry, once you get a problem with your staff (which in the end doesn't sound like you do) and you can't retain good people, you are not paying high enough wages. Period.
---
I am sick of industries complaining about not finding people, especially in customer services, tourism and other seemingly low-level/low responsibility jobs. If you raise wages, you will find people eventually. Capitalism works both ways!
---
Are you able to provide a link where they have the hotfix listed?
---
I like the gw2 ui
---
Yes, but even if they made the encounter even harder than what it was, it would be a joke in 2019, people cleared MC and Onyxia in a raid mostly filled with lvl 55-59s, and a few 60s oneshotting every single boss, that alone is harder than "pre-nerf" mc with all L60s using dungeon gear by a lot.

---
I'd say that at this point it doesn't matter. More gold is generated all the time. Value of gold is reducing every quest return and vendor sell. If you get now 200g it is as valuable as if you sell it after two months and get 400g.
---
There is so much gold already in game that now it's not worth to save item for later.

Hit cap for white damage is really hard to reach. You'll be over capped on yellow damage maybe, but auto attack damage makes up a lot of rogue damage for sword spec.
---
mind blown
---
Dear Dairy...
---
This is so true. I think even if we did get a progressive patch implementation of vanilla (starting with patch 1.1 instead of 1.12) people would be surprised that it's easier than remembered, because the benefits of better PCs, better connections, larger screens, gaming mice and keyboards, information about every element of the game, better theorycrafting, and a more experienced and better playerbase do add up.
---
But still, the difference in difficulty between 1.1 and 1.12 is enormous. There are so many changes, and almost all of them benefit the players.
---
I want that  shield so bad. You can charge whatever you want
---
Because dual spec lets you have two full talent trees at once that you can actively switch between.
---
Zandalar tribe ftw! I thought this was our server because of &lt;Fairy Tail&gt; hmu if you ever fancy some world fuckery, I'm called Phatbo√≠ :)

---
I attack every single frost mage i see , be it lvl 1 or 60 with my rogue. Hate the kiting douches, thinking they are good.

Went from the odd bit of competition in Arathi to motherfuckers EVERYWHERE in STV. Considering just abandoning the zone and going somewhere else.

Hey, that's MY toon you're pushing there!
---
I'm Dvergur on the RP-PVP realm Zandalar Tribe, thanks for a wholesome joke while I was waiting for my Stockades tank &lt;3
---
Just keep in mind that this playstyle is now much more common. I played paladin in classic and didn't put a point in holy until about midway through AQ40. Simply wasn't necessary to off heal and do 5 mans as a full healer. Heck i didn't start getting +heal/damage before the later stages of MC due to itemization/game knowledge. Now I respecced at around Uldaman to 21pts holy to keep up with the worst kinds of groups and feel still sometimes feel inadequate with 300 +healing for 5 mans. I know that I enable this kind of behaviour but if I can't find a group as a healer most of the dungeon content is locked to me.
---
I'd really like to try out an RP Server. But is it worth it to start a second character if I won't even have much time to play at all soon?
---
They weren't. High Elves invaded their land and Trolls were about to take them back, if it wasn't for the Alliance's intervention.
---

Not really sure if thats correct and *hostile, harm* might be a double confirmation but thats what I came up within a minute.

Should get rid of Shaman totems rather quick and also helps in Zul'Farrak and LBRS.
---
One of the best pvp 1V1 specs. In bgs they are below average
---
If you haven't done Badlands yet you could take a look. Quests only lose experience value 6+ levels after so you should be mostly alright.
---
Newsflash.
---
The primary difference between help desk and customer service is that the former is internal and the latter is external.
---
In both cases, simple templates will be sufficient for 80% of what you're dealing with; and everything else can be escalated to people with actual expertise.
---
Yeah, but one you get your mount at 40, this WPL route becomes a lot faster so well worth it.
---
Is there an addon that can show me my completed quests?
---
A priest guide I watched mentioned weaving wand casts with auto attacks from your melee weapon. I can't seem to get it to work. Does this work in live?? Any tips or vids on how to do it?
---
&gt; Yes, but even if they made the encounter even harder than what it was, it would be a joke in 2019 
---
I'm not proposing that they increase the difficulty of the encounter, I'm just putting the facts out there with regards to whatever was changed in and outside of Molten Core/Onyxia which contributed to the version we're doing now. 
---
The fights are a joke mechanically, and I don't think we'll start seeing a resemblance of somewhat difficult encounters until Naxxramas, and even that could be debated upon. 
---
&gt; people cleared MC and Onyxia in a raid mostly filled with lvl 55-59s, and a few 60s oneshotting every single boss first reset 
---
Let's just be real for a moment here, by "people" you mean the guild APES. That isn't to say that other guilds weren't doing it with loads of 55 - 60 players, but the particular case you're speaking of is singular to a guild that has done it all on Pservers for years. 
---
&gt; that alone is harder than "pre-nerf" mc with all L60s using dungeon gear by a lot. 
---
I actually don't think it's necessarily right, but since I don't know the actual details regarding which items were added to Stratholme, Scholomance and LBRS, I can't tell how effective a 55 now versus a 60 back then. 
---
But the addition of 30 rare items to Scholomance alone is something to at least think about. Also the patch notes include 30 - 50 notes of particular pieces of gear that has been changed which I felt would make my original post too long. 
---
I just think the discussion is a lot more complex than some people make it out to be.
---
The lifesteal effect stacks (or used to) with spell damage, so a Paladin would get a lot more damage+health back when it procced than a warrior for example
---
If you level together, one can pick up mining, another can use herbalism. Another can get skinning, and the last can get..not sure, whatever you want. A lot of money comes from the quests, a lot comes from grinding mobs, some will come from picking up gathering nodes, some from skinning. If you get a nice rare drop you get another 1-2-5 gold.
---
Good luck!

You know theres a better word for what you want right? instead of "?he" or "h[is|er]" you can just use They

Because i want to be a special snowflake and i like the underdog role. And that is the truth.
---
Yeah it was just in case you were knew cause trying to level up in prot can just make someone quit and that would be a shame x).
---
As for your question, I think the difference is marginal and it's better to maximize the damage from your abilities.

oh, could have sworn it was a tbc thing. oh well. still far before BFA&gt; lol

---
Is there an add-on for those class icons at the corner of the unit frame or is that a built in part of the frame?
---
just variance. I leveled duo from 1-35 or so, we did have stretches when neither of us would get the drop for 10-15 min, only to then get several in a row... also sometimes one of us would be done while the other is still at 0 (usually me, of course)... but in the end we finished each and every quest....
---
What does that have to do with dual spec?
---
Perfectly normal.  
---
My friends also started talking directly to my pet named "Erwin" to do things while we are in discord.
---
Ever think that only happens because alliancr cant attack you?
---
If your own faction could kill you you they would  gank you constantly with high lvls.
---
that's why you say at the start of the run, need boe's. much simpler.
---
Well shit
---
This might be true ü§î I've notice things drop faster solo leveling
---
Explains why it‚Äôs so damn expensive...
---
When I fought for first time Onyxia playing shaman we had to equip at least 70 Fire Resist gear and use many Fire Protection potion, after Garr it was like 140 FR. 
---
1.12 Onyxia, MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 are jokes for PUG.
---
How about no?
---
If the healer is a low level then the whole group need to be better to compensate for it. Tank with better aggro management, better DPS, better control. Avoid any "surprises" (and those may happen - all of as can do mistakes). And all of this because healer decided to go for a dungeon he's no t ready for. Why? Healers rarely get into situations where they cannot find a group.
---
Unfortunately not, got a couple of football fans, but not many.
---
We did fight a pack on the bridge though!
---
oh shut the fuck up. wanting a little quality of life isn't going to ruin your precious game that you've been playing non-stop for 12 years on private servers.
---
using multiboxing to do any kind of pvp is bannable so "deleting people" is no factor really (who is gonna risk 5+ accounts for a gank?)
---
I have yet to encounter a single multiboxer and I'm on the fullest realm of my language
---
I don't think it's an issue
---
I literally explained how we solved the retention problem, but nice to know people don‚Äôt like to read what‚Äôs written.
---
Everything‚Äôs gotta be so black and white with you lot doesn‚Äôt it?
---
I kill everything i see while questing, even on the route/walk to/from the quest area just not to have to stop questing to grind up to the level i need to be for the next batch of quests.
---
I loot them completely as well :)
---
I'm kinda also interested in knowing if its a reportable offense, so I don't waste my time reporting for something where no action is ever going to be taken.
---
well we tried to do sm, but got ganked at the entrance, and even getting there from southshore is a task itself
---
not a very good dungeon for alliance

It's one of those things that relies on people using their best judgement. I've absolutely done it, but in about half the dungeon groups I've run so far, that would either be suicidal or get me thrown out. Bad healer? Low lvl healer? Offspec healer? Blatantly intoxicated healer? Out comes the shield. Orange level mob? Shield. Some idiot pulled 2 pats? Hit that shield macro.
---
Actually you dont need any because any other priest can spec in to shadow weaving and be more useful than the shadow priest
---
We are still living "the hot peak time" of Classic. We don't know when P2 is going to happen but my guess is it won't be soon. Sure many people are 60 and already clearing MC/Ony but I don't think they do release decisions according minority. Majority is still leveling up and my experience is that most people are at levels 30-50. So we still have plenty of time (my guess is we talk about months). And I am pretty sure that like after six months player amount will be much lower that what it is right now. Because people didn't quit after two weeks does not mean they are going to say for next year.
---
We will see. I am pretty sure that they do think about this a lot and what is chance that there is still same amount of players when we are actually talking about P2 launch.
---
1.12 talents, class balances, and itemizaton will trivialize most of the talent.  Other factors exist too.
---
Ive seen far more warlocks do this than hunters if Im being honest.
---
No Changes tho. Know that problem as a druid myself.
---
So much this.  If you aren't Tauren/Troll/Elf you are probably an alien or created by an alien.
---
in a dungeon, sure. So it'd be:
---
- Charge
---
- Bloodrage
---
- Either Thunderclap and then demoralizing shout (or vice versa)
---
- Apply sunders
---
maybe sweeping strikes as well, whirlwind if you have it etc.
---
Not sure about others but cheapest I have seen on our server was 700g, highly doubt he had that money lying around at 50ish level.
---
Sounds like a great tool. But, I feel I shouldnt be forced to use addons to avoid spam in chat.
---
Questie does it but I don't know if it only starts tracking from when you install it or not.
---
I honestly think it's a matter of server and the culture on the server you're playing on.   
---
If you're playing on a very 'streamer' heavy server where they have been able to influence the dungeon culture, then I agree that people will be spamming "LF AOE FARM X dungeon" or something similar, and you find many many more of the groups that do exactly what you mentioned. 
---
But I haven't actually met that much of it, sure sometimes I get a group where the tank is a beast or charge pulls and pulls 3 packs, but it's actually sorta rare for me to encounter the "ezpz, gitgud" groups, at least on my server.   
---
But in any regard compared to actual vanilla then i'm sure you're right that the groups with this mentality are much more prevalent now.
---
I would just do /sleep everytime i would need mana in the instance.
---
Youtube came out on 15th Feb 2005, four days after the EU release of WOW. I forget how long it took my EU vanilla guild to get to MC back in the day, but there were videos available and a lot of meme videos. Heck the leroy video came out before I had been to UBRS, but that was initially on warcraft movies, not Youtube according to wikipedia.
---
no idea. ive been swatted before and thought i did a good job of hiding all my info including personal info on my paypal.
---
evidently not.
---
I am a dual wield warri so no problem, why do you need to switch spec? R U TROLLING ME
---
Also, locks don't need to skip spells.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to say playing is terrible and you can‚Äôt do it. But it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre acting that it‚Äôs good for you. I think it‚Äôs good to acknowledge that playing wow takes a LOT of time and to be careful with it. And I think as a community you have to attend people to that and help each other.
---
AFAIK a lot of people from Grizzly got banned
---
I once reported someone for scamming people, then I woke up the next day to a ban. I asked why I was banned. Turns out the GM banned me instead of the guy on accident. Got a free shop pet out of it.
---
It's situational whether it's a win for the pally or not.  I've seen where a paladin is done with an area and just wants to kill some horde for fun.  Kills a few, earns a bounty, then when he can no longer slay freely, he just uses the hearth he was planning to, while trolling the people that came all that way to kill him.
---
This is awesome, thanks. Do I have to manually update some of these? because I only ever get addons through the Twitch app.
---
See ya herd
---
vendorprice
---
Pservers tune up damage because a bunch of people have this idea that vanilla was really hard, so even though it's not in reality, pservers looking to emulate that tuned things to be harder so the game matched their idea of how hard the game was supposed to be (as their vanilla noob self remembers it)
---
BEAT YER FEET TO THA SOUND
---
60 mage here, nearly all pre raid bis comes from BRD/BRS strat and scholo- with a few exceptions. Dont worry about gear until your ~50-52 and start farming BRD. Better to just keep the grind up and level. Can buy some ‚Äúfrozen wrath‚Äù or ‚Äúof the eagle‚Äù BoE‚Äôs but in general not worth to worry about gear until gearing up for raids.
---
I met some incredibly nice people on ZT-horde. Lot of prof competition, multiple specific guilds, many opportunities to RP and PVP as well. And between levels 1-30 I only ran into one person who I'd wish were Alliance so I could gank them. This might be anectodal, but I have had a good experience on ZT so far :)
---
It's just another opportunity to level fishing.
---
That straight up isn‚Äôt how it works. Entry level positions are paid less than more advanced ones, literally no industry would accept anything else.
---
What server are you on? I'm on Faerlina and have yet to experience anything like this.
---
Yeah but im guessing the modern GMs would have pvp skills on par with a current year games journalist playing an fps (or even a side scroller).
---
You'd have a good 2-3 minutes of hitting them before they could work out which single button they needed to click.
---
Until your raid gets good and then you use the Manual Crowd Pummeler.
---
Meatless turtles is the most rediculous thing.
---
Paladin tanks aren't bad for 5 mans - they are actually really great for AoE tanking. The problem with them for main tanking raids is that their talents require them to take a critical hit for their extra block % to kick in via redoubt.
---
Also, a downside is a lack of taunt. Sure, proper raid communication and dps awareness would mean a paladin should have no problem tanking a single boss, but if you have one DPS pull threat you literally have no way to gain it back if your judgement / consecration isn't enough holy damage to top their threat level. So it's either the dps pays attention (HA!) or you start losing dps to boss hits.
---
As far as tanking up to 60 - that's what I'm doing now. It's incredibly fun, and pretty much EZ mode in 5 mans. Consecration is an amazing AoE threat generator. Another drawback though is your Mana pool - pally tanks can go OOM, and once they do - you're shit out of luck for threat.
---
All of this is kinda minimized up until endgame content though. Paladins can tank all the way up to 60 before they start seeing any major drawbacks.
---
On mirage raceway they are very contested these past 7 days. Unless you play on off hours.
---
&gt; why do you need to switch spec?
---
I just clearly explained why someone might want to swap specs...
---
You classic purists are really fucking weird.
---
Thats what i was asking about
---
Honestly, this isnt even about the world chat issue.
---
The world chat bullshit went FLYING out the window like the end of Die Hard, the moment my personal info was shared.
---
Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups, my friend.
---
Did at any point I say them doing that was unreasonable? No. I explained why you commit found less competent people in those jobs.
---
Yes server populations are fucked big time. If they don‚Äôt drop a lot, expect to see Blizzard open more servers in the coming weeks and months.
---
For reference, the average total characters per server in Vanilla was 15-20k, while the largest was Proudmoore with around 25k. 
---
Meanwhile Classic server Pagle with 100k characters looks like a nightmare to de-layer.
---
You're missing the point of my post. 
---
I'm not here to force anyone in to picking low leveled healers, but to make more people aware that healers 1-2 levels below the requirements can do just fine...(if) they are healing talented and have actual healing gear. 
---
I'll stand by my point that a healer level 50 for example with full resto/holy talents and healing gear, will outperform a healer lvl 54 with no talents and half dps/healing gear. Both in terms of mana regeneration, healing power and sustainability. 
---
Obviously a healer that is of a lower level should be aware of body pulls as well, try and stay back and compensate as much as possible.
---
A dps warrior definitely can tank all that.  The prot tree is generally worse for threat/rage than either of the other two trees.  It just makes you a bit harder to kill (Which also hurts your rage.)  A dps warrior is a better tank in most 5 mans.
---
Yeah southern barrens and ashenvale.
---
To get to 30, you'll probably need those two + hillsbrad + stonetalon + a dungeon run or two... It's a bunch of traveling around, unfortunately. Just got to 29 myself, having done all of stonetalon, almost all southern barrens and hillsbrad, and all of ashenvale except the very worst grindy quests.

Wait what lvl are you(as in how many talent points you have)
---
This is vanilla, forget about it, work around it like everyone else.
---
Paladin is the most OP class in this game in group pvp situations if you know what you're doing.
---
just yesterday I got a reply from a warrior saying my lvl of 46 was too low for ZF. btw, he was also lvl 46.
---
What's a humen
---
Whats wrong with the kid in the left?
---
Sure that‚Äôs not the situation in this thread and still what he did before might be a win but the fact he had to bubble hearth at some point can hardly be called a win
---
I think maybe there is.

There is no clear definition of spam in WoW Classic. So, you're just using your own judgement.  
---
And also, I have no idea if my reporting for spamming actualy results in any punishment, since I don't know the guidelines.
---
Well, that's a lot of "if"s. I agree with "if"s and "1-2 levels below" apply pretty much for everyone but a tank without dedicated tank build - because higher level DPS will simply produce too much agrro no matter what(or their DPS need to be lowered and that's also not a pleasant experience).
---
&gt; I'll stand by my point that a healer level 50 for example with full resto/holy talents and healing gear, will outperform a healer lvl 54 with no talents and half dps/healing gear. Both in terms of mana regeneration, healing power and sustainability.
---
Well, yeah it's true. But the question still stands - a full holy priest sure have to "live" in dungeons to level. Why push for higher level dungeon early instead of "safe" runs? It's not like you'll miss anything. A full holy priest basically can dictate his own rule to the party because if how good he is at healing.
---
Not to mention innervate was also the 31 point resto talent.
---
WELCOME TO HORDE TERRITORY
---
Hunter's are still decent all through naxx, you don't want to stack them but they aren't dead weight, they just get out scaled while still providing more than adequate dps.
---
Go play a private server with dual spec then?
---
Noggenfogger EU it's sub 300 rn
---
I'm on ashbringer and Yes, the population is pretty balanced.
---
The people are very nice too
---
Fair point. I can see how it works but I don't see it being better for lower levels where stuff is going to die before you get proccs if you're using HS or whatever.
---
Hit him with the /lol and you have the greatest pvp moment
---
didn't you find this boring? just healing
---
One way to solve this is to create more CS levels. Entry level is basically being able to hold a telephone conversation without insulting the client and checking if its one of the top 5 issues. If not - send customer to level 2 and so forth. Kinda depends on the amount of work available though. If all of your customer service contacts can be handled by two persons this won't work. 
---
There's also the option of job perks. I know of a few colleagues who work now for almost 15 in tech support while servicing a line that gets them at most 2 calls an hour that are handled in about 5-10 minutes on average and they are free to use the internet recreationally. They earn minimum wage and are as happy as they can be.
---
There's another one in Duskwood that kills a human whose trying to warn orcs that the Undead are experimenting on them.
---
Recount is my go-to.
---
I deeply regret joining a pvp realm. I loooove rp realms and their atmosphere. You really feel you entered a fantasy world.

Do you just interject retarded ass comments in every thread?

Cool!

---
It‚Äôs never worked for me since starting Classic WoW
---
In which case we will see inflation.
---
It varies from organisation to organisation. But templates exist to help streamline the troubleshooting and escalation process. Lot of basic information can be gathered on first port of call, then if an escalation is required, Level 2 &amp; 3 do not need to repeat the same steps. Templates also usually address very common fixes (E.G turn it off and on? clients profile path/s, does device ping?).
---
I would confidently say, most med-large enterprises should use templates. If they aren't, I guarantee your level 2 &amp; 3 are constantly wasting time on tasks they shouldn't.
---
It's not a win/win when 1 person i a coward and runs away and the other stands there ready to keep playing.
---
Just this one friend and it's been this way for weeks.

This.  Did princess run as 54 priest pala hunter and it was pretty much plain sailing and i got my ring &lt;3

Pug groups often get carried away trying to be too aggressive and it ends up backfiring

I played 4 years in vanilla (from the very beginning) but I must admit that I almost forgot everything. 
---
I never played the "new wow" thought, where money is easy and mobs are weak.

Allright for the 5 seconds rule, thanks.

U don't need to fill out both trees to be able to perform, I know what dual spec is just don't see the need

There's a weapon in Gnomeregan that has an On-Use effect, with only 3 charges.  So they go and get a bunch of them, use them, and then sell them to a vendor when they're done with the charges.

I can't remember what it does, but it seems to be good.
---
bristol pusher is back
---
Oh yeah, but I meant the other hunter. Couldn't he have send his pet to prevent the attacker from skinning?
---
Why is it against the rules if he cant do anything to affect other players?
---
you don't like paladin too?
---
Sure, if you want to be half as effective at both roles.
---
Why do people post this? He has 2 mechanics and could be pugged 2 weeks after release.
---
Like why? What's the point?
---
If he has me ignored how come he can still receive messages from me?
---
You're not reasonably going to get to a point where dodge/parry pushes block off the attack-table, especially since Redoubt relies on being crit. There is no more reason to avoid agility than to seek it out. Get stamina, defense rating and strength (if available), the rest doesn't really matter.
---
We won't be tanking raids anyway, so the entire thing is academic.
---
Details is the golden standard these days
---
And they don't drop off that hard, they still sit closely to the other dps outside of the ignite mage and crazy geared melee.
---
Allright, thanks, I'm going to check if she has that kind of spell at her current level.
---
I like lasttarget since when you kill someone it untargets them.
---
Without the Other races of the Flesh, the Burning Legion would've wiped the floor with the Trolls, Tauren, and Elves. 
---
Without Humanity, The Elves would've been Consumed by the Trolls.
---
And the Trolls would've, in turn, probably killed themselves since they're categorically known for fucking with BLOOD GODS.
---
Yes works, but a few points are worthless. If you skill frostbite, you can't really take use of improved blizzard.

Would be nice water costs a fortune and warriors seem to be happy to pull before I've got max use out of it.

Can you explain APES killing rag then?

Where drop this?

But if you pay 1s a stack and play all day, that‚Äôs a ton of money saved
---
Did they actually show up among players?
---
Yes - fishing them now
---
Absolutely not my experience, neither on classic so far nor on years of private server pvp.
---
Very civil and nice of you, thanks! :)
---
Its a boring levelling experience in classic and if you expect her to tank for you it is not going to work out well. I dont think paladins even have a taunt.
---
The reason I was saying it is an in popular opinion is because many people just don't like ret paladins.... And it isn't the best spec for pvp either
---
Oi mate!
---
where at?
---
Everybody is pretty much a titan creation or a troll offshoot at this point.

Do you know if there some kind of similar resource for other classes by any chance ? Would love to see one for pala

Hahaha, did anyone actually believed that there would be #nochanges?

Awesome thank you

Look at this, Another Disgusting Orc that is so incapable of being a law-abiding citizen that he has even begun violating the laws of gravity.
---
Horde are so despicable.
---
I also play Mograine EU. There are a lot of groups being made for all the endgame instances, atleast on alliance side. And judging by how many times horde has a big group infront of UBRS I would say horde is busy getting BiS aswell.
---
Bro are you me?  I‚Äôve had different issues and given up each time trying to open a ticket.

A mage aoe'ing 2 mobs is not Always a bad thing: on a clearcast proc, it is beneficial to use Blizzard on 2 mobs, especially if you're running low on mana.

Have any RP realm became the Classic Moon Guard yet by the way?
---
I haven't noticed that option in questie before. I'll have to check when I log back in
---
Nah if you play WC3 the orcs wanted to set up a camp so they start chopping down nearby trees. The nelves somehow get mad at the orcs for not knowing that it's their forest (even though they intentionally hide their existence from all the other races) so they do the reasonable thing and start murdering them.
---
The elves had it coming.
---
Actually your assuming a lot. Many ifs.
---
The only thing I assume is that the paladin would stay exactly where he is if he wouldn‚Äôt be forced to hearth bubble. Realy not far fetched

I've always liked to farm gorillas. Many places have gorila zones (like in northern STV) and those gorillas are not part of any quest so there is usually no competition.
---
My impression was that warlock is always applying dots and fear and shadowbolting until enemy is dead. Is this true?
---
Also, how necessary it is for druid to switch between forms when fighting? Even if I have a lot of abilities, will most of them go unused because fighting in 1 form is enough?
---
if he has you on ingame ignore, you can't talk to him in-game, but you should be able to out of game which is why the bnet app would work.
---
I think technically a click is still required for every action to be within ToS, so someone is sitting there with an addon that scans prices and will hit "buy" every time his addon notifies him of an underpriced offer. 
---
On a side note, all addons that automatize shit need to go away. AH is completely unusable for crafting mats as a player without addon right now. So many single item stacks created by morons who like to flood the AH.
---
Druids can tank everything but a few bosses like nefarian and chromaggus. Their TPS is far superior to warriors, and they are much less gear reliant.
---
I believe (not 100% sure though) that if you don't put a rank in the spell, it will use the max rank you have learned. If this is true, it would also save you having to put new ranks on your bars as you learn them.
---
As for the order of petattack vs /cast, it doesn't matter which is first. Putting the spell first, however, means that the tooltip will be for the spell instead of pet attack.

How exactly do you level enchanting, and when do you start making money with it? I'm disenchanting most of my greens and am still giving my bracers +5, but this is getting really expensive, since I'm not selling most of the greens I loot.
---
Yes.
---
Not necessarily.
---
Why is Ashenvale-Crossroads ride so much more expensive than for example Crossroads-Orgrimmar? Is it because Ashenvale is a higher level zone?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this comment is sarcastic or not.
---
‚ÄúYou might *think* you enjoy this game I don‚Äôt like, but actually you don‚Äôt!‚Äù
---
Im surpriced you can even get grps, I kept getting declined because I wasnt a priest so they couldnt run their super optimal spell cleave grp, luckily as a shaman the melee cleaves wanted me, ohh and normal runs? they didnt exist till lvl 60.
---
Your Guild name makes me feel about 15 years younger. 
---
Think I'll make a guild called "The Black Qiraji Parade"
---
do people set their HS to capital and just keep it there while leveling? lol
---
All classes for dps at least are very simplified. Hunters have some unique responsibilities on certain raid bosses like kitting adds, but the rotations are much simpler.
---
I believe you basically aimed shot and multi shot on cooldown and use lower ranks as necessitated by mana. To optimize you want to time your abilities not to clip autoshot, but that's about it.
---
What is the torch run?:)
---
You don't need to be a good Mage tho.
---
Mages stack on top of each other, as long as you have points into Improved Blizzard and maybe Coldsnap, Iceblock or Ice Barrier ... as long as you're a Frost Mage specced into CC you're usefull.
---
No other class does stack so easily. You don't need to be good to play classic wow. Classic WoW has no challenging gameplay and spellcleave omegalulAoE with 20+ mobs is as challenging as classic gets tbh.
---
Using soft CC like Sheep, Freezing Trap, Sap or Banish and fighting one mob out of a group of four at a time is fucking retarded and most definitively "not challenging".
---
Back in the day you did that because nobody could play the game not to mention their own class, so to lessen the stress you used soft CC. Nowadays the gameplay in Classic WoW makes you fall asleep and im thankfull and glad spellcleave emerged to wake me up infight and also give us faster clearspeed.
---
I'm tanking for my guild but also random pugs and imo spellcleave increases the community interaction, at least in those groups I'm joining. You need to actively keep track of the fights and think about what you're doing otherwise you're dead.
---
Spellcleave increases and builds upon standart classic gameplay and improves on it.
---
The entire group needs to watch their positioning, monitor addgroups infight and reevaluate the situation every second.
---
Thats pretty cool.
---
You don't need to be a good Mage but imo joining a spellcleave group will increase your learning curve and mastery of your class by a good amount.
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
Imagine raiding more than once a week until naxx, you dont need pve specs for onyxia/zg
---
pussy
---
Thanks for the clarification! :)
---
Jealous
---
Are you on Skeram?  I just reported a hunter who destroyed my from on top of the cage, and just today a blue clarifies that isn‚Äôt ok....
---
Huh? It's not just about "specs" and classic+ it's also about roles in general.
---
Even though my spec underlines my main-role, I found I don't want to limit myself to that role and started getting gear for other roles right away.
---
I'm currently level 44 as a Druid and I have 4 item-sets in ItemRack. These span a total of about 30 bagslots not counting what I'm currently wearing and I suppose it's only gonna get more!
---
The sets I have are:
---
Cat, which is focussed on Strength, Agility and similar Melee-DPS-increasing-stats.
---
Heal, which is focussed on +Heal, Int and Spirit.
---
Bear, which is focussed on Stamina, Armor and tries to get some str and agi too but with much lower priority than stamina and armor.
---
And PvP, where I simply try to get the highest overall amount of all stats combined as all of them are usefull in PvP. I also value stamina slightly higher than other stats in this set.
---
I feel that if I didn't do this, I would severely gimp myself in one or more several aspects.
---
I don't have an explicit damage-spellcasting-gear simply because I feel that this would be redundant with the Cat-role which simply is better at it due to having it's explicit resource. For a class that can also use their mana for healing, and doesn't have to rely on it for doing damage, I feel it would be a waste to spend it that way. At least unless it is particularly good at it.
---
&gt;I tell my healer before we start.
---
:D - yeah, this tactic works best i think - educating DPS seems like wasted effort. Even after they die multiple times they keep it up.
---
Three things happen. People are grouping them all together into a "bug"
---
1. You turned or moved
---
2. You, or your pet get hit by damage or you pet causes damage
---
3. People are waiting for the UI to refresh reflecting out of combat.... When you can spam the macro and the trap casts even tho it never shows you left combat.
---
That sweet sweet windfury makes it worth, signed a rogue with swords :P
---
Wardens Staff is still Bis, you just use MCP to generate initial threat before switching generally
---
Im on westfall too! Congratulations!
---
This is my plan for level 60. I will avenge all my alliance brothers who died to the millions of horde outside sm dungeons. And give them an easy acces to their sm grinds.
---
Bears do just fine as well.
---
Blizzard called out the turning as a bug tho
---
&gt; "*The species to which the legendary* *Jedi Master* *Yoda* *belonged was ancient and shrouded in mystery* "
---
We solved it! Yoda was gnome!
---
If he ignored him in game, you would get the message
---
"Bla is ignoring you"
---
Or if they ignore you ingame does that somehow integrate with b.net messages?
---
Don't get my wrong - I agree with your point. Shamans, paladins and druids all struggle massively with this, totems from shamans are so fucking good but are NEVER factored in to dps.
---
Ah, maybe this expains their price. Going for 25 gold a piece (Mirace Raceway).
---
It's literally the BIS for feral tanks, so you are
---
My 3 year old account from beta in Heroes of the Storm got reported the same way.  I said nothing in 90% of my games and was chat banned (playing mostly casual queue) because other people didn't like me playing Murky (in casual queue!).
---
When I asked why I was put on a short ban, the GM showed me one time I whispered my friend "lol u asshole" and so the ban was upheld due to "chat violations."
---
yeah i wish it proc'd on my DoTs and i'd actually use it lol but i'll bank it. NO WAY i could vendor it :P Just a joke title.
---
Who? Your Uncle Dave?
---
Archived site i used myself back in the days. Click on your class at the top. Not a bis list but you can see instance drops suitable to your class , crafted gear and some more.
---

---
I disagee : tank gameplay in HL raids/dungeons is the most rewarding in my opinion. Leveling solo is a nightmare though !
---
considering the context of the quote it would be pretty stupid to use it unironically...
---
I think it depends on the server.   
---
I'm playing on Zandalari Tribe (RP-PVP EU), and it's been really chill. I think if you're playing on a more populated server with a lot of streamers, then the culture of the dungeons might be more affected by the elitism the streamers bring.   
---
But I do have people whispering me in dungeons: "Damn I thought druids sucked" or "You're doing good even though you're a druid" which makes me a bit sad and happy at the same time, but it's not that prevalent.
---
&gt; Dude, charging for mage water a non-guildie / **random dungeon team member** is absolutely fine.
---
If someone expected me to pay for water when I'm healing a run I'd find a different mage, genuinely never had someone try to do that.
---
The guards are borderline useless anyway, if you out level them they completely ignore you. I've casually walked into horde inns to kill people and the guards just stand there and watch, it's ridiculous.
---
It's one thing to make a mistake, it's another thing to ignore people who call you out on it.
---
Stealth nerfed :(
---
Exactly. Feral druids, while leveling, are not only doing quite well at playing solo. They are also better tanks than non-prot warriors (if you not doing 100% AGI only gear) . Sure after level 40 Plate gives Warriors a big bonus, but you still have to collect it. And all this while getting almost no decent gear from dungeons.
---
What's their issue then? Because if you say threat you're going to get laughed out of town. Bears generate insane threat
---
Trashdrop or from Raggi? There are so many conflicting sources I'm really not sure where it actually drops.
---
/giphy vader no
---
I got mine in ST dungeon run.
---
Priest took it but everyone said to give it to me. He agreed if i equip it right away which i did.
---
Later that day i joined guild in which i have to be resto.
---
So there goes my staff, but i am "abusing" it now until 60 as i am tanking all the dungeons.
---
1s is cheap. A mage wanted to charge me with 50s/stack recently. 
---
He became more generous when I - the healer -  did the same thing and asked him to pay a couple gold in advance because each heal would be charged with 50s :P
---
&gt;God no, tanks are so rare. It has to do with simply how terrible warrior leveling is.
---
I actually see a lot of warriors - as the message was warrior will be top DPS at 60, i think this lured a lot to roll them on but they just dont want to tank.
---
You want a spell cleave group to carry your rogue
---
That‚Äôs debatable. There are generally two schools of thought...
---
Imagine being condescending all the time.
---
What if I want to do dungeons with friends? What if they need a healer or a tank?
---
Sure?
---
Druids bring MoTW for extra agi/str, paladins bring a lot of buffs - how do you factor this in? How can you factor in 3% crit chance? Give 3% of all crit damage from your feral's group they're buffing to the feral? It is a rabbit hole.
---
How old is that gm ????
---
Such incompetence
---
Can't you just get someone else to help you with that?
---
omg ...and hes a streamer looolol..Druids do have problem with hunters until they get their speed boosts and charge (if they feral ) but with that level difference it shouldn't be a problem lol!
---
Instead moonfire spam he should have used root  .You can always tell a noob druid by moonfire spam
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-LSmULmByAQHQs
---
Cant confirm. Getting killed by lots of ?? players or by groups. I'm just avoiding stv on peak hours now. I'm on gandling eu though.
---
OP is 24 so Windfury is not a factor in any way here.
---
Make sure the shamans are using Flametongue weapon rather than Rockbiter, as the latter generates extra threat. He also should be opening with Flame Shock rather than Earth shock, and probably only use Earth Shock if he's expecting to tank it, expecting the mob to die from it or knows that you have enough threat to handle it. Also tell them to attack your main/skull target and not ES others. 
---
If you indeed hold threat like a magnet for all other classes the shamans must constantly be spamming ES or use Rockbiter, or both.
---
Magic dust is!
---
We got a lucky Eye drop last night, and working with a few other guilds to get ingots we managed to make Sulfuras.
---
It's almost like my predictions of the content being easily doable by PuGs, based on playing on pservers, were right. 
---
Wonder what all the delusional people think now about the "difficult raid content".
---
You could grief kids in real life but why grief kids in game? Just as bad as robbing a bank, it's against the rules.
---
GRATS HOOCH
---
Leave then.
---
Ap difference will not be the deciding factor in this. Hit cap and crit chance will be the big deciders
---
Warlock even has underwater breathing ...niche but very useful .And he really wanted that kill to chase to the depths of the ocean it seems. Embarrassing
---
I tank with 2h when elites are not 3 3 or more levels above me or when my life bar gets dangerously low.
---
Better agro and better dps it's just better.
---
Yesterday I was denied an Uldaman group because I'm not protection specced. I'm level 47 and have tanked Uldaman since level 44.
---
Saw this an hour ago for the first time. 
---
"Does playing the game sounds boring? Pay us so we play the game for you! That way you dont have to play the game you hate!" 
---
It just sounded wrong for me.
---
Well for one - I played with 400ms and about 10 fps back then haha.
---
Also, keep in mind warlocks still to take tons of damage, but they're probably not. It's likely just hellfire and/or lifetap.
---
Let them use siphon/drain life to heal back up. Save your mana for the tank.
---
I did not play for 12 years and never on privates. I played from 2006 to 2010 and things you cry about are things that made us quit back then.
---
Just playing few weeks for nostalgic reasons.
---
Your assumptions indicate no value in what you say fucknut
---
i suggest you to keep different ranks of fear. as panic button, use the highest rank for longer duration.
---
for other purposes use rank 1 because r1 is 10 sec fear and mobs do not run away that far away. but rank 3 has 20 second and the mob keeps running away from you for 20 seconds which ends up they just run away and you lose them unless they have dot on them. also it makes you lose dps
---
The issue is that Shamans Earthshock generates extra threat (no idea why, tho, one of the big classic mysteries). If they spam it they are doing it wrong.
---
&gt; Idk what is up you ass m8, not sure if it's worth to even argue with someone...   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; How am I being elitist, I'm not hating on anyone, 
---
Well i never said that goes to show you didn't even read/understand my reply.
---
Why you get mad when i ask you the same thing you asked me ?
---
&gt; Point I'm trying to make is that I want to experience classic the vanilla way. Would you look at that. If you add cocoa to vanilla, is it not just chocolate? I just wanna add enough to make it stracciatela. 
---
Well if you think retail is just vanilla+addons then i have to respect your false oppinion and there is no use in further arguing about anything.
---
yup

If you don‚Äôt have another account, you‚Äôd need someone on the new faction you trust. You‚Äôd essentially lost an item from the new faction with a buyout for the amount of gold your original character has. Once you buy it, you‚Äôre money has moved to the new faction.
---
I wouldent bring a rogue unless its a friend or a guildie..
---
Druids are a good bet as another said especially if you like kiting, but maybe shaman too. From the sounds of things as ele/resto you'll do a lot of healing but can try to help burst people when the time is right. They have a lot of interesting utility in totems. Clutch grounding totems may sate your desire for impactful tactical plays.
---
Troll-bait warning!
---
We're literally playing the game with battle net
---
How much is that worth? I got one a while back but used it thinking it wasn't worth much
---
I still dont know why MC is open Phase 1 but good job.
---
Do you just want to see the name of the debuff or its description as well?
---
This [here analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d84bqw/enchanting_part_two_an_analytical_look_at/) (and part 1, linked in the thread) found on the front page right now might provide some answers.
---
lol BfA is waiting you
---
I have played WoD for a month so I don't know all that much about retail tbh, but for example having no dungeon/raid finder makes the difference between meeting new friends and just meeting temporary team mates. Yes I read that somewhere
---
You should really try some advertisement. It's really fun to hand out stuff to new characters and come up with witty lines. I handed out bags in Goldshire yesterday and the day before and stuff like:
---
New bags in stock! Even roomier and so soft you could use them as a pillow when you fill them! (Not taking claims in case of pointy objects in the bag!)
---
Yo what's your stance now that MC and Ony are getting cleared by 25 man PuGs only three weeks down the line?

---
#####Newly formed guild recruiting players of all skill levels interested in a casual raiding experience and having friendly people to play Classic with.
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
**&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** is a North American based Alliance casual raiding guild occupying the Pagle (PvE) server. As a guild, we look to maintain a focus on understanding and supporting your guild mates as we all traverse Classic raiding together.&amp;nbsp;    
---
Some of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and gaming buddies!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#‚òÑÔ∏è What we look for in members ‚òÑÔ∏è
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of **&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.
---
#üìú Requirements and Rules üìú
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!
---
#üìÖ Guild Events üìÖ
---
**Post Launch:** At the current moment, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#‚öîÔ∏è [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ‚öîÔ∏è
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 9:00pm - 12:00am Eastern Standard Time (EST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 12th (we will re-evalute as necessary). Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This should give members enough time to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild. We are currently recruiting all positions and classes __besides tanking__.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 14 Melee Damage, and 14 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
The loot system is a rotating loot council comprised of the Guild Master, a selection of two random officers, and two random guild members. The piece will be awarded to the guild member who the council believes will make the biggest impact on our progression. Be ready to put the guild before your ego! You will get pieces, I promise.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;

no bugs though everything is functioning as it should if blizzard wanted the guards to run up there they could make them.
---
Can you tell me why?
---
Look for deals on Greater Magic Essence or 3xLesser Magic essence. The greater magic wand vendors for 15s35c (might be a bit off with the copper amount but it's around that price). Simple wood costs about 10c? So as long as you can get the essences below 15s you're in the green and can get your enchanting up to 150 while making a little profit. Could also try to AH the wands but it's barely worth it considering how flooded it is with these wands. You'll probably start making money at higher levels when you get access to enchants that are dropped by mobs from higher level dungeons and what not. Another enchant that's pretty well going is the movement speed bonus one while unmounted.
---
similar or slightly higher on Nethergarde, depending if/how many are on AH.
---
I was swimming around the lake in Darnassus as an Orca (Druid swim form + glyph of orca) asking people near the water for some fish.
---
Someone actually ran to the closest fish vendor and bought me some üòÇüòç
---
How did you grind 1k gold so quickly?
---
Picked up a few in Tanaris this morning
---
That wasn't what I said. They wanted to move to another role, not move up a payscale.
---
can you traverse the ocean?thought you cant
---
But to conjure like 60 seconds. Change that reply to 60s
---
Christ you must be bad considering that the content is already getting rolled by PuGs three weeks after you made this comment.
---
I play on Golemagg and it's all English here.
---
Don't get why OP wants to play on US servers.
---
&gt;more relevant in the world
---
And why is that? Europe has roughly the same population and majority of people speak/write English.
---
That involves extra programming. Yes, this is an exploit and therefore a bug, stated by blizzard themselves.
---
If they attack from the ground the guards will kill them in seconds. This has been an issue for years. Thats why they made the guards ranged in retail. The point of the being up there is that you can kill people all you want inside the neutral city and the guards can‚Äôt do anything about it. 
---
Ps this is exactly the shit J. Was talking about when he said you think you do, but you don‚Äôt. Just leave the city and don‚Äôt give either of them the satisfaction.
---
why would you think thats trolling?  incoming damage isn't a problem in these dungeons thats why warriors are going without a shield and druids are going stacking agi/str and completely ignoring defensive stats.  this staff makes your dungeon slower than having an empty slot lol
---
It's a reference for the less-legal servers where the western clients couldn't render properly the missing Chinese characters, so all strings would render as empty.
---
Those nodes in instances AFAIK are separate node "objects" so they can have different drop tables (DM nodes, ZG nodes, or even ooze covered nodes in silithid hives).
---
Not many knew about the exploit anyways.
---
Most people who knew about it would know they would get rekt hard. 
---
Stuff like jumping over the gate prior to a match of WSG granted a 3 day ban in vanilla. Such a glaring issue with such a big impact on the game was a sure fire way to get banned and your stuff removed.
---
I used to go mountainbiking every day. Havn't been for a month. But now I have prebis/mc gear, benediction and truefaith. I'm going out biking this weekend!
---
I've leveled to 225 without any issues. Found some recipes here and there and it worked nicely.
---
The secret is to use fishing! Get your frogs and what not, cook them up, get that skill working for you.
---
Cooking is also very good for profit. Get tiger meat, 2 apples, 1 mana flask and you get 2 jungle stew. Input: 90 copper. Output: 6 silver. Pretty good, I'd say! Surely helps to get that level 40 mount!
---
Brave Sir Robin turned about, and gallantly he chickened out!
---
It's the thing you kill, then he rez immediatly, so you have to kill him again.
---
BIS Druid ‚ÄûTANK‚Äú staff. congratulations!
---
That the sensitivity went up, but you should never be holding the right click while FD'ing anyway.
---
It works both ways sadly. Sure, not using BIS meta classes and builds is a thing and you absolutely can play like this. But, on the other hand, if you're already not the best group of players around, you kind of want to increase your chances by bringing in strongest possible builds...
---
Druid was already mentioned but I think Hunter may be a good choice. You need to manage your deadzone and the way you do that greatly depends on what class you are facing. Perhaps you want to kite a melee enemy, or just go in an all out DPS race against a ranged opponent. You also have a varied toolkit filled with numerous traps and stuff like aspect of the cheetah and flare. 
---
I know you asked about BG PvP, but a hunter shines in world PvP, too. Where you can literally track enemies using hunter's mark and track humanoids. 
---
It's a class with a large toolkit and a high skill ceiling. You'll definitely be shifting tactics based on the situation and enemy. At least more than most of the other classes.
---
No warriors are rewarded by this being 1.12, before the threat changes they weren't nearly this dominant and were almost always threat capped.
---
Lots of questing.  I don‚Äôt enjoy dungeon grinding so I quested a fuck ton.  Also after I hit 60 I kept questing.  Finished all the quests in all the high zones.  Skinned along the way then sold it all when I switched to engineering.  Got a lucky boe that sold for 200g as well.
---
Teranis
---
I just hit 30 also. Did you get your whirlwind axe already?
---
I do lol ü§£
---
That's because almost nobody is on at night.
---
God you're fucking stupid
---
As most of the crafting mats are still low value in the AH, there are few outstanding farming spots, really only monastery cleave spam is a reasonably effective way to farm if you're into that stuff and play the right class. 
---
Gold income just from questing on the other hand explodes shortly after 40, you easily get 50-80s or items worth this much or more. Personally I'd just keep going with quests for another one, maybe two levels.
---
A fews weeks back when I was running SM for the gear (finally got the leggings after 25 Herod kills) I got cheated by our healer. As a paladin I have been running as DPS or Healer in dungeons, depending on what the group needs. As such I carry two sets with me and a ton of water since paladin healers are no priests and need to drink often if you want a somewhat speedy clear. In comes this other paladin healer, and he hasn't brought any water with him. We first stand around for 10 minutes looking for a mage that can conjure him some, but none are around. In the end I traded him 40 water, half my water supply because I know that each run requires 10-15 water. He doesn't even say thank you or pay anything back. A bit frustrated I think to myself, "oh well, see it as an investment, now the runs wont take 10 minutes extra". And since we were a farm group 10 minutes saved each run is a lot. Guess what, after one run he leaves and takes all my precious water with him. Now I had to HS back to Southshore 40 minutes later to replenish my water stores and make the 15 minute trekk back. &gt;:(
---
Yeah people are still new to the concept of a couple levels doesn't make you impervious to lowbies anymore.
---
For the longest time Retail had that BS mechanic which drastically reduces your hit chance on higher level players, then it was made even worse with stat squish.
---
Eh to each their own. I was the person who trained them and the person who had to deal with anything they couldn't do and I had no issues.
---
If it didn't work for you that's a shame, but it can work.
---
Warriors have it good in 1.12, it is known.
---
I'm playing druid and at lvl 27 I don't regret it. I enjoy cat form and healing the most but it's nice to have so many options. There's lots to learn if you want to play well in PvP. And you're really nimble.
---
Biggest downsides so far is that bear form is ugly and dps could be better. And I wish cat and bear form dmg scaled with weapon damage so they're not just literal stat sticks.
---
While I accept Skarms insights on raid performance. He's simply wrong in the dungeon parts and clearly hasn't had enough experience with group content and paladins. Hobbs would be the better source or if you can stomach his attitude Killerdukki. 
---
Paladins are clearly the most difficult to manage tanks in 5 man content but they are able to perform as a stand-in if other tanks are unavailable. Given the general lack of tanks for group content, thats a given. 
---
Lack of taunt is a non-issue as more threat can be generated with more mana usage. This brings us to the other problem, mana. Expect frequent breaks or lack of threat. This makes paladins the only class of tanks that can actually run out of a ressource they need and requires them AND the group to act accordingly. 
---
The paladin also has to constantly check if he is currnetly generating too much threat on a target because then he's wasting mana that could be used for emergencies or to speed up the run.
---
The current meta of pulling everything red, ass pulling everything else that can be found and seeing mana breaks and CC as non-essential works also against this. 
---
In a 5 man group of people that are working together? Absolutely no issue but still a warrior or druid would be better.
---
You can pug it without any issues whatsoever
---
No your adding additional assumptions.
---
Im exclusive talking about a pvp situation forcing you to hearth bubble.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you slayed the whole of orgrimmar, sure good job.
---
Now there‚Äôs a situation that forces you to bubble hearth. That‚Äôs not a win.
---
You can‚Äôt just arbitrarily add x number of positive events to the scenario that are supposed to make up for having to bubble hearth beeing a negative one.
---
The act of having to bubble hearth is not a win just because you had some won fights before you lost and were forced to bubble hearth
---
Good luck getting any sort of positive comments in this subreddit, while I would also enjoy dual spec as a priest I appreciate the original game did not have that as a feature and enjoy it for what it is.
---
I do I swear ;)
---
I have limited myself to 3-4 gym sessions a week because of wow, cutting back from 5-7
---
The room before last boss in BRD is harboring a ton of quick killed, quick spawned mobs. You need to kill special torch-dropping mob, and ignite 2 braziers to unlock the door to the boss. Im just guessing here, but a torch run is either a name for farming that room for xp or simply another name for a full second wing clear.
---
But they should've and that was probably fixed now. XP once after that not anymore.
---
I was going to argue with you but I decided it'd be better if I blocked you it's not like I'll be missing anything LOL.  bye
---
Check out wowheads newest post regarding dps. Warriors on top as always
---
Would you invite someone specced into tank?
---
I've been playing on AD EU since 2014 and i did t know %t was a thing...
---
Im guessing they pull the mobs that always respawns before Emperor in BRD and aoe that area to pieces for 100k xp/hour. To get a truly classic experience...
---
It‚Äôs funny how all the talk about it being bannable the last few days seems to have made even more people do it.
---
Thanks man!  I wish you could grind exalted with the other races in p1, I wanted a raptor :/
---
Same here. What level are you at?
---
Well, for some bosses. Some bosses (like 3 or so) cant be tanked by druids, as they require either a hard cooldown or the use of items (which bears cant). Warriors will never surpass druids in regard to pure mitigation and hp pool, but will, under some circumstances, be able to avoid crushing blows. Druids will reach the armour cap, whereas warriors wont.
---
Many warrior tanks will probably dual wield and go furyprot, as they generate too little threat to keep aggro when being sword n board, which means that they are both crittable and crushable. It is also a requirement for a warrior to have thunderfury, as they need all the threat they can get. Druids can pretty much just do wtf, as their threat generators are multipliers, whereas warrior threat gens are additive.
---
I have a feeling that this gm hates his job. Didnt blizzard fired like half of the gm staff some months ago?
---
It was like this in vanilla I think. I remember killing a 60 rogue as a lvl 20 priest with a lvl 20 friend after kiting him for like 5 min
---
Good, I don‚Äôt really want a brain dead like you commenting.
---
I am level 34 on my mage and i am by no means a tourist xd i just dont have much time to play. Couple hours only during a weekend.
---
You cant really put all the players at certain level in the same basket. On retail i was doing mythic +15 +. 
---
What i am saying is just because someone is low level doesnt mean someone doesnt know how to play. Not everyone was able to play 5 days in the game yet :)
---
I'm a simple man. I see cats, I updoot
---
Once I was doing little mini game turtle quests that would entertain (maybe) a 2nd grader I had to ask myself is this the future I want to be living in and finally had to say goodbye to retail.
---
fuck this guy
---
This has nothing to do what you said but thanks for ItemRack addon mention. Was looking good set management addon (playing druid as well) and ones I tried didn't work. So thank you :)
---
The droprate feels like I think it felt 15 years ago. Mined over 50 rich thorium and gotten 10 arcane crystals now. Even 2 out of one vein yesterday.
---
But the hits on a rich thorium vein feel off, sometimes I only get two hits resulting in 2 ore and 1 stone.
---
Yep, /kick and find a new one, it's not like there arent 5000 other mages floating around
---
IM IN CHARRRGE NOW
---
Most likely. Flights to the noobie zones are cheap so players who are just starting out can afford them.
---
They do for me, because they amount of bad mages rivals hunters by now, because they did not learn their class.   
---
I had a warlock who didnt learn shadowbolt and banish as level 57, because he facerolled his way to close to 60 in AoE farm groups. 
---
This non-skill gameplay seeps into the high level dungeons now, where these people don't have a grasp of their class and try to AoE 2 battlemages and a scarlet priest.
---
Im only lvl32 but it feels pretty balanced
---
Beats mine, I got
---
"people have a great respect for you"
---
When even before reading it my gf and the server asked what it said and I replied "it says dump the girl"
---
Yeah I have 3 ranks of frostbolt on my bars. Highest and second-highest for damage and watching threat, and then rank 1 for spamming quickly.
---
New tank here.  It's wayyyyyy different than DPS or heals.  There's a ton of chaos going on all the time, you can't break focus much, the group does expect you to know the instance perfectly, but the reward of leading a group through a dungeon and pulling all mobs correctly while maintaining aggo is incredible.  It feels like you've actually accomplished something, rather than just managing your mana and keeping people alive/mobs dead.  It's like a whole different game, and imho, a lot more fun.   You start out being absolute dog shit at it, and wipe a bunch of groups, but that pressure leads you to learn, and read, and perfect your pre-dungeon plan which is something I've never had to do as a follow-along class.
---
Because despite every class and spec being viable in BfA, that never stops the min maxers from trying to squeeze out every second, and the playerbase gobbles it up to try to emulate these pro players, and somehow it becomes law, and that's how elitists become born imo. 
---
I believe I read that there have been 40 man raids consisting of only druids and paladins for example, to show you don't absolutely need these pre planned rosters and class selectism, but human nature will cause these types of elitist scenarios to play out sadly.
---
Alllriggt folks move along, nothing to see here. Cmon twenty-three skiddoo!
---
I do melee cleave groups, and rogues are very much welcome
---
I love dungeon grinding, and I have no idea wtf is everyone's problem with that 
---
Yeah, it might get boring for a mage, but try leveling a fucking warrior solo
---
Also, you know what's not boring? Being 60
---
I want to see 8 Prot Palis tank 4 horsemen.
---
Darnassus doesnt even have an anvil to forge stuff. Everytime I need that, I express my most sincere gratitude loudly to whoever decided or forgotten to put down a single anvil into that main city.
---
Feel free to buy your own water at the vendor bud

Lack of ranged can be solved with ez-throw tnt. Cheap and requires no engineering.
---
haha get it? because like duh obviously if anyone wants a single ounce of quality of life they fucking love everything about BFA.
---
Stop pretending that retarded shit makes a game "challenging" or "difficult"

There is its called frost mage.

Restauration tree, it's what's for dinner.
---
Restoration is what you were looking for. I still love your version though.
---
Not just tanks, 1.12 changed how threat worked in general, resulting in melee damage only dealing 80% of your damage as threat outside of D stance.

Dude a couple more black Lotus won't destroy the economy.
---
It is layers he is not making new black Lotus. He is literally taking a black Lotus from a different layer that has been there anyway. 2min later some1 from that layer would have picked up that black Lotus.
---
He is not creating infinite amounts of a material he is just collecting it on one Person instead of it being spread out on multiple.
---
This is not gonna do anything to the economy so stop panicking pls..
---
Either way layerhopping is fixed by now :)
---
Yeah I realized even if I hit 60 I will always be fodder if I go anywhere alone, which is something I like to do. Just thinking about grinding raid mats and dying a million times is not my definition of fun.
---
I guess I‚Äôm just more of a pve player at heart. I enjoy dungeons and raids, and battlegrounds, but I‚Äôm just not cut out for world pvp, not when getting stomped as the absolute minority.
---
The add-on "Auctionator" adds to the tooltip of an item how valuable the enchanting-mats you will, on average, get out of an item, are and thus allows you to compare directly whether disenchanting, vendoring or selling the item on the AH is the best course of action for each individual item.
---
On average it really seems like selling is much better. Makes me wonder where all those cheap-enchanting-mats in the AH come from. There must be people who don't intend on leveling the profession but use it to make a net-loss. :o
---
Just hit level 22 on my horde priest. Where would be the best place for me to quest? I‚Äôve got quests leading me to Ashenvale and to Stonetalon mountains, which of these would be a better experience for horde? Also should I level up abit before attempting the 22-24 level quests in the Barrens or am I better off just staying at the barrens and doing them all?
---
How do I level a prot pally? Currently level 16 working my way up the holy tree to get consecration so I can tank dungeons as I level. Problem being is that I'm levelling with a 2h at the moment as it makes questing much quicker, but once I get consecration I'm gonna need to start levelling the prot tree which involves a lot of talents that require shields to be effective. 
---
So I guess my question is, once I get consecration should I put points into prot and keep using the 2h, put points into prot and start using a 1h and shield, or start putting points into ret for damage and respec later on? 
---
Or should I do something else entirely that I haven't even thought of?
---
Cheers
---
Hope it's not too late to reply, but while I think DKP is more suited for distributing loot than Loot Council in Classic (for various reasons), DKP is also deeply flawed - or at least how I've experienced it. 
---
People tend to get greedy and hoard all of their DKP towards a single big upgrade (ie. a weapon or a trinket) and pass on minor upgrades. This creates headaches for raid leaders when they have to give out loot that is actually upgrades, but nobody wants to spend their DKP. 
---
Also it's extremely unattractive for new raiders. This depends how deep into a tier the guild is, but sometimes raiders have so much DKP that it's virtually impossible to compete against and you have no way of catching up (outside of them spending their DKP and collecting all the loot). 
---
Honestly, I think for any Classic guild that seeks to thrive has to find a balance of being approachable for new raiders but also reward long term raiders. Something like rolling off the less desirable items for everyone and allowing only their best/most attendant players to roll on big upgrades. Something along those lines, but better thought out than what I did.
---
For leveling you shouldn't even buy it. It's too expensive (energy wise) and offers so little damage. Better of using claw, rake and ferocious bite.
---
Iirc it's bis period.
---
Shouts also generate threat, demo shout is usually first thing to use after pulling. And if you have engi, pop them grenades.
---
+50% atk speed...good for tanking threat gen and dps
---
You already made a ton of shitpost like this.

same, not doing that dungeon
---
Wait, did they give exp in vanilla or not? Cause if they did, we should be really worried.
---
Thanks for clearing that up!

Pally tanking is tough. I played a pally tank with my friends until about level 34 and i finally had to switch to ret, questing was just too miserable. In order to have a reliable AoE you need to go 11 points into the holy tree which sets you back quite a bit, and the brunt of the protection tree is broken by design (The goal of a tank is to be crit proof so why do we have two talents that require us to be crit?
---
Can you tank as ret? Ehhh, kinda. Righteous fury is a helluvadrug and Seal of Command + RF is a ton of threat. That being said, you are entirely riding the whims of RNG on whether or not the thing you are hitting hits you back. My group and I have basically designated me the "boss tank" because although i have not a single AoE, after about 2 Command procs i rarely lose threat on a single target. Does this mean that you should advertise yourself as a tank when looking for groups? Absolutely not.
---
Paladins are hybrid classes and they play like one regardless of whether or not you want it to. When i was specced prot i had to heal sometimes, I tank while i'm ret - Paladins are flexible and provide amazing buffs. For casual play or even semi serious PvE Pallies are just fine if you know what you are doing with the people you are playing with, and they are absolute monsters in PvP, but if you are planning on pushing the toughest endgame raids with a serious group of people then you nailed it on the head - They cannot really tank raids, and any utility a DPS pally brings, a holy brings just as much with the caveat that they can bring a better DPS instead.
---
All that being said, Paladins are very satisfying to play, and in a group dynamic have some amazing utility.
---
Sounds kind of immature now, but back in the original "classic" days, I would give away stuff I made while leveling my LW by playing hide and seek. I'd pick a spot in Org, and the first to find me would get a set of whatever I was currently crafting. Didn't always get people interested, but occasionally I'd get a group running all over the city looking. Made it fun to give away gear I'd probably have vendored or tried to AH anyway.
---
&gt;attempts
---
I've been doing RP for a while now and I've been made to understand that you don't need to write "attempts" or "would" in all actions against another player. Rather, announce the action and let the player react.
---
For example:
---
&gt;A pushes B into the water.  
---
&gt;B notices A's intentions and dodges the push in time to avoid being thrown into the water.
---
It's a matter of trust between both roleplayers that they'll both seek to fulfill their roleplay desires and not attempt to "beat" the other, which leads to richer experiences.
---
&gt;**Oh.. pay better you say?** Cool, you have fun explaining to sysadmins and network engineers why the helpdesk guys are making as much as they are with **no responsibilities** and **a lot easier work**. Best pay them more as well...

I think i agree. As a shadow priest pretending to be a healer at uldamar, i find my self ooming when we have a ‚Äòpogchamp pro look at me meleecleave ravager beserkerstance tankwarrior‚Äô who might be overleveld compared with a tank 2 lvls under the requirement who uses a shield and defensive stance, sometimes not even using 20% of my mana on pulls on those REAL tanks.
---
People here mention don't use shields on tanks, but generally avoid using shields, unless you need to prevent them taking damage before throwing a heal on them. 
---
Spend some time to learn the cast times, the mana costs, and the usual heals. You'll work out good times to use heal vs greater vs bubble. 
---
Also, don't be afraid to have players not at full health. Don't waste mana on overhealing, or healing targets that aren't taking/going to take damage.
---
Stop playing with high school kids
---
No they most certainly are not.
---
Bears are, for most bosses, better tanks than warriors, as they have higher mitigation and generate a lot higher threat. In order to be uncrit/crushable warriors need to go sword and board, which means they wont be generating as much threat as they sometimes need to. Warriors will many times go fury-prot and dual wield in order to mitigate this. Dudus dont care, as their threat gens are multiplicative whereas warriors' are additive. Beardudus easily reach the armour cap whereas warriors wont, as well as having a much higher hp pool to take those crushes and eventual crits.
---
Feral DPS can be really competitive (if youre alliance), but it requires some extremely tight play, as you need to powershift between regen ticks. You need judgement of wisdom to get enough mana back though (unless youre paired with a bunch of manatide shamans). Oh and you need to farm MCPs, but you already knew that. Most druid ferals dont know how to play, and will never powershift. Oh and you need consumables as you will be chugging down pots like theres no tomorrow.
---
Dudu healing can be great, if you know what youre doing. Youre the most efficient healer, but you really need to be able to predict the future to land heals properly. You wont be as high as hpalas or priests if they play equally well, but you wont suck at all.
---
Balance...ugh yeah, i guess if youre insane. I suppose it is doable to achieve enough dps to not get kicked, but you will need consumables. A lot of them. 600 dps is doable.
---
You feeling ok?

What about the oce servers
---
Laughs in horde
---
It's just human nature these days. People see the pro players and their builds/rosters and suddenly it's law and the right way to play, nevermind that you could probably clear a raid with 40 paladins or druids, or 10 warriors, 10 priests, 20 rogues.
---
Where is the ‚ÄúTruestrike/Dal‚Äôrends reserved‚Äù box?

None of those numbers are accurate

Post of the day !!
---
Does this work on each monster hit for AoE like hellfire or rain of fire? Or would it just be a chance on the cast or possibly not work at all with AoE?
---
Most of us gets tired of the asshats that wants to pull/compete for threat.
---
They removed the ability to line break long ago because people would abuse it to impersonate other players or even game masters. It would be considered an exploit if you found a way to do it.
---
This.
---
The only time I've used it questing was on bleed immune skeletons at raven hill.
---
If you can get heals into a drink rotation things go very smoothly.  Worst is when heals don't show up with stacks and stacks of drinks.  I want them drinking immediately after a pack is down, so I can tank into the next pack while they regain mana, get aggro till I'm half life, get a heal, down the pack, and repeat the cycle.  Healers that just heal and stay half to a quarter mana slow the group down and are responsible for a lot of wipes.  I usually carry stacks of drinks even if I don't need em so the healers have no excuse not to drink.
---
I don't see smolderweb
---
Once people start getting aq40 gear your dps will plummet down the charts. It's underrated until then!
---
Right, but the issue people run into is grouping up and disbanding as soon as the quest is completed, specially on kill X amount of Y quests. Which means they get less XP than was designed and end up running out of quests. Groups that stay together and grind extra mobs won't have an issue.
---
Fuck me the cringe is real in RP servers
---
Yeah, ZT is about 60:40 A:H, but because the Dark Lady watches over us, that 40 persent is equivalent to 70 persent.
---
Yeah since vanilla I do not report ppl anymore. Got a account suspension once many many years ago, I was the reporter but somehow the gm mixed that up and treat me as a suspect finally I got a bit rude in chat and got my acct suspended for 2 weeks.
---
How does one move the health and enemy health windows?
---
As a rogue, I like to stealth behind someone and inspect them, then type something like "/me pickpockets %t and receives \[item\]"  (where you don't type "\[item\]" but just shift-click the item you want to "steal" in the target's character sheet).  Sometimes people can get a bit worried about that. :)

When i level as prot i use shield with a shield spike, concecration, and red aura and aoe tank 3 or 4 mobs at once and watch them all kill themselves.
---
This hurt my brain....
---
Standard recommendation is to level as ret and respec later on - it's generally faster for solo content and you'll still be able to tank dungeons fine until endgame. Keep a 2h for levelling (and it's probably fine for a lot of tanking too) and a 1h+shield for tanking.
---
That sounds like a nice plan until you all get a juicy nova-cone crit
---
yo I have had this issue before recently, I'm pretty sure its just a bnet issue at the moment, I guess wait for them to fix it
---
I don't wait for the UI I spam it

Ya but you can summon so we forgive you.
---
Gehennas. See quite alot of alliance players though. Have a list going with people I‚Äôm gonna corpsecamp the fuck out of when I get to 60.

This is why vanilla and classic is so much better than retail. With /p you are thinking about the party, the comradery, the fun.
---
With /i you are only thinking about yourself, constantly reminding yourself how you can benefit from these people.
---
why are the vendors on strike?  is it because we keep selling them literal garbage?
---
And they will lose their accuracy more and more as time goes on as blizzard intentionally broke the functionality of the addon that was used to obtain this kind of data by making the "/who" command require a user-input. :\

I think it was about a weak ago so the data is at least a weak old.
---
I give 1c to mages in dungeons just to be a bit patronizing
---
The Zoram Strand in Ashenvale can be excellent leveling and is usually horde-dominated.
---
There is a world quests (essentially dailies) for one of the factions where you have to protect baby turtles from predators (crabs and seagulls). Each time a turtle makes to to the water the NPC  says... well, "A turtle made it to the water". It had become a pretty big meme by the time Blizzcon last year rolled around where they even got the NPCs voice actor on stage, which was pretty nice.
---
I'm only worried that if I pick druid I end up using cat form all the time and end up using only the abilities that cat form has because it's most efficient.
---
Sure, but then you have your actually trained IT staff looking for other roles, because if they realise the incompetent staff are getting paid the same as them for 1st line support, then they will start to think they are 2nd line, because - well they know a lot more than the new 1st liners.
---
I honestly have no idea how this has worked out for your company, unless there is a massive lack of jobs for IT support in your area. My area there seems to be a lot of jobs for Help Desk workers and the good ones flock to the same companies and the bad ones tend to be stuck doing support for an MSP with 100 tiny customers with weird and wild processes because thats all they can get to keep their company afloat.

Isn't the point of a makro to get shit done in an instant within presing the button just once?

No.  Ret is in no way competetive in pvp.

There's always pvp and battlegrounds. Until the raiders get bored once they have their gear and start pushing the pvpers around. &gt;_&gt;

I know someone who spent 750g on it on my server.

not being able to split packs with a pet is also infuriating  
---
pull pack, once they are on you, let pet hit the one you want to split  
---
FD, rest of the pack goes back to minding their own business  
---
now in classic, they ALL just move on to random targets around you or your pet.  
---
also having my pet bodypull and not  hit a mob, causes said mob randomly switching target to me.  
---
the aoe threat this client randomly hands out to combatants and non combatants is just broken

right , i'm  OPs side here, but this is starting to seem a bit pitty.

like

&gt;Wayyyyyy ahead of you.
---
just relax dude, is it really that big of a deal? The GM is just some dude with a job. Also inb4 "if we don't report this it's gonna happen again". From the chat OP even admits to walljumping , so what's the problem? It's harsh but i don't think they're gonna look at this as a mistake on the GM's part. Also the GM didn't hang up mid conversation. "Thank you have a good night", what you need him to spell out "i am going now, b y e? "he'd already moved on before you sent that last message.
---
From what I've heard, it's mostly a spec for when a raid's already on farm status. It doesn't cut it in progression.
---
Yeah cause smacking sleeping orcs in order to wake them up is thematically much more mature.

That is not accurate in the least and census add-ons dont even work anymore. Nobody knows anything about server pops except Blizz.

The way I cope is that effectively vanilla levelling is grinding mobs. Quests are an exp bonus and a hint of where to go. Sometimes you get gear upgrades.
---
If course if you're following a guide on how to be super efficient this begins to break down. Even then, when I did a 1 to 10 guide, I had to grind deliberately at two points.
---
Because u want dualspec
---
Leeroy wants transmog
---
And horst wants lfg/lfr
---
And in a couple of weeks we have retail 1 and retail 1.2... Thats why u only see haters in the comments..
---
‚Äûgives me a warning for some reason‚Äú
---
he is literally telling you the reason.
---
beside the fact that youre denying it and then tried to contact him ‚Äûoh yea ok i was up there‚Äú
---
What should he do?
---
No joke, I didn‚Äôt know it was a thing until people started complaining about it.
---
My hunter is lvl almost-28, and i'm having some issues with my route.
---
I've been to Ashenvale, Thousand needles, Barrens and Stonetalon.
---
I don't know where to go next, since Wetlands and Hillsbrad are crawling with Alliance.
---
you can exploit something without it being a bug.  you got super worked up over nothing.  you can have a block too since you want it buddy.
---
That's what I thought. Thanks
---
Killing stone elementals in badlands is a decent way earning money at 40...they drop a lot of vendor trash with fair price...but it might be crowded there...
---
Healed my first full brd at 48, first lbrs at 52, first strat living at 53 and first strat ud at 55. Now that i'm lvl 56 everything feels like it is within my range
---
Noggenfogger EU, Horde
---
They said they didnt "fight anyone up there" and also explained how they are a melee and can not exploit the bug. This GM just clearly doesn't care.
---
They did ofc, and not only in vanilla.
---
It's called the Streisand effect :)
---
Are you sure u Installed it in the right folder
---
I thought it was? There is a lot of iron, IF ONLY I COULD MINE IT!!!! :P 3 more nodes of tin or silver should get me to 125 and then I'm gucci
---
42 is definitely going to be a challenge. That's why I suggest doing ulda first to get 43 maybe a couple bars in, and maybe do some ZF quest/grind, 42 is definitely possible, and 44 is easy.
---
best is to see that the priest never even heard of cancel aura....
---
Yeah me neither. Everyone's been super friendly on Mograine.
---
I recommend peeking on Joana's guide and doing every dungeon at least once with all the quests.
---
Lmao fucks wrong with you, boy?
---
lol there will always be bad players to play with don't worry
---
has no buffs .. always runs in front of the tank which makes him nervous (since he has now downtime is always on the edge of his seat to start the next fight)... will go all out for his dps and ignores bodypulls while doing so but will vanish if the rest of the grp wipes to the mobs he pulled - just to mock and blame the healer and /or tank while they do the corpserun ... I understand the "issue" with rogues to some extent - I love having a rogue who knows what to do but there are not many and they are in my opinion the minority - since dps is in 90% not the priority except for dpscheck bosses / encounters
---
Druids are quite good tanks, especially for 5-man content. There is a lack of good raiding tank gear for feral, and you'll find warriors will get a significant edge in later raid tiers. Druids still have a viable role as offtanks even after that.
---
Few groups will accept a druid dps, and lack of res hurts druids healing 5-mans. They are fine but not amazing in healing on raids.
---
I have a real life horse phobia.
---
Won't stop me from getting my mounts though.
---
That's.... Well... Dumb.
---
Skeletal horses.
---
But as a warlock I can say that our relationship with our demons are more sadistic actually.
---
And a warrior got it, I don't know if Varia thought it was a shaman cause I took the screenshot and am a shaman, but Hx is a warrior.
---
Nobody gets banned in Classic, lol
---
damn it, stop telling people this is a thing, I only rolled a warrior to be the special snowflake loot whore
---
Indeed. We don't know how much stress these people are under. I've worked in shitty customer support before under very stressful conditions, and we messed up big sometimes when we were in too much of a hurry. 
---
I also have no idea if this guy is the one who logged this report and made a case of it. Could be someone else's fuckup too.
---
Quests :)
---
I play on Ashbringer as horde, best server ever. Alliance has a bit more members than horde nowadays, but overall very balanced experience.
---
Enjoy your stay.
---
Swag confirmed
---
Yes but that‚Äôs one quest at level 6-7? Doing 2nd grade tasks as a hero of Azeroth level 120?? Not sure how we can compare them given that context.
---
Well then you might have to go back for a bit to get the last few levels before you can mine there.
---
I am about to buy my first mount in lvl 40 and I am honored in Orgrimmar and UnderCity.. Which looks more badass Undead sitting on a wolf or Undead sitting on Skeletal horse?
---
Its free real estate
---
yeah, i was definitely not talking about aoe packs here. however, gotta take it into consideration that if im going into BRD for example there will be a number of guys around level 55-58 in greens, and even if they are a mage or a warlock, i am going to out-dps them.
---
Not to mention those mages who tunnel vision cast Blizzard when they see more than 1 mob...
---
It's 100% but only on a certain type of raptor
---
Of course it's viable.  It's just suboptimal.  When you're starting out there's no reason to try and heal with ele.  Once you have gear and you're just facerolling through, it's a waste to spend hundreds of gold respeccing.
---
These guys are on a different dimension
---
Raptors and skeletal horses
---
You're putting up Healing geared / Healing talented healers against eachother here, which is not the point of my post.   
---
&gt; And that's the case for everyone. If the healer is underleveled, you won't be able to do chain pulls. If the dps are underleveled, you won't be able to do chain pulls. If the tank is underleveled, you won't be able to do chain pulls. 
---
The whole idea of the post, is to make people aware that healers 1-2 levels below requirements that are healing geared and healing talented can heal a dungeon as fine as a person that beats the requirement with 1-2 levels and have no talents or gear. 
---
Of course with better gear and higher levels you can do more healing, but a healer with resto talents and healing gear lvl 48, will outheal, outlast and have more sustainability than a lvl 52 with no talents and no gear, thus he should be the better choice for the dungeon in this scenario.   
---
That's not the point of anything, the point of the post is that a geared and specced healer can do just as good as a healer that's a higher level but doesn't have the talent or the gear. It's not a question of who is effected the most by level differences in the dungeons.
---
Well I would like to be combat until I can get decent ganking open world pvp build...so far I won most my PvP encounter with combat rog even when they attacked me first. When I will be able to get one/two shot build I will go for it
---
Don't worry, as a warrior without a FaP/help you can expect to get bodied by any mage that isn't terrible.
---
I disagree, its faster for the tank to use his eyes than it is for me to type in the chat that im drinking. If he cant look at his party frames to check on the healer mana, i dont expect him to be able to read the chat.
---
A two sentence horror story
---
Don't use macros for anything involving FD. Just keybind pet passive, press that, feign death, and trap all manually.
---
It was also changed in wotlk iirc to just attack speed buff, not extra hits.
---
Alright now get it again in teal!
---
There's also Silver dragon which can integrate with HandyNotes
---
It's because you tested the blood of all those animals you killed with your portable blood-tester-kit (mouth). The sample size required to make an accurate prediction is unfortunately rather large, so sometimes you end up ingesting their entire blood supply.
---
My Bad, sorry :)
---
I'm on horde Ashbringer! 
---
Always seemed 50/50 to me!
---
Great server
---
'Dey dook our juuuubs!
---

---
Did anything ever come of it? Was she waiting for you?
---
Unlike #TrueVanillaPlayers some people actually value their time, you know. I've did those quests not once and not twice for example, they aren't interesting to me at all.
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that people are trying to do them all in one go. For example BRD has a big level range, multiple quests, and locked doors for a reason. Pick a section, do that, and come back later. Easier to not burn out from long runs.
---
Every time I see alliance, I am one bad look from just saying fk the quests, I will spend the next half hour practicing world pvp and start a fight. 
---
I can't state enough how much I love world pvp. Even if I lose the fight. And after winning the fight in which odds are against us /y LOK'TAR or FOR SYLVANAS is the most epic sh*t this game has to offer imo
---
I had something similar, but I got in the habit by pressing it once just after stealthing, and then a second time to actually backstab people.
---
Nah I've had it too many times to be RNG, the dwarfs in Mulgore killed about 50 of them day after release, broke group 6 dropped in a row. And mayn similar incidents since, too often it's happened to be RNG.
---
Shimmering flats? For someone who completed all of that 28 is a bit low...did you complete every quest in southern horde Barrens base (cant remember name)...oh and at 28 you could do few RFK dungeon runs...bat drops very nice bow..
---
Saved, thanks!
---
They is a gender-neutral pronoun. What's the big issue? It's a female human, so by all means call them a she if you want.
---
I didn't know what he typed was a Jaraxxus meme when I responded tho lol.
---
Ya, i only use roar at the start to get them all looking at me for the initial swings if the healer has someone hot'ed or something, so that thorns starts helping.  Not really a big deal, just in the habit of tossing it I guess.
---
The point I ment to get across is it feels to me like using swipe for me has felt less useful than I remember.  I mean it's nice if the group is actually all on 1 target, but the single target and switch thing is just feeling like it gives more control.
---
Play a warrior. Get ravager from herod. Feel strong as fuck.
---
It gets old in ze, uldamab so get a stoneslayer feel strong again.
---
Now you are in maraudon, get an axe from croc or 2h mace from princess, strong again. 
---
Now get into brd. Get a dreadforged retaliator from emperor feel strong once more.
---
You can be goldshires prostitute
---
Whether you clip auto shots or not depends on how fast your weapon is.
---
I use foot pedals for a few abilities. Every now and then my dog sits on one and presses it.
---
Here, good compilation of the info: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Master
---
True! It took me all day to come up with that response btw.
---
It's alright tbh, I'm just complaining a bit
---
Lol part of me wants to delete the question it‚Äôs so bad but the other part of me knows I deserve the shame.  Thank you lol and worry I didn‚Äôt just take a second and use my brain instead of asking hahaha
---
The point is, while you may be an exception to the rule, and I can sympathize, based on not knowing a player and not grouping with them previously to know, it's not worth the risk. While you may be perfectly capable of.handling it, if I have the choice between a L48 and a L52, at least the L52 has a HIGHER probability of having better gear, higher rank spells, and possible know their class better. Sure, they may not, but based on not knowing either player most groups will opt for a higher level because there is less risk of it backfiring and them having to kick q bad healer and try to find a replacement partway through. That kills a lot of time and groups.
---
Sorry to kill your dreams bud, but you need to be exalted to buy other races' mounts. So its dead horse for now :)
---
There's probably 7 other horde not in the picture helping you fight him I'm sure.
---
Great thing about Druid is that you'll have less competition for tier.
---
This comments section seems a but triggered.. Just a bit
---
The situation I presented above is a one v one. Just one with history. we're literally presenting you possible situations where a one v one could be considered a win win. In mine the person hearthing feals they have done enough damage and the attacker feels like they drove the invader off. A win/win. Just because you limit the scope doesn't mean others have to just to make sure your perspective is the correct one.
---
Yes. The purpose of a chart like this is to get a feel for how much a class brings to the raid. Some classes are very good to have 1 of.
---
wow.  mine's one of the larger ones (i think) and it's usually under 10g.
---
If you die in Molten Core can you teleprt back in as a ghost?
---
Being a healer, I probably wouldn't mind paying the tip.
---
Everyone gotta get dat mount somehow
---
Any update??
---
Undead sitting on a wolf looks like undead and wolf having a very special relationship... Very special.
---
Go horse, not hoes.
---
Well, i never said "be a stereotype of the worst hunt and wreck havoc in dungs while blaming everyone else".
---
I actually do tank dungeons with my BM, i just do so by running a carrion bird (spam screech) and being above-average level. The only dungeon i'm not comfy on doing would be BRS.
---
Or play a mage and get your class quest wand
---
They never have to stop moving except fot mind blast which is crazy in pvp
---
Yesterday I was collecting troll tusks or something in STV, and struggling because there were a lot of people killing them so they were respawning fast, and there were people dying and leaving their pile of angry mobs behind to agro whoever was in their path. I was also maybe a little underleveled. Anyway I needed like 25 of the things or something, and after getting 24 in maybe 30 kills or so, I killed no less than 10 more to get #25
---
very frustrating when I've been struggling to get the kills and thought I was almost done.
---
I don't have strong feeling on lower levels, but at 60 I generally am not pleased to see sub 60s, even healers. It just slows the pace down a lot. Mages are always oom after a pack, but if that group of 60s has a 59 healer, that person too tends to be oom like the mage, making it a long break between every pull. Lower level can do it, but it'll always be a bit more of a struggle naturally.
---
I did my last 2 levels in brd, doing torchruns. I used about 450 waters, drinking every chance i got, with the warlock chainpulling with killrogg.
---
Back in Cata/Firelands I won a piece of raid gear against another mage with a roll of 2. The guild erupted in laughter.
---
Yeah, this is what i'm doing at the moment. But it quickly gets hectic with a lot of running around so it's not always easy.
---
It‚Äôs clearly a hunter weapon.
---
Nice to hear thanks!
---
I've paid for a rez before
---
That's not 1v2. That's you ganking 2 low health players while they fight other mobs.
---
That's not guaranteed to work at all, actually I always used a macro with a petpassive in it. In fact, even when my pet is dead or dismissed it pretty much never work. There is a delay between the dropping of combat and pressing the FD button, which seems to be randomly between 0 and 2 sec. 
---
In PvE it's not that crippling since after those 2 sec the mobs willcertainly stop attacking you (if it isn't resisted) - even though I have already been killed several times by hits in that window when using FD while low on life. In PvP however it's too long and makes the opponent able to re-engage you before you can drop combat and lay a trap, in the vast majority of cases.
---
Either way there's an issue because combat dropping should be instant, and it is clearly not most of the time.
---
I did end up pushing for 60 in the end. Still haven't got HoJ, but I did get lucky in MC with 2x t1 and Perditions Blade. I think I used all of my luck up in one night for Classic!
---
Ay then i retract my statement
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gw2-ui
---
Make sure to use the Classic version.
---
That was very interesting.
---
Do I smelt my ore. DO I SMELT MY ORE? IT GIVES NO POINTS!!!!! 100 TO 125 YOU ARE DESTINED TO MINE TIN AND SILVER, WHICH ARE GREEEEEEENNNN
---
Are you dumb?
---
Just wait. The guys who rolled these efficent classes are obviously 60 by now. The others are still leveling/doing wpvp.
---
What do you mean by that? It sounds interesting, can you post a picture of your WAs?
---
you can prehot yourself to get some attention :) Works for every second pack, as you need to recharge mana.
---
I usually tab target and swipe for multiple. If i see my threat on 1 sucks, I maul as well.
---
Uhm what? Not for me
---
&gt; Seems like incompetence, leads me to believe they won't do shit to most exploiters 
---
How so, exactly? It's pretty clear OP was up there based upon the wording used in the conversation. Being up in such places is simply not allowed. Attacking other players from such a position would simply be a feature that would likely instill a harsher punishment. But's it's still a basic offense to begin with.
---
Why would you ever want a statless Melee weapon as hunter?
---
Well, as a tank, it's rogues and hunters that I always have to pull aggro from since they won't wait a split second for me to tab-sunder and build threat.
---
Picking up good blues as a low level healer was a huge noticeable improvement.
---
Eh, wpvp isnt that bad yet with the honor system not being there. Even stranglethorn vale was a cakewalk for me
---
I played in vanilla, and I‚Äôve played more than a week at lvl 60. Haven‚Äôt touched ‚Äùspellcleave‚Äù or exp farming, and use whatever dps wanna come. I‚Äôve had no problems at all.
---
&gt;and how do you guarantee that the underleveled random healer is actually well prepared and specced into healing?
---
It's is fairly easy to ask a healer if he is resto/holy specced or inspect him to look whether he is geared for healing. It's the same when I make a dungeon and a tank that barely beats the requirements ask to join, I'll ask if he is prot specced and how his gear is.  Obviously there is a chance he is a bad person and lies, but I can always inspect him for the gear at least. But you will always find people being able to lie in every scenario to further their own gain, so it doesn't make any sense taking that into account here.   
---
&gt; why should the groups risk it? 
---
If they don't want to they don't need to. The group always decides who they want to invite. This post isn't made to force people to pick low leveled healers, but to make more people aware that it is more than possible for lower leveled, geared/talented healers to do the job, so they can span out their search if it's hard for a group to find a healer.
---
Pretty sure you can disable automatic updates in the settings. Or just uninstall bfa if you don't play lol
---
Time is money friend!
---
Take them all and put on a flash drive
---
I starting to think that you are trolling... How can you think that those 3 videos you've uploaded are good?
---
It seems way less fun tho.
---
Not too familiar with Halo cuz xbox :( explain pls?
---
Wow you're such a tough badass
---
Im a 49 rogue and the sad fact is nobody wants a rogue for "fast dungeon spam" groups. Youre better off questing and if you have a few dungeon quests do the dungeon once in a mixed group of every class which will undoubtly be slower than the meta spellcleave/meleecleave groups
---
Hahahaha who posts this sort of thing and thinks it's content. This is literally you killing one afk and one fish in a barrel. 
---
Literal trash player
---
I always tip the Mage 1g but in return I expect to get max trade windows stacks of water. I barely use more than 1 stack during a single dungeon run so even if we include a random wipe or two, the dude have no reason at all to give you more than two as a healer. I have never had a Mage that asked for payment when he gave me water at start of a dungeon but I did have Mages that wouldn't give more than absolutely necessary - and it's absolutely fine to pay for the extra water...
---
Thank you. I always thought it related to people who fall through the cracks of any given system.
---
DELETE
---
Really heroic someone with half a life and shortly after a fight to kill. A true hero.
---
on Golemagg it was 275-350 g yesterday, 3 in ah
---
Warlocks are OP dont worry
---
&gt; are people who get indignant when someone charges for their services.
---
I figure if we're grouping together and there's a mage in the grp it's a dick move to charge me $$ for basically casting a spell.
---
What about mass crafting first two green guns from engi for DE into wand mats (as those are weapons)? Copper is easy to get at large.
---
DAE BLIZZARD BAD ?
---
Get a weapon with agi and something else. Wait until you get it from a quest. Your Pet is your Main source of damage anyways
---
Wow is that s11 reckless?!
---
Didn't they wipe a whole funeral?
---
&gt;he'd already moved on before you sent that last message.
---
Yes, and that is a problem lol.  Should OP just lie down and take it?  Do nothing?  Getting a warning for reporting someone is hilariously bad customer service, he should report it.
---
Yep done a good amount but ill do a few more. Thanks.
---
Someone did this to me off the zep and made me have to wait for a new one :(
---
No you are lucky, everyone and their mom is still farming that trink with 50+ runs
---
Applaud in rape horse
---
I am 5-boxing in Classic. Currently leveling a team of Warrior, Paladin, Priest, Mage, Warlock. It is so much fun to have all different classes, but it does make things harder for sure with all different rotations etc. 
---
I would recommend ISboxer for dual boxing too, yes. Cuz you can play from which ever character you want at any time and do literally anything you want with ease! Like let‚Äôs say you are fighting a mob and you‚Äôre playing from Paladin - another mob runs in from the side and you need to sheep it - you don‚Äôt have to switch over to the mage to sheep it because ISboxer will let you do that from playing from the Paladin. 
---
Look up this channel on YouTube - Multiboxology. MiRai is a multiboxing god who does videos on that channel and he teaches how to setup ISboxer and explains in ‚Äòdetail‚Äô how everything works! They have a Discord also that works as a customer service, which I have gotten so much help from (they answer in a few minutes). 
---
Best of luck to you! I am playing on Zandalar Tribe EU btw.
---
Well that cocky /wave was provocation enough! :D
---
I trade food for healthstones on my Warlock.
---
Already discussed the aggro in the main post. 
---
Weaker heals for a lower level sure, but more mana, more regeneration = more sustainability, more uptime and a smoother run than a dps specced character with some healing gear. 
---
Sure, I absolutely agree, take the 52 healer with gear and talents in holy/resto over the 48, but if the level 52 is just a dps with a bit of healing gear slapped on then the lvl 48 will outperform the 52.
---
I was always pvp realm back in the day, but I played by myself mostly. Some friends wanted me to come play with them. They were on a pve server. I gave it a shot. And when you finally see people from the opposing faction, you just feel like you've been completely neutered. It's like, "THERE THEY ARE! ...ohh. I. ...ohh. ...*waves." üòê üòë üòê
---
 May I ask what build and talents are you using at 25-30 level for good PvP?
---
Because that's where this weapon drops and what he's hoping for?
---
Just like the 100k gold worth of Arcane Crystals? Get real
---
How do I deal with getting endlessly ganked on Kromcrush? Like seriously, I quested for one level total in hilsbrad/1k needles yesterday and died 27 times to horde just waiting for a mob to take me down below half HP and jumping me. I‚Äôm a 32 ret pally, is it worth respecing to prot and using a shield to not get blown up? Very frustrating sometimes.
---
Is screen burn still a thing?
---
I'll try it out when I'm in the Badlands. Thanks for letting me know.
---
If you see mages using aoe on few mobs its probably clearcasting proc which gives us free spell, and blizzard on 2 targets will still do more damage then single frostbolt spamming.
---
the difference is, things like epic mounts wont increase in price, so 400g are worth more than 200g
---
What, like a screensaver?
---
I don't think they need another one
---
Don't do it!
---
What‚Äôs not allowed is being up there to avoid guards. Otherwise, do you not think Blizz would just put a collision box on top of every building to prevent that instead of using soft rules and case by case GM solutions?
---
I don't see the issue. It's an MMO that allows for PVP and these guys are cleverly cornering one market. What we get is a form of trade guild which is actually kind of cool.  Nothing is stopping other players to either challenge guild doing this with means of PVP or similar matters.
---
Nobody needs devilsaur, nobody needs the prepaid BiS in this game, second best is good enough and you get better gear in raids. If the prices are to high get something else...
---
Big issue is everyone using the few guides out there, if you go questing somewhere that the guides call bad you are gonna have a better time. If you are going to farm herbs, go where the 1-300 guide guide does not mention..
---
That sounds like a good idea. More efficient than my skinning I think. Thank you for the suggestion.
---
#1 VS 2 OUTPLAY!
---
Clicks video:
---
First guy is a Warrior... at 40% health, not aware of your presence. And you got a full opener on him.
---
Second guy is 1% Mana, 30% Health, with a mob attacking him.
---
What's the next video about ? *World Pvping* gray level people ?
---
Oh wait, you already uploaded that 2 mins ago.
---
My shitty guild back in vanilla could clear 3 wings of naxx. Same guild, but instead taking 25 of the best raiders to raid in BC, couldn't finish SSC or TK (2nd raid tier) before disbanding.
---
Even the excellent guilds that knew how to dps, who were the ones getting the first kills, who people looked to for strats, still were nowhere near as good as today. Just look at how fast they were killing bosses like Vael or Patchwerk, and compare those kills to how fast private server guilds can kill them. There is a huge difference.
---
I miss pure pwnage.
---
You were there for that too?
---
I've had a few locks do that without asking, feelsgoodman
---
im amazed that so many people will bend over backwards to justify classic's shit design instead of just admitting that it's a fun game badly in need of a balance pass. #nochangetards
---
Also wouldn't be surprised if the vast majority if not all the highest healing parses for priest are dwarfs.
---
Any idea about weight of stats in classic? I know 29 agility= 29 ap, 1 crit 2 dodge. What about hit rate? Where can I find about numbers.
---
I get that you feel personally targeted here,  but the point of the comment was in the other direction, I think. We're currently looking at people clearing stuff who're very committed in terms of time, to clear it. Not all the currently low level players are bad, but nearly all the bad players will currently be low level.
---
I dont get it when people get mad over people using general to try and find a group? Like lookingforgroup gets super spammed and has all different types of groups in it. If you want to do blackfathom deeps, then why can't you look for people in the same zone, that are likely level appropriate to run it, ie  use ashenvale general chat
---
Unless you have a pretty old monitor this shouldn't be an issue
---
I don‚Äôt think newer monitors can screen burn.
---
On some monitors and phones it is.
---
Of course I do, like all the hunters complaining about FD being bugged :/ It doesn't work either way. And it's been a subject of frustration on Classic's forum since a week after launch :  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feign-death-trap-bug/278131/2](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feign-death-trap-bug/278131/2)

However Blizzard seems to be working on it, as they said 3 days ago :  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295205/wow-classic-feign-death-bug-report-investigation](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295205/wow-classic-feign-death-bug-report-investigation)

you will struggle beginning at angerforge in BRD if youre lvl 50 and youre trying to heal tanks using 2h weapons....Trust me...
---
Didn‚Äôt someone post a pic of a ban?
---
Screen burn on a modern LED monitor? Not very likely

The recent surge in alliance to this server has caused the imbalance to tilt incredibly over to the alliance side at almost 65/35 at peak hours. Dominated at max levels reaching 200‚Äì300+ lvl 60s on Alliance vs About 90+ horde during high volume. While more horde will help, dont expect anything to drastically change unless a mass surge 4-5 big horde guilds move over. If horde people are worried, they might have to consider Earthfury as theyre  Horde favored at the moment. 
---
Heartseeker is growing at an amazing pace.... only if youre alliance.
---
Depends on how in tune you are.. if you‚Äôre constantly watching your damage data you will notice little things. Most days I play for about 8 hours though so that might make a difference in subtle changes..
---
They cheap
---
The point of this post has never been to force people to pick underleveled healers. But to make more people aware that healer CAN heal a dungeon just fine even if they are 1-2 levels below the requirements ....(if) they are geared and specced for it. 
---
So if you're making a group and can't find a healer, it makes no sense to turn away a healer a bit lower leveled if they are geared / talented for it. 
---
I do also believe that a healer level 48 with full talents and gear will outperform the lvl 52 dps with some healing gear equipped in sutainability and uptime.
---
(horde here) bought a vicios hammer for 3g at 30 .. a polearm with 35dps at 35 for 6g .. and now bought another polearm (bonechewer) at lvl 43 for 7g .. never bothered doing any quest - for me it was easier to farm a few gold while grinding - but I like grinding so I might not be the best example
---
I did. and it did feel good. Thanks for the input.
---
Questing sucks but you are guaranteed any dungeon run you want. Enjoy!
---
Geez I normally just give them 1-3s just cause in my dungeon groups.  You‚Äôre stopping someone for your own needs, they should get something.
---
Maybe the early generosity has developed poor expectations.
---
I absolutely agree. 
---
This post takes into consideration that the tank is an actual tank and not a dps just like the healer in this case is an actual healer with healing gear :)
---
A warlock asked.me for water, said yes, opened trade, 15s wtf, I took it ,but followed to craft him a bunch more water. I think I gave him like another 60 or 80 bottles. He then hit me with a soulstone after. It was a nice encounter.

TIL draining the life/soul of people via dark magic beams somehow physically messes up their skulls.

I know it is on phones like the iPhone and Androids, not sure if it will become a problem on desktop.
---
I found that even with 2 deaths walking from WPL, it‚Äôs a lot quick. Like 10-15 minutes quicker. If you can get through with only one death it‚Äôs a huge time saver.
---
Turn the co trash and brightness down
---
You'll probably have better odds as ret. Prot can't really fight back.
---
Best advice is to just not get low. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take the while longer to FoL during kills to keep up, if you suspect the horde is lying in wait.
---
Try to save your cooldowns for fighting back.
---
While not necessary by any means, it's very convenient. In dungeons with fleeing mobs in packs that's very close to another it makes life easier. A few silver is a very cheap price to pay to contribute to your dungeon group.
---
I would take this with a grain of salt. The highest ret dps comes from being a spelladin, which most people arent, and requires a lot of consumables. Feral druids requires a specific playstyle that most people dont do, as well as a steady supply of MCPs.
---
Are feral tanks and deepz grouped together?
---
The staff is better for AoE grinding, due to higher int, stam, and spirit (if you use mage armor).
---
For single target dmg the dagger/OH combo is better, because it adds a lot of damage.
---
Fucking yetis. Every zone they‚Äôre in they don‚Äôt have hides. Fuck em.
---
Mage of Classic is now the hunter of vanilla.
---
The problem isnt unique to FD, combat over all is a bit sluggish and unresponsive, same thing with dropping out of combat can at times take 2 seconds after the mob is dead.
---
Its possible to adapt to it but I for one would expect a smoother experience of a game in 2019.
---
videogame Subreddits always have a scapegoat to shit on and generalize and circlejerk about. In this episode its rogues and hunter loot.
---
Then its healable. Im not resto spec but I have healing gear on my dudu, and I can keep up ACTUAL tanks quite easily.
---
add 'we already have a rogue' 
---
since that seems to be a problem ... 
---
why shouldn't there be more than one top dps  in a dungeon? :(
---
Great post and allot to think about! thanks!
---
\*Saurfang voice\* There is no honor in this !
---
Maybe for some, but that was never what i expected or was looking for, since ive played vanilla for \~10 years on and off on multiple private servers. 
---
I'll always prefer a smooth run with dedicated people over constant wipes or players leaving and needing to be replaced all the time, completely irrelevant of clear speed. And I'd prefer to have some complete noobs in my groups that are atleast willing to listen and learn, instead of twitch-self-educated sPeLlClEaVe "pros" causing chaos, wipes and the need to drink after every pack without actually speeding up the run at all.
---
You're one tough badass
---
Honestly, should‚Äôve just drank that rage potion
---
Nobody has 12.5k at the moment. Some Scrooge McDuck might have 200g he could spend on it
---
Can you use potions in PvP?
---
Oh thanks! üôÇ Then I stick with the staff a bit longer.
---
There is no central place that lists all changes in a clear fashion, only patch notes of the individual patches which you have to trawl through. 
---
Not sure about the BC part myself.
---
You didn't say what server you're on.
---
Uhm.
---
use LookingForGroup channel?
---
On our realm world is mostly for random chat, or global trading. LFG mostly happens in LFG. Thats what the channel is for after all. And its global too.
---
Just minor corrections, the wood is 38c, so any Greater Magic Essence under 14s97c is a free enchanting level. I took my enchanting from 70-150 with purely Greater Magic Wands, I threw a few on the AH at a time for 16s50c and vendored the rest to keep a bit of cashflow going to buy the materials.
---
If these are the prices on your realm it's so easy and free/cheap to level your enchanting to 150.
---
Yeah I'm not sure which patch but it definitely got nerfed sometime before the TBC prepatch.
---
Well I would recommend if you‚Äôre about 50 now, do some Princess runs for a few easy pieces of gear, do a few ST runs for more good gear, and beginning of BRD you can do at like 52 (maybe lower, I was healing it at 50) for some really nice gear. That will help your leveling tremendously if you‚Äôre all greens right now. I‚Äôm not saying grind the dungeons but I‚Äôll tell you what - I get about half a level per BRD run at 52.
---
There are tons of nice drops for you in ST and BRD.
---
okay then I'm confused why you're telling me irrelevant things lol
---
Priest feels really good in Classic, haven‚Äôt lost a single 1v1 yet unless the enemy is 5+ levels higher, even then they have a really hard time despite being a clothie.
---
is your internal screaming because a hunter has this weapon
---
Did anyone ever leave and come back in disguise to get more than 1 bag?
---
Roll a priest
---
Do dungeons
---
Yep pretty sure its 4s
---
You don‚Äôt happen to be playing on Westfall are you? I‚Äôm also in A guild named Mutiny on Westfall
---
Tfw you see a mage frost nova and continue to take melee hits and blames tank for not holding Aggro. While tank is waiting for healer to drink.
---
If you don't ask for anything then usually people won't give anything. Most are prepared to pay some amount though.
---
Between zoning in and the first pull: "Oh by the way, [item you need] is on res"
---
or
---
Druid: "Shit, I'm out of seeds."
---
Unless you want to buy BoEs, you won't find better than Smite's Mighty Hammer before Manual Crowd Pummeler in Gnomeregan.
---
I've leveled multiple 4 times in total and my goto grinding spot for 40 mount is either the apes in northern STV or the Burning Exiles in arathi highlands. Dont bother with anything else. 
---
My advice to you is to start grinding Burning Exiles at lvl 38 and sell the Elemental Fire at the action house. Should go for about 2-3 g each but can go even higher at wednesdays and sundays after the raid resets.
---
Water costs a lot from vendors. 40s per 5.
---
Yeah that is a basic syst weight for rogues but when we compare raw stats for two rogues and ap difference is 100 than that will translate to 7 damage more per hit. But if one rogue has better gear and, lets say, 4 more crit, then that is gonna make a lot of more difference on the damage meter. Assuming both rogues are hit capped
---
Pet micro is the absolute basics for a hunter.
---
more like live to fight another day...
---
You say "Forced into dualwielding" I say "actually made a viable melee dps class"
---
You're never going to run out of quests unless you 5-man every single one you find. There are always at least two regions (if not more) for each level range, which will guarantee enough xp to you to the next area. 
---
Plus dungeons can always be done if all your quests are done.
---
Well done,  boys
---
I don't exactly remember. But the engineering gadget are always superior in PvP situations.
---
... wat. 
---
How did you get ‚Äúbanned‚Äù from world chat by a player. You mean blacklisted? 
---
Just screenshot the convo and submit it to blizzard or post it on the server‚Äôs subreddit
---
The problem is that every time im fishing a firefin to respawn other pools, another asshole near me is fishing all the other stuff.
---
Similarly every time i start killing hyenas, for example, to respawn some birds or whatever, there's always someone nearby ignoring hyenas and killing the birds that im trying to respawn.
---
So eventually i just say fuck it, and start only killing stuff i need. Because that way i at least get some stuff that i need, as opposed to none of it.
---
Hahahaha. Yeah wasn't her then. Shame :p
---
Thats a twink weapon, hell nah
---
At first I thought, "maybe he actually has STR on his gear and he's just being quirky", then I recognized his [bow's icon](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2825/bow-of-searing-arrows)...
---
No, in 1.1 there was conflagrate on the fireballs and some other changes.  Also talent rework is HUGE - warriors actually doing decent threat with 1.12 talents vs the best threat u could do in 1.1 was spam sunder armour.
---
And this is my point exactly. I'm a resto druid, with all my gear focused on healing. I'm currently lvl 50, but i healed ST and BRD when I was 48.
---
If the tank is a proper tank, just like I'm a proper healer, then it's easily doable. 
---
If the tank is a dps with a shield or in worst case a 2hand, then it's going to be hard.   
---
if the tank is underperforming then the healer needs to carry, if the tank is a normal tank performing averagely, then an actual healer 'can' be a lower level without having any trouble. (except for bodypulling, but that's already discussed in the main post).
---
So you actually earned gold by using a portal, nice!
---
Macros are a way of adding multiple commands to one button. For example, I have a macro on my Shaman which will cancel my ghost wolf form, cast flame shock and then start an auto attack. They can get more complex than that, but this is an idea of how they can be used.
---
Priests are also largely unchanged from classic to bc.
---
Aha nah mate im in arugal oceanic
---
"Can you res me pls?"
---
Yeah about that, corporate just had some budget cuts and we had to cut the res spells sorry, I could for 1g, but that is as cheap as I can go.
---
It‚Äôs not a jpg though.
---
As a hunter you want agility on most of your gear, stamina if you think you need more hp or are getting ganked a lot.
---
Once you get to around 53 you can start looking for gear with +%to hit. This is going to be the biggest thing when you hit 60, you need a total of +9% to hit.
---
The only weapon you should think about buying are new ranged weapons every 10-20 levels, but unless you are planning to twink, it‚Äôs not worth buying anything more than 3/5g after lvl 45/50ish
---
I feel like letting others do the killing kind of defeats the purpose of the challenge. But yeah I guess you could do this
---
Proper jealous, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.
---
Well, who'd get an item like that and not use it?
---
Trinkets also. Pop ZHC and your crits do 400 damage more.
---
You already said it
---
&gt; this is a custom channel, go make your own world chat
---
Nothing to add here. If you make yourself dependent of one private channel for finding groups, it's pretty much your own fault (since there also is the official Blizz-moderated LookingForGroup)
---
I'm pretty sure, we were some ppl who talked about it and beeing suprised it was instant. Havent tried anything but NIghtfin soup tho.
---
Some times their body will disappear immediately. Normally this would mean they took rez sickness but that leaves a skeleton behind. what I'm talking about it their body just fades out and there's no skeleton.
---
So far my dungeons experiences have been great. But i see this all the time...
---

---
Video of a patchwerk kill on a private server. You can see that patchwerk has 6.8M HP, which is double that of the 3.9M he had back in vanilla. You don't get the numbers wrong and double it by accident...
---
Being a level or two before picking up your new rank greater heal or whatever and then going into a dungeon that's 4 levels above you is really rough.
---
Mog?
---
Damn. I must be on lower pop server I guess. Gotta make conscious decision between Warden staff and fast cat now.
---
&gt; But you will always find people being able to lie in every scenario to further their own gain, so it doesn't make any sense taking that into account here.
---
Except that it does. You might have someone who lies while being level 49 and you might have someone say outright "i'm dps specced but I can offheal it" while being level 53. Who would you pick?
---
And it also heavily depends on the class and the level range we are talking here. A feral druid with heart of the wild will also do the healing job just fine.
---
&gt;This post isn't made to force people to pick low leveled healers, but to make more people aware that it is more than possible for lower leveled, geared/talented healers to do the job
---
And it is possible for lower leveled dps to do the job. It just takes a bit longer. It's also possible for a lower level tank to do the job. He'll just have to pull way less, you have to CC more and he'll keep taunt on cooldown. But it's doable. It's no difference to a low level healer. Lower level = it's slower. It doesn't matter who is lower level. Those dungeons are doable with EVERYONE being lower level.
---
This so true. Only need one hand to play priest with healbot.
---
The other you can masturbate with or something.
---
&gt; Plus dungeons can always be done if all your quests are done.
---
So basically when you run out of quests? Hence my entire point?
---
Calm down Ser Gregor.
---
RIP in peace
---
Reddit cannot help you nor Blizzard will, that's indeed a player controlled channel and they do have the right to do what they want in there.
---
Start using LookingForGroup, it's visible worldwide like World but it's an official channel.
---
If everyone complaining right now about World would move to LFG instead of complaining, the problem would solve itself in a heartbeat.
---
Spreadsheet &amp; a calculator
---
I didn't realize this. I'm a mage and mostly always have been. That's fine though. I always give min stacks of 20 so hopefully people appreciate it and save some gold along the way. Need that mount !
---
Oh I'm on this list!
---
Even so, a large chunk of their damage is from their Pet. Still if auto attack is the Main source he does not need a meleeweapon
---
Welcome! :)
---
So I was in this cz/sk guild, Slovak here. I wish I could blacklist everyone from there. Everyone sane left after the first week.
---
My friend was still in. He was levelling his 3rd character (long story short, good choice) and asks me to help RFK. I'm over levelled but I swear nobody knew how threat works so the bats were super dangerous cuz they would silence the healer. 
---
Not sure how it exactly came to this but I'm tanking 2 of them. They are on me we are doing well. Suddenly, one fag runs thru the whole room and pulls 5 more bats. Not believing what I'm seeing I am sure he has a divine plan cuz devil save him if he doesn't. Ofc he does not have. So I'm there, our underleved party struggling with 2 bats and he pulls 5 more. My head starts to hurt. Do everything I can but we get wiped harder than the idk fkin what. My head hurts even more now. Looking for bleach for my eyes. Ask my friend to give me leader. Kick the mofo. Friend tells me he is from that braindead guild. WHY TF DID U EVEN INVITE HIM?!?! The guy apologizes in whispers and I invite him back. Then he thanks me and says I could accept my mistake tho. WHAT?! It was my mistake I did make enough threat and could not aggro the 5 other bats he pulled? Remember how the bats have silence? Some people are apes I swear. I think he pulled them cuz the other time we pulled 2 camps and somehow survived. Those mobs were good 3 levels under the bats.
---
As a fury warrior do try to get an xbow with plus hit if you can, but it's not top priority. Blackcrow is good.
---
Hi Karen
---
IIRC anyone caught assisting you will reset the fight you have with said demon for a hunter.
---
Cat Form is generally terrible for prolonged fights. Like a rogue without cooldowns or the high on-demand damage that rogues can produce.
---
Dire Bear is absolutely ridiculous against melees. With the 2,5 sec attack speed, you're basically swinging a very fast two-hander at them. My Maul does upwards of 7-800 damage on a crit with my cat form gear on.
---
I meant doing leveling
---
Those smileys in the title, are they supposed to be "orgasm"? LUL
---
Get prat. Think it's able to do this.
---
Ahhh.. the mushrooms, questie sends them all to the lake in the northeast while I got em every time all in one go at the lake southeast of the crossroads. The rest is a nice grind/farm spot for line cloth and light/medium leather, I came out of the Barrens a wealthy manthanks to the hooveless zhevras etc.
---
Just a heads up, GMs go through little to none customer service training. It's literally just people who play WoW that put in a resume to play it for free and moderate it.
---
Source: Step Brother works at Blizz IT.
---
Then when you realise the tank doesn't know the dungeon and you try and set the pace or tell the group strats or where to go, tank gets salty
---
careful though because it does add a gcd
---

---
4 times, wow. Thank you for the advice
---
Remind me! 30 hours
---
I'm not sure but do battlegrounds reward experience when winning? If so, you could join a battleground and do nothing all day.
---
My question is, why would you want to level that way?
---
If you don't want to kill anything or anyone, why bother getting to 60?
---
Most travelquests are probably gated behind prequests where killing is necessary. I think you won't even reach level 10.
---
Is it allowed to receive help? That way someone could kill mobs for you, while you only loot...
---
Not sure about the drop rate in Wetlands but welps in Badlands, Searing Gorge, and Burning Steppes have better drop rates from my personal experience.  I don't think I got a single flame sac off the Wetlands mobs tbh.
---
in real vanilla this was a thing early on, however it was fixed long before 1.12 where they made weapon swapping in combat cause a gcd.
---
All the bitching about cheap PvP tactics is just coming from warriors who didn't get any.
---

Well yes but I thaugth we were talking about actually playing oomkin as dps

Your entire response was a random aside bro

You have a lower chance to catch the squid between 00:00 - 06:00
---
I spent around 2 hours there and I can confirm that Shaman spawn points don't in fact spawn other shamans 100% of the time. For example the 2 shaman spawn points in the cave, where I ended up finishing the quests, initially hard a mage lord and a battlemaster on them, and the shamans spawned there next. Also the point in front of the cave is shared between shamans and warlocks. So I assume this is true for all other possible shaman points as well.
---
Yetis without Helcular's Rod
---
Yea wow's Ms I bet is checked like once every 30s? Or maybe even minute cus it changes so rarely.
---
How a weak sword with will help me when a warrior charges on me?  A 40dps sword will help way more
---
It's not rude in the slightest :) 
---
It's up to the individual group who they want to invite, and I'm not trying to force anyone to pick lower leveled healers, I'm just trying to make more people aware that if they are geared / talented, they'd be able to do the job just as well as a non specced nongeared healer at few levels above. 
---
I totally get the part about wanting a smoother run, and if you pm me saying that's why you won't be taking me that's just a-okay, but if you just state the level requirement and follow that like it's the law, then I'll be a tat annoyed but accept it nontheless. 
---
And it's not a question about whether questing / grinding is more difficult or a bigger hassle, the post was only meant to let people know lower leveled healers can do fine by a level or two if they're geared / talented for it.
---
Well it does right now - and he should have know it. Here‚Äôs an example: I get some loot, I loot it before joining a party. I do this because I don‚Äôt want to lose my loot. Crazy stuff, huh?
---
But nooo the game stole my loot! Hah!
---
The damage threshold to break fear was quite high in vanilla, it‚Äôs why they nerfed the maximum durations. Patch 1.3 made it so that it *should* break at 15 seconds on players. Again, it‚Äôs still a very powerful CC. Always was.
---
When should I transition to Restro as druid? Currently (about 30) im playing feral for better solo questing and movement. Will I be able to heal/tank dungeons about my level with couple of gear switcher or without talents I should not even try?
---
You're gona regret it in the endgame if thats the only reason
---
Level 56 with 8 days /played as a warrior. It all depends on your class, but if you're focused on levelling, 6-10 days /played will catch most players.
---
These levels in the 50s are taking around 3 hours each.
---
Yes, I am Horde. But factions seem to be pretty equal. I‚Äôve seen a lot of alliance while out questing. It‚Äôs not the biggest server, so you won‚Äôt see a lot of people on during weekdays at 2:30. I was at work then as I‚Äôm sure most people were... Online population is good though after 5 on weekdays and over the weekend. It makes it easier if you find a large and active guild as well.
---
&gt;1.12 is the last patch before BC and featured substantial buffs for players.
---
nope. People were far worse.
---
you can sell thorium grenades for good money, but they are expensive to produce as well....and not everybody uses them. Potions are used by everybody raiding and many in pvp so it has a broader market.
---
People are such little bitches man. Can‚Äôt take responsibility for anything.
---
&gt; Warriors say druids are bad, because they can't tank like a warrior.
---
&gt; Priests say druids are bad, because they can't heal like a priest.
---
I play both classes extensively, and I've never heard someone in my class say these things.
---
About 8 days, lvl 56. First time playing so its abit slow
---
For weeks before classic launched I kept telling myself i wouldn't worry about 'meta' specs or the 'correct' build... But here I am, googling which is the best build for each class... looking into BiS gear and which talents are more efficient. 
---
I hate it. I just want to blindly enjoy the game the way I did back in vanilla :( I leveled as a holy paladin with a polearm back then and loved every second of it.
---
Seems like bis for druid tanks if I remember correctly, or pretty close, so gz.
---
At least you don't have to farm gnomer everytime for that crowd pummeler mace if you go cat dps. This and managing the items and charges would turn me off playing as cat.
---
&gt; can you bind bow auto shot to right click instead of regular auto atk?
---
At the moment RMB is used for targeting the monster you're looking at (similarly to how it works in GW2 action camera). You can bind whatever you want to LMB, Shift+LMB, Ctrl+LMB, Shift+RMB, Ctrl+RMB (and of course you can bind stuff to Mouse3, Mouse4, etc using the regular game interface)
---
If there's a demand for it I could implement binding stuff to RMB as well, but since targeting is such an important part of the game, I felt it was better to not let users unbind it.
---
r/woosh
---
Hey, 10s to save 40s and finding a vendor, as well as the cost of the Mage‚Äôs time and the money _they_ would‚Äôve had to have spent learning the skill is more than worth it.
---
21/0/30. You‚Äôll only be missing 5% spell crit from holy for healing and repentance for pvp. Hit doesn‚Äôt matter much in pvp so don‚Äôt worry about the prot tree too much.
---
It happens the same in Firemaw-EU between Progress (Aliance) and New gen (Horde).
---
We've been fighting against progress for some devilsaurs and New Gen stays there looking, they have been seen doing the same in 2 groups not atacking eachother.
---
You can tank and heal everything pre-raid regardless of spec, as long as you have the appropriate gear.
---
He is right though. It is Rank 1 you want.
---
Any rank after that is useless. I play Druid and I know that even
---
You'd have to ask the devs. I leveled normally to 60 and didn't hear about this at all, so if it did exist it wasn't flaunted over all forums, streams, FB and it's mother - might be all the publicity that causes it to get nerfed because so many more people (I'm just assuming here!) do it now than back then? But yea, ask the devs. As far as #nochanges go that's already gone with 1.12. Throwing such a silly hashtag term out there is just stupid IMO, regardless of who uses it and what context.
---
10/10 would read again

If only players would use their CC, everyone would benefit...

that is all great information, thanks :D

I  just love the cats from cat carriers.
---
Bought 4 of them so far, 1 for each character.
---
Cost me almost 20g so far but it's worth it.
---
Daaamn. I'm not even hitting 3 hours per level at 27 lol. U hitting grind/quests or more dungeons?
---
It's not worthwhile on anyone in PVE from a pure min-max perspective anyway. There isn't a vanilla 2h melee class that is actually any good - 2H warriors, enhancement shamans and retribution paladins are all shit-tier when it comes to PVE DPS.
---
It's a PVP weapon, so I see no issue with it going to whoever's going to A) put the work in to get it and B) is most likely to take it into PVP. It shouldn't be decided on class so much as who deserves the badge of honour and who is going to get the most use out of it. Both arms warriors and enhancement shamans are absolutely terrifying with two handed weapons, so I wouldn't put one over the other by class alone.
---
Most Mages in classic are ignorant and not team players
---
Yes he has .. he just hasn‚Äôt streamed
---
Are you Horde? I try to help the opposite faction sometimes, probably won't be as nice in phase 2 though.
---
If you pick a tank lvl 48 for Sunken Temple, then he is no matter what going to have problems keeping aggro on bosses or other mobs at higher levels because he simply cannot hit the mobs with either attacks or spells.   
---
If a healer lvl 48 is picked for SUnken Temple then assuming he is geared and talented for it  will be able to heal it without too much trouble.  
---
There is a world to difference between how these two scenarios would play out, and that's my point. That there IS a difference, and that healers is the exception to the rule of the requirements. (IF) they are geared and talented.
---
Fantastic work - If you could ever release a version of your Mod that is fully customizable I think people would download this left and right. Just an idea. Seriously great work!
---
Honestly, I'm happy to provide for people I'm playing with.
---
But other than that I have limited time, and when I just learn a new rank and people open trade first then ask, and proceed to ask for 2 stacks. Thst takes my entries mana pool twice to conjure.
---
I'm sick an tired of being a water dispenser for 15 years.
---
I got the "I am a merchant" addon, and added water there for like 1s per drink (20s/stack) for current level and 1c for previous (as I make 1 stack per cast)
---
Slightly miffed mage
---
Yea I honestly may just end up leveling a hunter for potions I really don‚Äôt want to but eh. 
---
I may even just make my paladin an alchemist/engineer while the hunter just takes herbalism and mining
---
Which addon is used to change the font of the combat text?
---
&gt;"pay them better"
---
it kindof is. the problem is society does not value such work and we accept shit-tier jobs to be done at shit-tier quality.
---
&gt;explaining to sysadmins and network engineers
---
firstly, their job is not mind-numblingly boring, and emotionally taxing (dealing with angry/frustrated customers all day and it not rubbing off on you is not easy)
---
secondly, if a bump to the GMs pay puts them over qualified technicians, then the technicians are also probably underpaid.
---
the only reason anyone gets away paying toilet cleaners minimum wage is because there are poor saps who are *desperate* enough to do it.
---
&gt;still want to move on
---
move on to what? if they are qualified for more serious work why were they ever put on the helpdesk in the first place.
---
The no CC meta is infuriating to me. People complain about mana breaks but I would still have mana if you sap or sheep or banish a target... It's not hard :/
---
I did.
---
Warrior can break fear in zerker stance. 
---
Warrior wont get rage when he hits your shield. 
---
Top key stuff for you.
---
I played Horde because that's what my IRL friends were playing.
---
Until you get to raids.
---
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be. Back at original vanilla launch, we didn‚Äôt know deep breath doesn‚Äôt hit the entire room. So for a long time, Onyxia theorycrafting was about figuring out how to keep her from deep breathing, since that was an almost guaranteed wipe. That‚Äôs where the ‚Äúmore dots‚Äù meme comes from - a popular theory was that you needed to keep dots up to keep her from breathing. 
---
Turns out it was just random, but for a while there, most guilds were only able to kill her on those pulls where deep breath didn‚Äôt happen.
---
You arent a melee character
---
Hunter melee is useless
---
Melee is there to get you OUT of melee
---
A non statted weapon is utterly useless for you in every situation
---
Also, buying epics at level 40 is not clever as you will find a green thats better at your level and replace it within 5 
---
There are plenty of better options
---
TLDR: Dont do it
---
"They hated Jesus because he told them the truth"
---
In this instance, I am like Jesus.
---
Yeah I understand where you are coming from. I think it very much depends on the dungeon though. Some are just so intense like Gnomer where a lower level player can accidentally pull a lot of trash.
---
But in general I agree that healers can be a bit lower for the most part. Just hope you see where the people that say you are too low are coming from. :D
---
Start doing zf melee cleaves at 44 and then do torch farms at 52
---
Mages... i grouped with one for a killquest, he then said "nice a healer" and pulled 6+ moba and tried facetanking them while spamming arcane explosion. He instantly died an his last wordsbefore leaving was "BAD PALLA"
---
nicedamage
---
always thought multiboxing was against the spirit of the game and if it was up to me i would ban it but blizz thought otherwise so i dont even know why you are bringing it up.  This was settled over a decade ago.
---
But a 40dps sword would help me kill warriors that charge on me while I level really easy, how 1-2 agi points in a weak sword will help?
---
To be fair you probably just got reported for the wall jumping and trying to fight back. Shitty, but he‚Äôs just doing his job.  The guy doesn‚Äôt have time to sit around and have a conversation with you about whether or not you did anything, I‚Äôm sure he just said the same line to everyone who got reported in the area.
---
He probably took the boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet and then swam around Durotar. Not that it wouldn't rack up the deaths, but that's fairly safe.
---
You won't outperform other classes in their role unless you go really try-hard but you'll do well enough. With HotW/NS, you're set to tank or heal pretty much anything or you can do a tank/dps hybrid spec.
---
There is a small price to pay for the flexibility but it's worth it imho.
---
NEED PRIEST TO SHIELD KILROGG.
---
Just miss me with that.
---
Also take variables like if the healer is lower level/not good you should be using demo shout more/shield block, if the group is lower level then use CC (sheep/freeze trap/banish on elementals), if you have an aoe frenzy group then be ready to use taunt more and sunder. Another tip for tanking against aoe dps is that if the pack is frost nova you can taunt and back away to take less damage.
---
You also have to think about we are having 1.12 talents here. Back in the days when MC and Ony was current content, the talents were different.
---
Nah that server blackshit shit is a meme unless you ninja barons mount or eye of sufuras
---
over 30% of the damage comes from a pet whilst levelling
---
Because surely he would be levelling BM ... right? :O
---
He did charge them. He asked them to perform tasks for the bags. They spent time doing this because it was fun for them too and they got a bag out of it. Shut up.
---
It‚Äôs why the pvp trinkets are so worthwhile (for those whose trinkets break fear) and why racial abilities liken Fear Ward and WoTF are so desired.
---
Yup, it is still broken.  It seems to be the worst, or only, for mages.  I played nothing but casters from release to cata and getting aggro while you're afk was never a thing.  There's got to be at least one video from back then of a caster running by a mob and not pulling aggro.  No buffs, no eating, no drinking.  What exactly is placing people on the aggro table then?
---
Ok, what I find a speedsteel?
---
Just play the game and don't worry about what other people are doing, even without clever use of game mechanics the "hardcore" players will get to level 60 long before the "casual" players alone by the sheer amount of time they use on the game.
---
since when is multiboxing in pvp bannable?
---
Bit of an exaggeration but yeah, you may need to pull a few extra packs. No biggie.
---
&gt; the rest of us Adult players will be even further behind.
---
Behind what ?
---
Who's whipping you on the back and force you to level at a certain rate ?
---
Why do you care if "Xsaltymagex" is level 30 or 60 ?
---
Alliance seemed boring for a high fantasy game. Races were so humanoid, so I went Horde.
---
You're completely right, the aggro can be a hassle, which is why I also mentioned it in the main post as one of the biggest problems.   
---
And I completely understand where it comes from, but with your example then there has been put more thought into it than just "he isn't X level" which is completely fine in my book.
---
Lok'tar Ogar !   
---
Death to all Alliance scum !  
---
^(why should i play a human, if im already human irl, that why i chose horde. also lorewise i find them far more superior.  still from my pov horde are good guys and alliance are just the scum of the earth !)
---
i don't know a macro but you can use weakauras to display something if the target has the debuff or is missing the debuff (depending what you think is more useful)
---
Yeah we have way too many Warriors anyway.
---
We Need more mages. Otherwise how would I AOE all those bosses in MC, BWL and ZG?
---
noo srsly - I get you. Mage is way more fun to Level. There is a lot of them though. AOE Farming didn't help that :D
---
Not sure how much it will be worth but it‚Äôs pretty much the rarest pet
---
I go out of my way to break that stereotype and be a friendly undead rogue, sometimes it works I made friends with a human rogue in booty bay last night. I could tell he was looking for the poison vendor but couldn't find him. He shrugged at me and I knew what to do, led him to the spot and we spent a few mins brewing poisons together before venturing off, later I saw him killing pirates and It looked like he was going down, 3 was too many. So I stepped in and helped, we ate a meal together after a close call and went on our way again. Maybe I'll see him in Tanaris..
---
&gt; Am I being overly critical of the classes? 
---
Yes. And by the looks of it you also swallowed every meme about each class while at it. For example druid tier set being healing oriented doesn't mean that there aren't alternative gear available to make feral viable. But if you just need to play to maximum potential, then your choices are warrior for tanking, priest for healer, mage/warrior for dps. Any other class is less efficient at those task.
---
Overall there is no class without downsides. You have to choose and with that choice some downsides occur. Warrior will get kited by a mage, a mage will get shafted by a rogue/hunter (this ones kinda even though), a rogue can't do much about a paladin etc. Hybrids are always overshadowed by their pure counterparts in specific roles.
---
With all these points in mind, mage has the least of problems, it has a high skillcap and can go toe to toe with every class, it's always welcome as a dps and it's good in soloplay.
---
Agreed!
---
I've used them all, semi extensively
---
Bagnon
---
Onebag
---
Ark inventory
---
Bagbrother
---
Inventorian
---
And some lesser known thst I can't remember the name of
---
But adibags blows them all away, effective easy filtering, ability to set up more filters with ease, nice and slick design (up yours arkinventory)
---
So... much...pain
---
Horde because the first artwork I saw was a badass looking troll. Something about the tribal aesthetic and the jungle made me want to roll a troll hunter. Since I didn‚Äôt have any friends at the time who were playing the whole ‚Äúlone adventurer + faithful companion‚Äù theme was a perfect fit.
---
Is this a bot? It sounds more like a machine than a human being
---
CC? what's that? as a rogue I only pick spells with big numbers.
---
your hunter will be rich
---
It's always the gnomes.
---
/gquit
---
/uninstall
---
That doesn't say that this particular issue is intended. The issue here isn't that you can end up with 38 energy and have to wait 2 seconds for your next tick. That can happen because you get partial energy refunds when your abilities get parried/dodged/miss. Obviously that is intended.
---
The problem is that that each tick is supposed to be 20 energy gained, but sometimes it is 19 or 21 instead. I didn't see anything in the video saying that this is intended, unless it is way after the part you linked.
---
When I rank, I start with demo roar, swipe spam for groups, and save my taunt for anything that gets pulled off me. For single target, I use Maul.
---
Druids are exceptional at AOE threat, so you really shouldn‚Äôt have any issues.
---
i met a poor guy solo farming tyrs hand as holy. mindcontrol mobs and attack other mob then nuke low mobs dead. not that fun to watch
---
Reading these posts make me feel ashamed when playing my mage, I don't want to become part of this new stereotype.
---
You can report GMs, just so you know. I've done it before. One time I caught one in a bad mood as well.
---
Yeah, that was my plan before launch. My friend that I play with is the type that constantly tries to min/max (and I use that term loosely) but he worries about stupid stuff like all of this and I end up getting caught up in it.  
---
Think I'm just gonna try and forget about everything and play what I actually enjoy! Thanks!
---
the world needs a GM Apu youtube channel
---
Didn't know you could write "%t" to get their name. Guess I haven't played on RP realms that much.
---
Are there any other commands like this one? :-)
---
NElf life is lonely. Most make the adventure to other starting zones for the better/more familiar questing. Those that remain in Kalimdor for the early levels are probably alts, specifically there to soak in the quiet or experience the NElf questlines.
---
I'm om Gandling-EU as a alli Warlock, currently in STV as level 36. Generally the pvp has been enjoyable, fighting over mob spwan areas such as Bhag + The Ruins, and then just getting along grinding. Nothing ever seemed to last to a stage where it was unenjoyable.
---
 I've had a blast and have got my ass kicked a couple of times but no corpse camping. However, the Shamans of Gandling seem to have some serious issues as they're the only class to go out their way as a Skull level and kill me. Dare I say, they're worse than rogues and mages on this server.
---
They're still around! Every now and then you just get amazing GMs that listen to you, treat you as a legitimate source of information on obscure subjects, and do the whole RP shabang along the way.
---
Just for the memes and especially since you're a fellow Warrior: 
---
Please get a stack of [Free Action Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion) and a pair of [Ornate Mithril Boots](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7936/ornate-mithril-boots) just to fuck with Mages. Its so fun!
---
Mages think this game is like Rock Paper Scissors, they're sharp Scissors while we're wet Paper - but a Warrior popping Free Action Potion fucks with that perception so hard, its really nice to /spit at them after you oneshot their ass with a Mortal Strike crit.
---
All they could to is Sheep you and wait out the Potion but you can allways kick the cast or Intercept after they blink away.
---
Indeed, back then I remember that in my guild it got craftd for a very active Warrior who contributed alot to the guild, he was sort of our MVP, we even held like a ceremony in front of Thrall where he got it handed over.
---
I miss the old days, I recently started classic but there is alot about the numbers going on, about efficency and I honestly think that this isn't what it should be. Maybe the dps obsession was present back then and I don't remember correctly but I feel like it's the only thing that matters in the dungeons today.
---
Is a warrior
---
You can autospam frostbolts while eating/rolling cigarettes !
---
Thats what motivated my pick
---
This is how I feel with my gryphonwing longbow
---
ive seen a holy priest farm tyrs hand with mindcontrol. poor guy but was fun to watch
---
Yeah, you're right. I think of the classes I have already I'll probably play druid. I don't need BiS gear if I'm having fun lol. There are plenty of random non-set epics with agility on xD I guess they'll have to do!
---
Ah yes, the Pick Up Group group
---
Am I the only one who read "Oi, Very rude!" With dwarf accident?
---
im not deflecting.  
---
Yes the Fellorc did all that, but they were under the macig Fell power controll of Gul Dan, and no im not trying to defelct it, it is what it is, but the current horde are not bad guys.  
---
Gul'Dan was evil and used his own people for his own purpose.   
---
a splinter faction from those evil Orc's are the Froswolf(Clan) Orcs, they refused to work with/for Gul'Dan, and parted ways. some Orcs were evil and some where good !  
---
\#TheHordeDidNothingWrong
---
It could be that many others have just joined in a joke. Giving you 1s in a jest, it's still small amount of money for the service, in fact too small for anyone to think you are trying to make a bank there. If it's expected that you'd make more money killing mobs than making water, it's joke money.
---
Aoe is pretty good, when I play instances I always ask if the tank want to try pulling more mobs, if we can successfully clean the wave, they usually begin pulling more without me asking again.
---
I think your original post makes it sound like the original people you hired were qualified, and those you hired later were unqualified. 
---
I believe you were trying to get across that the original people you hired were *overqualified,* and the later people hired had enough relevant experience (slightly *underqualified)*, and you successfully trained them at the job (properly *qualified*).
---
However, I'm not sure why you were so upset that overqualified people want to move up.
---
Nothing stopping you from doing it again. Worry about BIS at 60, there'll be plenty of time at that stage.
---
Do not do it... I‚Äôm maiming hunter....your mellow weapons are just stat sticks! Only used for wing clipping basically....if you want something to hit hard get agil and stam with a high swing time
---
A few mins slower than aoe cleave? Ure drunk right?
---
We did  herod runs in around  4-5 pulls with 4mages 1 heal.   There is no way you do this a few minutes slower... not even double with normal pulls.
---
But yes it sucks to find normal runs. Just invite ST dps classes :)
---
When will elemental earth stop going for &lt;10s on the AH?
---
Noggenfogger represent
---
Gotta say i got them all besides nobody says a word. Probably because im the healer yelling at everyone
---
Yea steamwheedle port is where I was catching summers last week so that should work fine.
---
Im just going to downvote that, this is too good of an advice and more fishing competition, I can‚Äôt have that. 
---
Nah JK, it‚Äôs very solid advise and I think it should help a lot of players.
---
b-b-b-but they were controlled!
---
Everyone knows that if someone tells you to go do genocide and you do it, that makes you innocent!
---
lmao
---
Find a guild with high levels who'll protect you.
---
People should tip for your time and mana and 1s is nothing
---
You should check out the WSG flag runner build. That one is designed to be tanky and able to heal irc. The big thing you'd have to worry about in dungeons is gear. Probably would have to carry around a healer and tank gear set.
---
What it don't show is that the windfury totem from the shaman put the rogue and warrior on the top spots.
---
Layering exploit. They all did it and they all write essays about that they didnt.
---
Just in case no one has said this yet, conjured items will disappear when you're logged out for 15 minutes.
---
They are from busy realms to less populated realms so its unlikely. Log in and you will see if you can move.
---
EMERGENT GAMEPLAY.
---
Well it happened to me after i cleared an area of murlocs on the westfall coast to finish in a floating wreckage pool only to be layered and have everything respawn and my floating wreckage pool change to a oily blackmouth pool in the middle of fishing
---
This is not true at all.  As a healer I'm basically beget using my max rank of any heal
---
Yeah, but ret is one of the meme specs which annoys me because I kinda enjoy the idea of it in raids/dungeons. It gets kinda tedious solo but I love playing the support role in groups. 
---
Having said that, I'm loving the idea of druid right now so I think I'm gonna try and focus on that :)
---
Nice, well done! I'll use this for sure.
---
You could try for RFD too. Have you quested through STV already? Desolace?
---
Cuts down on people rolling for loot though. So that's a plus.
---
Honestly I feel like you're making a big deal out of nothing. The game has almost been out a month, if your not 60, then speed leveling clearly isnt that important to you. So if you don't care about speed to 60, and your enjoying the game to 60 who cares about a few xp exploits you didn't get to use. Honestly there isnt that much to do at 60 anyway as you can start farming your BiS in your 50's. The end game raids are literally just Onyxia and MC which are easily farmed with tons of guilds running them already, and really you dont even need BiS to beat them.  What advantages do speed runners really have? Even many casual guilds will be farming the raids before phase 2 drops. I've been having a great time playing the game and I really dont see how other people exploiting the game to level faster has any impact on my game experience or how it should on anyone elses.
---
&gt;  the rest of us Adult players
---
If you were really an Adult you wouldn't be here whining about exploits that got punished with bans.
---
My personal hot take:
---
The difficulty of the warrior leveling experience is vastly overrated.   Most people seem to agree that it gets better after level 30, but I don‚Äôt even think warriors have the worst pre-30 leveling experience either.    I think Shaman pre30 is much rougher, and Paladin is worse than Warrior if you aren‚Äôt talking about difficulty, but effectiveness.   Sure, warriors require skill and gear, but Paladins, Rogues and shamans are all more of a pain for me personally.
---
Then the guy who needs hearths and sells it on the AH. After saying he would equip it.
---
&gt;blizzard cracks down on their GM performance.
---
more like, hires more GMs, and lowers the quota of tickets solved per day to allow GMs to investigate issues properly.
---
maybe this guy is incompetent, but this really smacks of trying to get something done as quickly as possible.
---
maybe this GM is incompetent, but hardly malicious. incompetent why? not enough training and not enough time.
---
Sorry - I was really unclear. You'll definitely understand it more if you finish it; it's a pretty good examination of imperialism, racism, and particularly the unique characteristics of African colonialism (explored more in 'Guns, Germs and Steel', which I would also recommend).
---
But by "should read if you're into that sort of thing", I merely meant if you were hunting to read all of the 'classics'. In that sense, it's worth persevering, if that is part of your enjoyment of reading.
---
I'm the drunk healer but God damnit I do a great job
---
Haha I can imagine :D You gotta do what you gotta do in order to make your pennies ;)
---
Heh, no offense taken. Bad hunters really stand out in groups and leave a more traumatic experience than just "bad" or "mediocre" players because the worst they can do is not focusing, not dpsing enough or afk too much.
---
Bad hunters can aggro a whole dungeon after a jump, "oops my pet, prepare for a pack of 34 elites". Hence the trauma.
---
I should just gather gear for tanking/healing and spaw? Great!
---
You got evidence? Never seen getting 19 energy. I'd bet money on it that I never got 19 energy.
---
Hit % is more valuable than almost any amount of stats. Wear your shoulders until you find enough hit on other gear.
---
Fuck blizzard employ retards
---
Technically Hunters don't either since they have, by far, the easiest time hitting mobs much higher level than them. However, nobody wants you pulling half the skippable mobs in the dungeon.
---
So what you're saying, is that if you're not 60 already, and clearing MC and Ony by now you are a bad player.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-leveling-classic-wow I hope this helps.
---
I have really been enjoying druid, I'm not a very fast leveler, and have been able to both heal and tank in dungeons without needing to respec
---
I had something similar, I was accepting a quest there and a warlock on top of the cage from just pking people, I starfired back at him and got guards aggro and died, he pmed me with "nice try"
---
never mind the people standing on a table across the room killing people... good job guys
---
Man I had to check his ArtStation and it‚Äôs the weirdest style. Like hyper realistic/MS paint/copy pasted photos/12 year old doodle that‚Äôs super unfinished and glowing...
---
Are you the 29 Druid healer I 4-manned Armory with last night without a tank?
---
Nah, pets dosent have that exclusivity as back then unfortunately.
---
I'm on Whitemane, and Nightfin Soup is selling for like 12-15s each, same cost as the fish or less sometimes!..and that's IF it sells. Must be nice! Can't wait for fishing to start being profitable on my server..
---
To be fair, if the GM has put a warning on his account it needs sorting in case he does something stupid in the future. I wouldn't want the GM getting in trouble either, but it's not fair for OP to have a mark against his account for nothing.
---
Can I have your other loot drops? Got legs on the past 6 kills haven‚Äôt seen a single other drop
---
As a Paladin, Resistance Auras are niche and will get little to no use until 50+ dungeons, Seal of Righteousness can stop being bought after you get Seal of Command because it replaces it in your rotation, Seal of Justice isn't needed, and Seal of the Crusader isn't worth the mana while leveling.   
---
Just because you get to save 100g on a mount doesn't mean you should spend it on things you don't need.
---
I had worse as alliance on stalagg. Hopped to heartseeker and 0 regrets.
---
Naxx will crush casuals. There won't be PuGs to Naxx as it's properly tuned in 1.12 (nerfed since world first but still hard). Hardcores will crush Naxx as well, probably day one, but that'll be result of proper preparation.
---
I was actually thinking Holy not Resto, your're a shit psychic.

I've had more luck with that looking for groups.

Good luck.

(I also right clicked and moved it to a separate box as it can get busy with spam at peak times)
---
Standing on a table? Seems like they were intentionally using objects to avoid guards, which is cheating and you will get warned and banned, go report them
---
Was pretty easy tbh.  I did it while I was leveling, skinning as well, and saved all my mats on an alt for Eng and to sell.  Switched to eng after i decided farming devilsaurs wasn‚Äôt gonna be worth it
---
Thats 100% wrong... If you stack spell damage it takes alot but your damage goes up.. go put on a bunch of frost gear I bet your blizzard goes from 31dmg a tick, to 32 or maybe 33 depending how much.
---
Also the wetlands water staff also gives in, so its a faster and better item then anything else unless you get a crazy good BoE world drop.
---
Every mage rushes it, cause its a standard easy staff, and benefits your frost abilities... 
---
Nice try tho.
---
First time playing wow
---
What gets me is that he "didn't have enough time" I get the whole mage aoe is a thing now. But wtf are you grouping for an instance if you're pressed for time, in classic?
---
Snitches get stiches.
---
we are powershifting now and have 2 items supporting it,not so common in vanilla
---
There is a quest in Ungoro (From linken) that is pretty long but you'll get a 20 spellpower offhand as reward.

Oh trust me, I did the moment he started shooting me
---
Hey, Shalle!

I dont ask for tips but if they give them I'm more than happy.

I actually haven‚Äôt lol

so if someone says "fuck you" then you resort to camping them for hours? lol
---
Unfortunately oceanic has no rp servers

Might sound silly, but your battle.net is signed into the same region as his? Right? Log out of battle.net client and there is a drop down on the window where you type your email/pass in. Similar behavior happened to me a while ago.

oh thats great

I love this line art. The delicate feeling of a sketch but I see a clarity reflected in inking.

But FellOrcs aint the same as Froswolf Orcs.

Frostwolf Orcs = Good
---
For the unenlightened, why are stuns on your tank targets a bad thing?
---
What.. I was literally thinking about making a guild called Invictus. Reminds me of character creation... :P
---
What class are you? It could be a factor in what route you can take ( such as mage mob grinding and pet classes being able to solo higher lv quests better

Thanks Broseph, got it! And keep single pulling, you're the tank: you decide!

I think this guide will cover pretty much everything.

Some mage in Org wouldnt give me a stack of water unless I paid him 1g lmao, I'd rather buy from a vendor, at least it wont disappear when I logout. His loss, woulda tipped him (no need to demand money, people will usually tip).

You mean Arthas the undead, that was under the influence of the lich king, which was made by the horde's demon overlords from a horde leader?

Yeah but taking that into high level dungeons is insane.

Am I missing something? This guy admits twice that he was up.
---
Completely random runs were always a bit of a shitfest, because you mostly get those people nobody wants in their guilds, at least on high level. At least in my experience from 10+ years ago.
---
Jeez. How‚Äôd you guess that
---
Guess you totally ignore the part where hes now tanking unrs/brd and its the same story
---
Because it's much easier to save and make money in wow than irl :-D
---
Whats better arms or fury?
---
&gt; Solo leveling as a paladin is unbearably boring but much better than a warrior for most of it.
---
Not really. I have both, and the warrior is actually much easier to solo. Do I need to occasionally sit and eat after 5 or 6 mobs? Sure, but the warrior is done eating after that fifth mob around the time the paladin is done killing his 3rd.
---
What an idiot.
---
It's also been posted in the Icelandic Wow-Classic Facebook group hahaha
---
Do you have any quest helping addons like questie? That one shows you where all the quests you can get are (with some inaccuracies but it's still good). Maybe you have some on the other continent?
---
Oh shit, I wasn't aware you could report people for being in stupid places and killing you in town like Booty Bay or Gadget  - not that it will be of any good if that retarded GM responds.
---
Good to know anyway.
---
What raid is this?
---
Bleikfis directly translated from Norwegian is Palefart, what a name.
---
I don't see what's wrong here.
---
you were on the roof, you couldn't be targeted for pvp purposes. So that's an exploit in PVP regardless of whether you were attacking or not. It seems like you both said thank you and he logged off then by the time you typed your long reply he was gone.
---
As a Paladin tank (no rage issues, yay), my free square is "DPS warriors spamming heroic strike".
---
It's bad DPS and ludicrous aggro. Thanks!
---
That wlll be replaced in a week? No thanks.
---
how?? has the season started allready? I thought it's another month
---
Well, it if can't be Shaman, Druid will have to do. Sorry to see you side with such a misguided faction, but perhaps one day we can all learn to co-exist. 
---
Good luck with the druid, just go for it and stick with it.
---
Just stay arms even on 60 you can ez tank all dungeons with arms
---
Probably not that far off.
---
Most totems are blessed by their shamans before being used so clearly the elements are fine with it.
---
People are probably down voting because you're talking about meta in ZF
---
Awesome cheers.
---
So why was the hord Player flagged? Most likely because of gang slaughtering poor souls on their way to a dungeon.
---
So you need two 41 lwl(at least one of you) hordie to take down one 41 lvl alliance druid? So much Strength and Honor.
---
TIL %t is a thing.
---
"Put yourself at a disadvantage to make life better for everyone" isn't gonna work ever.
---
Also this is not a "PSA".
---
yea what happens when u pull agrro from across the server and the mobs come over and 1 shot you , i dont think druids like this understand how THREAT works
---
I have noticed and just end up 2hand tanking in defensive and spaming cleave to keep threat. It's a pain but no one wants to wait. Whatever happened to letting the tank turn the mobs first?
---
I've had zero issues. I had bad groups, I had good groups. I had AFK people and leavers. I had ragers and whiners. I had nice guys who were bad, and good players acting dickisch. 
---
I'm enjoying the diffrent players and behaviors.
---
Its better than only playing with the same likeminded people like I always did in retail.
---
Now I'm playing with everyone.
---
Gratz on it, I bought mine off the AH, when I saw it there for only 95G... Made me also very happy :-D
---
You can get away with that play style as long as you have a good healer/tank combo. But it is really exhausting as a healer in those groups ( I don't tank, but I guess for tanks it's the same).
---
That's why I play my druid only in guild groups. Pugs are like a box of chocolates ...
---
a little quote from your self a few posts ago  
---
&gt; Everyone knows that if someone tells you to go do genocide and you do it, that makes you innocent!
---
Combat in general doesn't drop quick enough, after bloodrage ends it takes about 3 seconds for me to drop combat
---
I tricked myself here
---
Your reddit name is similar to your char name and I saw you get banned.
---
Save yourself a 1:02
---
He just puts a freezing trap on an autowalking-guy's path.
---
In vanilla I had a Dwarf Hunter called Marx who travelled with his constant companion a wolf called Groucho.
---
Stuff like that happened in vanilla too, not layering.
---
What did you use to edit this, please? :)
---
That was sarcasm...
---
They both work fine for different situations. If you keep a closed mind you aren't ever going to find those different situations. Every thing looks like a nail to a hammer.
---
I'd you arent raiding then dont even sweat it. Spriest do incredible when finds end quickly. In pvp or dungeons you wont have to worry about it. It's the 10 minute boss fight of a road that hurts. You oom in the first 30 seconds and then your dps tanks as you stand and wand for 9 and half minutes.
---
Have you tanked as arms with subpar/underskilled 1h weapons and dps who don't comprehend threat?
---
and those groups are huge... I think we made it to the last room with no wipes and then it began... we wiped on every group (i was 42).
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad for retail nerds.
---
&gt; Adult players (with really not much time on our hands) 
---
Well im not that "Old" but still im an adult working 35h/week and still have enough time to play. Stop pulling the "I have no time because im an Adult and everyone with more time must be a kid" card. 
---
It always comes down to what you chose in your life.
---
feelsbadman üò£
---
Well I mean as we've seen in the lore with WoD orcs don't need demons and fel to be massive genocidal dicks. That's just how orcs are.
---
Using any terrain to avoid guards is a bannable offense. Just a little fyi.
---
I saw the same massege a few days/weeks ago, I think they just sending it automatically like a bot.
---
I feel you my man. I spent almost over 2 hours in SMLibrary trying to spellcleave on my Mage the other day. And it was all chaos and no efficiency. Repeatedly I asked if we could go the slow n steady way. But was either ignored or got the "if you want slow n steady questing is just as fast".  After wiping repeatedly I started to CC on my own and nukimg the mob that the tank taunted. Felt like the pace changed after that. Still was pretty pumped and fed up when I hs'ed out of there. Surely aint gonna run cleaves when my Warrior comes of age! /venting done. Thank you all!
---
No one has mentioned it, so I will. Incremental dot damage was far less likely to break fear in vanilla. Full warlock dots? Watch your character helplessly burn. Throw an immolate or shadow bolt while they're feared an the direct damage portion is extremely likely to break the fear. Slow burn; no break. Big single chunk damage; almost guaranteed to break.
---
Boomer triggered by new ways to play the game.
---
You dont have to be spell cleave if you dont want to, theres still groups that pull one pack at a time.
---
Note to self as a mage: ‚Äúput single target chill mage‚Äù in the LFG channel.
---
This got out of hand.
---
You can do this with a macro as well
---
Did a quick search, and it was Outfitter.  I don't see this ported over to Classic so will give Itemrack a try.  Thanks!
---
Yes it‚Äôs annoying. I had a feeling retail mindset would carry over to Classic and it‚Äôs definitely making dungeons less enjoyable. 
---
I would imagine it‚Äôs even more annoying as a Tank, I play Healer. 
---
That being said I still enjoy Classic dungeons to retail by a large margin, at least in Classic the players interact with each other.
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
Grats man. A must have for any druid haha.
---
I do seem to get fuckloads of greens from the trash in rfc though. Useless greens, but you can disenchant them I guess
---
I get it, different play styles other than yours are wrong and we should all be playing cookie cutter builds.
---
I feel like this is a consequence of the dungeon rushing I witnessed so far.
---
I might be an oldie for saying it, but I like to put up the campfire in front of a boss for the small spirit buff, prepare my earlier caught fish into "low tier buff food fot the healer to gein 3mana every 5sec or whatever" and share it with the group. Yesterday I ran through Zul'Farak and got called a "slowtard" because I put the skinned letter into armor kits before a boss to give it to the tank who had no enchantments on his gear. (It was the tank who called me like that).
---
I mean he didn't even accepted the kits (I dind't ask money) he was rude and told me if I want a slow dungeon I should form a group myself as I slow down his path to 60. 
---
It was my first bad experience so far but I havn't had that ever in vanilla tbh and I did the exact same back then.
---
I give 1g
---
People keep bringing up edge cases. I'm making a general statement here, people who are 60 by now a vastly more likely to be good at the game than the general population.
---
Are there some very skilled players who are going to be low level for a long 5ime yet? Yes. Are there some people who just managed to wipe their way to 60 playing 24 7? Also yes.
---
So you really think this represents the trend in those player bases though? Because that's ridiculous.
---
Imagine actually playing BfA lmao. You ARE the meme if you paid for that experience.
---
I agree
---
I buy and trade.
---
Ive been topping meters in dungeons since the beginning  and im 55 now, ive been wondering when will my DPS become as bad as people claim, apparently it doesnt. The aggro is real tho :D
---
edited my post
---
If this aoe cleave is a thing, I don‚Äôt see why/how. If it is even 15 minutes slower, you‚Äôre rolling against the same class. 4 mates and a priest = all cloth wearers. No way the upgrades you get balance out over a normal group. Just sounds awful
---
garbage GM
---
Stunned tanks aren't building threat and their rage generation is nerfed.
---
Just be glad if you get an intellect buff from me. J/K I'll usually gladly make water and food for everyone in a dungeon run while they progress through the dungeon. I don't make excessive amounts, but enough to get through the encounter without using your own supply. I only expect a tip when random players ask for food/water. I do always find someone to give my food and water to when I logout tho. No sense in letting the food go to waste.
---
This looks furry.
---
Lol. No, you just RP in normal English.
---
I think I've looted a single Fish Scale in my questing. I don't know how you guys stock up on these.
---
I mean don't be a dick and then screw up something so easy. It makes you an easy target.
---
Part of this makes me feel like these are mostly just bots. Anyone can write a program to mass message warnings to people. There is nothing personal or identifying about those messages that make me think it was a person behind a computer.
---
As a healer I'm sick of burning my entire mana bar on the mage and warlock. Like calm down you dont need to burn every mob in 2 seconds. The amount of time I've gotten through off sheer luck because the final mobs die as soon as my mana bar runs out. Oh and then the dps people are like, keep me shielded please. Look I dont got the man to put a shield on you every 2 seconds because you have way too many mobs on you.
---
You must be fun at parties üôÑ
---
They are really fun in PVP.
---
Dont forget the HOJ/Savage/Ironfoe trifecta.
---
Wait until people learn about getting on top of buildings in Booty Bay.
---
How does one play around having a high party member other than replacing them?
---
Group with other people.
---
I have very porous bones
---
Use the /equip trash blade on sinister strike or another ability.
---
Love your character name.
---
This wasn't my point.  A good tank *makes* a good raid leader, because the qualities of a good tank overlap heavily with the qualities of a good RL (chiefly decisiveness).  This statement is completely independent of DPS RLs.  Another way of phrasing it:  I've never met a good tank who wasn't also good RL.
---
There was a suspicious amount of bank alts in the barrens that day.
---
Oh shit what have I done
---
arms/fury. mortal strike/sweeping strike for soloing and tac mastery for dungeons. no need to spend a point into prot until 60.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053250213120105001-55000104005
---
Oh yea I know I wasn't saying it didn't exist. Both DBM and BigWigs also existed in Vanilla. It's just that there were websites with strats and positioning and everything even earlier.
---
&gt; How can the game not be intended like this?
---
You think when blizzard was making these dungeons they intended them to be spammed nonstop and just killed with 3 pulls?
---
Only shows the vendor selling price. What addons shows the auction house price?
---
What a judgemental comment.
---
Agree, at low levels...at first (primarily because most tanks wont have the tool set to maintain aggro).  
---
However, as players progress, these practices will eventually become muscle memory and bad habits will develop. This in turn CAN become problematic in higher level dungeons and perhaps raids as well.  
---
IMO practice early to avoid the pain later.
---
I've tanked brd arena so far as elemental. Shield mastery and elemental warding are pretty much all you need.
---
Having a hard time farming medium hide for Leatherworking. Killing tons of bears and such in Hillsbrad, but all I seem to get is medium leather. Any tips for better results getting hides?
---
Is blizzard rank 3 at 34? Mine were only doing 45 yesterday in SM
---
hey, heads up, they disappear 15 minutes after you log out.
---
Hey man - Sure thing, lets get to it.   
---
1)  
---
The easy answer is to talk with people. When I'm making a group and a low leveled tank pm's me, I always ask if he is prot and he got gear for it, if he doesn't then I say I'm sorry. Obviously he can lie about the talents, and I'll have no way to know before we start the dungeon, but then he is being an asshole, and he is ruining his own reputation on the server (imo). Also i'll kick him and look for a new tank. In regards to the gear you can always inspect people when you meet them. 
---
So there is obviously a bigger 'risc' with inviting lower leveled people, so you also need to put more effort into talking / checking them, that much should be obvious in my opinion :)   
---
2)  
---
I have no doubt plenty of dps have actual healing gear sets they switch to, just like I have a dps set i swap to when I quest. So I'm not under the illusion that you don't have a set, but I'd be prone to believe as a DPS most people will probably try and gear their DPS (mainspec) first and have worse healing items than they would if they were 100% healing, if you catch my drift.   
---
Hope I got your questions answered, otherwise let me know :)
---
Why don't you talk to other players in game or explore the area like it was meant to? WoW is a social game, but people nowadays prefer to google-pilot the game.
---
Dogshit trash garbage GM :)
---
haha i just posted yesterday about the same drop too. gratz buddy keep on druiding.
---
As a drain tank warlock there are a ton of skills 30-40 I won‚Äôt use and don‚Äôt plan on wasting the gold at low level. Money much better spent on anything rather than on unused spells
---
Biggest mistake is buying all spells. Most classes only need 1/3 of the talents while leveling. This alone can cost you 10+ gold.
---
Buying consumables, gear or other unneeded items will set you way back. Don‚Äôt buy anything and vendor everything.
---
Having a gathering profession + skinning then vendoring or putting on the AH will net you a lot of gold.
---
People do it for exp, not gear. Gear is just a side bonus.
---
When you move the goalposts, anything is "hard to justify".
---
Become one with the Shockadin. Once you‚Äôre in BRD some nice hybrid plate drops with str, int, stam, and +to spell and heal. I‚Äôve found myself just switching weapons and one or two cloth pieces out for world questing.
---
Blizzard has really put their worst employees on Community Management.  It may be 2005 WoW, but it's still 2019 Blizzard.
---
100% wrong. i can chain pull 5-6 packs before the healer needs to drink.
---
But you realize that after you hit 19 energy, the next tick youll be able to SS twice. I have this recorded, happens to me all of the time. Downvoting doesnt change the facts.
---
What you're seeing is Dominos for the bars, Luna Unit Frames for the character bars, and MikScrollingBattleText for incoming/outgoing damage.
---
I‚Äôve had my share of terrible experiences as a healer as well, but plenty of good ones (with guildies mostly).
---
I really don‚Äôt like grouping with mages.  One mage is fine, but once you get more it‚Äôs just a shit fest.
---
Best of luck to you brother.
---
LFM spell cleave should've been the free slot.
---
It's hard to harvest anything while running. 
---
But yes, that and closing the trade window.
---
This is what my new job I start with next week did. I've worked with customers for almost a decade, and dont know Jack about programming and shit. 
---
They are training me in all that on the job because people from my old job said I was just that good with people.
---
Very incorrect! You‚Äôre a warrior ‚Äì you want to keep all of your weapon skills maxed. But moreover, you‚Äôre just making your life harder than it needs to be. Questing will go much faster when your DPS is higher, so get your 2h out.
---
I'd make it easier, and calculate DPS gains from autoattacks only.
---
If 53 agility is 1% crit, then 4 agi gives you about 4/53 of 1% or 0,08% (rounded up) crit chance, and it also adds 8 attack power. DPS = attack damage/attack speed \* (1 + crit chance/100). AP increases your DPS by 1 for every 14AP without crits (so it increases the number attack damage/attack speed) gives you. Because of this, the agility is actually better. In this case it's DPS1 + 8/14 \* (1+0,0008) versus DPS1 \* (1 + 0,01), making the agility superior for as long as the 8/14 divided by the DPS1 is bigger than 0,01-0,0008.
---
If you don't want to do that math, unless your DPS already is high, the agility is always superior.
---
People should play it how they wanna play. I think blizzard intended it like that
---
So what blizzard does is hire temps to help alleviate the rise in help tickets after a big release.
---
So for a few months there's a good chance your GM is a temp making $10/hour
---
The easiest way is directly up from Southshore across the lake and up through Tirisfall yea. Faster on land when you get your mount but pre-40 for sure its easier and safer.
---
That's not true.. they hotfixed stuff all the time lol. And they did nerf Onyxia's initial DoT even in patch notes anyway.
---
Not max level but I don't mind giving created food/water away for free if I'm not busy. I even give away Healthstones on my Warlock alt. Personally think it's just 'paying it forward'
---
As a fury warrior I should get atleast 9% hit to stop abilities attacks from missing. I currently got 6% hit from gear but is there also a default value added when you are at 300 weapon skill? Surely my hit chance wouldnt be 0 if I remove the hit gear.
---
You are right. But they are easier to ru√Øn than retail dungeons + death penalties are way worce.
---
But the dungeons and game itself is pritty eazy.
---
You can wait one lwl and take quest to Razorfen Downs which reward you with perfect one handed sword.
---
I'm pretty sure hides are just rare and youre doing the only thing you can. Crafting professions are either very time consuming or very expensive :(
---
It seems like they have enough since they respond pretty fast.  It sounds more like this GM is just bad at his job.
---
[Mmmmmmmmmm what'cha sayyyyyyy](https://i.imgur.com/gRe2nhm.jpg)
---
Generally speaking the spell power (dmg or healing) are going to give a bigger overall boost to heals and damage. Now and at 60 that will be your highest priority.
---
i don't get whats boring about this? I hate leveling and love playing the game at lvl 60. I'm just speeding the process, in a fun way I think. I like bit numbers on my screen and i guess you like to experience the "game" as you want it. Either way, wasn't trying to fuck with you boomers. :P
---
What‚Äôs the bigger assumption?
---
1. paladin is unexpectedly forced to bubble hearth during a pvp event and returns to finish whatever he was What‚Äôs the bigger assumption?
---
2. paladin is unexpectedly forced to bubble hearth during a pvp event and randomly in that moment finished with everything he was doing there so he actually wanted to hearth anyways
---
&gt;Isnt it exhausting to be butthurt by default?
---
That wasn't a butthurt comment bud, that was a 'no fuckin shit' comment.  Like thank god you told me I don't have to play spell cleaves because that's what I was 100% getting at.
---
&gt;Few months ago this sub was spammed with "play the game just how you want to!" but i guess being innovative and coming up with faster ways to level than in 2006 is forbidden.
---
And that's great, I personally believe this way is ruining for themselves.  I can use this same logic with exploiters.
---
"Do what you must... I've already won."
---
I didn't get banned in vanilla, so they can't ban me in classic.
---
Soon 58 and have a bit over 5 days. I wouldn't say I sped run it, I just followed joanas guide and would probably be able to do it faster taking in to consideration the great amount of time wasted having to wait for respawns / tag battle
---
Blizzard is for like 4+ afaik.
---
I think on the battle.net support page you can do an item restore.
---
I would grind the basilisks in STV (level 40ish ones near the arena)
---
I'd prob quit if they did, these servers are supposed to be #nochanges. Fixing bugs is one thing, but nerfing/changing things would instantly make me unsub from WoW again as I only re-subbed for classic.
---
Yea I'm trying to get consecrate but I put my first 21 points into protection and don't have the money to respec xD (this would be my 4th respec)
---
For context I'm leveling my 4th alt and was asking because the same quests right after another continuously just got me a lil burnt out 
---
(Trying to get all the classes I want to play 30+ before phase 2 hits)
---
Probably a bug.
---
It will do good as long as you aren't also breaking the exact same rule you are reporting a guy for.
---
Well I hope you're enjoying the game and you have so much more to look forward too. Enjoy your adventure and play in whatever way makes you happy :) 
---
Good luck on your travels.
---
R/whoosh
---
&gt;There is no win in bringing a underleveled healer if he constantly pulls more than a healer on a more fitting level will.
---
The win is that you find a healer and get to do the dungeon. The only reason to invite an underleveled healer is because you can't find anyone better anyways.
---
How not to be poor while leveling:
---
1. Do NOT pick Enchanting + Tailoring
---
2. Sell greens and cloth
---
3. Play the game
---
4. Be rich
---
The OP? Yes
---
I remember back in EQ GM actually meant GameMaster and they would regularly hosts events *inside the game* as well as solving problems.
---
Bloodfang?
---
Arcanite Reaper! Hoooooo!
---
Reports Cheater, gets banned.
---
This depends on the company. I worked as 1st line tech support call center for an ISP back in the day, and even the less technical call center people could help you through connecting your home router, IPTV, set up wireless on windows/mac etc.
---
Genocide is bad except when you ignore it and call horde the good guys by pretending every bad thing they did didn't happen, yeah okay/
---
Priest would probably be ideal if she doesnt mind healing all the time
---
I can relate. I was #1 dps and damage done in Ony, last mage alive one of the handful of overall people alive, finished her off. T2 Helm dropped, and I rolled a 5 while the mage who died first and didn't contribute anything won the helm. I totally get the pain bud haha.
---
balance is fine, horde has slightly more but its only a minor number advantage, most hordes are still leveling. Server is alive and very healthy, you'll enjoy it here.
---
A lot of this is scripted for them unfortunately, I've seen a few similar tickets that are worded in exactly the same way. Kinda rude that he just bailed on you halfway through though...
---
When you're low level and get a green with a few stats you definitely notice a difference.
---
As you get more gear it's not as noticeable.
---
&gt; secondly, if a bump to the GMs pay (once well trained and shown successfuly to handle situations) puts them over qualified technicians, then the technicians are also probably underpaid.
---
Well the point I read out of OPs statement is more that many people simply wanna earn the "technicians paycheck" after a while by becoming technicians themselves. So slightly bumping the CS paycheck probably wouldn't change that. You would have to bump it by so much that the guy actually had so much money that he wouldn't want the "bigger" job for even more money.
---
&gt; Blizzard literaly devil since Activision took over!!!!
---
Yet you keep giving them $$$ most likely.
---
Missing the dual boxer pretending to be 2 people.
---
Because tanking is not very fun at all in Classic. At least imo, especially with pugs.
---
Yeah. A few people have seen this guy trying to mess with people.
---
They haven't been able to do it in the Eternal Palace, but for the two other major raid instances, it was cleared in a weeks time. Just saying.
---
They already changed BRD for this exact reason.
---
So ya its 100% happening. Also official forums posts about it.
---
I'm the 2nd one in the DPS meter. There were 10 mobs were pulled and not properly agro-ed, our healer was at half mana when pulled because they didn't drink
---
When they say your mats and 50g tip, they mean it's their charge - it's just how the phrasing evolved
---
I was thinking more along the line of someone trying to steal the node while you have to fight a mob next to it, so you trade him and then go away, then come back and trade him again, etc.
---
Be annoying enough that he might make the mistake to click it away when you are done with the mob and try to gather it yourself.
---
That‚Äôs what being a hunter is all about
---
Sure, and I think this is a shitty way of doing it.  Just like someone who exploits, or buys gold, or buys an account, or has a bot, or is constantly asking for inv to another layer.
---
Play the way you want, sure, I just think some ways ruin the game for yourself.  Why is this so hard to understand?
---
Why? So others can laugh at him as well? If you report someone, don't be doing the same thing as them lol.
---
Yes... Suchs party pooper...  
---
But good for me - I can't watch Reddit Vids from work :D
---
Being Karen feels pretty fucking good.
---
I‚Äôm not butthurt about the bubble hearth. It‚Äôs funny to me.
---
Hear hear! All it takes is a brief line or two to talk to someone before blindly inviting to know if they are for your group.
---
^(I still cringe every time I see "AOE FARM" in LFG chat.)
---
I'm so tired of these posts. If you don't want to participate in a cleave run then just don't, nobody is forcing you. 
---
Though your point about cleaving being slower are completely wrong but TBF to you, you couldn't know since the most efficient comp is to go 4 mages + 1 priest by far.

In theory the tank isn't getting hit, so they get less rage. While sparing the tank some damage sounds good, it is often better to use those stuns on soft targets like ranged and casters to allow the tank to establish threat on hard hitting mobs while the DPS cleans up the softer targets.
---
üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yes, thanks for assuming I don't know how threat works, and that I don't know healing generates threat. 
---
As a healer I am very very aware of the fact that my heals generate threat, this is why you dont HOT a tank before he pulls and so forth. 
---
If your healers are consistently taking aggro away from you it is because of 2 reasons primarily. 
---
1). You lose health so fast that we have to heal you before you have gained any aggro/threat on all the targets and then we take the aggro. 
---
Now, this usually only happens when we're doing really big pulls, and if you're in a group doing really big pulls then you shouldn't be bringing a low leveled healer. i've stated this in multiple threads on this post already. 
---
Now, it could also happen when you're pulling a moderate or low amount of mobs IF you as a tank aren't specced into prot, aren't using sunder armor to generate threat or actually utilizing your abilities properly. 
---
EVerytime I have been with a normal tank with tanking gear, and talents in prot, this has almost never been an issue. 
---
Also, if the healer is a lower level, then his heals should be lower because the ranks are lower, which means he generates LESS threat and he should pull aggro less than a higher leveled healer. 
---
So in this instance I'm gong to say the reason you have bad experiences as a tank is not the healers fault.
---
That is very true yes. Most people does however seem to prefer priests, so I end up tanking most of the time.
---
Personally, I'd let the market tank.  Only roll cloth and mail characters or something. Or only but this leather from guildies. Or demand my guildies only use ethically sourced leather.
---
As a tank/heal druid I agree with you op.
---
Tanking, as soon as there are 3+ mobs mages start cones or explosions, warlocks hellfire. They don't give me 5sec to group the mobs up - if I don't charge, they do dps before I even get to the mobs (or mobs to me with Faerie Fire). They're not using CC and I've stopped bothering with raid marks beyond skull.
---
I can Swipe swap through 4-5 mobs quite easily to hold threat but explosions and hellfire are beyond me - most of the time I have to charge and/or taunt on CD.
---
As a healer I can deal with a lot of party wide damage through hots but have no answer to damage spikes on multiple members - unlike paladin flash or priest bubble. If my dps dies, it's mages and wlocks doing aoe or me, when the mage uses Ice Block.
---
And the worst part is they blame the tank for not being able to hold aggro or healer for not babysitting them.
---
&gt;Hunter really is the shittiest class of classic.
---
One of the quickest to gear up in raids
---
One of the higher skill-cap in PVP with marksman
---
You can use the same spec in raid and PVP and still by a wpvp god
---
One of the best farming class
---
Quickest class to level
---
--------------------------------------
---
Who cares if you don't top the dps charts, no one expect you to, the fun part is topping the hunter dps chart.
---
Stay Sub, it‚Äôs way more enjoyable imo. I‚Äôm chunking everything to half with ambush, then dodging most of the remaining damage from ghostly strike (ghostly? ghastly? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
---
Blizzard really is the best.
---
I mean this is 15+ year old stuff. We know where everyone sits in the charts, specially warriors and rogues. 
---
Most fights favor melee it's not new in MC. Also there are other factors like fights where casters get "counter spelled" or have to stop casting to make sure this does not happen. Something hunters don't have to deal with for example. Just like there are fights where melee have to run out or deal with a mechanic. 
---
I just looked at some of the top mage charts in fights where they get curses, and a lot of them were still pressing decurse. Not 25 times, but still losing dps to press decurse. And actually did not see PI on like any of the rank \~7-15 i checked. 
---
Nothing new here, just pointing out Mages have to actually perform additional duties to the raid, other than personal awareness like melee.
---
How do you see the split between alliance and horde?
---
Yep! These were the people we found. They enjoyed the work, they got a more relaxed work environment, they got paid better than what they were before, and they stayed in the job longer. It also meant when we *did* hire admins we hired people straight to admins rather than through the helpdesk so they were happy as well.
---
Literally everybody won there, the people here going nuts at me are just looking for reasons to be mad. I was just having a conversation :/.

An opposing faction player pmed you? Sure.
---
&gt;But thank you for following up
---
Why didnt you wait for him to Respond from the statement before this one? And **not** make a smartass remark.
---
You kinda ended the convo on your own. Then tried to talk again? Im confused. This is on you, not them.
---
Chonkers is so sad, look at him. Also lol, he's a hefty chonk.
---
Welcome to classic.
---
Don‚Äôt buy prebis stuff until AFTER you get your mount.  The prices WILL drop...  I have a buddy who got his devilsaur set early for around 300g total and now he‚Äôs so far from his mount.
---
You‚Äôre mostly on track but you can‚Äôt just not train skills.  Yea, you can skip a bunch but not training skills will just make the leveling process slower.  Each visit to the trainer starts costing more and more and that adds up very quickly, but you still gotta do it.  Don‚Äôt go every level but go every few levels and you‚Äôll be good.
---
You‚Äôre also forgetting how much repairs cost...  especially as a melee character, your repairs start getting huge so you‚Äôre gonna be constantly throwing away chunks of gold.
---
I got my epic mount the other day.  I didn‚Äôt do anything special.  I think I just quested a lot more than most people, I don‚Äôt enjoy dungeon spamming.  I don‚Äôt leave zones until all the quests are done either.  I make sure to do all the quests in whatever zone I‚Äôm leveling in, which will benefit you in the long run, rep and gold wise.  Plus, you get more gold from quest gold + vendoring the items.  I made a decent chunk from extra mining mats and after selling all my skinning stuff.  To save money, always ask a nearby mage for consumables.  Buying food/water starts to add up later as well, the 45 food costs 3g for a stack of each.
---
My experience outside of spellcleave groups, is that i place high value in healers that can effectively DPS single target  as well as heal.
---
I suppose its subjective in what you value in a healer, but i know in a normal group that isn't spellcleave, i'd rather have a on-level healer that can do effective DPS, while the entire group  is full health.
---
Late stage capitalism 101: Use people as stepping stones to get to the top, then once there, fire them all and hire new people with half the training and a tenth of the passion for half the pay.
---
I don't think he sees overqualified vs. qualified. At the end of the day, he hires helpdesk people for helpdesk jobs, and unless they're mental, I don't think they write "You'll be able to graduate outside of helpdesk into sysadmin" on any job description. 
---
The issue being that the helpdesk people come and go and he needs employer retention. But you can't pay someone above their responsibilities and it's not exactly his fault for wanting employer retention. 
---
There's also the fact that "entry-level" nowadays means "stepping stone" more than it means "only basic knowledge required". 
---
If you have a supermarket that sells apples and the apples need restocking, are you gonna hire a guy that doesn't know exactly where the bananas go but can restock apples as fuck, or are you gonna hire a guy that can restock apples and expect to be upgraded to management in 6 months?
---
If he reads this post on livestream please @ me.
---
Ashenvale, Stonetalon, or Crossroads. You'll end up hopping around these three zones for the next 5-6 levels.
---
I hate the 2hand warrior tank
---
This is really insightful, thanks.
---
It's down to your play style. Rogue solo questing can be a chore if you aren't combat spec. And stealth isn't even that effective if you want to go skip a Cave for a questie at the end. Use distraction and slowly make your way through with saps if possible. But you're a lot more squishy as sub. I'd just level combat
---
let them die. that's what i do. i let them die! i focus on my tank. heal him. and after the secound or third time. they have learnd there lesson. I'm the healer, if i blast my mana on every trash group it will take longer and longer to finish a dungeon. because i need to sit a lot. 
---
currently at lvl 39 most of the time in kathe it's just chill for me, sitting on 90% mana. because the group knows what they should do. I must have been lucky with my groups. but i think it depends on your communication with them and there attitute.
---
&gt;  at least past rank 1
---
That's the key part of what I said. The benefit CoR brings while leveling is contained in rank 1. The rank increases only increase the armor reduction (and AP increase), which doesn't require buying additional ranks.
---
BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON

Tweet it at Blizzard. Companies are deathly afraid of what can happen on social media these days.
---
gear check?? never even mentioned it, not playing what do you mean i play all the time.. about 13 years straight, i think you are responding to someone else....
---
To attest, I‚Äôve dragged our 45 healers through full runs of BRD and LBRS, they do great. Just gotta clear some extra for em to not get mercced :P
---
&gt; I didn't judge anything about the OP. I didn't even mention the OP. Now I am REALLY starting to be judgmental of yourself because it seems you can't grasp a very simple definition of a word. This was in no way judgmental, if you think so you are extremely sensitive.
---
yea sure
---
I just did this yesterday and it was a lot easier than I remember. I had like all injured, 3 badly injured spawn and no critical ones spawn.  
---
I didn‚Äôt really have to triage anything.  
---
Maybe I needed a hype man too.

---
You're being downvoted because you're rude, you're a noob, you're giving bad advice, and you're skipping skills by 18, which is completely counterproductive as the skills are very cheap and all of them are useful.
---
People skip some skills in their late 20s to 40s to help afford mount on time, but you're doing it wrong to skip useful stuff early for pennies.
---
What does DD mean in this context?
---
&gt;and look at all the comments losing it because I just pointed out that I think this is boring.
---
I think you need to learn how to read, i asked in what way it ruined the game, i never claimed you had to find it fun or enjoyable.
---
I find it boring myself, so i really dont get what you are talking about.
---
As a healer I don't mind if you are willing to pay for my water. Its easier to hit the tank once or twice with a fat heal than constantly heal every single group member excluding myself every fight.
---
Warrior is slow and expensive without a sugardaddy to funnel you gear and consumables.
---
1hander and shield until around level 15 when you find a good 2hander. Spam sunders. Keep up on cooking and first aid. Get skinning.
---
You are not an asshole. I've given up asking people for water, because they either tell me to fuck off, ignore me instantly, or charge 50s a stack for the water. Havent met a single one who either sells it cheap or is kind enough to give me water.
---
Then again, I cant imagine how it is to be a mage outside of SM, I'd bet that you have 5 people per minute asking you for water, so it makes sense that you dont want to hand out water for free all the time.
---
Better customization. Less resource intensive. More accurate dps numbers to logs.
---
Hi Karen! I didn't know you were on Reddit too. See you at the PTA meeting on Thursday!
---
The way I have dealt with people in the time I've tanked in wow. Everyone gets one pull. Then I'll tell them to leave the pulling to the professional üòâ. Should they continue to pull I tell the healer not to heal them and leave them to die.
---
Unless stated in the forming of the group, the tank decides who and what to pull. It's a perk of the job.
---
I definitely remember having +shadow damage on my warlock twink in vanilla days. I think it's just that the chances of a piece dropping with your own element are low enough that you can pretty easily get to 60 without wearing any
---
Damage Dealer. What else could it mean in this context?
---
What's your logic here? It's common to refer to your faction, race, and class choice as a role.
---
Look up the cold blood hemo build w/ ghostly strike. 
---
It‚Äôs my favorite build. 
---

---
How much can you sell the 14 slot journeymans backpack for?
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm s amazing how many sheep will follow an idiot shepard.
---
What an ass.
---
Don't play warrior as ypur first char...
---
But jokes aside: It is gruesome until you have a good weapon
---
But it can be very rewarding towards higher level
---
You cannot race or faction change in classic/vanilla full stop.
---
If you want to reroll horde, it will require you make a new character. If on a PvP server, a different server as well.
---
Level 35 isn't too bad, I would suggest re rolling now rather than waiting.
---
What? Being up there isn't against the rules. Only attacking players from up there.
---
Ah. Exact reasons I don‚Äôt play pvp servers. The level of asshole is too high. ‚ÄúLet me just come in and ambush you while your just trying to quest‚Äù *stab*
---
If it‚Äôs not in the current ToS then it‚Äôs pretty irrelevant for this variation of the game 15 years later

Lanklet
---
That's one of my favourite farming spots (alliance). Found a level 25 shaman who walked all the way there to farm on day 3 of classic, I admired his dedication but I wasn't sharing mobs so I camped him until he hearthed out. Definitely not worth it for horde.
---
1. Go combat, it has a cleave once per 2 minutes at least, which speeds up your leveling a lot.
---
2. Enable autoloot and make a macro that casts pickpocketing and then cheap shot (or whatever opener you use).
---
Glade you're enjoying yourself man!
---
Not really any tips for starting with warrior, but I always told people back in Vanilla (and TBC &amp; WoTLK) to start with a Druid. It's the only class where you have the option to be a tank, healer, or DPS and can switch between them pretty easily. WoW is a completely different game from Diablo and PoE and you may like doing something that you thought you never would have liked.
---
Nevermind raid wide dps/mana uptime buffs.
---
20 silver a stack in the ah ain't great but it's honest work.
---
Not everyone wants to play Boomer ‚Äúdungeons should take 3 hours + dont dps til 3 sunders + sorry I have to put the kids to bed‚Äù World of Snorecraft. If lighting up 30 mobs with pristine group coordination doesn‚Äôt seem like fun I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre a dull petty person.
---
I'd happily pay 20s per stack if I were about to SM farm.
---
The problem is that all mages I've seen charges like 50-60s a stack, so basically vendor price, and those who dont charge like lunatics either ignore me or tell me to shut the fuck up.
---
Then again, it has to be annoying to have people spam you for water all the time, so I get it.
---
I mean, we all know fish swim in schools...
---
They‚Äôre about 4-6g each on my server. I‚Äôm using them at the moment. 
---
That bit was mostly just a humble brag as it‚Äôs definitely not a reliable way to get the bags, but it was a lovely little bonus to get three of them
---
As a healer, I now refuse to do cleave groups. It results in too many wipes when multiple dps pull aggro too early and I can only shield one of them. Takes much longer overall.
---
&gt;But they dont believe they are ruining it for themselves, they are going past the leveling phase faster which i assume they dont enjoy.
---
&gt;They arent ruining their own experience, so you dont have to worry about that.
---
Man I'm so glad you're here otherwise there would be no one else to point out these very obvious facts for everyone on here.  Thank you so much.
---
&gt;The game is not "ruined" by spell cleave.
---
Not what I said, not what anyone said.  I said I personally believe it's ruined *for them*.  If they don't think so (obv they don't) then that's fine, idc.  I just personally believe it does.  
---
Please I need some more VERY obvious facts thrown my way after this one.  So you're saying they enjoy this?  You don't say...
---
seems to be nostance, not noform
---
I came here to say the opposite, what an awful UI lol
---
Sure thing, and that's completely alright. The group decides who they want to invite, and this was never mean to force people into grouping with lowlevels, but more a way to make people aware that people 1-2 levels lower can heal a dungeon fine if they are geared / talented for it.
---
I don't mind slow grind if the end outcome is good :)
---
Wow, that's unusual. Honestly, my interactions with GMs have always been awesome through different expansions. Kind of a shame. :/
---
Had this happen to me yesterday in Desolace, there were clearly a group of players needing to kill Scorpids, who all avoided killing the Basilisks and Vultures...  
---
After about thirty minutes there were no Scorpids whatsoever, just Basilisks, Vultures and a bunch of frustrated players dodging pulls they didn't "need" to kill.
---
Thank you. Found it, it's PT Sans Narrow :D
---
&gt; yea sure
---
Tell me what I judged about OP.
---
you never need to know the weapon's damage range  
---
you want to know the weapon speeds, attack power from other sources and what portion of his damage comes from instant attacks (only stormstrike when you are level 40)
---
Any chance you're playing on Zandalari Tribe :P ?
---
For one, the roles I was talking about were quite well paid. Our issue wasn't "we pay fuck all" it was "the people we are hiring do not want this job, how can we get people who want to stay here longer than 6-8 months".
---
I mean are you just looking for ways to be mad here?
---
How much time is needed for level 60 ?
---
Can‚Äôt be; he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúplease do the needful.‚Äù
---
People who cry "LOL NOW THEY'RE BANNING FOR PVP" while knowingly using terrain manipulation to avoid guards.
---
Hopefully they go back to retail.
---
I'm a mage and if someone asks for water I give it to them and if they tip then it's greatly appreciated but I never ask for it. I do the same for portals.
---
I work a full-time job, have a girlfriend, and other responsibilities besides work, family, and friends on top of it all and hit level 20 within the first week. 
---
Being efficient at the game =/= having no life
---
At what point did I say them moving on elsewhere was unreasonable?
---
&gt;  Dude, we hired you as helpdesk and you've spent the last six months becoming competent at it.. we kinda want you to stay there. Nope, if you don't move them up they start applying elsewhere and leave.   
---
and 
---
&gt; The issue is when they want to move away in less than a year.
---
You do, in those two sentences (from different posts), sound like you expect someone who gets trained to stay on the job, at least for some set amount of time. That is a ridiculous expectation. It should be expected that as soon as you've trained an employee to give him any marketable skill, he will try to sell that skill to someone else.
---
Look up "keys and attunments" for your faction and do those. Other than that, you have a lot of UBRS/Scholo/Strat waiting for you.
---
+1, I'm glad you made the right decision
---
yea thats what i was thinking lmao
---
that should be more than fine to play at that resolution
---
Also the /me, never seen that before!
---
Increasing the pay isn't gonna keep most people at an entry level job. Personal development and growth is a bigger motivator.
---
Which unit frames are those?
---
Earn it like everyone else.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, I agree with that. But a little while ago, I saw a DPS warrior need on a really solid strength agility leather item, and the rogue in the group got all upity.
---
&gt; I find it boring myself, so i really dont get what you are talking about.
---
You're asking why you think it ruins the game, yet you find it boring yourself.
---
My dude...fucking think about that line for just one second.
---
I know right, I spent 10 gold on the charms since you can't really farm them yourself at 30 (but managed to get all of them so I think it was a decent deal xD).
---
Are you seriously begging for gold on Reddit lmfao
---
You pointed it out in your post. You are just QQing.
---
Imagine getting angry every time you ask for help and other says no.
---
And remember you are the one asking for shit. No one has to offer you jack shit. If they are offering and you don‚Äôt like it just say nty, drop party, look for another.
---
It‚Äôs always been tips for everything since the beginning really. No really has ever said fee.  And you should always tip.
---
Its just illusion magic that makes you feel like you are drinking water, if you log out the spell fades from your character.
---
It's Classic WOW, there will never be any bug fixes, therefore what you reported is a feature and this makes you in the wrong.
---
I treat creating food/water like any other profession.  
---
If doing something for someone else will help advance my profession and it costs me nothing, I‚Äôll do it for free. Example: making bags using someone else‚Äôs mats. 
---
If doing something doesn‚Äôt have a benefit for me, but is a benefit to the recipient, I think they should tip ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.., 
---
Creating food/water is such a thing.
---
If I‚Äôm in a dungeon, I‚Äôll create food/water all day long for the party. Because it also benefits me. 
---
If I‚Äôm in a tavern and someone asks me for food/water, I‚Äôll do it for a tip.. However, I never specify an amount.. Even a copper piece has some value in classic...
---
That being said, I‚Äôve also felt generous, announced free food/water, and spent an hour yesterday in stormwind creating food/water for anyone who asked..
---
&gt; I've run many groups with mages past level 30 when I get blade flurry and when were the same level, my overall damage is higher, my aoe damage on packs with flurry up is higher, and I have literally 0 downtime between pulls.
---
If you're in the group as a rogue, it's clearly not a mage aoe group so why should your experience be relevant? There's no skin of your teeth with 3 novas and cold snaps.
---
I can‚Äôt sell rage potions on Kromcrush... sucks. Thought with the abundance of warriors they would go like hot cakes too.. stopped bothering with them.
---
Was this on noggenfogger? I reported a lv41 ud priest doing it there.
---
145-160 hours for a reasonably informed player playing relatively efficiently
---
Note: this will only work on high pop servers since it relies so much on the AH.    On my  low/medium pop server this would not work.  A stray like tthis will only work with a healthy population of higher level players with a much healthier economy then you see on lower pop servers.
---
Oh man you totally got me, ouch lol
---
Maybe you can really put to work the mailbox bank tip. Send a few stacks to another character, send them all back. Now you only need to visit a mailbox to feed your cat. Alternatively fishing works wonders for pet food!
---
Yes XD 100% agree
---
If I need it I need it. I don't know the pre-raid BiS of every class, so I roll basically on what is an upgrade to my gear. And in the case of a holy pally, cloth is part of what I need - there is neither much plate, nor much other gear besides cloth for healing in this game, at least pre-raid.
---
The sixth clause in that has got to be a joke, it‚Äôs basically describing the point of a PvP realm
---
Hmm, seems like noone bothered to answer.... Conjured items disappear some minutes after you log out. Hope this helps :)
---
You have much to learn young hunter.
---
I think Leatrix Plus has it as well, not entirely sure.
---
Make a macro that says it when you conjure.
---
Lmao they axe half of their GM staff yet this lobotomite stays gainfully employed.
---
No, but there are more than a few former Activision employees in the higher layers of Blizzard nowadays. I could have worded my kneejerk reaction more carfully, sorry.

---
I just grinded basilisk in thousand needles for 10 hours or so. Got me 60G and 2 levels but I could feel my brain rotting as I did it
---
I think your post is a-tad optimistic to think that the average GL is going to research into a lower-level healer to see if he's specced correctly/geared, and that's even if the average GL knows what those criteria are for that specific class. When he can just wait an extra 10 minutes for a on-level healer to come along.
---
I feel the courtesy should go both ways. I've played a mage for a long time in Vanilla (a long with other classes) and now I'm playing a druid so I know the struggle from both sides. 
---
When I played the mage, if I got a trade window out of nowhere in my face I just asked for high tip (something like 2-3g) and if they refused to pay it I refused to give it. If can't even ask nicely I'm not gonna act nicely and provide you water. If they asked nicely I gave it to them for free every time.
---
As a druid now I prepared a macro that whispers my target and asking them in a nice way if I could have some water. If they give me I always tip them but if they ask for gold I find another mage instead or I rather use my vendor water instead. And I always try and ask the mages that I know can create more than 2-4 water per cast as well since I know it's rather annoying to create a lot of water for that. This method has worked out good for me and \~80% of the mages give me water right away.
---
If you want to be vulnerable to curse of tongues and counter spell :)
---
My current plan is this ....
---
Workout how much each item from my professions sells for at a vendor. Calculate the cost of vendor bought mats (thread, spices, dyes etc) and see how much I have to play with in terms of the AH/player purchased items. Then search the AH for those items and only purchase if it falls under my maximum price.
---
For some items, there is literally no profit in it .... but for others you can make some.
---
For example ... Light hide vendors for 50 copper. I often see it in AH for about 60 copper a piece. Salt can be bought for about 45 copper a piece. Use the hide and the salt to make a cured light hide, which vendors for 1s 10c. When I was really low on cash, i'd buy out every light hide I could get my hands on as long as it was 64 copper or less, making sure to leave enough change to buy 1 salt. I'd sit for ages making cured hides and then just vendoring them. buying more salt, make more, vendor those. Rinse repeat Profit. For some items, it might only be a few copper here and there but if you are making lots of them, it soon adds up. I have on more than one occasion completely cleared the AH of certain items because I can profit. Now I will leave 1 or 2 at a low value so that anyone looking to sell their own listings will be more likely to undercut those and leave me with a bigger profit margin. I screwed up by buying all of one specific item and when they were relisted by new players, they were about 20 times above my profit margin.
---
I have started a Google Sheet to list the maximum prices for a few recipes that I use as a staple and only even buy the materials that fall under that price. Sometimes I will leave 1 or 2 at a low value so that anyone looking to sell their own listings will be more likely to undercut those and leave me with a bigger profit margin. My sheet also allows me to edit the vendor prices for the threads or spices once my reputation increases and will calculate my new profit margin without messing up my sheet.
---
Good one

Welcome :)
---
Weapon speed and weapon damage are inseparable. The Weapon DAMAGE of the Whirlwind Axe is higher than the damage of the Whirlwind Sword, while both have the same dps. It is the high damage which makes the axe valuable to warriors over the sword. The Axe has higher top end damage because it is slow; or the sword has low top end damage because it is fast. At that point, it's semantics.
---
People keep asking because they hear slow is good. Slow is not good. Slow means big number in the damage range, when compared to faster weapons with similar DPS. BIG NUMBER GOOD, Slow just usually rides in the same car and sits beside Big Number at lunch.
---
noform works. I have many macros with this condition.
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôs fair of the rogue to be annoyed. If the nobody else needs sure I don‚Äôt mind at all but come on you know you don‚Äôt need that like he does
---
levelling with mining and herbalism this time around. Definitely helps with gold income, but it's been quite random on what sells or not. sometimes the bronze bars all sold really quick and next day the next batch of bars didn't sell at all for the same price. 
---
I should probably get an AH addon or something, because it's so damn time consuming trying to gauge the value of items when it's only sorted by bid price and it fully ignores stack size/buyout prices.
---
I've also been trying to put stuff on AH with my bank alt as soon as I get home from work so that it's on there for the 8h prime time instead of earlier when I did it the last thing before going to bed (although those items would also sell.. maybe not as many items on the market then.. idk)
---
Yeah, I believe it's a boring way to play the game.  I'm sorry but are you actually brain damaged?  I feel like I am speaking with a 3rd grader.
---
I notice a lot of people, assuming they are new to the game entirely, are needing on stuff they don't even need. It's kind of sad. You don't need everything that drops.
---
&gt;If you think this is boring... and this is how someone levels for hours and hours. Why is it so hard for you to believe that someone would think this is ruining the game for anyone who wants to level this way.
---
You still havent figured out that they find leveling the ordinary way even more boring, maybe some day youll get it.
---
Sorry bud, just because a few people do it and you heard about it doesn‚Äôt remotely make it ‚Äúmeta‚Äù.
---
i basically do all this except fishing and am still poor :V
---
this is me:
---
\- get epic drop for first time in years of vanilla playing
---
\- undercut AH prices
---
\- 3 hours later, people have undercut you by 70g
---
\- still poor
---
While leveling that doesn't really matter I don't think.
---
That it's incorrect. You can often tell what people mean based on the context, that doesn't make it any less incorrect.
---
If it was a spelling mistake it's not a big deal, but when you're intentionally using the wrong word it's worth correcting IMO.
---
Same story from Alliance side
---
Dustwallow Marsh?
---
Mages charge for water.... is locks give out hearthstones free... one actually takes some effort to obtain;)

That was awesome!

---
I‚Äôve been playing mage, sure the aoe is helpful, but really the only time I do it in dungeons is when an extra pack gets accidentally pulled. 
---
I‚Äôll run in arcexplo + cone + freeze, and use mana shield to help negate some dmg. I do it to pull threat and kill things as quick as possible so that way hopefully the tank survives and maybe I end up as the only sacrifice.
---
How long would you estimate all of that takes?
---
Also, is that with just a basic fishing rod and maybe some lure?
---
They were selling on Thalnos for 20 to 30 gold. They are probably the most common rare whelp pet.
---
I saw something curious today and couldn‚Äôt find an answer. I was on my way from Loch Moran to the Wetlands and saw a human Warrior player fighting one of the dwarfen Guards in the tunnels. This player had the horde symbol attached to his portrait and his name was yellow and all. 
---
He quickly logged off (or disappeared) after he killed the NPC. 
---
What did I witness there? This happened on a PVE server.
---
Dude menethil harbor is right there , if you enter the wetlands you will be found out real fast , also loch Modan feeds into it.
---
You are making some very dumb comments and comparisons.  
---
1. It is very clear what is an exploit and what is not.  
---
2. "Someone stole from me, so I stole from them, and I am now being punished. That's dumb." Logic.
---
This is exactly why I would never pay a monthly sub to play this.
---
A paladin rolled on shoulders with frost damage?
---
Yeah I sold my shit logged off and realized later on in the day
---
I can't hear you, [you're mumbling too much](https://scontent.fmci1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/47686064_1950461101922791_8471785397511258112_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&amp;_nc_oc=AQmFXYoTmiHRK46fGOqDWQBbrJiJ3EDsABELbbWlo_deaCoyOttP7reWW0NOVvpZh6c&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fmci1-2.fna&amp;oh=9890fe26e02b58ec31ac33fe3451d2df&amp;oe=5E36404D)
---
They are doing a basic job that requires basic skills and get paid as such. Do you think everyone deserves 6 figures just because they think they are worth that? If they want to go to bigger and better things that's fine, but they are doing a basic job so they should expect as much.
---
You must be thinking of a lower level wing then cath.
---
So I'm also grinding that area. You just gotta practice doing the pulls. Iceblock for a super large pull. Practice your range so you can frost Nova them a second time without getting in range after like your second blizzard.
---
Well I was 15, and was a warlock. I knew nothing about dps, my optimal talent builds or anything like that. I just knew keep my dots up and spam shadowbolt lol. Wasnt til later expansions that I realized there are optimal talent builds and optimal rotations. Although now I play a mage and it's pretty much just spam frostbolt.
---
Aight nice one thanks.
---
Well, that's prretty much what I do. As a warlock I can afford doing expensive stuff. I'll probably wait for Dire Maul to get my epic mount tho.
---
You win some, you lose some.
---
These are the ones im using right now. So you should be able to just copy and paste them in :) Have a nice day!
---
Double D?
---
You still havent figured out that people find that way of leveling more enjoyable than grinding the regular way.
---
Maybe some day youll get it.
---
&gt;I'm sorry but are you actually brain damaged?
---
Not butthurt, btw.
---
Most of the stuff that drops off mobs around level 40 really vendor for much more than what you can vendor before that. Rock elementals in The northwest corner of Badlands in particular drop an incredible amount of grey items that stack and you can usually make 6 to 10 gold an hour or something if you get some alone time with them. They are lvl 37 to 40.
---
&gt; You still havent figured out that they find leveling the ordinary way even more boring, maybe some day youll get it.
---
Holy shit you are actually fucking retarded.  I'm sorry I can't with you anymore.
---
Lol glider?
---
They were always policed. Even in the original vanilla. The difference is whether you got caught or not.
---
What's the addon name?
---
As a healer, I‚Äôd invite that.
---
i truly wonder why people cut and run as soon as they can from u
---
Lots of people in the higher level zones have been pretty generous with the tipping. If I'm out in the middle of a quest and someone asks me to make water/food, it's usually a 1-3g tip for around 4 stacks of whatever they ask for. Portals on the other hand...people don't seem to understand that those actually cost money to make.
---
"Classic Threat Meter"
---
People are HUNGRY for that ore, my dude.
---
Herbalism is good too once you get in the 150 skills range. Swiftthistle, Fadeleaf, Liferoot etc are all needed by 60s who often don't want to take the time to farm it.
---
I don't even think it will sell for over 50g at any point(Maybe once classic reaches wotlk if they go that route). On gehennas eu horde you can buy one right now for 16g and there are about 30 for sale.
---
The political climate is a bit more of a hot topic these days. Obviously people won't talk about the same subjects they did in 2005.
---
I'm similar where I played Horde because my brother picked horde because he was a fan of the troll headhunters. He thought they were cool which they are.
---
Not sure you really understand - this goes into their CRM system as a case resolved with a verbal warning.  If he does actually do something else - let‚Äôs say someone reports him for one of his alts‚Äô names - he could get a ban unless this is corrected.
---
The shoulders you are talking about is not BiS for mages. There are frost shoulders that drop from vault that is BiS.
---
You could get caught up on skinning pretty quick. The others will eat a giant hole in your levelling grind if you get started on them now.  At the very least, get a mount before trying to herb/mine.
---
In the age of forums and screenshots.....
---
I did do a little bit of that one too.
---
2 gold 50 silver on my server
---
You need to unlock some closer flight paths
---
A rogue told me I had to be prot speced to tank SM gy. I answered ‚Äùwow really?‚Äù, then continued 2h tanking every dungeon...
---
thx, time to fish some stuff xD
---
Cheater-bannn!!!
---
I guess when I say manageable I mean I'll die less, but maybe increased dps really helps with that too lol. Thank you!
---
Wouldn‚Äôt bother spending too much time grinding for gold before 40 to be honest, you‚Äôve gone 40 levels without a mount you can do a few more. 
---
Running SM for 8 levels is gonna be boring as hell. Enjoy the quests and zones. 
---
You could spend 24 hours of grinding to get 100G. But at level 45 you could spend so much less time to get that 100G.
---
OP obviously cropped this image to make it look like a 1v1 when I can almost guarantee he had a group helping him here. Why crop it otherwise?
---
At night people are really more chill about quests but It's harder to get people. Still possible at this point in the game though since most high levels are needing them. And most high levels still play at night. 
---
In some months It's gonna be hella hard to find a GOOD slow and steady quest group.
---
One of the guilds on our server said around half of their player base got banned, and they got banned hard. Over 3 months, characters total roll back and all.
---
Hello, pretty new to WoW still.
---
Got a level 18 Warlock, been using wands for the longest time. Should I try using a staff? What's better? What difference would it make? I use the wands' basic attack (Shoot I think?) a lot, do staves have that too? Thanks!
---
Other question - what is the most needed class usually on servers ? Healers ?
---
These were the insides of ikea candle LED lights with orange tape over them. wired together. I think smaller Christmas lights would have been better (easier)
---
After hitting lvl 30 zones, the trash loot you pick up is vendoring for like 7 s for a 1 stack. Couple this with skinning, where you're getting medium/heavy leather per beast, and you're on fire. I always quest until my bags are full and then I go vendor and head out to quest again. I'm at 55 gold right now and I started this maybe 5 levels ago. This includes breaks to do dungeons and helping friends level up so I could be making more money faster if I just farmed for a level but that feels tedious.
---
&gt;Holy shit you are actually fucking retarded.
---
Keep being mad about people enjoying the game in another way than you do.
---
Cropped to zoom in on the Pally because the camera was zoomed really far out. üòò
---
So you're saying it's not a tip if it's mandatory? TIL North America doesn't practise tipping.
---
Indeed, all other classes never pull from me, outside of first hitting. So tell them not to use Rockbiter and ES. What about FS, heard it's also used by shaman who tank. Is Flame Shock best in terms of least threat?
---
What about lightning shield? Should they avoid that?
---
Definitely possible, especially once you can start 'consistently' mining thorium and truesilver with the amount of folks levelling engineering.
---
I don't think you're imagining things. If I remember correctly, some items were updated with more spell power on later patches of vanilla. We are on patch 1.12 which is one of the later patches
---
Mage wants to AoE so everyone has less fun doing the dungeon. Nothing new.
---
It's not realllly egotistical, I think a lot of mages just get caught in a mental trap. People will happily pay you for water outside of dungeons, so it's easy to think you should be getting paid for water inside of dungeons.
---
All good advice. I think after reading all of these great comments I'll be playing feral druid :) My characters name has ALWAYS been Mithriel. All of these stupid meme names annoy the hell out of me lol.
---
Just so you're aware, /LFG might exists on your server but that actual *Looking for group* channel in WoW is /join LookingForGroup. This channel exists as a core part of the game, "LFG" is player made.
---
Take the advice it's hard to break, even when i know i don't really need it, i still bought it, mainly as it's clean in that ok all up to date kinda thinking too. But at mid twenties and it was over 3 f gold, yea the advice is real, lol.
---
And since weapon for Ferals are just stat sticks I think it's not as important to upgrade that one, as Mr. Smite's hammer is pretty good in regards of stats.
---
By the light of the moon! Pfff...
---
Most likely, was refused an invite to RFK because the warrior wanted the dagger for fury :/
---
&gt;Iirc, I maxed mining and engineering, then dropped mining for tailoring and started an alt with mining and BS (here's looking at you, overpriced iron belt buckles!)  
---
Sounds like meaningless to me.  
---
&gt;Gotta grind rep like an idiot, just because I need flight 
---
MoP had daily system where you "grinded" rep for whatever it was, don't remember. Legion didn't really, because you would naturally get it thru world activities.  
---
&gt;I'll grind rep for gear/recipes that actually mean something or because they have a nice tabard  
---
All reps in legion or bfa have some rewards for revered/exalted. In BFA almost every one has a nice mount.  
---
Why talk about game you didn't or barely played?
---
buying lv35 water is expensive 20s is a good deal.  I'd pay that.   I keep getting the lv 25 water from mages in my instance groups (not sure if they dont have the level 35 or are just trying to not craft it a million times) and i just wind up using vendor water anyways cause it's so slow, lol
---
On my [website](https://3d-mon.com/3d-model/groupe/unisex3dprintmodel/ragnaros-lamp-firelord-demon-3d-print-figure-and-lamp-copy/), yes
---
What you don't understand is you don't have to waste a ton of mana clipping Bliz to run from a mob that's going to kill you, or waste globals/mana on blink/ice block.  All you have to do is wait 5 seconds at the start of the pull.  Then you can literally spam bliz and you're fine.
---
A warrior tank can hold threat off mages spamming blizzard, they just need time to generate enough initial threat to keep the mobs hitting them.  Its all about rage generation.
---
The dungeons go faster when casters don't have to drink from 0-100 every pull because they've wasted half their mana running from shit, and especially the healer won't have to drink from 0-100 every pull due to spamming heals into DPS.  This is way more time wasted than waiting 5 seconds for threat...I mean what do you think you're doing by spamming AOE on pull and running to avoid things?  Do you think that's faster than waiting 5 seconds and then DPSing?
---
You think you're good, but try it the non-faceroll way and you'll see how wrong you are.
---
You pay 15 dollars a month to play this game nothing wrong with getting what you pay for.....
---
I reported someone for this glad to see nothing will be done
---
I think this is the gm equivalent of showing up in the patrol car and telling everyone to go home; even the old lady hanging her washing out in the back garden. *Especially* the old lady.
---
He spoke on chat idk how
---
Disagree. 
---
Who knows if PreBis will rise/fall. 
---
One thing is static and that is mounts. 
---
As inflation rises (more gold on the server, so it will rise) you get closer to that epic mount. Therefore my advice is hoard items that currently have low value, unless you can get a decent price now and plan to reinvest in more items that will rise in value. Then sell what you need to get your epic mount at the time, not now. What‚Äôs the point of having 600g when you need 900g? When you could have just kept the items and sold them just prior to epic mount purchase for 2/3x fold more gold.
---
I‚Äôm just not the type to rely much on ppl lol but like I said if you got it like that why not ! More power to you.
---
We're at a weird time for the economy in WoW at the moment.
---
Many people are still levelling, gold is being sucked out of the economy by mounts, class skills, profession trainers. This means that only a few people will be looking to spend serious gold at this point, and only a few people will have much gold to spend. At the same time, the things that are valuable will be extremely rare. And potentially they could be in the hands of people who don't know how rare/valuable they are.
---
Overtime I'd expect prices will rise slightly as people hit max level and stop putting their gold into sinks like mounts and skills etc. Then supply will go up as people start farming at max level. Prices will probably drop a bit.
---
After that prices will spike with each new phase, especially for things that are used in anything new. They'll then slow drop over time until the next phase. Overall there may be a slight increase in price over time in actual gold terms, but due to inflation the value of gold will have declined significantly.
---
Once we get into the stable period of the final phase gold will just continue to inflate pretty much for as long as there's an active community. Without any new sinks or tweaks to the economy this inflation will just continue on. The only thing that'll slow it will be a decline in the number of things being killed by players.
---
You probably could use an account as a reason, having a warning on your account can't be good.
---
I had a Gnome send me a battletag friend request just to bitch about me ganking him in Jintha'Alor
---
Stick with Wands most of the time. As a warlock, you‚Äôll have almost no strength/agility and no talents boosting your melee attacks, so anything that involves hitting someone with a weapon will be pretty weak. Only wands (and bows etc, but you can‚Äôt use them) can shoot.
---
Not sure if you know this based on the post, but you can have both a wand and a melee weapon equipped.
---
&gt; SM farm
---
This seems like such a foreign concept to me, because every time I've been there with a group, people start to leave after the first area. I'm lucky if we do three.
---
What you call exhausting, I call engaging. Spamming the tank with one spell over and over for 30min-1hr (or more) can get crazy boring. So much that I‚Äôll personally fall asleep mid-dungeon.
---
IMO, it‚Äôs also good training for when shit actually does go wrong. When you get used to healing a group that is slow, consistent and boring, you get out of practice of your triage and critical thinking skills. So when shit goes sideways, you‚Äôre caught off guard and might not handle a situation properly.
---
still favorable over people who say "loot is ffa!" only to go "Nah, not enough dps, we'll award it to the other guy" later.
---
I love the Wow Classic community! &lt;3
---
Always wand like you're doing now, never use your actual weapon for melee as a lock unless you're just trying to skill it up for fun.
---
I've done most of the general tips you've had here, except I haven't touched fishing yet. I had 110g at level 40 so i was instantly able to get my mount, re-spec for Shadowform and train my crucial level 40 skills. So I must be doing something right!
---
I plan on back tracking a little to get it caught up to speed :) Might do Herbalism in place of a (currently) useless Tailoring, just to get some extra money 42-60, making that epic mount even easier to get.
---
Are items that give hit rating bugged, or are charecter stat addons just not displaying information correctly?
---
I have noticed my hit can vary from +5 to +9, and I have to unequip and re-equip my gear until I get the right value.
---
Playing a fury warrior if that makes any difference.
---
He is an idiot, makes me think he was just a bot. Open another ticket, and keep opening them until they resolve it
---
A lot of the comments here make really good points that are worth listening to. I'd like to mention the chain of command in a group.
---
Healer - The healer decides the speed of the run and the size of the pulls. If the tank pulls too many mobs or makes quick, consecutive pulls and the healer is unable to keep up the heals, then you're looking at a potential wipe, wasted cd's and wasted mana using inefficient heals. The healer needs to call the tank out if this is the case.
---
Tank - It's the tanks responsibility to decide what mobs to pull, what order they should be killed and if any need to be cc'd. If you have a group potential of aoe then the tank needs express the need for time to lay out aggro among all the mobs for the most efficient use of aoe's. If marking is needed then mark. The tank needs to call the dps out if they aren't listening.
---
Dps - Follow the tanks lead. 
---
If you're in a group and the dps don't get with the program through ignorance or arrogance then the simple answer is to kick them. You can usually tell very early on if someone's going to be a problem, and at the end of the day dps are a dime a dozen, easily replaced. Stands need to be taken so that people learn the lesson that this isn't retail, it will make everyone's dungeoneering experience better in the long run.
---
being up there AT ALL is a exploit.
---
right? i've worked at mcdonald's for six months now and i'm still not manager. fucking greedy corporate bastards.
---
In classic is it possible to enchant something that is soul bound if you are not an enchanter?
---
Here's an idea of what most people will work on at 60: getting pre raid bis gear, maxing professions, getting gold for epic mount, helping out friends/guildmates, world PvP, rep grinds for recipes, dungeon runs, raiding
---
Hence extremely technical technicality. It's not illegal, but you are going to have a very bad time if you don't, since it appears to be part of the social contract at the moment.
---
Guaranteed sent you the message on accident. Then too embarrassingly couldn‚Äôt admit it so just dipped out? Should have done the right thing and said it was a mistake.
---
Reminds me during wrath/cata days when my account used to be suspended a lot and I would call customer service so much that one of the guys told me to stop calling or he‚Äôll ban my account lol
---
Terrible logic honestly. The sooner you get it the better. It saves so much time using one asap
---
You're a dumbass
---
That's good to hear though. Just so accustomed to anything in the gaming industry being slave labour.
---
Just worry about stacking spirit, then int for the most part. When you get spiritual guidance talent and some plus healing from gear it's a good time to start downranking. I'd recommend just going 14 disc if you really want to start in disc tree, then going as far in holy as you want. Practice getting as much spirit regen as you can by getting as much time outside of the 5 second rule as possible.
---
I have to say trying to heal these groups are kinda intense. Did a SM armory run as enhance but had to heal since we could not get anyone. I mean. We were 3 warriors and two shamans and not one hold aggro. But we smelted that place in seconds. The only issue is there is almost no way to conserve mana inbetween pulls. Have to drink after every pull. So you can either clear trash quick or not have to wait for your healer. 
---
Also its weird coming from legion where healers were almost not needed to classic were it feels like healing has the hardest job there is almost or at least it costs the most.
---
How the hell did you get 1g by level 8?
---
This is the real sleeper answer. All of this content except AQ and Naxx was preparing to be phased out. The itemization, talent trees, and class buffs are not currently tuned for difficulty.
---
When the Naxx patch is released, it'll be cleared within 48 hours.
---
No one uses that to refer to dps so it's a relevant question
---
It's literally the same argument you're making. I spend a lot of mana and time to res so I guess I'll just charge you for it
---
Lol name checks out
---
It‚Äôs pretty game breaking if a level 60 sits up there and kills lowbies all day.
---
There is an item that transforms you to look like the opposing faction for a short time.  I'd guess he was horde using that.
---
Poor baby, someone used a word the wrong way and now you're upset. 
---
I hope you can move on from this.
---
I've had a similar sort of experience with a GM. I've always had the name "Defmute" since I started playing WoW. Randomly during the WoD expansion a GM messaged me telling me that my name was "Offensive" and I had to change it. I told them that I've had the name since Vanilla; they didn't care and gave me a free name changed.
---
I complied, but a few days later I submitted my own ticket saying that I find it hard to believe my name was offensive, and I'd like to have my name back. The other GM apologised for the original GM and changed my name back for me.
---
They need to work on their standards.
---
Even a bad mage will outdps a rogue on a aoe pull, this guy doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.
---
Well reddit tells me to play the game how i like and the way i like is forcing 20 guildees into doing nothing for a month while i get half a level per day.
---
&gt; ..in and issue a quick warning - **we want you to PvP and have fun,..**
---
So wait, that's the warning? They want us to enjoy the game? WTF?
---
&gt; ..but when you get atop buildings **et cetera** to avoid guards..
---
Sounds like this guy didn't even bother with a carefully crafted copy pasta.
---
&gt; .., you were up there, so you also get a warning.
---
"I don't give a fuck about what happened, here's your warning buddy."
---
But seriously they probably want to toughen their stance on PvP activity in these potentially exploit friendly areas and you got caught in it with your own report (bravo!), it's a sad story but not much to see here..You should have reported the player and go on your merry way instead of entertaining him.
---
Question to my fellow aoe mages:
---
What is some good farming spots for level 31-40?
---
Currently 31 and don't feel like questing in STV too much. I will run SM a bit but feel like GY hasn't been getting me enough gold.
---
I charge for water. One of the reasons is the time it takes to make it. Secondly the amount of people that ask me in SW I would be there for years making free water.
---
Details or you‚Äôre wrong.
---
You're a tank, if you're having problems finding a one pull at a time quest run, make one instead. Advertise it as a quest run and people will be expecting a single pull at a time, or at least the majority of your group. If you decide to stop participating because they aren't respecting your demands, you're acting like a baby. Ask which kind of run it is before you join and make it clear which kind you're interested in. If it turns out they lied just to get you there, you can explain yourself and leave.
---
Also, a little bit of money now that let's you afford your mount that much sooner is worth more than a lot of gold later.
---
I am playing a human warrior looking forward to tank my first dungeon and I have a questions about shouts. 
---
Is it possible to have multiple shout (battle and demoralizing) active at the same time or is it like the paladin blessings that you can only have one active at the same time. 
---
Also should I always use bloodrage + battleshout at the start of each pull to pump up my threat and rage generation?
---
Unfortunately that's the 'streamer/modern wow laziness' culture we live in, and its 9 times out of 10 the reason groups break down. GL's not checking or doing background into the people they recruit, having normally raider.io to check for them, or group finder queue auto fill for them.
---
This is why I always make my own groups..
---
Twink items will be very valuable
---
I got a lv 19 sentry cloak, I think it might be worth tens to hundreds of gold in the future.
---
People need to finish their first char and battlegrounds need to appear first, though.
---
But how much time did you spend looking for the hides under 64c. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt you have just been grinding mobs?
---
then why the fuck are they leaving if they pay so well?
---
It's only a good deal if you'll be online long enough to use it all.
---
I love me some mage water, but at least I know the vendor water will still be there tomorrow when I get hone from work.
---
yah but they cannot walk on water
---
Press enter twice to cause a linebreak...
---
Quit
---
Just use your imagination and pretend their body gets destroyed from smashing with a hammer, fireblasts, immolation etc
---
I've met some people running disc/holy. Works quite well actually
---
you know training skills cost gold right?
---
not entirely "for absolutely nothing"
---
also close to break points, it takes (level 30,40,50, etc) it takes more then a whole mana bar to make 1 stack of water.
---
They can use ES once you've established threat and they keep an eye on threat meter (something that everyone playing SHOULD get and do, threat management is not only the tank's job in classic/vanilla) as long as they actually allow you to get some threat. I don't think those few tanking shamans that exist have mana for much else than ES really, FS is just better damage over time and less threat (but for max damage a shaman should do FS -&gt; ES -&gt; FS -&gt; ES). Lightning Shield is extra damage for the times a shaman does get hit.
---
he only thing you can tell them is not to roll with Rockbiter or spam ES early in fights / if they're close to over-aggroing. If they do those things your only bet is to Taunt (which has a longer CD, I believe), after that it's on them. If they refuse to listen and keep on being idiots, consider communicating with the healer and letting them die once or twice, that might help the lesson to sink in.
---
Quite possibly. Dvergar is the plural term. But we of course don't use such demeaning words anymore and refer to them now as horizontally challenged.
---
&gt; As a healer I'm sick of burning my entire mana bar on the mage and warlock. 
---
This is the biggest time waster that faceroll DPS don't understand.  The healer that has to drink from 0-100 after every single pull burns a ton of time...Way more time than say...waiting for 5 seconds each pull and then AOEing everything down.  Mages waste their own mana because they have to clip blizzards to run from shit.  I see it literally every dungeon run.
---
It make zero sense to me.
---
every paladin that plans on DPSing should be going for spellpower and more spellpower :P
---
LoL people actually get tipped for that. i randomly am traded by people and then they say food or water thats all...
---
I‚Äôve been running around Redridge so I‚Äôm actually at 20. And a priest, so I can totally heal. It‚Äôs actually quite funny, I levelled my first ever character, a holy priest, back in WotLK and this time around it‚Äôs *So* much easier because I didn‚Äôt know about wand spec back then!
---
Fishing was just a in game hobby I did in my downtime when waiting for friends etc. 
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre doing quite well yourself, like I said after 40 my gold income jumped dramatically! The stuff you can gather in 50-60 zones is definitely worth having a maxed out herb/mine! 
---
Good luck pal!
---
There's always portal to the actual instance in classic too. Sometimes it takes clearing bunch of mobs to get there.
---
You should join the LookingForGroup channel, which I believe was on auto-join for me when I started playing. It's global channel so reaches way more people. That's where most of the dungeon LFGing happens. On some areas like Tanaris the general chat of the area can help too, when players are at same level than the accompanying instance (Zul'Farrak in case of Tanaris), however usually you get them from either LFG chat or Trade chat in cities.
---
He admitted to being on the buildings, an exploit....
---
That‚Äôs when you call in your guild to give you an emergency line of credit my dude
---
Fire is fun in pvp, frost is hella boring.
---
I have questions.
---
wow that's BS.
---
also wish this were reportable in retail as well... there's a neutral town in one of the new zones where people will just fly up onto a tower and spam cast onto the opposite faction just walking around doing their thing, and the guards can't get to them that way..
---
I imagine his point was start with the druid so you can try all aspects and then reroll as the one roll you liked (or stick with the druid if you like the versatility, obviously)
---
Does it really? Customer support, especially call centers and help desks are some of the most despised fields you can be in with low pay, high turnovers and limited training. It is really hard to find a full set of staff that really cares and is knowledgeable about the subject they're tasked to help with.
---
oh you mean like the hunturr i saw that needed on ravager because he wanted a statstick?
---
It's not wasting minutes if that's the way the game is designed. That's intended play time.
---
That would be very very bad for everyone.
---
Literally every conversation I had with a GM ended with ‚ÄúIs there anything else I can help you with today?‚Äù. So yea, you‚Äôre right.
---
It seems like it.  Voicing opinions about you thinking something is boring = being judgmental of someone else.  How can they even make that connection sanely?
---
Not really...cost and tip are two different things. "Tips" being required is just a price, not a tip given out of good will from the consumer
---
Yeah, the RFD sword is actually insane as a quest reward for how easy that dungeon is.
---
What really confuses me is the pure desperation mages have for wanting to aoe. I‚Äôve seen mages jump up at half mana when I pull to cast one blizzard, go oom, then run around with the aggro.
---
We get it, you can aoe...if you‚Äôd just wait 20 seconds for me to sunder everything you‚Äôd be good to go.
---
And you cant have fun if you didnt get any numbers for kills!
---
Only reason I think someone should be passed on loot is if they are so bad they caused wipes on the raid, but even then take that lightly. If they got cleaved by the boss and died, I take it as a learning experience. In the end losing loot always sucks no matter who you are and how well you performed. That's just how it is, and I had fun nonetheless.
---
This must have been extremely frustrating. I‚Äôd be pissed. Can you report GMs?
---
Unrelated question though: why is using the terrain for your advantage considered an exploit? That just seems silly. If something is intentionally put in the game it should be fair game.
---
sounds amazing. i wouldn't have thought it was possible. however, i've been wishing that rpgs had a more wow-like interface for the last 14 years.
---
Are you saying I'm wrong?
---
I intentionally join groups that are the low end of a dungeons level range. I hate the overleveled speed runners. 
---
I get that Mythic+ in retail requires communication but I have never been able to slog through all the boring crap to get there. There are far too many games out there to spend time doing stuff I don‚Äôt enjoy, leveling in retail being one of them.
---
That sounds like a bug. Def report it
---
can confirm as a shaman main with a lock alt. water breathing is top tier and not skilling it is a dumbo move
---
Since I didnt see it mentioned directly here, keep in mind that wands are in a completely different spot in your character inventory (ranged) versus a staff (equipped melee weapon). Should you have both? Yes. Wands, besides your spells, dots, and minion, should be primary attack focus. Melee weapons kn casters are typically just "stat sticks" as people here mentioned, so you should find one, or any weapon, that boosts vital stats by as much as possible. Basically, if you're attacking a target with melee as a caster, something is going wrong. 
---
FYI, good staff you can get via a quest chain that starts in the Barrens at level 15, if you're horde.
---
Or skill maybe? We had a healer on maraudon who was down to 10% mana in the first few seconds of princess... it was a nightmare. Only healing tank too.
---
Check the flair, I‚Äôm Horde
---
YES IT IS TAKEN LITERAL SECONDS.
---
THAT IS LIKE 2 AOE SM ARMORY PULLZZZ
---
Good on ya
---
Bro, resto shaman took my hoj in a warrior-resto shaman-3x cloth team. Shit happens. There is not much to do.
---
A bit late but what do Devilsaurs even offer?
---
That's not considered an exploit?
---
i use the "simple square" preset and love it
---
it depends on the group. A few days ago I was in a group where it took forever to find a tank and then the tank was super slow. He basically never pulled himself. Just went into bear form and let others pull for him (because he didn't have faerie fire yet). So he ran infront of a mob group and stared at them until a mage sheeped one.
---
It took so long to go through the library that people were like "thanks for the run, I'm out" afterwards.
---
Ah okay, thanks for the good deed anyway :)
---
I bet you havent dueled anyone equal to your own level
---
Mail shoulders with better stats dropped 5 seconds later....  And he greeded on them out of regret...  Why not when you have so many options, know the drops in the dungeon and shoot for the best as opposed to any upgrade?

**&lt;PoL Loves You&gt; \[H\] | NA-Benediction PvP | Friday &amp; Sunday 6-10pm EST | Casual | Loot Council**
---
We're  a social guild on Benediction currently recruiting players of all  types: casual, hardcore and everything in  between. Lead by a Vanilla veteran with years of raiding experience through WotLK and some recent private server experience, this horde guild is looking to expand its roster significantly over the coming weeks in order to prepare for raids and upcoming Phase 2 PVP.
---
PoL  (Playground of Love -- not associated with /pol/, sorry fellas) is a  Discord channel that has existed for  years. Starting as a meme to deal  with the hatred that exists from MOBA  communities like DOTA 2, a group  of friends banded together to expel the  toxicity and formed unlikely  friendships that have persisted across  games.
---
We‚Äôre  bringing our signature brand of banter and carefree attitudes  to WoW:  Classic, and we‚Äôre looking to recruit you. If you‚Äôre a person  with a  life, that can‚Äôt dedicate 8 hours a day to a game because of   responsibilities and you‚Äôre just looking for a group of like-minded   people that want to have fun and shoot the sh\*t with while drinking  beers and progressing through content or engaging in group PVP then  you‚Äôve found the right  place.
---
We  have a small but growing community that participates in Discord  regularly. We have chat channels aimed at sharing news, guides, and tips  in an effort to help people of all types enjoy their experiences in  Azeroth. Right now our main goal is getting everyone mounted up,   attuned, and raid-ready.

3.6 roentgen, not good - not terrible
---
You were up there too. That in itself is an exploit. Sure you reported the pvpers, but you also got warned about being up there because you were breaking the rules as well. Stay off the top of those buildings.
---
Everytime i try to not be the cheapest, evrytime I ended not saling anything.
---
I am very bad at the AH game.
---
I'm not sure if any are actually selling for that much.  I'm checking regularly and the prices always seem to drop to the \~300G level.
---
&gt;chill mage
---
And then roll up with a fire spec. Maximum chaos!
---
Your welcome kind sir.
---
The Cherenkov effect, completely normal phenomenon.
---
What's the XP bar addon?
---
Tip for rogues: stop trying to roll combat in pvp. Just be a warrior. Sub or assassination are kings of pvp.
---
10 packs is very hard for me. I tryed this few hours. But 7 packs is pretty playable. Few days i solo leveling from 49 to 52 lvls im Mara. One run is 15 min time for all pulls and reset (i dead every time for reset instance).
---
I usually tip like 10s for water, so they were getting a hell of a deal.
---
Just out of curiosity. What is the usual fee price for x-mutes?
---
That is just classic... Seen a couple of Posts regarding this. It happens a lot when you don't have all the flightpoints inbetween.
---
You are lucky still. Sometiems they'll just say "No" because you don't have enough FP inbetween
---
Organic devilsaur leather only!!
---
1.12 wasn't the last patch before BC. The last patch was 2.0.x which was the pre-expansion patch that introduced new 41 pt talents, dark portal opening and such. This was before BC launch itself.
---
It's true that 1.12 made the game easier compared to release, but this difference is nowhere near enough to account for the difference we're seeing. When BWL, AQ and naxx get steamrolled, their mechanics are ignored, and their enrage timers are laughed at, maybe you'll admit that.
---
They're British, stiff upper lip and all that, that's why. For a real world example in a war zone see this clip :
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLAUud0i8g
---
38 lock right now and wondering if I should spend my gold on the shadoweave set coming up.  I got the questline warlock robes already (Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe) and the shadoweave pieces are running close to 4g each on my server last I looked.  With only 30g to my name, that would be a big hit at 20-24g for the full set.
---
Currently lvling an alt rogue.
---
Lvl21
---
Lw/skinning/cooking/first aid skill always 1 lvl ahead of me.
---
So far ive been grinding boars with swords and its fast af.
---
Its a good spec imo since you can cut through 10+boars within seconds without having to reg.
---
But keep in mind that i got good gear from lw and i got the dm 1h swords.
---
The fact that lvling is best if you kill everything on your way makes this spec too good to avoid.
---
My main is a warlock and im pretty sure that im 100 times faster with the rogue.
---
Fark. I love this so much. Wish I was playing
---
Does anyone have the spec tree that Snutz (warlock) used when leveling or when he did the duel tournament (lvl 40) against Venruki? thank you.
---
How much time did it take?
---
Mangeclaw. Was my first and only pet from 2005 up until end of Cata. Is now my only pet in Classic. He's a helluva a pet to get and easiest white bear for low levels. 
---
Spawn is constant, no need for anyone to actually take the quest.
---
this druid is bot powershifting, and deff. not using the gnomeregan mace
---
You're special.
---
I had a mail issue which they resolved perfectly but the GMs response to me was entirely in Spanish... this was in Skeram and I don‚Äôt speak Spanish lol
---
Because they wanted to work as admins or network engineers and were taking the job as a foot in the door, not because they wanted that job.
---
They figured they could work there six months and move, when it just didn‚Äôt work like that. I mean it can.. if you hang about a few years and an opening comes up you become a great candidate. You just can‚Äôt go ‚Äúit‚Äôs been six months can I have this other job now?‚Äù.
---
I am probably responsible for reporting 100 people for being up there.
---
Yes, reduced armor will increase your physical damage by a %. The closer you get the mob to 0 armor, the more damage you'll do, exponentially. You're pretty much afk autoing mobs anyway.
---
Sunder can also be dodged, proccing overpower.
---
Hey guys, 
---
Ive seen payo (rogue streamer) running around with a quiver on his Back even he had Not equiped a quiver. Is This some Kind of bug?
---
Hero!
---
I‚Äôll argue. I‚Äôm high asf 90% the of the time I play. I play better. It‚Äôs almost like a zen moment because all my motions are fluid muscle memory because I don‚Äôt have to put much thought into anything anymore. It just auto pilots. But much like an autopilot system the captain is at the chair and ready to take over at any moment.
---
If you run LFD with a friend, /p talks to the friend while /I talks to the rest of the group. Otherwise, f solo /p to /i.  So it kind of depends on what you‚Äôre doing and with whom you are doing it.
---
Yes, it's Ashbringer!
---
Yep.
---
I just finished these up man. Lemme tell ya, good freakin luck. You‚Äôre gonna need it.
---
This is why i tank. 2 sunders on every mob holy shit enjoy your 6 hour dungeon
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you guys can be so respectful to the GMs when they do things like this
---
conjured items disappear after being logged out for 15 minutes.
---
Woah, they're being sold for 10+ on my low pop realm. Damn!
---
I'll accept what you said, but you came across as if I have offended you and for that I apologise.
---
Care to cite where it says it on the ToS?
---
Cast rank 1 frostbolt to hordies passing by the guards and profit. I seen so much deaths from crossing the body of water by the dock in Southshore by that lol
---
Every class is going to have pros and cons. There not all perfect. It‚Äôs just a matter of what fits your play style and what you want to do at end game. I suggest making a list of pros and cons of each class and watch how classes play at level 60. 
---
Also if you take the leveling to seriously and rush to 60 your going to get burnt out.
---
What‚Äôs the deal with the one odd hairstyle?
---
Garbage tier customer support. How far they have fallen from the days of friendly GM's that would roleplay for fun while solving problems. Now we get ornery assholes like we're calling our cable company.

Hi. I'm looking for a guild that has an interest in PVP. Not only, but that has members that enjoys doing WPvP, BGs &amp; Gurubashi etc.
---
I am not really looking for Raid-content, although sometime in the future I might get interested in doing so as a Warrior (Tank or DPS). I have never been in a progress-guild, and I've only raided twice without the LFR in Retail. So my raiding experience is not so hardcore, but I would love to try it out if possible.
---
Right now I'm leveling with a friend, and we're doing exploration and leveling in a rather slow phase, not rushing anything. Doing some WPvP when we encounter Hordes. Its more about the journey and not the high-end game.
---
I'm a male, 33 years old from Sweden and I work a day-job ~07-16. I am a pretty chill person, I don't cater to drama and I am not easy offended. But I want the environment to be mature and not consist of derogatory and/or sexist jokes. I do joke pretty dark and harsh myself, but there is a time and a place, and that is often between close friends if ever.
---
What I'm trying to say is that I just want a chill and respectful guild-chat, and play with people that wants to have fun.
---
Cheers!
---
CRIKEY!
---
Great. Fantastic. But ask any actual, professional artist if they've ever had to draw on their own time, unpaid, in order to get the practice and experience they need in order to later use those skills to work as a professional artist and I think you'll find that 99% of them will say they have.
---
What I'm talking about is that it's not unreasonable for people to use a subreddit or other type of voluntary community management to get the required experience to do that work in a professional environment. I'm not saying unpaid internships are a good idea, though I see how it could be read that way.
---
Ok thanks another vid would be dope
---
None of that here in the barrens shortstuff, go back to your tundra.
---
They can‚Äôt take action because this is literally people not knowing if it‚Äôs intended. From talking to peopl it sounds like those mobs only gave xp on first kill back in the day. But it‚Äôs a lot different than the raid and dungeon reset exploit
---
Seems like you didn't read the post in full or any of the replies / threads underneath it.
---
I hit 60 without doing any of those things. Stop caring about what other people are doing, and focus on hitting cap and enjoying the game yourself. Classic has only been released a month.
---
It doesn't even matter if you do damage. If your in a town with guards and you exploit the terrain to get somewhere they can't. You can/will get a warning/ban.
---
Note: Just because the OP is melee doesn't excuse him.
---
Looks like he fucked up and mixed the names, then got embarrassed and hung up
---
It really wasn‚Äôt THAT funny. Plus he could‚Äôve charged your pet then intercepted you and smashed your skull in but he was being pacifist since he didn‚Äôt expect to get trolled by a lower level, so you kinda just look like the asshole from taking advantage of him when he‚Äôs letting you live in the first place.
---
This sounds great, would be nice to see some actual evidence tho.
---
I skip to the stuff you need for quests and run dungeons when I need to grind
---
You should just go subtlety instead
---
Who gives a shit though you understood what they meant just give him the fip he wants and move on. Is someone's word choice really getting you that bothered? Lol
---
People not killing every mob on their way is doing it wrong.
---
just in case you never got an answer
---
conjured items disappear 15 mins after logout
---
I love seeing low lvl toons and trading them an item i take for granted that i know will change their life. Like i just upgraded my 14 slot to a 16 slot. Open trade with a random lowbie in Razor hill and give then a 14 slot bag. Off sets me killing every lowbie ally who runs past me in WPL sorry for everyone who gets Shadow word pain and devouring plague running to SM.
---
But why should the pally skip the cloth that was an upgrade just because a better item MIGHT drop?
---
So it‚Äôs so significant I should change. Which would you suggest and why?
---
I am a Murder Hobo.  
---
I have no roof to sleep under, and kill everything in my path.  
---
you want me to kill 10 boars ?! Fine ill kill all the leaving creatures around it as well !
---
Not what I was saying, and I really don't give a shit about the whole "which is harder" argument. All I'm saying is that LFR is not the faceroll people assume it is. In fact, people coming in with that assumption and ignoring every mechanic is the one thing that makes LFR take longer.
---
offended by your ignorance display, maybe
---
First site i checked had them listed as optional...  I can see that I'm going to get #metoo'd to death here so I may as well just swallow the pill, and move on.
---
Mana isn‚Äôt a limited resource. It‚Äôs actually infinite. You must be a real smooth brain trying to argue this
---
A few days ago a shaman asked in general chat whether shaman can equip Sulfuras and people were like "yes but you won't ever get it" and he didn't understand why. He thought he'd just have to go into MC enough times and roll for it...
---
Wait what really? Climbing on arena/buildings in Gadgetzan and killing people is an exploit???? You can get banned for this?
---
NA Kurrinax server. Guild Stack and Die is recruiting for our 2nd raid group. Message Lamps in game for invite. We raid Tuesday and Thursdays 7-10pm server time. Only requirement for application is we ask that you are at least level 45-50 or higher.
---
You BiS is your BiS but an upgrade is an upgrade. Love how everyone wants to pigeon hole paladins into healing but when they roll on caster gear suddenly they shouldn‚Äôt be going for caster gear...
---
I'm a 35 frost mage. I've got a single target build but I'd really like to switch to an AOE build for fun. How's PvPing with an AOE build?
---
Gotta love players like that one lol
---
Im skin Herb
---
I did all he says
---
Im at 51 with only 160g
---
&gt;Swiftthistle, Fadeleaf, Liferoot
---
they sell for less than 2g on my server
---
I don't play rogue, but your BiS gear likely gets you to critcap without the talent. If that is the case increasing your crit further is unlikely to increase your damage much.
---
i've done it in twice the past, I know it's not easy. But I'm a huge spender (consumables, crafting, recipes...) and don't enjoy too much grinding or AH games, so I'm always short on gold. Dreadsteed is a nice goal I can look forward to and it's still considerably cheaper than the racial one. I don't think the next phase is that far.
---
Lol its cos im level 58 at the moment, and just dawned on me like...what if all of this is a waste later down the line when im at work and cant even do the later content like get naxx geared etc, so thought whether i should stay on classic or move to another game where it doesn't require ridiculous hours to get the best gear
---
yojamba best oce server change my mind
---
The worst part is that he didn't make a gm joke. times have changed.
---
I have a full time job, and I am going to university full time and I also live my girlfriend (she plays though) and we both hit 59 last night.
---
Edit: replied to the wrong comment. Was trying to respond to the comment about how if 1/20 is easy then you have no life.
---
how much did 300 engineering cost
---
I might be remembering wrong but I thought I saw a blue post saying they would not be re-distributing loot under any circumstance, so it might have just been a bot response. It‚Äôs sad if they‚Äôre going to help in cases like these where there‚Äôs a glitch though.
---
No dishonorable kills?  Everything must die!
---
I swear those Badlands drops are insane. I walked away from an hour of questing with a bag full of greens.
---
No that is a thing that happens in OW. People will report you for playing a hero, if it's a really unpopular one and get reported a lot you will get chat banned. Happens all the time, even to people who literally never type or communicate at all.
---
This is the mentality that I'll ahve to adopt...  =]  have an upvote
---
Can someone be helpful and check if this is just for me?
---
Sorry bro I would immediately but I'm stuck at work :D Cannot Access the Website and/or Launcher right now :/
---
I can check when I get back in like 2 hrs :3
---
I mean, the GM's point was about "terrain exploitation" - not spamming DOTs on people.  He said "you were up there, so you **also** get a warning," meaning the guy you reported did too.  Were you up there?  You seem to indicate that you might have been ("is simply wall jumping an offense? Even if I was just...exploring up there and didnt fight anyone?").  
---
From what I can tell, you reported someone for spamming DOTs in a glitched place, but you might have gone up there too, so someone reported you.  If you did go up there, that could be "terrain exploitation" since that is not an intended path.
---
That's not a nelf.
---
My priest is only level 19 atm, from what I have read I needed to take 5/5 spirit tap and 5/5 wand and then continue in the shadow tree for questing or in disc for pvp/dungeons, not sure how reliable the guide on IV is. 
---
Figured if ima be wanding a bunch to help conserve mana may as well find out if I can turn it into my AA some how
---
After reading through the updated ToS from June 19 2018 i can see anything in there about cross faction collusion. This was a quick read though so it is possible i missed something or misinterpreted it.
---
Because in the US, DD is a cup size that's synonymous with big tits. While a "DD" produces DPS, so it's not that crazy or convoluted to understand.
---
Mage, warlock?
---
People forgetting to repair before the instance and having their equip break mid run.
---
Controlled chaos can be fun if all involved are somewhat skilled and know each other. Uncontrolled chaos, with people set on getting done as fast as possible, usually turns into one or more of the party members no having much fun.
---
The only time a healer would oom faster keeping tanks alive is if the tank is under leveled and getting hit with crushing blows regularly. Until you get to max (or near-max), tank‚Äôs don‚Äôt really gain boatloads of hp quickly. So either a tank is underleveled as well, or the healer has abysmally outdated/bad gear
---

He says, she says. What are Blizzard employees supposed to do, listen to you repeat it wasn't you and that it was Xyz, and then take a side? Both of you were reported, get on with it.
---
i remeber seeing the icon that looks like a sling-shot but i cant seem to find out where it is located.
---
Looks like you're going to have to reroll
---
I‚Äôve spec‚Äôed full into prot, I‚Äôm excited to get shield slam in 3 levels!  I use a sword and board as all my talents really take advantage of that shield.  Have actually gotten really positive feedback from healers saying it was so nice being able to heal someone who went prot, so that makes me think it does make a difference!
---
^ he‚Äôs right 
---
It‚Äôs BIS for mitigation for the rest of the game.
---
I have an auction addon (Auctionator I think) so total time spent looking for any item under the specified price is about 15 seconds per item.

Besides, that was just one example. I have a list of about 20 items (at the minute). I'll use the time where I cannot fully commit to proper grinding or questing, for example when I'm waiting for my kid to fall asleep at bed time (he's 3 and a half so up about 4 thousand times between being put to bed and actually falling asleep) or cooking dinner, or when I'm not fully able to play for other reasons (carpal tunnel flare ups), to sit and scour the AH for stuff I can make a profit from.
---
In addition, some items are a much lower drop rate (light hides have a roughly 50% drop/loot rate from Wolfguard Worg in SFK, but on average under 0.3% from skinning everything else that would normally give light leather). I could run to SFK and farm them which would take a heck of a lot longer to **maybe** get some than it would going to the AH and seeing if they have any.
---
sure, with more information available it becomes easier. but it doesn't speak for the skill of the individual. and yes its the norm for competing guilds. but its still not the norm for the average guild member. there is still a whole lot who hardly do any research.
---
Understaffed to hell i guess
---
Missing a mythic+ timer is worse than wiping in UBRS even if trash respawns.
---
...and 10+ horde fighting over the limited spawns.
---
No, conjured items only disappear if you‚Äôve been logged out for longer than 15 mins.
---
Except paid transfers existed in vanilla
---
I must be really stupid but I fail to understand how this would play out in the game? Do you have any example of a game where this "action combat" is the default preset?
---
As an SPriest... the pain is real without a friendly mage. I‚Äôll give you stam, fear ward, shadow protection, please just let me get some sweet H2O!!
---
Mage. Cast frostbolt, profit.
---
its combat rogue. sinister strike, slice and dice, thats it. 2 buttons to do 90% of max theoretical damage up to raids. very good damage output for that rotation. survivability is vanishing and let your dungeon group die
---
Maybe its just Horde players, but i've been playing in one of the most allyance heavy servers and its been smooth as shit. Most allys i just run up to them and /wave and they let me be.
---
Play what you feel like. Im going 30 0 21, and it has been fine levelling and grouping with people for dungeons.
---
Swords are king not because they have better damage and speed, but because realistically speaking blizzard hated dagger rogues and every quest that gives a blue weapon favors swords  outlaw, omen, the SM sword, thrashet... it's an easy upgrade path. Daggerinos have to upgrade once every 10 levels or so, spamming dungeons to get a pair of good ones.
---
With that said, if you're feeling like you do fine then please continue to be yourself. I'm 44 and it's great.
---
Ticketing systems can hold data pretty much from the time they are created until &lt;insert end of creation scenario here&gt;.
---
It's cause GM's don't actually play the game lol
---
It depends.
---
For Rogue you'll replace Devilsaur in MC already. It's not worth buying. It performs slightly better than other options.
---
Sure if you are going to keep devilsaur until late BWL or AQ for some classes then bite the bullet, but actually compare how long BIS is going to last and how much a difference it's going to ultimate make.
---
The current content doesn't require full BIS.
---
thanks
---
You suck.
---
 "Priests in Russia..." they where drunk AF to come up with that genius idea . 
---
Just saying..
---
XD wow.
---
You'll eventually need to grind some at some point so always killing mobs in between locations is more efficient because it's more xp earned between quests and it's less tedious than just grinding because you're still moving forward between locations.
---
Late to the party, but [here is my first GM interaction](https://imgur.com/a/C9q6T) :)
---
Used to be badass CS.
---
fuck this cleave thing, foreal
---
you already play ridiculous hours
---
I'm sorry that the game isn't as challenging as people remember it being? 
---
AE groups are popular because the content is so easy it can be farmed like that. 
---
It's not the current playerbase's fault that the original WoW players from 15 years ago were so fucking bad at the game. 
---
Whats next? Are you going to be upset that people stopped wearing fire resist for Ragnaros? Are we supposed to stick to outdated and honestly terrible strategies just to help you feel nostalgic? 
---
Know whats not fun? Spending 2 hours in SM Cathedral because your group insists on CCing 2 mobs per pull and drinking to full mana after every group.
---
The fuck are you on about?
---
...because?
---
(chuckle) "RP effectively" is in the eyes of the beholder, very subjective.  You can pick it up as you go.
---
On grobb-horde, there are starting to be weekly meetings where you pray to the earth mother and discuss history.  Aimed more at Tauren (my favorite race), but there's also an all-troll guild on Grobby.
---
If only they gave you an option to play more than just 1 character on one server. So many friendships ruined because we can't have fun together if we have to start new characters! Dear Blizzard!
---
Stack from a vender cost me 1g, I'll happily tip 25s per stack in a group.
---
The argument is more...
---
'It'll be fine if you bring me along, I will be able to do my job and I won't be dead weight; unlike if I were a tank or DPS'
---
It's an amazing dungeon. Ran it for a bunch of levels! You just need to go north east of south shore and hop along the islands, come out to the west of under city, and walk to SM.
---
If you move at half speed dodging is way harder.
---
Should be under the beast mastery skill paige. Away from computer so cant check unfortunately
---
I'm sure those GMs are really busy. He probably just wanted to quickly move on and warn the right person so he could get to the next issue he had to attend to, instead of doing a back and forth of "oh sorry I guess I had the wrong person" "it's fine, the right person is X" "thank you I'll go to him now, sorry again" blah blah. Classic is popular atm, so I have no doubt the GMs are spammed with a TON of issues to deal with as well.
---
Iirc, druids are flat out better in early phases but will always be good. Particularly as offtanks. Even when warriors are generally better, I'd take 3 warriors 1 druid every time over 4 warriors
---
like i said i dont know wow but how is it possible to tank and do dps at the same time ?
---
If only Blizzard created servers where PvP could be toggled off...
---
Won't they get half of the gold/silver drops just for being in party?
---
Only thing I can get out of this is "2 sunders on each mob" - behave yourself tbh
---
The horde protects their own.
---
That low key shade that some how he only beat you because he used his CDs and that means you didn't really lose.
---
Vanilla raiding is easy mode tbh.  The real challenges and time sinks didn't start until BC.
---
I see, okay thanks. Could you give me a bit more information the 3rd party mouse software? Is it like just an addon like from curse that can do it or is it something else entirely?
---
How did you get through the queues???
---
They also lowered the cap of scholo/strat from 10man down to 5man
---
Friend of mine did it for a day and got a 3 day ban. However nowadays Blizzard probably knows *everything* people do.
---
Disliked Druid for long, then I rolled one to see what they can do (on retail was a Rogue main), but Druid, man it's awesome, it's the most Fantasy class you can play and it can do everything, I'm lvling one on Classic at the moment and don't care at all for the meta which I never did for the last 13 yrs I played wow.
---
You"ll be fine
---
Not players afaik, only mobs
---
super helpful.  i've just been burning all my rage on heroic strike since it's all I really have so far and it doesn't feel like a particularly strong use of my rage.  I'll give this a shot next time I level the warrior.
---
It should be as easy as making every line "/equip &lt;item&gt;", right!
---
My wife was complaining about mages (one kept tagging her mobs in Raven Hill Cemetery last night) and wondered why mages are all assholes.  I told her that in Classic, mages have the most tools to be assholes with so they attract a disproportionate amount of assholes.
---
Apologies to all the kind, considerate and good players out there playing as a mage.  You are valued!  You're just stuck in the class with the assholes at the moment.
---
You might find herding a lot more difficult compared to in PvE. People tend to sidestep AoEs and spread out.
---
theres no point in downranking concentration because it doesnt save you mana. 
---
rank 1 deals 64 damage and costs 135 mana. if you divide the damage by mana, it deals 64/135 = .47 damage per mana point
---
rank 5 deals 384 damage and costs 565 mana. it deals 384/565 = .67 damage per mana point. 
---
and every rank inbetween is always more mana efficient then the previous rank. you should always be using the highest rank
---
it also lets you regenerate more mana. you would have to cast rank 1 4 times which takes 32 seconds to deal as much damage as a single rank 5. alternatively, you could just cast rank 5 once and then afk for 32 seconds which lets you regenerate more mana for the exact same damage and threat
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt I criticize the brain dead baseline content? That‚Äôs 90% of the content. That‚Äôs the main issue I have with retail. I don‚Äôt want to go through 90% of a game having no fun to get to the part I can enjoy. 
---
I know why they made the game that way but it completely ruined it for me. Classic is a different experience and one I am enjoying so far.
---
It‚Äôs significantly better for leveling...and pve dps - esp at low gear levels
---
Well, im a priest so i usually just switch to healer gear at the start of the instance anyway :)
---
people will take any opportunity to shit on people
---
lots of FYI information here
---
Yes, I am informed about that and I know it will. Though currently it gives no benefits.
---
He said "not overly resource hungry" and then you list the 2 classes I see go OOM after every single pull in dungeons lol
---
Wait you're not shitting me mate? So I don't need a slow mainhand for maximum ambush damage?
---
I usually pay a gold for 2 stacks if i get from a mage. They're usually pretty happy about it, takes them 30 sec to make 1 gold, and I leave them with a few buffs. Priest here.
---
Naxx is a time sink. I cleared it in vanilla with a very good guild.
---
It requires gear. If you can get in a guild that clears aq and is prepped, or is willing to farm naxx no problem. Naxx broke a lot of guilds back in the day... the majority of my guildies had jobs but light other responsibilities. I know the private server meta has changed some stuff but I‚Äôll be very curious to see how it changes naxx raiding.
---
I'm glad everyone has been told not to pick Ench/Tailor because that's what I did and I'm at a profit. Selling Greater Magic Wands has paid for my training and then some!
---
Some people have said Gearmenu before, but I didnt really get it to work when i tried it a few days ago.
---
ok, yeah im at work so i also can tcheck.
---
ill take a look tonight. thanks.
---
Let's hope cleaving retardness won't be a thing at lvl 60 dungeon farming then.
---
I heard they heard they have severe mana issues later on
---
I've had this same bug happen to me in BRD, luckily it was on an item I didn't need anyway.
---
That I understand. It was even in the post. But  car is also a car and not a mph. :P
---
&gt; apes in northern STV
---
Which ones specifically? Mistvale Gorilla 32-33?
---
Same exact place, only difference in the entire questline is that the follow up where you go to IF is in UC instead.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=728](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=728)
---
I don't know your origin story, you are just an actively shitty person.  It's okay,  awful people can do well in the world.  You just should know you suck and bum people out when you talk.
---
I play a warrior and when I got WW axe, stuff just *melted*.
---
Same thing when I upgraded from Gatorbite to Blackrock Slicer. That thing does WORK.
---
I was running Mara with a mage who would blast the mobs and start aoeing as soon as I charged in. The first time he died I told him there is no way I can hold any aggro when he does that but he didn't seem to care and neither did the healer. He probably died 20 or so time in three princess runs and wanted to keep going.
---
PVP servers are great while the first generation levels to max. But eventually wpvp will become stale and begin to die off as phase 3 nears.
---
*le cry*
---
No that was introduced in cata I think? Could be wrong but I know in classic you can‚Äôt trade bop items at all
---
If you get most of the set your looks increase your damage tho
---
‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt up there‚Äù... ‚ÄúI was up there‚Äù
---
I've watched three different streamers down her with zero deep breaths.  She's clearly not working as designed, I've seen groups get her into phase 2 before the tank even gets her in place, maybe that's causing issues?
---
Rage potion saves lives.
---
What's the going rate for some arcane intellect?
---
Yes you can do it at 16
---
Probably not too hard just spam LFG in org 
---
No you can‚Äôt solo it
---
You can walk all the way up to south-east corner of undercity following the shore line, and from there you can walk next to the outside wall of undercity all the way around. No need to swim at all. It's still way slower than going from western plaguelands flight path if you only die a few times.
---
I'm on Gandling EU horde. I never go into a fight unless I see own hordies getting attacked.
---
See you in Stranglethorn.
---
Sry for the noob question but what makes this staff good? I see average stats and decent dps...
---
i love the quest too
---
so much so that I didn't pay anything and grinded them myself
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Transfer
---
Put shoot on an action bar and assign it to right click?
---
On a PVP server you will definitely get a lot of ally harassment. 
---
Depending on your server, the 'battle of hillsbrad' quest chain is a lot of grinding and there are generally groups pulling all kinds of mobs there, so dynamic respawn can help you get tags quicker.  Plus there's so many horde, it can be handy if you're overwhelmed to run and people might help you out. 
---
I wonder what class you are?  What class you are impacts the equation of "is grinding worth it".  Also comes down to playstyle.  I like grinding but some people get put to sleep.
---
I didn‚Äôt know you lose your mana forever. I could have sworn that it regenerates or you can use an item that you conjure up to regenerate it faster. Is this a hunter problem or something? Please inform me
---
Do you have video evidence of this? It would pretty much prove she's broken.. Please escalate this.
---
It's fine but nowhere near as powerful as Escape Artist which has a 1 Min CD while Perception is a 3 Min CD. I would still prefer Stoneform over Perception if you are comparing 3 min CD racials.
---
Theldurin the Lost in the Badlands gives The Solution to Doom, which is the first quest. He is all the way to the southern edge of the Badlands, in the middle.
---
I was in a WC group last night, the 4th I had attempted. Previous groups had all imploded partway through over foolish pulls.  By some miracle everybody followed the tank and was cautious, and things were going really smoothly.  We all knew we were in a good group and were just enjoying it, when suddenly the tank said "if anybody drops group min-run I will hunt you down".  LOL
---
All that time and effort for a bar and half.
---
You should try a RP-PVP server. Community at ZT (EU RP-PVP) seems way more relaxed, at least on the horde side.
---
Each rank of mind control only works on certain levels.  For example rank one only works on targets up to level 44.
---
is this taking a picture with your cell phone thing just a meme that isn't going away now?
---
I've had great luck fishing Mirkfallon lake in Stonetalon. Started around level 25ish and made about 30 gold in a day. Thanks for sharing this new spot!
---
I see you're having a bad day. Talk to me when you're in a better mood. In the meantime, play some WoW, eat chocolates and piss off, you wanker.
---
I leveled solo as ret and did dungeons as ret from 1-54 before I went prot to grind for a few levels. Ret is outclassed even in leveling dungeons post 30, and I never did a single spellcleave run (despite people asking me to just throw on int gear and heal them).
---
I literally stated later in the post I wouldn't deny a ret an invite because they are ret. I am not sure what you're trying to prove with your reply. Ret in vanilla is pure shit.
---
I'm glad it worked out for you
---
I have it happen at sm, Badlands and ZF normally
---
This is why I don't heal or tank anymore.
---
Lol mage gameplay in raids is so boring, frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt....
---
\* Poof \*
---
Wut? I'm guessing this makes sense if OP hadn't deleted his shit.
---
Go Shek Farm in Arathi from 34 on, you can do pulls of 20 Mobs+ there.
---
Considering a bulk of people around the area were mass teleported, and from his wording, I'm guessing he swooped in ingame and just shotgunned everyone remotely in the area. Which I guess makes sense but comes off as lazy. But what can ya do.
---
Sorry lol I work thirds, just had got off not too long ago üòÇ doing my morning ritual of helping newbies with actual answers before the toxic trolls come through :/ the LearnToPlay crowd
---
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but it seems like OP is admitting he was also on top of the terrain and that his defense is just ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt the one casting dots?‚Äù
---
Implying I'm straight out saying it.
---
Please inform me how I can get more mana without investing other resources.
---
When a whole party brings Stratholme holy water to the dungeon.
---
there is literally a key on your keyboard dedicated to taking screenshots and puts them in a nice little folder for you
---
Take a look on wowhead, they use censusplus to get some server stats. It's more accurate than a pollo, and while there's no oficial numbers...
---
Yes, but the statistics will get more and more unreliable as time goes on because blizzard made a change to the addon-interface that basically broke the Addon (CensusPlusClassic) that was used to generate these statistics about a week ago.
---
It gets better once you get past ZF.
---
ST and Mauradon don't work well with mass AOE.
---
Oh great I can stop getting more int and spirit since I have infinite fucking mana now, and nobody needs water anyway because it‚Äôs infinite! You‚Äôve solved the world of manacraft!
---
DPS warrior tank simply by turning on Defensive Stance, and spamming abilities. That will be sufficient for most of the game. Slap on a shield if you want to be extra safe about it.
---
Your warrior class skills, and DPS gear are sufficient for tanking.
---
People only specialize at/near the level cap, and you can always pay a fee (small at first) to respecialize.
---
 You got a temp, blizzard does a lot of temp hiring and retains the ones who are ok.
---
Yeah they wont do good dmg in raids. 
---
They are only brought into raids for the shadow dmg buff they bring. 
---
But if you want survivability it doesnt get much better than a shadow priest. 
---
I hate running into them in the world. They always kill me and I feel like I have no chance when fighting them.
---
&gt; Bloodscalp tusks CAN be done at 30 alone
---
maybe by people more skilled than I am, then. I have never been able to kill mobs higher level than I am, as a leveling warrior. Only once I got the monastery axe could I finally solo mobs up to a couple levels above mine, but I still have to use of the tools of my arsenal, and a potion, so definitely nowhere close to being able to farm mobs equal level to +2, just it became possible thanks to that axe.
---
Farming level 33 to 35 solo at level 30 was just literally impossible, I would die to the first one.
---
Thank you for your concern about my ui, I know it can be alot to take in for the non-average person. It's good you feel comfortable with the default ui blizzard provides :)
---
What do you mean you didn't know it didnt hit the entire room? Don't pass your lack of raid intelligence off on the community...
---
This post is borderline making me angry with its misinformation. Every single kill we ever had involved a deep breath with minimal deaths. What are you talking about?
---
It was common knowledge on how to handle deep breaths..
---
&gt; How should a shaman behave and which abilities he should/shouldn't use to adjust his threat gen in these lower levels where Warrs don't have the spec nor the abilities for our highest end threat gen.
---
They shouldn't really worry about it; a shaman tanking a mob for a little while in between taunts isn't the end of the world. Don't stress about it. Warriors are completely gimped at low levels and simply do not generate enough rage to generate the threat needed. But thankfully it's nothing that's going to wipe you. just keep taunting and mocking blow-ing intelligently
---
That wasn't the goal of private servers at all.
---
Yes it does, and that is why you are being downvoted. The reason Blizzard said they can temporarily up the server cap, but it won't be sustainable is as shown in following diagram i made:
---
https://ibb.co/DgjszJC
---
Spreading the player base reduces the strain on the server. If they remove layering, the population becomes more dense. As a result they have to lower the server cap,
---
Where's my cringey yet endearing roleplay entrance?!
---
That's it, gotta watch the whole movie.
---
lol, hey... im not sharing it with anyone b/c it's what I like... I like having the hard separation and the black helps my eyes with reading chat
---
Im glad to hear its only me than who has that problem with Group maybe its cuz i wanted to dps lol
---
Def doesn‚Äôt the set bonus is for life drain and mana drain, pets mana, and reduced spell mana costs. None of that expect maybe the 8 piece is decent.
---
Yeah, WoW's "Turtle" model being a tortoise and then being used for amphibian/aquatic creatures has always been a pet peeve of mine. Do those legs really look like they are designed for swimming?
---
Jeez I've made about 4-5 characters all of which are in the 12-15 range minus my first character which is a 22 mage. I feel shitty enough that I've repeated Barrens so many times but I must be slow as shit if your characters are all 40+ lmao.
---
Hopefully now that you transferred the warrior will be your go to! You've got a good chunk of the grind done already, I would go ahead and get him to 60 and then see how you feel :)
---
Depends lol, on a friday / saturday I can stay up all night since I dont have work the next day.... but on a sunday-thurs where I have work the next day, id probably max stay up until midnight or else ill feel like shit at work :-/
---
It has been a while since I used a solution like this myself but it was with a Logitech mouse and their gaming software. Through that program I made the left mouseclick-button similar to hiting "A" on a keyboard.
---
That was for a different game than WoW but it would be possible to bind "Shoot" to "Z" for example and rebind the mouseclick buttons to "Z" through that program.
---
To pile on, Dv√§rg and Dv√§rgar being singular and plural in Swedish, probably pronounced very similar.
---
To all mages defence, casting frostbolt is fucking boring for a whole dungeon. sometimes you just wanna get that shatter fix, ya dig?
---
Ha, 1s is nothing. Dudes have been charging 1 Gold for 60 on org.
---
Come dire maul you can farm lashers instanced. Need 6k mana and Holy Nova. 50g/h.
---
To each his own I guess.  Playing a hunter/Druid/shaman it‚Äôs not that bad because you have travel forms/aspect.
---
But idk the way I went about it felt smooth where as my friend who had his leveling guide with an integrated profession guide, that he swore by, who fell waaaaay behind in both level and professions.  He got ahead in professions early but then hit a wall
---
If he hadn't joined a party or had full bags this 100% wouldn't have happened either.
---
I prefer to be the healer in dungeons and raids, but a Rogue alt for a few hours of fun every now and again will be perfect.
---
Asking for a friend, what folder does it go to automatically?
---
Was it a hunter or rogue?
---
I'm a true mage.
---
I frostbolt, then I frostbolt, then I frostbolt, and if I feel dangerous I may even frostbolt.
---
rly ? I think its the opposite dude
---
Ya, ironically I had that post up in another tab before this happened to me...
---
ive been giving mages 1g for 60/60 food/water. it's still way cheaper than the vendor
---
Got my mount at 43. Didn't train a lot of skills until after i got mount though.  I'm a hunter. Use cheap ammo too. I skinned everything. Just had no lucky drops to sell.
---
I don't even have HS on my hotkeys.  Not only does it cost rage, it consumes and auto attack which you need for rage gen.  Sunder Armor is a must even while soloing.
---
As a one-off, its fine but not as something you do everyday.
---
You can start RFC as early as lvl 13. You can find a group easy just join the /world, /lfg, and /LookingforGroup channels. No it is not soloable. Virtually no dungeon in this game is soloable at the level of the dungeon. Except one exception being that hunters can solo Dire Maul North. Other than that you will never be able to solo a dungeon without being like 20+ lvls higher than the dungeon. Even then it is only really possible as a Hunter, Warlock, Paladin, and maybe Spriest.
---
Never!
---
Priest or mage.
---
Priests can use shields to mitigate damage
---
Mages can make their own food and water to lower downtime 
---
.................
---
It was pronounced something they were bugged about enough that they finally allowed it. Like when the first time the game was released they had ‚Äúmeeting stones‚Äù to meet people who want to do a dungeon with. They later changed them to summoning stones. As soon as classic was released everyone lfg was basically demanding to be summoned.
---
It hurts so bad
---
You said to pull bigger and CC, which negates the point of pulling big and nerds the efficiency of the aoe spells of the dps. If you have to reduce the pull size when you pull big, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs boring wasting 30 seconds between every pull instead of chain pulling after a few sips.
---
Exactly, which is why your method is boring. A healer shouldn‚Äôt be going oom keeping people alive on most pulls, since they should rarely be needing to pump flash heals to save a dps‚Äôs life. Most mobs don‚Äôt destroy people that fast outside of raids. If they spike low (often due to frost nova pinning mobs who then turn to the closest), you can save them with a flash then use your more efficient bigger heals. It really doesn‚Äôt have a large impact on mana.
---
If you‚Äôre in groups that the healer is going oom on every pull, that‚Äôs a player skill issue on the healer. They need to learn triage and how to use their efficient spells moreso than there‚Äôs a need to stop aoe.
---
That's a tank druid. The armor on this is invaluable.
---
Lmao yesterday i was debating with people that said they'd never take shadow priests with them ***in dungeons*** let alone raids and let alone hardcore guild raids. Apparently people think you're wasting everyone's time and you're a selfish prick if you play specs like shadow priest and you deserve not getting a spot because you don't want to play the meta spec...
---
GM's won't help with that anyway. You invited the guy to your guild.
---
See I wondered that, there are so many mixed "reviews" on the best routes to go for warrior questing. But I guess having the WW axe will make it so I can more efficiently quest yellow mobs
---
Come back! The Horde needs you.
---
If you're playing classic to clear content as fast as possible, you don't need to  be playing classic. You can clear the content faster in retail, it exists there as well in case you or others didn't know that.
---
I mean, if that's how their guild rolls, then I guess he might.  But I imagine there would be some pretty pissed off people from that one.
---
People weren‚Äôt and aren‚Äôt spamming dungeons like they are talked about here or anywhere else. People are using scripts to cancel events and summon mobs. Spamming dungeons in the traditional sense IS still slower. GY/BRD event exploiting is why it‚Äôs so fast.
---
When you proc Arcane Concentration and get a free spell.... Might as well blizzard 2 mobs
---
report the report hehe
---
Fish them now then sell them in the spring/summer time.
---
One ticket down, 20,000 to go.
---
He totally owned me with that.
---
All drinking after every damn pull...
---
Achktually...thorns doesn't stack with fire shield.
---
Make sure you have a voidwalker up and pop the shield, get a fear off and dot up.    That's your only hope.    Death coil helps
---
I have some time when waiting for friends that I‚Äôll use search for pools on the coast of Ferelas or STV
---
Thing is im not interested in raids at all, my main interest lies in PvP. But in vanilla you need to do raids to get the best gear which will make me competitive in PvP, so its pretty much compulsory that I do them lol
---
Wow. What a douche
---
Except cleaving dungeons as a fresh 60 is almost impossible to do efficiently.
---
No no, please, tell me how those questions, even if sarcastic, are relevant to the current discussion.
---
Gnomer mace still BiS according to Skarmtank. The TPS is insane with it.
---
did ubrs with 5 mages today and im not gonna lie, im glad i wasnt tanking that hot mess.  almost wiping on the last packs before final boss before they realised its easy as hell to just sheep 3 of the orcs
---
When an item in an instance drops, do you ask the party if anybody needs it, or if their loot window is bugged and they cant see the item drop, before hitting greed?
---
No, you hit greed and move on. This comment is hilariously stupid, and could have been avoided if you thought about it for 5 seconds before posting.
---
Any form of warning for something you didn‚Äôt do is pretty bad. 
---
If the GM is this flippant and stupid while dealing with this issue, I would hate to see what he was like when dealing with a more serious issue.
---
&gt; Trifling gnome. His arrogance was his undoing!

---
Or get up there after you aggro them..
---
What's not computing? 
---
Besides, rules are best kept global, by saying NO ONE is allowed up there it avoids confusion for players.
---
Comprehending now?
---
If my tiny brain figured it out in 5 seconds, I can't understand how you couldn't? With your vast intellect, this shouldn't of required further discussion.
---
But here we are.
---
I have a 23 troll rogue and I keep thinking about restarting as an undead rogue because it'd be just a bit better but a big waste of time
---
I've ran into a similar bug. Can I ask you, are you sending in your pet to attack? I noticed when leveling, that when my succubus went to attack, if I landed my immolate right as she was attacking that it happened more frequently. My solution was to either let the pet get the initial attack off first, or also turning off pain-lash also seemed to help.
---
I reported it awhile back, but no idea if anything will ever come of it.
---
Your complete lack of perspective here is actually putting a smile on my face.  Remember when you were a dismissive jerk to a lame GM situation for no reason and got called out for it and acted like more of an asshole?
---
I meant watered-down...ahhh shit.
---
That's how language evolves, though. This happens with all words all the time.
---
Welp shamans dont have CD moves. He used bubble and the one where he heals himself instantly. 
---
Also aside from that there is not much skill involved in a fight between a level 25 shaman vs. Level 25 paladin. Both are just doing auto attacks.
---
Me too bruv :(
---
As a 60 mage, I am really glad that demo shout/roar was fixed. I'm still not a fan of how strong and easy AoE is in dungeons. There's something satisfying about polymorphing a target every pull. 
---
And there's nothing worst than when a party member pulls multiple packs and assumes a mage can solo AoE it down when half of the pack have guns/bows or casts spells.
---
Can recommend Argent Dawn friendly reputation for lategame water/food (no real effort to reach, just quest in plaguelands with AD Commision trinket on). They sell superior food(2,2k)+water(4,4k) in one item (60s / 5pcs i believe).

---
I believe the AV biscuits (in Phase 3) are better, but didn't find better refreshment in Phase 1 so far.
---
Read the post, OP says it was an honest mistake.  Getting pissy and leaving a group because people still are not experts at the game in the teen levels is just childish.  OP also says they already apologized for that.  So yes,at this point they have nothing to apologize for.
---
Edit: and you know that cloak would just be replaced by Fenrus Hide in a few levels.  No BiS dropping in WC.
---
Wasting.... 10s of the mages time to enable an efficient run. 
---
Next time you turn up I hope you come prepared with a scroll of stamina... Wouldn't wanna waste the priests time would you? ;)

---
Oh I get it for the greys actually a smart move. I‚Äôm gonna promote that in my guild runs :)
---
A good, well geared combat rogue will give you basically the same clear speed as a mage, since it has no down time and after 40 it has the most insane burst clear ability in the game.
---
Nice list, do you know of one for EXP per hour tracking?
---
I know it sounds like a simple Addon that already exists.. but I downloaded 3 and none of them worked.
---
There's really no reason to make every druid in a guild resto.
---
It may not be a fight that's worth having, but if you're willing to give up Natural Weapons/OOC to get some of the HT talents in resto, ferals' mana pool from HotW is absolutely bonkers.  
---
Having a bear or two floating around for MC in case your warriors [really don't want to tank](https://i.imgur.com/42SUpes.jpg) isn't a terrible idea.  And unless you have to decurse you might just convince them to let you tank trash / hang out in cat form for LotP.
---
Hang on to any Atal'ai spaulders you happen to snag in ST, just in case. :D
---
Thanks!!
---
US or EU?
---
The EU GMs have a tendency to be terrible.
---
That's a 'no' for me dawg.
---
I gave up on checking, had to guess, easily well over 4 days (mid twenties atm).
---
I'm having an amazing time, love the game, LOVE THE COMMUNITY!!! lots of rp, wpvp, fishing, cooking, dungeons, siege raids, crafting, harvesting, so many fun activities which have nothing to do with actual leveling 
---
That...
---
/played becomes irrelevant
---
How close are yah? You'll get it soon dw
---
We are only like 5 weeks in. Rerolling late would be like Phase 4.
---
Do you man, you have plenty of time.
---
Cool stuff, no problems! Good luck in RFC (lvl 12+) and barrens!
---
Is this a nerfed version of Onyxia? I remember the fight having a lot more deep breaths back in the day lol
---
I have a 40 human warrior, 47 undead priest and a 36 orc warrior. Happens to the best of us.
---
Better to re roll now, 1-40 can be done in a few days played, then start playing at max and gearing or pvping and realizing you don't enjoy it.
---
Fuck this guy.
---
As a mage in classic I would like to apologize for him, we aren't all that bad... Sure, some of us may groan and roll our eyes when we see 1 or 2 mobs pulled but we also understand "hey, not everyone has AoE out the \*\*\* and not everyone is able to keep up with us and our dmg+free food+free water+free "bubble"+free mana.
---
Nice,I was just there questing
---
Maybe you played too much and overleveled 90% of the playerbase? So yeah it may feel empty.
---
DPS is a blanket term, a car is something specific. It's not a truck, it's not a motorcycle, it's not a semi. They're all automobiles just like how all mages, hunters, warlocks, rogues, etc are dps.
---
Seems like your typical blizzard GMs at work, they have been handling all my cases just as badly for the past few years...
---
and you'll never see it again. Sorry to hear this.
---
Just out of curiosity, which roof is this being done from? Booty bay, or Gadget is the mental image I‚Äôm getting
---
If you are in a guild or have some friends that are higher level than you I'd suggest asking them if you could borrow what's left for your mount when you are closing in on 40. You'll have it back to the within 2-3 levels and most of the times players at level 50+ won't mind being down 40-60 gold for a bit. At least I don't, I've borrow gold to 3 of my friends and currently have 60g borrow to a 4th friend.
---
Yup, on Bigglesworth I was selling all the different rage potions over the last week for a slight profit over selling individual mats and think I had 2 stacks of 5 sell in a week.
---
Exactly, that's why i made my own guild called &lt;Drink Vendor&gt; too bad i am in maraudon all day and got no people in.
---
Depends on mood and how much time it takes and how they ask. If they're nice and I can make more than 2 at a time I usually gift a stack for free, but if it's gonna take like 2-3 times my full mana pool to get stacks for them and have left over for myself I'll charge a fee.
---
It's easiest just before getting a new level of conjure water cause you make near 20 a time and can't make any better water anyway so quite an easy feat
---
This turned out to be it! Although the game now warns me that the Addons arent sufficiently updated even though I'm pretty sure I've downloaded the latest version. How will I know if it works? Will the  game crash or something?
---
Is it rerolling, or just saving your 37 for later like leftovers? :D
---
If you're not getting a pay rise in England within 6 months annual review it's time to report them and get a new job

Corporate America is failing you
---
What's the most fun proc-based spec in Classic, in your opinion? I always enjoy it when you feel really good for getting lucky, but not useless if you get screwed by RNG. Are there any classes/specs like this?
---
The 50s can have that make anyone feel that way. Maybe you should just take a break from the game for a while. Going hard every single day since launch sounds like a ticket to burn out.
---
Yeah the xp bar *does* remind me of a sandworm (its mainly there to gap the middle and just as tall as one bar) but most of my skills are committed to muscle memory.  I only occasionally have to glance at the skills to see the cooldowns.
---
Cause you also had a bad experience with it?
---
Powergamer ;)
---
i leveled skinning and mining to 300, went out of my way to find ore and even found some vacant farming spots for skinning that i spent 4 hours grinding at.  i had them both from level 5 to ~53. i used auctioneer from day 1 so i kept track of everything i sold. i made about 40g in total. i had around 200g at 53.
---
dropped em both for leatherworking and tailoring, leveled them both to 300 the same day and made more in profit in the first 24 hours than i had made from 1-300 skinning + mining and 48 character levels worth of gathering. 
---
bought my epic mount right when i hit 60.
---
Yea you will have plenty of time to raid inbetween content phases, especially if you are only playing one character.
---
You can do the arena at 52, not the entire dungeon ^^
---
Hey, welcome to the tank club! It‚Äôs a lot of fun! If you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôll drop a few quality of life tips.
---
1) blood rage is your best friend! Use it at the beginning of pulls to help get sunders out!
---
2) there are macro‚Äôd out there to throw up Skulls.  What I‚Äôve done is made one that puts up a skull when I start using my gun on the mob.  This will help speed up the focus firing.
---
3) when pulling a big group with non elites cast a demoralizing shout, and then a battle shout.  This will be enough threat to keep them off the healer, and the dps should be able survive/kill the non elites fast enough to really worry.
---
4) Sunder tab will be your friend! An example pull for myself will be ‚Äúshoot a mob putting up a skull &gt; blood rage &gt; sunder skull &gt; tab to another elite &gt; sunder &gt; tab to another elite &gt; sunder &gt; hopefully tab back to skull if it‚Äôs only a 3 man pull &gt; sunder &gt; auto attack to build up rage and throwing in taunts or necessary sunders till everyone is dead &gt; hope I have enough rage for the next pull.
---
5) after you get your rage management and if you want to tank sword and board I‚Äôd suggest going 11 points into prot for at least improved shield block (only ever put one point in!).  It‚Äôll help with boss damage as it allows you to block two swings and usually that‚Äôs enough to be permablocking!
---
Hope that DM got the itch going for you, tanking can be very rewarding experience!
---
Paladins can beat pretty much everyone in 1v1, the problem is everyone can just kite/runway from them.
---
 YOUR TOAST HAS BEEN BURNT AND NO AMOUNT OF SCRAPING WILL REMOVE THE BLACK PART
---
Minimum wage buys minimum effort.
---
Does anyone know if dispelling scarlet disguises on Tirion's questline is considered an exploit? One could sit in the final room and dispel anyone that comes in, essentially instantly killing them and making them run back and forth 3 more times (or take spirit res).
---
Do you have a video of this addon in action?
---
You dont have enough rage to use cry in the corner...
---
&gt; Does anyone else feel like they've gotten bored or otherwise lost interest in Classic? 
---
Nope!
---
&gt; I don't see the point in getting to 60. As I'm not interested in raiding in the slightest, I don't think there's going to be enough content at max level to keep me busy for the foreseeable future. 
---
Ok, see ya!  Don't let the, proverbial door, hit you on the way out.
---
Froztards.. not even once
---
You think playing 20-28 hours in a 48 hour period is casual.....?
---
Ret pallys are one of the strongest 1v1 classes in the game. Bubble hearth is great when its like a 4v1 or whatever.
---
Their only weakness? the W key... as anyone can just run away from them lol.
---
Hi, Pablo Pineda!
---
The worst is when someone has the mob so it's Grey for you but the mob still attacks you. So you have to kill it, but you don't get exp or drops.
---
Playing through for my first time and curious as to what dungeons are best for Mage gear? I am level 44 and I have done Uldaman and ZF a few times in the past few levels but it seems like they don't offer much. Should I do some quests for better gear or do I just level up for now and not worry about it? I got the library rod and the helmet from cathedral earlier but since then I haven't seen much?
---
Is it just me or does pretty much everything seem super, super easy compared to vanilla? We're AoE farming dungeons, pugging raids, getting legendary weapons, etc. all in *less than a month*. Our servers first Sulfuras was more than a year later and our server had several predominant world-first guilds. 
---
This isn't "classic" wow this is your typical 2019 "we'll make  everything available to everyone pretty easily WoW"
---
On that note, too, I find anyone claiming "world first" to be cringey af. It's not a world first and it's way easier than the people who actually got the world first.
---
Idk why this bothers me and yes it's stupid.
---
Really wish they hadn't released MC so undertuned, this should be a monumental moment, not something some randoms get less than a month after release. Oh well, hopefully this is addressed with BWL and released more in-line with the actual challenge.
---
And yes, I know all you retail experts are SURE that this is exactly the same difficulty as it always was...of course there's been the raid exp bug, the layering exploits, the priest shield bug, the warrior demo shout bug...but they got MC perfect right guys? Mages have just figured out how to spam frostbolt "more skillfully".
---
It's LortiUI .

---
I'm sorry to say that, but that isn't how it works. Each mob type has a strict respawn location and a strict area they can wander on their own. Who told you this bullshit?
---
The AH cut is always a flat 5% (at the Ally/Horde AH), the only thing that changes is the deposit, which you will get back in full if the item sells.
---
Dude that‚Äôs so cool
---
I had a really pleasant GM experience getting my Blizzard accounts merged. Pity that they fired half the GM staff
---
This is particularly dumb from tanks. On my warrior I /join LFG and have a group ready in 2 minutes for whatever dungeon I want to run. We tanks have no excuse for not being prepared for the whole instance.
---
I recognise the Guild names. Reminiscence did the SW raid a day or so ago.
---
I don‚Äôt charge group members but I do charge randoms asking for water in org or around the world.
---
&gt;  1 free portal
---
Thats 20 fucking silver man. Just use your hearthstone ya dicks.
---
Even in the high end dungeons, it‚Äôs not as dire as you‚Äôre trying to make it out to be. Outside of raids (or poor positioning when a nova comes), it‚Äôs not as bad as you‚Äôre trying to make it out to be. You‚Äôre jumping to the far end of hyperbole.
---
I‚Äôm the healer in many of these face roll groups, and I rarely have to sit and get a full drink off.  Often times, the amount a healer has to drink is more on their own skills with triage and keeping calm than people pulling. A mage gets attacked and they go apeshit spamming them with poor spell choice, when it‚Äôs perfectly fine to keep calm and heal slowly and save boatloads of time and mana.
---
Blame the streamers. They caused this shit show.
---
It's, William Shatner's, secret, wow account.
---
Awesome, thanks a ton!
---
PSA you low level healers aggro everything and make us wipe.
---
Ok I'll ask in chat.  Where do people meet? In front of the entrance?
---
Highest boss is 16 in rfc as I recall.  So 13 is the lowest people take.  Idk how hard it is to find a group, should just look during primetime or any hour, you'll get one.
---
Also join /join lookingforgroup.  Type that im chat and youll see groups anywhere in the game instead of using just general.
---
Amd no you cant solo, maybe in 15 20 levels if your the right class
---
The deeper i get into it the more i like it. They have a lot of spells which can seem cumbersome but not all are required, but all add some situational utility. You get several spells to drop threat, you can run 36% faster in the early 20‚Äôs. You can solo a lot of things by using your pet and traps creatively, and the hunters playstyle pairs nicely with engineering, which is my profession and the first time im leveling it. 
---
Sometimes you just get burnt out playing so whats fun is going hunter pet training. You learn new spells by taming new monsters and can add a lot to your pet. It isnt required, but its a whole little subsection of WoW only for hunters and something else to do
---
Unlike other classes, with your pet, you can kind of customize your playstyle. For example, i like to use a cat/wolf usually, but i started running some friends through deadmines and realized how squishy they were and how little AoE i had. I came back with a gorilla that knows thunderstomp and some grenades and suddenly i was viable (enough) at AoE to breeze through it
---
In general, i like the alliance for leveling more. Their earlier zones are more engaging IMO
---
At 40 go straight 31 in elemental.  Then Respec to 30/21 at 60.
---
Personally even after 40 I find enh better as long as you can keep a weapon updated
---
I went up and down that river through the northern part of STV. I believe I got very lucky in the amount I found as well as what I fished up. It was basically one trip down that full river and back, starting from that Naga area.
---
Wut?
---
Not trying to  be a troll, but... Why did u even started in Classic if not for raiding/pvp?
---
I mean.. What?
---
Anyway, im 55 and having a blast! I got pissed/bored at 20-35 but now i'm "oh boyyyy!! time to farm my bis shit!!!"
---
I'm level 41, just got my mount yesterday. We're still in phase 1. I rushed to 40 and now that I have my mount I'm going to go catch up on my professions and enjoy the ride a little more.
---
It's interesting being a fire mage and constantly getting whispers 
---
"Need 1 more for ZF spellcleave"
---
"Sure, I'm fire spec though"
---
"Ok bye"
---
I think you can talk yourself out of any video game if you distill it to the facts that it‚Äôs just moving pixels around in your screen. It can be pointless or meaningful depending on your mind set.
---
Go ahead and talk yourself out of classic if you want. It just sounds like burn out to me.
---
I'm level 48 and I consider myself "rushing" lol.  Took a week off at launch and play pretty much all day on the weekends, but I gotta work full time on weekdays and that kinda kills a lot of my playing time. And even then I still take time to level fishing and stuff. Just enjoying the scenery on my 3rd or 4th vanilla playthrough.  I can't imagine how these guys that got 60 in two weeks can play that much.
---
US or EU  server?  I wonder if there is a difference.
---
Funny because someone else said the exact opposite. I play on a quite high pop server, although in the evening it dips to medium pop. I had queues of up to 25,000 people within the first week
---
Yeah I love that sword it lasted till 50 for me
---
Cool, have fun with it! I liked all-passing on boss drops because it encouraged us to talk things out and compare who's wearing what gear already. More often than not, if two people want the same drop, one of them clearly needs it more than the other, and usually the person who needed it less would be like "Go ahead, man. Grats!"
---
So much more human and collaborative than just silently letting RNG decide, and it makes you feel better about not getting loot if you know the person who got it instead really needed it. Also, if something else drops, probably they'll let you take it because they got the last one. Really makes the group feel more like a team. Fewer hurt feels, more good feels. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I would be interested in this whenever its available!
---
So you rely solely on ambush damage ? Not finishers or anything?
---
EDIT: Before u had hemo
---
It's definitely not just one spot, at least 10+ yards of that ledge that lets them attack without guards responding. You can go closer to guards on that ledge, guards ignore you. Go out of the ledge (even in the back of the room) and guards go for you.     
---
(is this the building with vendor that sells Runecloth bag recipe, right?)
---
Ok no solo, then, gotcha.
---
Damn, that's terrible. Their support has really gone downhill. I've made several GM tickets in the past and my GM experiences have been pretty good. One guy reminisced a bit with me and sent me some savory deviate delights. What was most incredible was the guy who managed to get my whole account restored. I quit during Cata and to make sure I wouldn't come back, I deleted everything. Fast forward several years and my then-girlfriend wanted me to come play with her during WoD. I reactivated the account and made a ticket asking if I could recover my main. I expected a naked  character, as I had censored, deleted or DEd everything and put it in bank. I ended up getting all characters with their old gear end everything like a snapshot of my account a day before quitting.

It‚Äôs shit like this that‚Äôs going to make me drop my subscription again.
---
I had so much fun in vanilla, and really enjoying classic...but reading posts like this sucks some of the fun right back out of the game again.
---
ngl I would have kept it, lmao. Better man than me!
---
Just saw Tips' Deep Dive on Feral druids, now I got half a stiffy for feral tanks, thinking of rolling one.
---
Pay GMs shit money and understaff them, get shitty GMs.
---
This is Blizzard's fault.
---
Oof. As a mage I apologize for this idiot. Mages can serve many a role, aoe, pulling groups for difficult areas if tank requests, single target burst, and group control. The versatility is what makes it so much fun. I base those playstyles completely around the capabilities of the tank however, and if I'm pulling aggro off of blizzard I... Get this... Don't use blizzard! If I pull off of a frostbolt after two sunders I... Wait for three!
---
Tldr: you're playing with an idiot, not a mage.
---
Mages are friends! Hunters are the enemy!
---
Upvote for skull warlock
---
The 40 ranges is known as the dead zone. It‚Äôs wh we‚Äôre everyone starts to slow down majorly. Just bite the bullet and grind the last levels out. Whether Warrior or Priest, they‚Äôre both very good Classes. Plus you can XP farm dungeons if you don‚Äôt want to quest as well. 
---
Just make sure you‚Äôre Horde. üôÉüôÇüôÉ
---
Saw a mage sitting near hydraxis charging 5g lol.
---
OK, NUKE IT DOT IT!!
---
I'm not reading this.
---
Roll logic hasn't changed in 15 years.
---
I posted a Boe blue for 10s instead of 10g and in the 30 seconds it took me to realize it had sold. AH add-ons are getting pretty bot esque
---
Any decent Warrior will hamstring/rend you on first contact, the whole dead zone never works, especially with leeway
---
It‚Äôs nowhere near the awesomeness of Warden Staff, but I just won a bid for Blackskull Shield (not skullflame), where the buyout was 10 and the bid was 3g. Considering the vendor price is 2g, I essentially payed 1g for a purple. I can‚Äôt use it for another 7 or so levels but I‚Äôm excited beyond belief to finally use it.
---
There is a reason they don't reply to shit like this, you're basically asking how they detected whatever got you banned. You're a dumb ass for thinking you'd get helped here.
---
Perfect timing!
---
Could have been he had a bow equipped? Maybe the quiver is part of that.
---
Whereas I do love me some wholesome posts, ive noticed 1000% of them are all lvl 1-25.
---
Then the 30+ posts are usually less happy
---
What's this retail you speak of. Sounds like an awful place.
---
You can't really play wow for the quests, you gotta enjoy playing the game for the sense of exploration, achievement and comradery.
---
Nobody as far as I know.
---
My youngest cat CONSTANTLY jumps in front of the monitor.  I‚Äôll just say her name, then it‚Äôs lap time.  Where she rests her head on my left arm, giving me dirty looks every time it moves.
---
5g is pretty common, but maybe this early in the life of the servers they can ask more, because demand will be high and the amount of skill 300 alchemists might be low
---
&gt; Linen Bags were selling like hot cakes for almost 10s each
---
Lol, but why when you can get a 6 slot bag at a vendor for 5s?  I guess they look nicer?
---
It‚Äôs been nerfed since launch, but is a good way to mitigate damage and cause enough threat to hold off the healer.
---
I would also add that you can shoot mob -&gt; bloodrage in defensive stance for some additional threat.
---
At 40ish I start to rotate bloodrage and berserker rage since generating rage causes threat.
---
That's your lifetime luck spent right there haha.
---
I use the addon "Auctioneer" and it tells you what the market price is going for on AH and it also tells you vendor price when you hover over the item. Not much different but it helps when clearing the bag from questing and you can't decide on whether to vendor this or AH it. 
---
Oh and as always, Lok'tar Ogar
---
I appreciate how short it is, I get frustrated that it‚Äôs so much shorter and underdeveloped compared to the instance in Orgimar
---
congrats, ally scum

Ill respond when i get home but i have one that works for the first hour, it bugs out after one hour if you dont reset it though
---
Welcome to alt itis..many if us are afflicted.
---
Yes Twitch bought out Curse so now the curse client is the twitch client. Curseforge is where the twitch client downloads from and more people use it.
---
Yeah, this is the only time I dread making food/water for someone.. if I've just learned a new rank and can only make 2 at a time. It takes soooo long to make full stacks 2 at a time, especially having to stop and drink like every four casts.  I still don't mind doing it though, as long as they've asked nicely.  I don't ask for tips, but most usually give something. I've received anywhere from 15s up to a 1g50. (The 1g50 was from a level 42 paladin.  I mean, he got a free mount, so I guess he had cash burning a hole in his pocket, lol.)
---
Why did you post a pic of a Mason?
---
A lot of people would have, probably me as well :&lt; I doubt it was the first item he sniped so I guess he wasn't really in desperate need for the gold.
---
It costs mats right? I wouldn't mind doing it free for with mats or just the cost of mats. I'm nice but I'm poor too lol
---
What happen if you die inside a dungeon, are you taken back at the entrance?
---
Can't quest cause every place with quests has unlimited horde gankers, so i just grind. I'm outleveling my entire guild because that's how much faster grinding is than questing on Kromcrush.
---
Tanks hate mages because mages don‚Äôt need tanks. With imp blizzard 3 and 3 mages rotating novas you can just kite forever... well, until you‚Äôre OOM at least.
---
Yeah because everyone likes people asking for money
---
Yep any time I‚Äôm in a group and someone asks‚Äô ‚Äúmind if I need?‚Äù, dude if it‚Äôs an upgrade you do _need_ it. You can always do another run
---
It‚Äôs usually the opposite for me: Mage is drinking cause they blew all their mana on AoE, and the healer is ready to keep going.
---
I feel you here bro, my old lady freaks out if she even see's snakes in a magazine or planet earth.  I can imagine she would do the same....
---
Good luck
---
He has either ignored you or set himself to offline mode. 
---
One of my friends occasionally messages me while he‚Äôs in offline mode and I can see all his messages, but I am unable to respond. I normally send him a text so he gets back online so I can respond back in game.
---
Any chance you have parental controls active on your account? That could do it maybe
---
You‚Äôre a fucking tool lmao
---
Yeah, I must be in the wrong game entirely because I don't enjoy what a specific portion of the playerbase does. Great line of reasoning, buddy.
---
Using the Lazy Peons quest as an example was just that. There are plenty more quests of that kind, be it "use item X on those guys" etc. It's none the more entertaining at level 1, level 30, level 60 or later on on retail. Heck, one of the critique points over the years regarding Blizzard quest design has been that fetch quests and similar have been uninteresting. 
---
Only because you don't have to do these quest on a daily basis in Classic it doesn't mean they are interesting or mature design.
---
Both can happen.  Tank may be using the dungeon to gear himself (it's what dungeon runs are for after all), and healers aren't that great at gold or gear farming, so a lot of times their gear is 5 levels below their level, cause they don't really have the gold to buy off the AH.
---
Mages make their own food and water, locks get their stones from what they kill.
---
Bro that‚Äôs me, I play a human pally
---
Sounds great though most of my guildies are still lvl ~45
---
That cloth vs. bandages sell price thing is false for linen and wool.  I thought that was the case as well, but at least for linen, the vendor price is 13c per piece, and the vendor price for bandages is 10c, and heavy linen is 20c.  Wool is 33c per piece, wool bandage is 28c.  Prices below are from [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) so sorry if they're inaccurate.
---
Silk is where it starts paying off: cloth = 1s50c; bandage = 2s; heavy = 4s
---
Mageweave: cloth = 2s50; bandage = 4s, but heavy = 6s (stick with normal bandages)
---
Runecloth: cloth = 4s; bandage = 5s; heavy = 10s
---
Yeah, I even managed a 2v1 Rouge fight thanks to Voidwalker Sacrifice and Eng. However I think if they were dagger rouges and timed ambushes correctly I'd have been toast.
---
Blizz customer support in general is fucking shit, on the forum you will get silenced for nothing at all. 
---
I heard they outsource it these days but with so many subs they can obviously afford better.
---
You get silenced in game for days due to trolls reporting you 5 times they just say sorry then link the tos.
---
Pathetic.
---
the update screen shows up on my classic wow login screen
---
So you are already friendly with the Argent Dawn...  hmmm, the plot thickens....
---
Enchanting is an expensive profession that doesn't pay off until you're deeply invested and have some rare and desirable enchantments.
---
Enchanters make their money with the auction house. Get an addon that shows expected disenchant value, buy up any greens that are below DE value, and sell the dusts.
---
Some enchanting materials come only from disenchanting blue items. Those materials are often expensive, so you as an enchanter can grind dungeons. Offer to DE unwanted boss drops, and stock up on them.
---
I was a little late to a ZF run yesterday(lock).  So some of the instance was killed already. The tank does some pulls and chaos ensues. I wasn't sure what the heck happened beyond the shamy unintentionally body pulling a group of three the tank was trying to avoid. 
---
I figure "mistakes happen", the tank then makes a path that weaves through some packs he wants to avoid(wall hugging and such), the shammy and I follow. The tank then tags a pat and runs back the way he came, clearly LOS pulling into a safe spot. 
---
I'm watching the mob doing nothing when I see a sparkle bolt come from behind me, the pat wasn't even in position yet. Confused and upset as to this absurd action I turn around(seeing him casting ANOTHER bolt) and asked "what are you doing?!?!?!" The pat then pulled the group the tank was trying to avoid (direct line to the shammy intersected the agro radius of the group). I run back to the tank, the shammy runs back to the tank body pulling yet another group
---
Ended with some words with one of them, they thought I was talking to the tank.
---
I've made a 27 mage, 21 paladin, 20 priest, 18 warrior and 10 warlock and still can't decide on a class. The suffering is real. Guess all I have left to try is Hunter and Rogue because all I want to do is DPS and chill. Leaning more towards Rogue as they don't drop off like Hunters do and stealth is priceless. Well feck I just convinced myself.
---
Definitely do some SM GY. There is a boss in there 2minute kill from start. Awesome dagger for rogues. Big power spikes help ur dmg and levelling significantly. Learn to chase out your next two weapons every 8-10 levels.
---
How I do what every other mage has been doing, make a video about it and slap a click bait title on it.
---
And to explain further in the click bars - I also have two different click bars aligning on top of my target portraits. One is used for my mage (sheep) and the other for my warlock (fear). So basically the mouse is copied over to respective character (so the screen I am playing from, the mouse is hovering over the click bar but on the e.g. mage screen then mouse is hovering over the target) and then I have a macro that first does a /assist {FTL} (in ISboxer this will target assist the character you are currently playing from even if you switch windows) followed by /stopcasting /cast Sheep.
---
Ran into a 60 mage earlier who was upset that an ele shaman would roll on cloth gear. So the mage mentality is definitely surviving at max level.
---
That's what I'm fuckin saying
---
\*Opens Peggle\*
---
There was a glitch in the matrix, showing us a path of doom and destuction. Good thing Chromie fixed it and im 12 yo again.
---
The glory of being a prot paladin though... people can AlE and actually not die.
---
\+250 armor and the def
---
and since you can even skill to get more armor its win -win  since weapon damage does  NOT matter in cat or bear form
---
All the new hires have to work on classic before retail.  He done fucked up with this one.
---
my server is absolutely full of warlocks.  i've never seen so many warlocks before
---
want to see how u do this ;)
---
I'm a 32 priest and I'm not sure where to put my next talent points. Right now my build is 5/13/5. In disc, I've got 5/5 wand specialization. In shadow, I've got 5/5 spirit tap. In holy, I've got 5/5 holy specialization, 5/5 divine fury, and 3/3 inspiration.
---
Most of my damage comes from my wand so I'd like to keep putting my points in things that improve my dungeon healing. I'm thinking 2 points into improved renew, then 3/3 improved healing. I've also been eyeing improved power word: fortitude though, and meditation looks awesome.
---
What do you advise, fellow priests?
---
So you let your tank get down to 25% and prey nothing goes wrong? Silence knock downs sheep‚Äôs??? Good luck
---
Could be worse. Some douchebag in our guild was bragging about how he, a healer, refuses to Res people unless they pay him. Otherwise corpse walk.
---
elvui itself will color/mark items with a big yellow ! if they are for a quest
---
you need to turn on the ELV bag mod part for this to work
---
Well that was boring
---
Obviously a liberal
---
Bought it for 290g in Faerlina
---
Jep want to hate and stop ... But I can't....
---
So I apologize for so random rant
---
The screenshots folder in your wow classic folder
---
Healers are never the bottleneck unless you're terrible.
---
If this was actually a true statement then tanks wouldn't care about mages because mages would be just queuing their own dungeons with a healer and 4 mages and this wouldn't be a post on Reddit.
---
Just username and pw.
---
Not really.  Leather and ore are very cheap until endgame mats.  Crafting professions can generate profit without travel or having to find nodes.
---
You damn near have to pay for heals as dps.
---
The latest census data before they broke the addon showed a lot more than 1% being level 60. The 40s-50s do seem to have less players, so it could seem slower. Especially at 50s. https://wowpop.appspot.com/

**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][SEMI-HARDCORE RAIDING][PST]**
---
**We are recruiting for two raid teams, both teams will be raiding at the same time!**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Who are we?**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you‚Äôll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We‚Äôre about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we‚Äôre not improving, then we‚Äôre not doing our job.
---
Our leadership team comes from a wide range of play styles. Both guild leaders are Eve online veterans holding leadership positions in large alliances, as well as being seasoned top tier raiders in nearly every expansion in WoW. One of our most notable highlights is being members of a world first Star Wars the Old Republic raid team. We're here to expand upon that experience and pass it along to other players.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
First and foremost ...we‚Äôre a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We‚Äôre not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren‚Äôt for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre new to classic, as long as you‚Äôve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday(Optional cleanup AKA ‚ÄúThe Chungus Raid‚Äù) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 3 patch.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don‚Äôt need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you‚Äôll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run. Our goal is to get our first raid up by week 3 or 4 of release, we‚Äôre not expecting everyone to bend over backwards and get to 60 and get geared up by week 1, but if you want to, you‚Äôll have some buds to play with along the way.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we‚Äôve done this before‚Ä¶ Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We will be using EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each week to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
Raiders can bonus EP each week for showing up early, with world buffs, and by contributing raid mats to the guild bank.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:**Healers(Priest and Shaman are in high demand), Melee Dps
---
**Mid Priority:**Tanks, Hunters, Warlocks, Feral Druid DPS/Offtank, Mages 
---
**Low Priority:** Enhance Shaman, Shadow Priest.
---
**Admittance into the guild is a not a guarantee for a raid spot. We are over-recruiting so we can form the most effective raid roster.**
---
*Exceptional players of any class are encouraged to apply regardless of class priority need. Raid spots are not set in stone and can be contested. We are over recruiting so that we are able to form the most stable roster possible. After the first team is built, the second team will be formed.*
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/PC9TQv4)
---
It is, but typically people who are going there for the quests aren't trying to do it as fast as humanly possible.
---
It‚Äôs just the default class that is selected when you go into the character creation screen. You can go ahead and level a hunter to 20 for Cheetah to use as your bank alt. But with that you are looking at least 30 hours of played time just to get to lvl 20. All to just save a few seconds here and there. I think it would take quite a long time to get back all the time you spent lvling but that is just my opinion.
---
 *And now... the darkness holds dominion ‚Äì black as death.*
---
I mean people probably didn‚Äôt understand itemization back then and thought that since it‚Äôs purple it must be good.
---
Also keep in mind the realm populations are very large, but also yes.
---
I rolled a mage due to ease of travel, free water, and I never played one back in the day. I leveled a priest, hunter, rogue, warlock, and Druid back during the peak of wow but never a mage.
---
Are you logged into bnet in EU and he US? You can still play on the same server but will not see each other in bnet.
---
Does this also click the bobber when it splashes if you press button, and then loot the fish ?
---
Or only cast the line but still have to manually click the dobber ?
---
Either Savory Deviate Delight (item that changes your appearence randomly) or an Orb of Deception (Trinket that changes you to look like the other faction for a while)
---
A friend of mine swore a farming spot in swamp of sorrows was awesome because the common white and gray drops were good vendor trash.  He made like 40g in 2 levels. I made 5g in 2 levels there because of RNG bad luck.  
---
That's what a lot of people forget about, luck in getting decent drops, even if it's just vendor trash.
---
I would argue that I do not hate mages. Hate is too strong of a word, and I prefer to judge the individual players instead of the whole class.
---
Also, mages DO need tanks, at least to kill bosses.
---
However, the rest of your statement is true. Mages cleave groups are extremely good at clearing huge trash packs. However, you need to have the group for it.
---
The big problem lies in the fact that a lot of people don't even want to adjust their play style according to their current group.
---
I'm level 20 and have burnt myself out.
---
This is not given enough credit for why it's so much easier. There were not greens giving 40-41 spellpower to helm / chest when MC first released.
---
I know, it‚Äôs like:
---
Look guys I‚Äôm a weeb xD
---
Fuck off weeb
---
Been answered twice already, but the god-tier answer is def Enhancement Shaman w/ 2h-weapon.
---
(If you‚Äôre maybe new to Classic from Retail, one of the big changes in class design was increasing the utilization of procs in the rotation of many specs in Cata. If you‚Äôre looking for something similar to that in Classic, Windfury is the closest you‚Äôll get.)
---
I sometimes still get GM's that do the RP thing and I've always appreciated it.
---
.....don't.... Know..... What.... U mean..
---
I think my new Tank welcome line is now "We aren't AOE farming"
---
Should thin the DPS nicely.
---
Skinning. Skin everything, then vendor what you get until you start getting "Thick Leather" and put that on the AH.
---
While this may be true for some camps, this is not the case for all of them. It may also just have been RNG . 
---
I clearly remember waiting in a camp in Westfall for a Defias Pillager when a looter spawned. The previous 2 times it was a Pillager.
---
While some spots have fixed spawns, I feel that for the majority of spawn locations it can very between 2 or 3 different kind of mobs.
---
"spellcleave" is op and Im pretty sure everyone here shitting on it is just salty they aren't a mage or priest
---
until we pop blade flurry, and hit 2 targets! haven't had a tank yet that can hold both targets im hitting.
---
&gt;Dominos
---
That's the action bar replacement I believe.
---
I mean the one that shows health/mana
---
thank you! :D
---
im the opposite of bored.
---
He also opened a ticket instead of right click report for cheating. They have a very robust system when you actually use it to report for people for cheating. You will never get a GM response for right click reports you make, but it's way more effective in punishing cheaters. To be honest though, you have to abusing the exploit for hours and disrupting the zone extensively to actually catch more than a warning for that.
---
We‚Äôll bill you.
---
Due to work and stress (and late night hours of WoW) I accidentally grew a neckbeard :( I took 2 hours off today just to be home early and cut these foul hair down. And then I farm leatherworking.
---
I was facing the same issue on my Mac, thank you so much for posting this!!
---
Could they be overworked?
---
&gt; Overpower, Heroic Strike, Cleave. They all work off of weapon damage and add a tiny amount of flat damage per rank.
---
I was wondering about stuff like this, do these numbers in the tooltip not scale and get bonuses from our stats or anything? Am I paying 1g10s to literally gain ONLY 10 points of damage on my overpower?
---
I mostly just get the info on wowhead.
---
Squids have been unavailable untill now. It's only available during winter half of the year.
---
This is brilliant.
---
Yea they messed with /who to deal with the gold seller spam.
---
Can you name few plusses for this ?
---
You'll need it for zf gy if you intend on doing hat at all.  Extremely good xp/hr and $$ to.
---
I run with 4 mages and a healer regularly. It's better than having a tank for instances with few casters.
---
But tremor totem only kicks in *after* you've already eaten a tick of fear.
---
It's still technically doable, but I've never met a guild who's willing to put up with the hassle of a tank that can't stance dance. :D
---
Select someone else before you cast/use soulstone.
---
especially the zhevra one. I mean they have 4 hooves, and we can't keep a single one intact when aiming at their torso? That's just an insult to horde capability IMHO.
---
Warriors are great but have the absolute worst leveling experience of any class. Right behind them are Rogues. Both are AWESOME classes... but they are just ROUGH to level. 
---
If you aren't married to Warrior, I'd recommend Mage as a good first class.
---
Very proud of you. Don't stop the great work. :)
---
Keep you gold. Do not use on Auction house, because you will need 90-100g at level 40 for your mount, unless you are warlock or paladin.
---
Not really, it just makes sense in my head that the tank leads the group because of his role. Historically many guild leaders of top guilds have been the main tanks if im not mistaken.
---
Also it's either this or you can stop and argue with every idiot pulling half the dungeon and cries cos you cant hold aggro. This is for my mental health honestly.
---
Remember the GM's in classic? How they'd role play around a little bit, have fun, and tell jokes WHILE helping you out with your problem and actually listening?
---
#nochanges
---
are you psychic or something?  
---
how can you tell someone if angry or not over the internet?  
---
asking you for the second time now to fuck off
---
You can if a good solo class try that market unless very contested. It's great money
---
If you enjoy pvp because of one shotting stuff yet thinking classic wasn't good pvp... What about one shotting people with pyrpblasts. engineering trinkets. Ambush. And honestly the fun to be able to do different things like run around as a balance druid with moonfire and roots on all ur keys and be able to win. The problem with pvp after classic is there was always one or two classes that stood out and tons that were useless / not even enjoyable to play. I would personally say every class has at least one spec that can dominate certain roles in pvp which defiantly gets lost and diluted with exorbinate health pools and pve balance changes through the years. Example playing in a 2v2 arena for 45 minute match's because everyone had the same two unkillable champs is not fun. Guess my whole point is at least it was fun.
---
Thought you said locks and not looks. I‚Äôm truly and idiot
---
Deeply invested means close to 300 skill, raid/reputation enchants, and farming up or buying Enchant Weapon:Crusader and charging tips. It's cool to be that guy, and the reputation grinds are achievable and casual-friendly goals to aim at, if you like the idea of enchanting.  Once you have a formula, making money is as simple as opening trade, but you have to get there first.  Formulas people usually pay for are Riding Skill, Crusader, Fiery, (and the smart people buy Minor Speed on some cloth boots)..
---
If you just want easy money, grab a gathering profession, and use a bank alt to play the DE auction house minigame.
---
With a competent group, most of them should take about 1.5 hours, give or take. The notable exception is BRD, which can take anywhere from 2-4 hours, depending on group makeup and if you do a full-clear.
---
Can you name few plusses for this podcast ?
---
\*laughs in aquatic form\*
---
MAGETARDS ARE EVERYWHERE
---
Alliance only quest
---
The average user on this sub is the same type of retard they all claim to hate. it's hilarious
---
Oh yes, amazing satire. Pretending to be a retard.
---
A LOT of that first place warrior damage should really belong to the shaman correct totem management, in that respect they bring more total dps than anyone. Just don't tell that to the raid when your dps warrs link their logs.
---
If you do dungeons mostly as you level then you're entirely in dungeon gear on the way up, and there's a few dungeon quests and the occasional solo quest you do as well that also offer gear.
---
No healer, or tank for that matter, should have bad gear leveling. They'll have the best gear because they'll keep getting dungeon drops.
---
You can't automate the click of the bobber.
---
Just kick from group and replace with a different Mage. You wont have any problem finding other Mages out there, that's for sure.
---
Yeah, I don't think a lot of these AOE'rs know how threat works in Classic/TBC/WotLK (when it actually mattered). 
---
AOE did get easier in TBC and in WotLK, but in Classic, tanks are extremely limited in AOE threat. For instance, with Warriors, Thunderclap and Whirlwind (our only real AOE abilities) only hit 4 mobs and have 6 and 10 second cooldowns, respectively. Beyond that, we can use shouts for a little bit of threat but AOE quickly surpasses that threat value. 
---
Honestly, the best way to AOE tank in Classic? Thorns.
---
Yes, 2H will generate more Rage per hit, but maybe less Rage per second, really depends on the weapon, Guessing a 2H is 3.0-4.0s swing time, you'll definitely have more rage on the earlier phase (SS/WW) but you'll get the second swing in for BR+Def Stance at best. Idk how much this would change with a 1H, again really depends on weapon.
---
Though it's true it's tight on rage to pull off the full combo. I find myself missing a lot of hit's I find, even with Max Skill + Human weapon affinity, againt mobs -3 to +3 levels (which can really fuck up the rotation), which I was quite surprised with, though I did the math of Rage generation through Charge &gt; Rage costs &gt; Swing generation and Damage taken, and the combo is definitely possible to pull off. I think I personnaly have to get to the Berserker Rage cast faster so that I start generating more rage on damage taken earlier, or maybe try to use Berserker Rage just before charging, idk, I'll try it out tonight ! I can definitely improve on it.
---
I main a hunter in retail.  I started playing about 2 months after TBC went live, and I remember having to manage my pet's happiness, manage my dead-zone, and manage my ammo.
---
Hunter, is the most solo-capable class in the game.  Without a doubt.
---
With the exception of aoe farming, i never envied any other classes abilities.
---
Hunters are not a simple class to learn and master.  Anyone can run a hunter, but not just anyone can Master them.  By the time I hit STV, I could easily solo Yellow Elites.
---
Wait for the end of the first 3 month cards.  There's probably going to be a lot of them that decide not to renew their subs, and I can imagine there being some power balance shifts on PvP servers.  Hopefully Skeram stops being a Horde sausage fest.
---
Most shamans spawn in a little cave close by. It's being guarded by two Overlords so noone bothers going in there.
---
Exactly this. I like casually grinding mobs. Fighting for spawns I‚Äôm annoying though that should be better eventually.
---
I think the problem is all these addons auto accept the quests and people either dont know the next part is escort or dont know how to turn off auto accept.
---
I got Glowing Brightwood Staff but have no idea how much it is worth since none are listed on AH. Any ideas? (or should I keep it? not sure how useful it is for druid)
---
*laughs in helculars rod*
---
Waiting for a sword and board tank to establish threat over 10 GCDs on a single pack pull isn't fun for anyone but the tank.
---
Put on your 2H or DW, charge in, and cleave them down. Taunt if you need while your casters kite. You will have to drink after every pull, yes, but mages have to do that anyway.
---
My group does this and it's a blast. I have fun, dps have fun, healer has fun because he actually has to use his brain (whereas just healing the tank with full aggro he just puts up regen + pws and then goes afk).
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs because of layering
---
PB&amp;J. Rasberry jam. Honey wheat bread. Cut diagonal.
---
I don‚Äôt have a list, but i know wailing caverns is a longer one, especially based on group. The Scarlett Monastery ones are all pretty short, with GY or Cath taking the least amount of time. A good group can clear Armory in under 30 mins.
---
Most of the people who made money on wands did so in the first week.
---
That's where I saw it, I just didn't know if messages are generic and shared between classic and retail.
---
We got vanilla back, maybe if we bitch hard enough we can get quality CS back.
---
Come on Blizz, don't you guys have phones? I know you think you don't want quality CS, but you do.
---
More than possible. I'm off to work 5am-5/6pm and I'm planning on it.
---
Believe!
---
This is 100% untrue. It DID cloak shapes, in fact I would use this in WSG as a druid, but people on opposing  WSG teams started complaining about not being able to identify the class and form of druids using Noggenfogger, so the ability was removed. Don‚Äôt remember which patch, but it was pre 1.12.
---
Flag running in bear form as a skeleton would still reveal the bear attack animation on specials like maul.
---
I agree as well. 
---
But that hasn‚Äôt stopped pugs from asking.
---
welcome to vanilla where feign death can be resisted by the mobs so they can eat your asshole while you bitch and moan about it being bugged on the forums.
---
They'll come back when the honor system launches. Then they'll get really bored of TM / SS when their death timers get to 30+ mins. 
---
They'll also be back when BGs launch, but they'll get tired of it when they realize that only ~1.4% of players can be above rank 10 at any given time - no matter how hard they grind a LOT of these no lifers are gonna be capped at rank 10 for weeks then they'll quit for good.
---
Mages are the new hunters confirmed.
---
I thought Shatner was a Shaman...
---
I gave him a dollar.
---
These kinds of funsies is my fav part of classic. Sure it's still possible in retail but noone talks anymore bc you know you'll phase away in 2 sec
---
You should‚Äôve killed that Tauren
---
Ah yes, the reason why I'm rolling a DPS alt instead of finishing my priest grind. I know this scenario all too well. It's driven me to roll holy spec at around 42 just so I have enough mana to survive most encounters, but most people see it as just more packs of mobs we can afford to pull. 
---
But just know, your healers notice your attention to these details and we appreciate you for it. We may not say anything, because we're busy silently cursing the DPS so we don't lose our minds, but we appreciate it none the less.
---
Well try to take my Aggro as a fury tank :p
---
Come to Bloodsail Buccaneers! We will let you tank your way ;)
---
Healing touch almost cast. The feeling of joy knowing you would be so happy for someone to save you.... overheal of 400 on yourself.

Note: Not all of them work in Classic.

I think it depends on how your planning to get to 60. Just questing, then it comes in handy for that spare gold until 60. If your dungeoning and don't want to skin the main bosses then illd probably drop it once you have enough saved up to make a decent dent in another profession. 
---
Maybe around or before 50. I'm not too sure. I've not dropped it yet but have it leveled to 202. Might just commit and go for 300
---
When someone leaves in Classic what do you do? Go back and not reset the dungeon and hope to get another person? Or fully reset it so the new person gets all the xp/quests too?
---
Here you have it in detail with items as well

---
Dont touch Prot until you're 60, guilded, and already slotted as a tank.
---
You spec Arms, you spam sunder, even solo.
---
You don't even need a shield (but have one just in case)
---
Ooooh! *whip crack*
---
Also just a joke, my dude. It'd be pretty difficult to not notice the dozens of replies.
---
I felt similar as a priest when I didn't want to run SM anymore. I went to featjermoon stronghold on Feralas. There is a quest to kill see nagaa on the island that are lvl 42-43. I did that quest and grinding an extra level. Then there is a follow up quest to kill 43-44 nagas. Did that for another level. 
---
The area is completely void of horde so it's a relaxing spot. Getting there can be tricky if you've not been yet but it's nice to go there now as you'll want to go there eventually anyways
---
I'm a level 60 hunter with rhok'delar and 5 T1 pieces.
---
If a level 50 rogues opens up on me with his stunlock while one or two other lvl 50's DPS me as well, I will easily die without even having a chance to fight back. There truly is not that much of a difference in damage numbers and health numbers between a level 50 and a raid-geared level 60.
---
The only 60s that can easily 1vs3 or 1vs4 are mages, warlocks you know.. just the typical classes that have enough CC on hand to easily deal with multiple enemies.
---
I must've misread his intent. My mistake.
---
Giving it based on class is fucking stupid when noone in the game actually uses that weapon for pve progression and no 2h dps are viable in pve.
---
Anyone in your guild who will use it in pvp and is an active contributor should be able to roll on something like sulfuras. Locking this insanely hard to come by weapon to individual classes because GM likes to circle jerk about how warrior is better than shaman or paladin is bullshit.
---
Yep. I've honestly had numerous dungeon runs where I've lost all or all but one all-greed rolls. 
---
A ST run the other day I got won a blue to sell but another dude got about six trash weapons which vendor for over 1g each...
---
It's me I'm the drunk healer
---
I dont think they should release content quickly. Except for phase 2. After that i dont mind if it takes 3 or 4 months for each phase
---
If you have herbalism/mining at 60 you want the epic mount because it makes a huge difference while you're making your rounds.  If you're primarily going to be doing dungeons/raids or farming in static spots at 60 then the epic mount is luxury and status symbol.
---
Is this some sort of Warrior joke that I'm too Paladin to understand?
---
But most of my damage comes from wanding. I‚Äôd prefer to keep going down disc and holy. I hear you still wand a good amount as shadow anyways.
---
Given that they fired and essentially rehired half their service workforce last year it wouldn't surprise me if they had also cut corners on pay and training.
---
In terms of size you can compare to Mankrik. I'm on Mankrik and have never been in a queue for more than 5 minutes (and that was once in day 2 or 3). It consistently hits high pop every night and has what I was tracking at about 10-12k horde players logged in during peak hours. It isn't the most balanced in faction, but it isn't horrible. Hopefully that gives you a frame of reference for # of players and queue times.
---
Back in wrath I remember calling blizz support and being on hold for over an hour. Fun times..
---
I think this applies more to lv60.
---
I don't mind if it's a major quest that leads to a good item, but more times than not it's just something super random that awards either just gold or some random greens.
---
Save the quests for if the group all agrees on it.
---
I ran SM with 3 warriors and a rouge and a Druid healer and by god we cleared that shit in like 20 minutes. It‚Äôs nice not even having to worry about aggro cuz even the weakest player (rogue) and take more than a few hits without breaking a sweat. Not to mention the other 2 warriors just going for it without getting upset when they pull aggro. We cleaved that shit harder than 3 mages as dps.
---
It‚Äôs been out a month
---
Same. I bought bags first and could probably grind the last 30g out pretty quick even though I'm already level 40, but Cheetah is fine imo for a few more levels. Not in any big rush to get it.
---
Countdown to Classic - is the podcast for classic.
---
Ctrl Alt Wow - is still relevant becasue and only becasue grand nagus is now playing classic.
---
Convert to Raid - still ok due to Pat playing, Thyst better get on board asap retail is dead girl.
---
The Starting Zone - dead show now, they are retail only, yawn!
---
Lagging Balls - unless Thorn saves the show by playing classic, then another dead show/stream
---
The Instance - uggg the show died years ago really, but Scott is such a cool guy and caster.
---
So yea i have a few open spots need to fill, great topic, thanks for posting.
---
I know for Fury warriors the ideal is 12% then go crit, I would figure for rogues it would be around 12% as well.
---
I mistakenly left an instance after winning an item because someone in group decided to afk and not roll. I just assumed I‚Äôd won it but took a mage port out. I put in a ticket with the GM (since it was pre raid BiS) who said in order to preserve the experience they do not restore items if you leave. I said ok but if I deleted the item consciously you can help me, which wasn‚Äôt the Vanilla experience, but if I make a legitimate simple mistake you can‚Äôt? He even confirmed he saw me won the roll. Long story short, GMs seem pretty fucking useless. They are not there to help players anymore.
---
I quest mainly. But i like to do a dungeon every other level or so as a change of pace or when i get quests for them, Like i will do a ZF tonight as i have a quest from the hinterlands to get an amulet from it. Despite the fact i have done every other quest in there.
---
Interestingly I was looking at a PvP video by one of the highly regarded PvP Rogues and he was a Nelf. This is actually what got me thinking does it really matter.
---
Tauren sees Alliance pretty boys fighting, Tauren steals egg
---
Except that's still slower because warriors have active damaging abilities, heals don't beat bandages for efficiency when you run yourself OOM. Then come Whirlwind it's orders of magnitude slower, never mind all of the other things I mentioned.
---
i'm contemplating respecing from arms to prot but i'm only level 43 and think i'm better off waiting until late 50s as i still need to quest a lot, while good when i am with friends not so great when soloing
---
Or do b2b support so you can just tap the rule book and tell them to do their job.
---
Aoe farm instance mobs for green? Hows a mage complaining about farming lol.
---
I think most of the pre-bis lists are assuming fights are taking 3+ minutes. I think in reality if you have a solid guild Mp5 will be worse than people think. The shorter the fight the less mana it is giving back. I am just stacking +healing and int. I will downrank my spells a lot.
---
Sometimes after killing a mob it looks like there is loot to pick up, but then there is nothing at all. Is this a bug or a feature?
---
yea. i mean "wait for sunders" was a thing and it had its purpose 
---
people just wanna go nuts like retail and yea it does not always work out well. you can mostly get away with it in lower dungeons but once you get to BFD and beyond it becomes real bad real fast
---
Finished Wetlands quests and I'm level 29. My server is absurdly Horde leaning in terms of faction balance. Where should I go now to level? Was thinking Desolace -&gt; Dustwallow Marsh.
---
I noticed the issue with pet not attacking a moving target. If I send him to attack and shoot as well, the mob will make it all the way to the dead zone before a growl lands. It's lame when I'm feeling too lazy to kite
---
Loool okay please pull the entire cathedral chapel with a warrior/rogue comp and get back to me.
---
Once we get more horde, it‚Äôll be perfect. In terms of alliance, it‚Äôs great!
---
We don't help turtles get to the water in classic. We kill them and vendor there body parts.
---
Every time I kill a shaman or warlock, I place a freezing trap on their body. I'd say about 1 in 3 pop reincarnation or their soulstone just to eat the trap and die again :)
---
Made the mistake of putting points in prot, respecced when sweeping strikes was available on Arms and everything feels so much smoother, mostly rocking a 2H while tanking with a shield for ohshit moments/some bosses.
---
At 43 now so cant personally speak for higher but I can't see myself respeccing soon.
---
Ive really just been enjoying the game. Not rushing it. Ive got my professions maxed and ive ran some friends through RFK, SFK, WC.
---
["Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FZfzqMtwQZES3eqN/slow-is-smooth-and-smooth-is-fast)
---
Haste tends to make waste in instances.  Like corpse runs, waiting to rez someone, waiting for everyone to heal up / drink up.
---
Agreed - I heal regularly spec'd almost full feral. Im a resto main in retail -- and aside from slowing the f down and just picking spots better, nothing a full stack of mage water cant fix.
---
Oh yeah, the druid... This class is so great in Vanilla. Kappa.
---
Sorry bro, I had too ;-)
---
Stealing this. Great idea. I also miss some of the social interactions in a good flowing group. The Aoe groups tend to have a lot of silence and brain dead mages in them. A lot of the time mages just hearth out if they're unsatisfied with another mages performance or the pace. They're getting prissy.
---
Your best bet is to check the drop table for a specific dungeon, and check whether there are any items you really need. Often, it takes a while to replace items, so a big upgrade may make a difference for a long time.
---
Other than that, it is really hard to predict whether a group will gain XP more efficiently than solo play. Some groups blaze through with no effort, while others can't find their asses with a map.
---
I mean.... I feel this is so true haha. But i meant with a well functioning normal group.
---
Agreed! Horde transfer here, plz!
---
FYI - it was patch 2.0.1 which came soon after this current 1.12 patch which massively nerfed AOE damage to do decreased damage whenever hitting more than 3-6 targets (I cant remember the exact number). In the current Classic patch, AOE damage does not decrease.
---
This isn't meant to excuse bad mages, only to serve as information and partially explain why Mages are excited about AOEing very large groups.
---
Can confirm. Levelling a sub dagger rogue and it's super fun.
---
Feralas usually does feel dead. There are only a handful of quests so most people don‚Äôt linger there.
---
i think they only want warriors during the ravager phase for dps.
---
Not fully sure brother, I know its really obvious looking though.
---
Great, that gives me a good point of reference. Thanks!
---
Manalets haha
---
I believe it is part of the design. You always get the option to loot whether it has items or not.
---
Wow, as a warrior I find this borderline offensive....
---
Remind me how much your repair bills are on your cloth armor? And how you can use the cloth drops you get on anything other than bandages that you need to use between pulls.
---
A mage complaining about farming being hard is like a trust fund baby complaining that their parents bought them a Lexus instead of a Mercedes
---
Meh outside of, Druids,  Shaman and Rogues,  I've seen every other class doing everything stupid in incredibly high amounts. I don't think it's just one class. Too many people who are watching streamers and elite youtube videos, trying to emulate what they saw thinking they're king shit. Mages, Hunters, Warlocks, Priests, and warriors I've seen do such stupid things, it makes me think we've taken a step back. Doting everything, DPSing when you should be healing, not tanking properly, multi/shot growling, AOEing (my god the stupid people trying to AOE is incredible).
---
Most realms that are pvp are horde heavy
---
well...okay sure those are pretty nice, but have you ever done a flip while jumping? It's pretty freaking sweet is all I'm saying.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem that way in classic with the amount that have been crafted already.
---
What?! Well no wonder that damn monster keeps coming back to our house if you keep giving him money!
---
I mean, feeling like you failed to mention it before the run started.
---
That said, it does feel sort of scummy to roll on all tank gear, and also roll for heal gear.
---
Nothing to that extent.  But I did have a hunter need on "Razor's Edge" then rage quit the duo group because I also need rolled after him.  It's a tank axe...you dont need it.  If you need something you dont need, I'm also gonna need in all fairness.
---
Should've just helped with your group to make it easier.
---
xD
---
You can easily spell cleave SM without a tank.  People here just don't like that playstyle.  I for one have fun spell cleave mass pulling cathedral.  Also, it's not that hard to find healers.  Good tanks, on the other hand, are really hard to find.
---
That's become a good deal of CSR are temps.
---
Blizzard isn't going to cough up the dough to keep a staff capable of handling an event like a game's launch or big patch.
---
So they keep round the clock temps and up the number of temps for game/expansion releases.
---
Yep. I tried Dark Knight several times in FFXIV, but realistically you're just trying to maximize your DPS between tank busters, and I didn't find that very enjoyable. And if a pull does start going south, I can just throw Grit on and quickly grab aggro and then use Living Dead.
---
After tanking in Classic, when I go back to FFXIV (I still haven't given Shadowbringers a try) I'll probably level DRK again, but still not sure how much I'll enjoy it.
---
Definitely a bug. Even if you‚Äôre in a group with free for all as the loot system this still sometimes happens and will prevent you from skinning the kill.
---
With that mind set it would have been faster for BOTH groups if you had helped them earlier.  But I guess it only matters if you aren't being helped. As for the Tauren, you're rival factions. Bm is expected. You're supposed to be at odds with each other.
---
Kinda like you said OP, shitty people everywhere, but there are also plenty of good people, play with them and ignore the ass hats
---
Nice determination
---
I gave a mage 1g for asking if my group needed water while we were camping quest mobs. 
---
I want to encourage that type of behavior and the delivery of much needed mana was nice.
---
Some times mobs don't drop loot, but they still need to be looted. Feature. It's so people can't skin your mob until after you've had your shot at looting.
---
I just want honor kills
---
I would pick a key you like and just use shift and ctrl + that key for the other two stances. Personally I use middle mouse
---
Oh I didn't camp every 5 minutes, I normally set up camp whenever healer needs to reg because he's oom, if the dungeon groups advances fast, and now breaks are needed, I obviously don't cook or produce leather kits. But sofar in every dungeon there were atleast 1-2 major breaks. The tank didn't rant in that case with the healer as he saw the logic in an oom healer to reg. 
---
And the ZF incident was a run without breaks, just before the Boss where I told "wait a minute I prepare you leather kits". Put the campfire and was done in 20seconds all in all. I really don't get why it always has to be the rush, I really don't undertsand how these 20seconda can be such an annoyance to anyone when playing a multiplayer game that revolves around proper teamwork.
---
That being said, sure not anyone asks or wants the buff food but so far noone complained when receiving something for free.
---
Default UI Spotted.
---
Edit: Well I'm pretty much convinced 2005's best is 2019's basic. I know \*I\* was bad back then I'm pretty sure I made it until the 50's before Alliance Druid, Ace, Dragonblight ripped me apart for wearing STR gear on my hunter.
---
As a healer the dungeon is much more fun to me if I can manage my mana and last 3-4 pulls before having to drink but at the end of the day I'm happy to find a tank at all. Millions of warriors and nobody wants to tank.
---
Any mage would AoE farm from 20(ish) and up, just how it is. So how much does it matter that it is done in a dungeon as opposed to out in the world?
---
I've  seen a ton of shitty mages doing aoe in dungeons and realistically if they were to have done it out in the world they would be better, which would reduce the amount of high level mages that can't figure out how to do a aoe pull by themselves.
---
I can't see how them not being challenged on their AoE kit however would make them better at anything but doing aoe.
---
Well that dude was a dick, but I will be honest - the instances take a long time as it is. Waiting for a fire and buff food to be made/eaten before every boss sounds pretty tedious. You can be in those places for well over an hour, so slowing it down hurts your chances of actually getting to the bosses people need before they might need to go do other thing IRL.
---
If your dps are starting too quickly and causing threat issues, that's a dps problem, not a healer problem. You don't bring a higher level healer to carry bads, you tell the bads to stop being bad. My job isn't to deal with everyone's else shit and allow them to still be shit. That's the sort of stress that's going to cause you to have healers not want to go with you.
---
Layers m8 ;)
---
Thank you for the contribution. Hope your day is pleasant üòÉ
---
Hunters pulling threat cause pets have growl on, or using multi shot at the point of pull so 2 out of 3 mobs make a b-line for hunter.
---

Looks like every horde story starts the same.... :D
---
I've been getting scammed. I've been paying 2g per trade window of water.
---
The CVars violenceLevel and ffxGlow were removed from the Interface settings quite a while ago, but still work. 
---
violenceLevel ("0" - "5") controls how much blood and gore is displayed. Requires a UI reload to take effect.
---
What ppl dont realize is that AQ(P5 and beyond) Fire spec is what mages go.  So firefins are at current moment a delayed investment.
---
Oh def, need that nerd clout
---
Why would you advertise that half your guild got banned for exploiting
---
Yoooo I don‚Äôt have any history with vanilla wow but this is LIT
---
I get the same thing actually. I just assumed it was a limitation of the game, but maybe it‚Äôs not? No idea how to fix.
---
GM needs to be fired ASAP.  What a dummy
---
I got three stacks of hot smoked bass in the bank and was weirded out when ppl said it was bugged
---
Dont forget the warlocks that dot up every mob on the pull. I love that when this game was new the DPS would get yelled at for going ham and not managing their abilities well. Now it seems they want to blow their entire mana bar every pull, then say youre a shitty tank for not holding aggro when they get whacked. I used Ravager while tanking well beyond it being really good JUST because I knew on the trash mob groups id have to keep my AOE threat up because most groups have never even heard of CC. 
---
Side note as a tank: EVERY time I get a group together and someone mentions how slow we are going, or they recommend everyone going ham on every pull we wipe, its literally been EVERY time. Remember guys, wiping over and over because of dumb bullshit makes the runs WAY longer. When I have a group with sensible players that work  \*together\* we clear no problems and ends up being only marginally slower than the successful AOE groups Ive been in. People forget how to look at group dynamics, player classes, level ranges, and adjust their tactics accordingly. Ive been in groups with underleveled feral geared druid healers, and the caster still expects he can go balls out every pull. This game is very dynamic, screw your plug and play strategies, use your head.
---
In my experience, questing is faster for experience alone but instance grinding, while giving less experience, makes up for it in profit.
---
That said, I think AoE groups might be getting experience faster in instances.
---
Its also worth noting that the amount you actually use Heroic Strike makes it pretty useless to skill up. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve used HS since 20ish
---
Just going to throw this in here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5y1qjb/every_good_deed/
---
TL;DR: OP reported somebody that said they were going to molest a child. OP instead received a ban. It took four GM's to look at the ticket before the ban was given to correct person.
---
This person has customer serviced before.
---
Why phase 2?
---
There's nothing wrong with you doing your spellcleave runs. This is more when you are doing a normal run and one dude decides he is the spellcleave. Or when the mage and lock decide AOE!!!!even though there is no way you can hold aggro as you have 0 rage and they have pulled so you miss your charge etc.
---
 My Druid would like a word.
---
100 AP translates to 7 more dps which can be anywhere from like 14 to 21 more per hit depending on weapon skill. For Sinister Strike, which is normalized for attack speed, 100 AP translates to your sinister strike doing 17.1 more damage.
---
As a tank can I make one where when I'm in a group and close to death, say around 5%, my character says 'your champion is in need of aid!'
---
Why should they? If its something that they issue warnings for, it doesnt matter if you are melee or ranged class, Its forbidden for every1.. Should be simple enough?
---
do people just record their gameplay constantly? Or it is streaming? I've seen some pretty cool random clips and I'm wondering how many hours of video these people have in hopes of catching a cool random moment.
---
At 60 now but I don't/didn't mind as long as it's a Mage that knows their shit with kiting because I won't be able to keep aggro on all...  the real annoying people are the idiots who play low AoE class and think we'll somehow clear faster with like a 2x Rogue 1x Hunter DPS group if they double pull, which just makes mine and the healers life hell for no reason whatsoever.
---
"I had Blade Flurry up its good" xd
---
Dumb question, can I still use this with swords?
---
This. It's a large creature made almost entirely out of meat. Where's the fricking meat?!?
---
i feel this in my bones
---
I'm so bad I don't even know what you guys are talking about
---
Yeah for sure. I used to love devilsaurs in pvp for the same reason.
---
My "main alt" is on BB, definitely a fun server so far!
---
I mean i dont like mages either but you cant deny the 100k xp per hour theyre getting man
---
I never said they were. Your numbers are still bollocks.
---
Yeah I purposely decided not to roll a tank because I believe in marking targets and using CC. There‚Äôs less players interested in keeping that kind of patience
---
PvP servers tend to have 10%+ more Horde on them, so theoretically yes, there should be more Horde fishers.
---
I'm sure there's plenty of people, yeah.
---
Others won't be.
---
It's just a video game. Made to occupy a little of your time while also providing entertainment.
---
If it's not providing entertainment then don't play.
---
Both of those zones should be fairly calm. Horde don't have a lot to bring them to Dustwallow, as Hillsbrad and Arathi probably have their attention.
---
If you wanna fish and fuck around and shit that's your prerogative, but you could have more efficiently leveled to 60 and then had a much easier and faster time doing and obtaining any of those things. 14 slot bags are 2 and a half gold. You get one high level green weapon drop and you can just buy two bags. Compare that to the hours and hours spent obtaining the requisite fishing skill. If you just got your epic mount first with the money you get as a byproduct of running dungeons to obtain pre bis gear for several days you could then ride around super fast and level the fishing a lot faster.
---
Or right click on the chat tab and go to....settings i think?  Theres an option in there to join the default channels that arent turned on.
---
It's not your fault it's the job of dpses to make sure you get aggro on the mobs. Marking mobs to make sure you are all attacking the same will help a lot. However for aoe it's hard especially for bear tank who is limited to attack 3 targets at the same time. So for big pulls the dpses should wait 1 or 2 seconds to make sure you have enough aggro.  Still,  it's hard when dpses are trying to beat the others with damage and not thinking about the tank. Another thing that helps is to make sure your 1 or 2 lvl' s higher then recommended so you won't miss every hit.
---
Wiping brings frustration to the group resulting in kicking the tank or some times even the healer. But it never occurs that a DPS is getting kicked because of a low DPS, it's really unfortunate when there are not a lot of tanks.
---
But to come back on your idea to quit tanking.  don't stop tanking we need you! I've tanked all my life but decided to go healer in classic. So far I didn't have to worry about my tank while doing dungeons. Ofcourse it happens that he loses aggro but then I'll just heal the others up.  Every class is made to atleast absorb a few hits from an elite before dieing, which gives you enough time to get your aggro back. 
---
So for the dpses out there; Be kind to your Tanks, there job is way harder than yours!
---
Snitches, do indeed, get the stitches.
---
This is game changing.
---
As a healer I found a good slow methodical tank last night. It was wonderful. We went faster because we didn't die and have to ghost run back. 
---
"The Long way Round is the Short way Home"
---
Yeah, had a guy offer me 2g last night for 4 stacks of each.  I thought he was crazy until someone told me how much high end food / water costs.
---
I actually managed to gank a skull mage at nessy's last night (playing a warrior), he severely underestimated me.
---
Thats also wrong, Force Reactive Disk is best for that :P
---
You didnt automatically kill the Tauren, I blame you for all of the atrocities happening in the world... of warcraft.
---
Or Priest healer mindblasting on pull and scoring a crit
---
They should just get rid of leveling in retail.
---
Funny joke but Oceanic already uses the US client since it's the same license
---
Nope, class. Grab a stick and start swinging.
---
I thought they reduced xp requirements with each expansion?
---
I am a lv50 warlock so I am eligible for the whole spellcleave meta thing but I really just prefer doing pack per pack and completing the run in regular fashion without stress. 50% of the spellcleave groups I do end up joining have failed horribly. Mages who can't control the pulls and then end up complaining about my DPS when I don't go full ham on Hellfire 1 sec into the pull. What they don't seem to understand is that being dead when mobs get killed gives you zero exp.
---
And if you don't kiss their ass throughout the entire process, they'll up and leave without a word.
---
Oh, I thought mages could perma slow mobs and kite them, root them in place with freezes, and teleport 20 yards away on a 15 second cooldown...
---
You can aoe down several packs IF you have 3 frost mages and IF they know what they are doing and are all specced properly with improved slow on their blizzard. They need to coordinate their frost novas, cone of colds, and cold snaps as well. In this scenario, the "tank" is primarily there to pull and pick up anything that happens to get loose from the aoe, as well as finish off runners.
---
This is a highly coordinated group effort and requires a very specific group comp and players at the absolute top of their game. My friends and I did it. 3 aoe classes (usually 3 mages or 2 mages and a warlock), holy priest, and me as an arms warrior using sword and board for initial pull, then letting the mages get aggro and doing sweeping strikes / ww when the mobs were NOT frost novad (if you run in there when 8-10 elite are frost novad, they will all turn and hit you instantly and you will die). I was even able to do pretty reasonable dps compared to the mages with this setup, although my primary function was to be the "cleanup" guy - when there are 4-5 targets left at less than 10% HP and they're all trying to run, I was the one that quickly finished them off. And if things went bad, I could aoe taunt and shield wall. 
---
Mages that think that they are some kind of aoe god and can solo everything in big elite packs are mistaken. You don't have the mana pool or the damage for that. It requires a full grp of aoe damage, a knowledgeable tank, and a good healer. Everyone has to coordinate.
---
Not a new player lol. 
---
The extra stam is just fine at level 14 or so thanks.
---
Based on what I've seen in LFG, it seems to fall off in the mid 50s in BRD. People are spamming for "AOE ARENA RUNS" a lot, which is only like the first couple rooms of BRD. I think that's about as far as you can take it.
---
I didn't know this was considered an exploit, people do it constantly. Why don't they just fix the issue if this is so unintended? Come on over to Kromcrush, you can see it 24/7!
---
That builds is absolute trash to tank dungeons. That build is full resto and then you only take points in feral till charge which is 11 points i believe
---
I hope P2 comes around xmas time
---
It has happened to me solo and in a duo with no quest items involved
---
Yeah I genuinely don't understand how people can enjoy while playing that much, but I'm glad they can cuz I sure can't anymore, I'm not 15 like I was last time around
---
As a mage I agree, I probably get far more whispers than you to join aoe groups and ignore them all.  
---
That said, if a tank is fighting 4 plus mobs I will aoe, but I know how to do it where it won't wipe the group.  It's okay to pull aggro if you can keep them inplace and making a small circle around the tank, hell if half the mobs are not attacking anything and are just walking indefinitely to a mage they can never reach, that's a lot less dmg the healer has to heal.
---
Bottom line, if you are going to aoe as a mage, don't run into melee distance, Nova, cone of cold, and proceed to spam arc explo in leeway distance.  You will die.
---
Wouldn't foresight be conjuring the water before hand? Water is 40s a stack at the highest rank and in order to facilitate fast pulls I sit and drink after every pull. Now I can wait to just get to empty and do a full drink if the mage doesn't want to make water, but it will slow the instance way down and run the risk of a wipe if I run out of mana mid pull. Big thing you're also missing here is that until cap most healers are running a dps spec that has no points into making any heals cheaper or better. I can maybe see where you're coming from but I don't think you're understanding the situation of the people you're running with.
---
Sometimes when I group with my SO we are still in different layers and have to ungroup/regroup a few times to get it to work right. Anyone know what the deal is with that? It's slightly annoying.

**&lt;D√©j√† Vu&gt; | Atiesh - Alliance | Casual | Mostly EST**
---
**About us:**
---
We are a small group of veteran players who played and raided together from Vanilla through Wrath. Real life responsibilities caused us to spread out into other hobbies and games, but we're getting the band back together for Classic. While our ultimate dream is to be able to get to the point of casually raiding again, our first priority is to grow a group of players who enjoy running 5-mans together or just knocking out quests while hanging out in Discord.
---
**Expectations:**
---
Just be fun to play with and a decent person.
---
We're great at telling you exactly where that quest mob is and telling old-man stories like the cautionary tale of why you should never say "Hey guys, watch this!"
---
**Schedule and Contact Info:**
---
You can contact me in game on Pantone or hop in Discord and talk to an officer. We're generally busiest on evenings and weekends EST but a few of us are spread across the country or have other schedules.
---

---
You forgot the seductive **ah** after the whip
---
Sulfuras, hand of layering.
---
My guild group is able to clear all bosses in BRD (except Bael'gar... that trash is horrible) in about 2 hours, I'm tank and keep the pace going so that we aren't in there all day. No spellcleave, just concise pulls and minimizing downtime
---
I donno why, but a scene from mad max jumped in my head with the guy yelling "witness me!" ))
---
It‚Äôs definitely a valid point. A lot of people just find it so satisfying to fresh ding 40/60 and ride around on that new mount. It is quite the achievement. I‚Äôm not really in any rush to hit 60 either, I, like a lot of people are really just enjoying the levelling journey.
---
If the main goal for my gold making is reaching 900g for my epic mount ( i plan on farming 99% of my own consumables) would it not be better to wait for inflation to sell my stockpiled trade goods?
---
didn't realize id trigger you guys so much
---
&gt; I'm still just baffled that in my entire journey in Classic WoW, people behave like this. ***I'm level 47, this is the first time*** I've come across such despicable and utterly disheartening behaviour.
---
You wrote a post about the singular bad experience you've had?
---
I haven't grouped with a bad Shaman yet, but maybe I'm luck. About the only bad thing I've seen is Shaman constantly breaking CC.
---
Literally just want honor for my kills.
---
We were talking about pre raid bis. That's in a raid, but ya I get what you're saying
---
If your girlfriend plays you are out of the conversation.
---
Most significant others will start getting pissy when you spend over 2 hours at the computer on the evening.
---
No lol
---
Level 56 here. I would highly recommend waiting until at least level 35, even then I would ideally wait until 50+ your questing time will suffer a lot.
---
Hahaha I gotta walk back from Stormwind to Darnassus because my idiot ass forgot to take the  flight paths hahahaha
---
/r/agedlikemilk   
---
Seems it was pretty accurate
---
Good point!
---
Fuck tailors.
---
Buy them from the AH, or gather the mats and ask a tailor to make some for you. They will pay for themselves with all the extra vendor trash you will be able to pick up and sell.
---
Dungeons drop them often enough, I believe you can get 8 or 10 slots from Deadmines. 
---
Otherwise you're going to have to spend some silver. It's not hard to find a tailor selling Silk Packs (10 slot) for 35-ish Silver in major cities.
---
Exactly. Nothing in the game requires this level of min max. Theres nothing in the game with Sulfuras BiS that is a "Meta" spec, so acting all elitist over who gets sulfuras is peak stupidity. ALL sufficiently contributing members of the guild who can wear it should be able to roll. It makes my blood boil to hear "Oh well you didnt pick Warrior because its the best so we are going to use your totems and otherwise act like you dont exist as far as loot goes"
---
I wont be doing a single raid that has the legendary quest drop on reserve personally. There will be plenty of groups and i dont need your super elite progression core to clear fuckin MC, BWL, or Naxx
---
What do you mean? This post is specifically referring to mages.
---
SM and ZF are quite literally some of the only dungeons where full mage runs can work. It could probably also work on some lower level dungeons too, but I'm quite sure you will hit a wall with your 4 mages group in all the dungeons higher than that. 
---
For example, I don't see 4 mages killing Uldaman's last boss, who has a ton of health and regularly summons adds, nor would i ever see them succeed at killing Emperor Thaurissan, who is quite literally **immune** to magic when he enrages, which happens quite often.
---
&gt; ...and if I feel dangerous I may even frostbolt.
---
Oh my...
---
Stair strat = 100% pug kill of last boss on Ulda.
---
Yeah no doubt hehe. I just got two levels on my Warlock full of rested! &lt;3
---
56 mage, level 1 first aid lol.
---
Nothing a /reload hasn't ever sorted. Potentially could be a driver thing, but as it's a mac, there's not much I can do about that. Nvidia aren't exactly great on their mac support.
---
My main is a rouge and my alt is a priest, but I‚Äôm thinking of switching it up, good idea?
---
Meh why nerf it ...why not buff it and make it a little tougher and more rewarding than this ez faceroll shit
---
I mean, even if he drew both of them, that‚Äôs only 4 mana. 
---
Whatchu gunna do turn one with 4 mana? 
---
Yes I know this is a WoW meme and not hearthstone, it fits,it sits on mana for itself.
---
What does the rotation look like? Do you just spam Hemo to generate cp until kidney or eviscerate? Do you use sinister strike?
---
&gt; *Some* Mages are seriously egotistical going by reddit.
---
There, fixed it for you, since you statement wasn't even applicable to only the Mages in this thread.
---
and nothing you said was relevant at all because you were making up prices irrelevant to the prices i sold my materials at.
---
I've only watched a lock doing it, but should be about the same as a hunter. I mean you're really not in a hurry since you can only do 5 per hour anyway.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'm very much open to playing Prot Paladin too - I just fancied learning to tank in dungeons
---
rank15 reporting in, world first naxx clear too
---
And neither do hunters as they don't get the glancing blow penalty.
---
No problem. Make sure to get all the secondary profs.
---
I question if this was vanilla because it was a while before mages got invisibility. I think maybe tbc
---
I‚Äôm finally set on the human warrior I made, but I constantly have to ward off temptations of making a Druid or going back to my priest or warlock lol
---
That spell isn't ready yet!
---
The formula is if the quest level is more than 5 levels below your current level then you receive 20% less reputation per level until you reach the floor of 20%.  If you are level 48 and the quest level is 40, then the quest doesn't reward 100 rep instead it rewards 40 rep.
---
I am looking for addons for auction house that are working with classic, I only have (afai remember), auctionator, but I need a more detailed one, can anyone help ?
---
We're you farming for it? Or just get reaaaally lucky?
---
Every job can be a stepping stone you just have to know how long you need to stay in each job for it to become relevant. 6 months is generally not enough time for it to become one. I‚Äôm not in IT so maybe 6 months is but at least in my industry 1-2 yrs at an entry level job is what you need
---
You can kind of tank as ret. Might be a better bet. Most healers I ran with to 60 were Ret healers
---
A level 40 is not going to have an easy time soloing without a dedicated healer
---
I mean above a certain mob count blizzard is the best DPS period. If you're having trouble with the pulls and need to focus certain mobs it's one thing, but just casting blizzard isn't necessarily wrong.
---
People don't understand this, because they dont understand the real world. Usually people who say things like this never worked a day in their life.
---
You posted a self thread so we can't see the picture.
---
Yep, that's close to it. Had to do the same.
---
I love this addon, thank you so much for the update :)
---
Higher overall damage literally equates to higher DPS. 
---
1000 overall damage in a 1.66 minute is 10dps. 1100 overall would be 11dps.
---
This made my day xD
---
Yeah, Im level 40 so Iron bound Trunks are the highest I can get. You can get Mithril Trunks with drop runecloth bolts. as well as think and rugged leather. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21228/mithril-bound-trunk
---
Fishing in vanilla was always an endgame money maker just for the stupid amount of mats and greens the trunks drop.
---
Haha yeah gotta get that mount money.
---
Fuck you
---
If you are burnt out by level 20, its not about burn out but the game is just not for you. Unless you very easily burn out i guess but theres not a scenario where you could have played so much you would burn out and only be level 20 in my opinion.
---
I think if we could set pet ability priorities that would be great. Most of the time it's fine but sometimes they just do everything but growl until the last second.

Recruiting all but prioritizing healers.  We are still leveling so have not discussed raid times yet just having a good time playing right now.  We are looking for more people to play with to get multiple dungeon groups going and raid.  Feel free to reach out.  My bnet is Judergan#1156

Bad form, Sledeets. Bad form.

Should have levelled it up. I've prevented a death so many times by using a bandage. People downvoting me are noobs lol
---
A hard one to answer
---
So I don't know if anyone else has done this much and maybe it's not doable in the 50-60 dungeons, but i've been having a ton of success 2h tanking using sweeping strikes and sunder armour and Stance dancing into Defensive if i ABSOLUTELY have too but I would do something like:
---
Pull 3 mobs somtimes can get away with, using charge if possible, Demo shout, Sunder main target, (If i crit, I'll let out a thunder clap) otherwise, i'll stance dance into Serk when i have the rage to Whirlwind and dance right back into Battle, keeping other mobs on me, and continue to widdle down, the rest of the mobs with Mortal strike etc.
---
I've not only managed to hold threat with mobs better this way, but i've managed to be top in DPS at the same time as 'tanking' and most healers tell me its not hard to keep me alive doing this as i always ask before we start if it's okay i tank this way.
---
I've never wiped all the way through SM doing this, and never been last in DPS, I even out dps'd hunters  3 levels higher than me doing this and being top on my meter.
---
I call my strat DPS Tanking :D
---
It means you can also play the original version of Warcraft III.  
---
But you are looking at Warcraft 3, not World of Warcraft. Two different games.
---
Been playing with a shammy friend who carried me through quests thankfully
---
Is there a way to reset the instance and have the desired results of the /camp reset instance macro from private servers (logging in at entrance or close to entrance to dungeon)?
---
Tfw you've cleared UBRS but can't get a group for strat live
---
Weird, on PC I can see it just fine
---
&gt;warriors are absolutely trash at tanking dungeons ....
---
Unless this guy is trolling, I think he means that doing dungeons as prot warrior low level can be an uphill battle due to threat generation.  The consensus among warriors is that while leveling, arms spec is the way to go for tanking dungeon content while leveling.  You have better rage generation and conservation through Anger Management, you can stance dance more effectively with Tactical Mastery, and you get sweeping strikes which helps with aggro as well.  You stay in defensive stance, spam sunders, revenge procs, and keep demo shout up. Easy peasy.
---
The mitigation you lose from not having a shield, is less taxing on healer's mana than not being able to hold aggro and the healer having to heal five people instead of one.
---
&gt;play prot paladin
---
Ok, now I know he is just trolling.... :)
---
I like the idea of selfsufficient and because I play with my brother and a couple dudes, I get enchanting so we all can skip the ‚Äúlooking for enchanter‚Äù step.
---
Is that wise or should I just have gone for another prof and make gold
---
That's like, less than half of the vendor price for good water haha. I'd happily pay 20s for a stack.
---
Yeah but that is a communication issue. Not a spell cleave issue, I feel. But I guess it's a good thing to blame when you have uncommunicative people in your dungeon groups
---
guild  raid of BRS is awesome. That is a guild that is going places! This is how you keep your max lvl players!
---
Got mine before even hitting 60. And i got 60 Saturday 7th of September.
---
Just do quest, keep mining up to your level, sell to HV mithril, stones, thorium and arcane cristals.
---
Profit.
---
had to leave for dinner mid-pull, as is tradition.
---
how to change it? sorry im new on reddit
---
I agree with this assessment. The wings of Scarlet Monastery are a bit different since I think most groups run multiple wings.
---
Graveyard: 15 minutes
---
Library: 20-30 minutes
---
Armory: 30-60 minutes
---
Cathedral 30-60 minutes
---
Right. Theres a good amount of exclusion at max for gear based on spec. Really sucks. I dont mind competing with ret pallies for items, just because they are less optimal than a warrior doesnt mean they shouldnt get gear they participated in. Let people play what they want and then worry about it when the group stops working.
---
Classicast is by far my favorite. These guys invite all type of guests to their show (including devs!) and its been great so far.
---
Pets are also glitchy; I had a cat which would never auto attack if the target was moving, i recently had a croc which would move at light speed (this stopped the moment it was de-summoned via using a flight path) and all pets just seem to stand over the bodies of things they kill for about 5 seconds after killing it.
---
The correct answer is revive pet
---
You know I try to avoid add ons but.. this really piques my interest. Could be a lot of fun I will save this an may try it out.
---
Ah lifetap. Slap me in a group with a couple spriests, tell the healer to only throw the occasional hot rather than panic heal when my health takes a sharp turn down, and watch the DPS flow :D
---
Yeah I just figured out yesterday that you can make lesser magic wands up until lv 100, and I think I made money. 10 lesser magic was selling for 45s, each wand vendors for 5s8c and it got me to lv 100 and I made money.
---
I inspect people's gear while waiting for the zep. If I see they are a priest without a wand or a hunter with a low level now, I'll send them a random higher level green I have. Most mail back ty, but some find me out in the wild and recognize my name.
---
On my priest I like to slow fall from above players and save/help them with a mob I know is trouble at their level.
---
Yep. Just hit 40 with 225 ench and 200 tailoring. But I‚Äôm glad I picked them, I think it should net me more gold at 60, and I‚Äôm okay with not getting my mount right at 40 if it meant being so behind in enchanting that I could DE something
---
The journey to 60 isn't difficult. It's time consuming, those two things are not the same. Sure difficult things tend to take a long time but the reverse isn't always true. 
---
When leveling to 60 there's seldom a time when you're expected to improve your skill at the game to over come a challenge. A lot of the time simply playing better doesn't do anything for you when you find a challenge that's to hard. The correct answer is to go off and get more levels so it's easier.
---
BfA raids at their hardest difficulty are, in my mind, easily superior to Classic raids at their hardest difficulty.
---
Finally!
---
Truu. I learned the dumb way and put some points into improved heroic strike (only 2) but I can justify it by saying that it makes tanking as Arms (lvl 46 atm) a little bit easier :P
---
He was rocking hunter and said nothing before just outright needing it.  Its spirit strength.  That's not hunter gear.  Not to mention we both were in mid 20s and it's a level 18 item.  He definitely could've found better.  I'm not saying he wouldn't have used it but dont immediately need on something you dont need.  That was a greedy roll.
---
Only bad mages die while aoeing. You can easily kite 5-6 mobs in a group where youre the only mage. If youre 2 mages you can basically pull as many mobs as you like since you can kill them before you run out of mana
---
You can go offline?
---
Problem is spamming WW/cleave/SS is the only way "warrior dps" is viable pre raid levels of gear. If you have the misfortune of tanking a group with a warrior dps (and why the hell do you? you're the tank make your own group with real dps classes) the only sane way you can deal is just let the warrior take advantage of their plate gear to survive their extra incoming damage while you keep what you can under control.
---
Op sounds like he needs attention- you shall get none from us warriors
---
I enjoy the well thought out pulling of a normal group, keeps things less hectic and you have a more classic experience. Why rush through shit and not have fun? Is the 2 minutes it saved time really going to make a difference? 
---
Thanks for always being open to tanking, you guys are hard to come by.
---
Yeah OP admitted he was wall jumping "To just explore"
---
Everyone else is abusing the glitch mods. I was just exploring. Ban everyone else please. - OP 2019
---
Oh, you're the tank. Definitely arena runs, maybe throw the giant in there, too if you trust the party. I hate fighting the giant because those pulls can go wrong in so many ways, though.
---
because turbocleave, plaguecleave, dynamitecleave and rambocleave were already taken
---
fair enough
---
aye. as a priest player i loathe healing warriors in dungeons. their aoe threat is extremely lackluster. paladin or even bear are much better. love a good innervate from a tank druid
---
Turn off pet sounds?
---
More so than the recipe listed in the other comment, the quest to raise your cooking skill past 225 involves getting 12 of these eggs. Other ingredients are also required, but not as sought after.
---
back in wotlk i dueled a 44 hunter out front org while i was on my 19 hunter.  turns out whoever knows to use fear beast will win.  it also might have helped i had more hp than him
---
Ask a guildie for some Tailoring bags BUT offer a profession item in return. Or a BoE green. I.e: piece of LW gear, some potions, etc. That's the only way I can think of you not having to spend money. Then again, the mats might cost a few copper or silver. Some guildies might give you a discount on the bags instead. Either way, I think you'll have to get lucky with a bag drop or drop some silver on one from a vendor or guildmate.
---
Maybe before they fixed the 10 man dungeon bug. I did a 3mage, 1 warlock, 1 priest zombie runs 2 days ago and it‚Äôs nowhere near 90k. Maybe 50-60k tops because you‚Äôre having to run a lot resetting the instance. If you can provide a video where someone is doing 90k per hour I‚Äôd believe you
---
Oh golly i cant wait
---
You say seals but seals only help you. Even if taking the judgments into account their benefits are pretty marginal, and I would say the same about auras. That is if you aren't using sanctity, of course.
---
Poisons....
---
Are you playing warlock? I‚Äôve noticed that imp buffs everyone around him with blood pact so if some pulls mobs past you your imp gives them blood pact buffing them thus the mobs attack you.
---
Requesting a key binding to open to-do window and put cursor into the text-field, thanks in advance!
---
Wait, it is not allowed to dot /attack from the top of buildings anymore ?
---
If true, that's retarded.
---
That's shocking and also not that surprising. The market is probably just super saturated, which caused competition to keep lowering their prices. Some people are actually incredibly dense when it comes to AH prices and selling their goods for profit. All the time I see people super undercut their product or even put the bid price WAY too low just to get seen first on the search list.
---
I'm sure it'll even itself out eventually and the prices will go up a little after a couple days-week(hopefully)
---
1. Is there a list for items in the game now, for instance want to know quickly if Old Weather journal for fish tracking is in game and can be farmed
---
2. Is there a BIS website that goes BY LEVEL? I‚Äôm a 43 Warlock, is crafting Dreamweave worth or is there something better at my level from a dungeon or quest?
---
I can only find level 60 BIS lists
---
I've had to modify what I knew about tanking in Classic quite a bit.  I wanna preface this, I'm Arms spec, wearing full tank gear.  Battle Stance Macroed to have my decent two-hander and Defensive stance Macroed to throw on Sword and Shield.    I charge in, Sweeping Strikes, Zerker Stance, WW.  This initial bomb of damage skyrockets my threat A LOT. Right after the WW bomb goes off, I hit Defensive Stance, Shield Block, and spam Demo Shout while Revenging mobs.  I then start using Sunder Armor on mobs as needed.  Often times by this point, many of the mobs are close to dying and maybe 1 or 2 have decided to latch on to the mage.  I just taunt them back towards me and keep them piled up.    It is a different game then what we remembered.
---
Thank you for using it!!
---
Visit your trainer to see if new spells or upgrades to your current spells are available. Guards in major cities can tell you where those trainers are.

---
Mages are responsible for more than just dps. Cc, decurse, and yes making food and water for other casters
---
As a mage, I hate these guys. I'm AoE talented but I don't do AoE in dungeons. I may not do a ton of dps spamming frostbolts but not dying is more important than speed. Slow means smooth and smooth means fast. Also, every mana user gets 2 stacks of water, no questions asked.
---
I always have several stacks of water. I do expect a mage who I am grouping with to provide mage food if I ask nicely! Never had a mage say no or try to charge me - surely a dungeon is a collaborative effort, I don't charge for buffing fort etc ;)
---
The funny thing is it saves way more than 10s over the course of a dungeon run as I can take short drinks and allow the tank to chain pull without burning precious mount money. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face ;)
---
Yes, I was just going to type this. Leatrix replaces many other addons. Leatrix can also dismount you.
---
I will agree with you on this. There are indeed dungeons, or parts of some dungeons, that are made much easier with spell cleave groups. On could also argue that it is even perhaps **too** effective.
---
My main issue is not with these groups, but with the fact that some people find it hard to adjust with regular groups after spending so much time only using AoEs.
---
Beyond 40 you definitely need to make stamina a priority on all mail gear, be spec‚Äôd for it (armor boost, shield boost, stoneskin totem boost) and make sure not to pull too much at once, but it‚Äôs definitely doable. It‚Äôs a challenge I‚Äôve set for myself in classic though - tank every 5 man at least once, not being over-leveled.
---
Not only is this something that happened in vanilla, but there's even a term for it that was borrowed from Everquest and was defined in the game's manual alongside other common terms.
---
"Train: To lead monsters so that they will attack another player."
---
this advice is in every post like this along with hundreds of YouTube videos.
---
The thing is you didn't miss anything. Everyone who is getting downvoted in this thread is correct it is no longer in the TOS.
---
On top of this the questions been asked multiple times and I mean multiple times on the blizzard forum with high visibility and blizzard has not responded. Like I said in my other post it clearly isn't high priority for them.
---
If it were bannable we would have seen a response from blizzard on one of the 40 pre launch question posts on the topic.
---
But I can 100% see blizzard wanting to see how it played out then take a stance on it which imo is not the correct thing to do.
---
They cant make the jump and then report people who can. Sad.
---
As a Paladin when I see this happen it's time to cast Divine Intervention and not lose durability.
---
Kite backward when they drop a bomb, or immediately target and focus down the bomb.
---
Tanking is pretty difficult in classic, your party has to work with you and let you get agro before unleashing full DPS. I don't have any other tips but maybe tell your party to lay off for 5 seconds while you gather the mobs and you should be alright. Also healers tend to let you get really low in classic because of how mana regen works so that might be why you feel youre taking so much damage.
---
Hey guys, I'm a poor Hunter. Please support me on Patreon. I'll spend the donated money on Food for my Pet some Arrows and Water thx, Granok.

How necessary are dungeon quests? I know a lot of them give great rewards and xp, but it seems like most of them are at the end of a long quest chain. Seems like such a hassle to figure out where the chain starts, and grind it out just for leveling gear. I know the first answer "do what you find fun" but from a meta perspective is it considered a waste to just run dungeons for the sake of it?
---
Also do you only run dungeons that are in your faction's zone? For instance Wailing Caverns has an amazing druid set, but I'm alliance and it's never mentioned in LFG. I know you're not going to get to Ragefire Chasm as alliance or stockades as horde but what about the ones in open or contested zones?
---
Does advanced interface options actually let you increase nameplate distance? I was using the script to increase it before that was fixed, living with ~20 yard nameplates now is infuriating as a ranged class
---
I would recommend marksmanship hunter. It does solid damage, has great utility in PvP once you learn all the tricks, and stringing together a lucky set of crits can wreck people.
---
When my Aimed Shot and Multi-shot crit back to back its about 60-75% of someones health that is my level.
---
Or just buy a Naga or knockoff and bind it to a button.  Hell, you don't even need an MMO mouse, just as long as it has extra buttons. Or be like the rest of us and bind it to the middle mouse button.
---
The thing is spellcleave groups don't even need a tank. They don't care about aggro. They work on kiting and killing everything before it can kill them.
---
The issue is mages playing in a spellcleave style when they don't have the dmg from the rest of the group to back it up. Now you have aggro on 8 mobs who all have half hp and aren't dying any time soon cuz ur about to be oom. Good job
---
Ive thought about this as well due to how stupid high dps and dmg that staff gives.  When i got it i was a little sad knowing other melee classes would kill for this damage and im going to keep using peacemaker while raiding lol.
---
WoW players acting rudely...well this is new.
---
I find 20-30 pretty boring. I started having a lot of fun again at 32.
---
Saving this for later tonight. Thanks for the write-up
---
Thanks, like  [onetwo3four5](https://www.reddit.com/user/onetwo3four5/) mentioned though would leveling in ele be better? It'd mean the gear works for both? (with enh, wouldn't I need agi gear?)
---
/cast [combat]Feign Death;
---
/cast Freezing Trap
---
Honestly you could probably get away with not tipping. Not many people tip me and I still give it away. Not saying don't tip. But you couuld get away with it.
---
Oh, I get it, but I actually find the 1 to 20 leveling experience to be pretty entertaining.  Especially as an ult I can drop a few gold on to make it smooth.  The game really starts to feel grindy about 37ish. It only gets worse from there.  So when I get sick of the grind on my main, I can level a hunter.
---
Farming elementals for their crafting mats is good. They sell for a lot right now. Either in silithus or un gorro
---
GM probably doesn't know much about the game itself. It's Activision now, not blizzard GMs we used to love.
---
&gt;MMOs should not be about being hard, but about getting together as a community and overcoming obstacles.
---
If it's not hard, then is it really an obstacle?
---
Holy is not my main spec, but so far I've been waiting until I am the "recommended" level for dungeons for a two reasons:
---
* If gear drops, I don't have to wait to equip it
---
* I have a bigger mana pool and don't have to drink as much
---
This is standard practice IMO, or at least...it should be at 60. I can't imagine wasting someone's time and not giving them at least some kind of tip. Especially four stacks of water...you can't get that cheaply from a vendor! I'm almost relieved I'm not 60 'cause I couldn't deal with constant demands for water/food/ports right now. If I'm logging in, it's to do what I wanna do, not get sidetracked for three hours.
---
What source are you expecting? An article by Forbes or from blizzard saying *jk guys no one got banned.*?
---
Many in my guild have kept their loot and gold and so have many of my ingame friends. I'm not ratting anyone out tho if that's what you mean. Snitches get stitches bro.
---
Im really kicking myself for not rolling mage.  I was a warrior main throughout vanilla up to MoP but I was always really good at mage/rogue as well.  I figured I'd be "useful" as a warrior for tanking and therefore able to get good exp in groups since I knew questing was going to be a shitshow with the Horde to Alliance ratio skews on the server (Herod).  Little did I know that tanks are now, apparently, optional.
---
Leatrix Plus let's you move and resize everything.
---
TIL, thanks!
---
Thanks, think Ele would be the best then as the gear would work for both?
---
Lots of people ask me for portals, usually in quest areas without even realizing it costs me money to portal them. They seem upset about 25% of the time when I just ask them to pay for the material, some will even just say nevermind. It's a little weird but I geniuelly think a lot of people don't even realize it costs a material.
---
Also battle res for druid costs a material. Saw this mage get mad our healer, a druid, who was the only one who could res, didn't just res the mage after a wipe. We tried explaining why we're all corpse running anyways and it would be a waste and they just left the group  instead. Some people man.
---
Get yourself into a party with a friend, you can log and when they get party lead can reset the instance remotely. When you log back in you'll be at the start with the instance reset. Warning though if you've hit your 5/hour cap you'll end up at your hearth location.
---
So that's where I went wrong, I assumed I knew basic math.
---
What if.. What if you were the one needing Triage but was fine the whole time and *I* was the one needing Triage? 
---
What if the Triage was the friends we made along the way? Wow. That's deep, right? Oh sorry, I didn't realize I was holding this the whole time - *passes spliff to you*
---
He's bored because people gave everything to him lol.
---
Especially if the dps warrior has upgraded shouts over my tank ass. Takes away my only effective aoe threat 
---
Then the tank is the bad guy who can‚Äôt hold aggro in their eyes. 
---
Tanking ain‚Äôt the same here in classic! If you‚Äôre dps and you‚Äôre taking too much aggro, it means you‚Äôre not doing your simple ass dps job. Which is to do as much damage as possible with out aggroing. 
---
Especially if you‚Äôre a mage, but everyone should have a threat tracker instead of a damage tracker (or both)
---
God this stuff pisses me off so much. My friend was a healer and he was lagging, as I convinced the group to stop doing AOE in uldaman. I end up dying bc my friend couldn‚Äôt heal through the lag. The mage then says ‚Äúsee? If I don‚Äôt do aoe they hit you for too long and you die‚Äù Like bruuhhhhh
---
Anecdotal story time.
---
I first learned about RP chat communities in the mid 90s on Prodigy Classic internet.  My friend was into it.  I thought it was mostly silly.  I was 15 and kind of trollish.  I played a long for a little bit, just to see what it was all about.
---
One random Pool Party room or something, I was RPing like a typical trollish teenager and someone was trying to jump off something into a pool and I 'forced the story' as you described by doing something like pushing them right as they were about to jump into the pool.  They followed up my actions with subsequent RPing about how they landed awkwardly and died rather than ignoring the annoying teenage troll like I expected them to.
---
People at the party 'got mad at me' and the person who died PMed me about 'why would you do something like that?  I spent a few weeks on this character and now it's all for nothing' and seemed honestly annoyed with me. 
---
It was my first real experience with chat RPers and it was rather surreal, to be honest.  I would have ignored the hell out of someone acting the way I did.
---
Consecration?
---
Right?! hahaha
---
He'll be fired soon. Watch.
---
An Ironwood seed is 20s as well, and you don't hear me bitching about using it to help the group. Just saying :)
---
I'm actually so freaking stupid, I never thought of doing that. God thanks for the tip, I'm gonna be doing that from now on.
---
Follow the priest leveling guide and it's basically no downtime with wands, bubbles, dots and heals. It's my favorite for solo. Druid is a close second.
---
You can. Like the other guy said, theres a turn off pet sounds option in settings
---
I'll check it out. Does it work with Bartender?
---
That's it? She doesn't even look fat or chubby or anything, just has a slightly fuller face I guess?
---
Well Idk about you, but I do dispense water for my instance/raid partners, but it gets annoying when I'm getting requests for it in orgrimmar/on a zeppelin/from randos outside an instance/etc.
---
okay so that happened every single time then, fair enough /s
---
Can I ask why you need all of those modifiers? I haven't required any macros with such extensive parameters.
---
You can tame it while it's asleep, just retame after the sleep cast interrupts it.
---
I helped many hunter get the wolf in lbrs by sheeping it first and they tame the sheep.
---
I played over a mobile hotspot while on vacation... a whole evening was like 200MB of data usage. But one night, my notebook must have thougt, oh nice im on wifi and decided to load a 9GB windows update in the background...
---
Some say he's still there, training more and more Artisan First Aid Responders for the wars to come
---
This is the most underrated comment here.
---
if they do aoe pulls there is absolutely no chance you'll come close to their dps haha. Actually the ST spec and the spellcleave spec have a lot in common. Both are reliant heavily on shatter and ice shards. Your specs probably aren't as different as you think
---
I hit 60 and had some good sex. 
---
I mean it was with my hand but still
---
This makes sense, I rolled on a PvE server and have a level 40 now, lore feels great but I feel like I made a mistake, I even started a new toon on a PvP server because i think id enjoy it more
---
Fate of every healer including myself as a Holy Paladin. Healing myself and wondering why the other guy is slowly dying.
---
Until 40 they are probably even.. after 40 shadow is pretty sick to level with
---
A mage complaining looooooool
---
They made you download bartender?
---
And what quest is that?
---
Oh man I did not know that, so any of the rare BiS gear (archmage robe, pattern of the void, truefaith vestmensts) are all bound to you once you make them? thats some shit...
---
So it makes sense, lore-wise, that Orcs and Nelves would be murdering each other in droves in WSG, but not at the border of the Barrens/Ashenvale which is literally right outside? 
---
I don't fuck with PVP servers anymore, but they are definitely more "lore accurate".  Just because the nations are at "peace" doesnt remove individual agency.
---
Not my guild, so i don't know.
---
Are you kidding me? I just told you.
---
Please teach me about the holy cogitator, brofessor.
---
should i be selling green-blue items on the AH or vendor them ? how do i know the value of an item
---
That's the AH price of the devilsaur skins.
---
Cool, thanks for the tips!
---
I don't really care if you believe me or not, 90k/hour was the norm for experienced spellcleave groups. If you haven't been following spellcleave groups, why the fuck are you trying to form an opinion on it and claiming that people who HAVE followed that meta are wrong? You abused demo shout bug, not 10m groups because it was ineffective in ZF and easier to just have 5 people in later dungeons. Do your research, the exp/hour is out there for experienced groups.
---
I mean playable undead are all human skeletons.
---
But did you know you only have to type /e for the custom emote?
---
sounds like the gm suffers from autism. sorry op.
---
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre hoping, we‚Äôre going for everyone‚Äôs sake, if someone is done with the gear there, they‚Äôll keep going until their guildies are sorted too. Cooperation is the most important thing to us. 
---
Keep going with pugs and you might never get your gear, go with your guild and you will get it eventually, the proudest moments were people passing on gear they needed for people that needed it more.
---
You can do it with the default UI in raid options. Enable raid-style party frames and then you can drag the party frame anywhere on the screen (click the button that shows up on the left side of your UI and unlock the party frame). I also prefer raid-style party frames for the minimalist view and class-colored health bars, showing % health, etc.
---
Personally, I don't think any of those are great as a gold farming alt. Rogue is probably the best; but druid and shaman both get shoehorned into healing late game so it'll be pretty redundant on your priest. Druids are OK open world farmers, but are very limited on dungeon farm; and aren't as good as hunter/lock for solo content.
---
Mage, Hunter, Warlock, and Rogue are really the 4 classes people talk about when bringing up gold farming characters. Rogue and warlock are honestly second-class behind mage and hunter; with hunters being able to do Mara Princess/DM trib solo and Mages being able to AoE farm and/or DM lashers. Rogues can pickpocket farm BRD, which I heard was nerfed vs. PServers but I'm not 100% on, and warlocks are just a slightly less easy mix between hunters and mages in terms of what's good to farm on.
---
Also Idk what you are talking about with druid, they are arguably the best solo open world PvP class in the game? Their kit is immense; and they have no hard counters.
---
&gt;Ffs just mash that frostbolt button, then you also won't be oom after 3 mobs and skip fighting the next pull while you drink.
---
Frostbolt is less mana efficient against three enemies.
---
Hey man Omni CC is built into the game.   
---
Go to Interface  
---
ActionBars  
---
Then Click Show Numbers for Cooldowns.
---
You should be crying and yelling at your dps to focus down one target at a time.
---
Switch to 2h tanking for more rage and threat.
---
Charge, defensive stance, demo shout, tab sunders. That's all you can really do. Throw a thunderclap in at the start if you're feeling it.
---
The combination of lack of skills to actually get good aggro at those levels and people going ham on dps almost instantly makes it kind of a pain to tank as warr. Try to get your shouts going to get initial aggro then try to land sunders on various targets as rage permits. I got a bit discouraged with tanking at first but now at Maraudon I finally feel like I can generate decent AoE threat and play the traditional tank in WoW.
---
Best class for enjoyment. They really can do everything well enough. Just ignore the oomchicken... my alt is a warrior to lvl with a friend
---
Cutyodiksoff
---
Go to the UI subreddit and it's pretty much all people asking for help with elvui.
---
I prefer not being dependent on one addon for everything. Right now, if one addon breaks it's no big deal, I just wait for a fix or get another one.
---
With elvui you're stuck and out of control
---
Blue you should always sell on ah. Green depends on the stats
---
If it has stats that make sense, like str+Stam on a mail piece it's probably worth something. If it's agi and str on a cloth piece, probably vendor or DE it. 
---
As for value, look at what similarly leveled pieces of gear of the same type are going for on the AH. There probably won't be another vicious waraxe of the tiger, but there will probably another 2 handed weapon of the same level, so check what it's going for and price it like that.
---
And that's how guilds should work.  We don't run any enhance shams as we have an abundance of melee already (rogues/wars), but if another guild takes them and has designated them as getting the eye should it drop, it shouldn't be my place to tell them what they should do with their loot.
---
Please tell you you renamed to 'Cutyodiksoff' or something
---
Dire maul
---
&gt; Healers are never the bottleneck unless you're terrible.
---
If you have a melee cleave group and the healer is your only caster, you are going to add a considerable amount of down time running with a lower level caster.
---
For example, I only need to drink 2-3 times now through an entire arena / angerforge / golem run. Basically just before bosses. A 50 priest is going to drink 5 times more often.
---
What do you play where caster drinking time is never a bottle neck in your groups...? That's like, THE bottleneck for shaving time off runs.
---
False, the best rule is to Auction everything you can, and vendor the rest. As a rule, almost anything that is not grey in name can be sold for more than vendor price on the AH. Not always true but it helps.
---
Gathering professions might be the best. Fishing, mining, herbalism, and skinning all provide good money for the materials you can farm at level 40.
---
i've never understood why you would gear people on the premise of 'helping out the raid' in classic. sure there are probably a few niche items which help hugely on specific classes but for the most part it doesn't matter, you can 1shot every boss in full blues
---
Yes, I think that's what I'd like to see, a small number that changes as I get closer or further away. Since I'd like to use a raptor strike now and then, between autoshots, this will help.
---
I wasnt this excited for a game since WoW wotlk!
---
If you were on my server, I'd conjure it for free, or at least cheap. I always trade tons of water in questing zones to randoms; as soon as I log in, I try to make a bunch of extra stacks to hand out. If I'm on a boat and not multitasking, I'll make lower leveled stacks to trade to lowbies also. Some people don't care, but most are happy to receive it.
---
Me, bearing down on them on horseback: \*YEETS WATER INTO THEIR BACKPACK\*
---
As a 4k io warlock for the last couple of expansions and a current classic mage. I‚Äôm perfectly content to press 1-frostbolt for eons and top the meters while hunters and warriors pull aoe threat and die. Whenever I do decide to aoe (like mara) it‚Äôs insane, everything dies, and I just iceblock if it don‚Äôt. Reminds me of legion lock aoe with leggos
---
Ok, cause im still tryna get the hang of it, for me, i try and let void build aggro, but she just goes for me, doesnt cast fart enough for me to build distance and just chases me down and wacks me. Also u say its easier with ds/ruin but every video guide is specced in affliction so could u explain the advantages of going ds?
---
What is the level range on a zf gy run?  Think I'm ready to just mindlessly kill mobs for a level or two.
---
server maturity and size too probably matters
---
mine was released 1 week after launch and is still Low even on sunday nights
---
so the economy is real shit for such advice
---
Eh, no thanks!  I don‚Äôt want an underleveled healer face pulling stuff when they are 7 levels below the average mob level just because they don‚Äôt want to wait another level or two to get a dungeon done. And no, you won‚Äôt do better with your healing gear in BRD at level 48 than a healer that‚Äôs level 54.. just no.
---
Small Indie Company BTW
---
Hahahahah awsome!!
---
The best rule is to Auction everything you can, and vendor the rest. As a rule, almost anything that is not grey in name can be sold for more than vendor price on the AH. Not always true but it helps.
---
This guy needs to be let go
---
I do use Bartender but I haven't tried moving its bars with Leatrix since you can move the bars with BT4 alone. The only thing I move is the tooltip and buffs/debuffs.

You: I wasn't up there

Also you: I was just exploring up there

Snitches get stitches - GameMaster ThugLyfe
---
Yeah thats fair of course. I can‚Äôt imagine too many people interested in blitzing their way to 60 ASAP are still reading guides on Reddit tho lol
---
Sub/Assassin is for sure better for PvP than Combat, IMO. You get the improved stealth and the high striking openers.
---
You will probably want to branch out at 40 to get arcane talents such as clear casting, but yes that is a good way to go.
---
Oh cool. I bet it's a bug and they will patch it, but everyone who killed it gets to keep their stuff and now everyone who didn't have tons of free time gets a way harder encounter.
---
:(
---
Touche, but at the time, the only options available were a 4gb GTX or some inbuilt intel shit, so I feel like I chose the better of the two.
---
yesterday I saw an undead rogue named surprisesex and he's like level 35. It's only a matter of time I think
---
Shit man. If yours was only 10g, feel lucky.  I looked into buying the charms I need and it was going to be \~25 gold total.
---
It's going to be tough.  Everyone and their uncle is clearing Rag.  The very first time I went to MC with a pug and cleared everything we could without the rep, I knew there was going to be a problem.  There's no "get stuck on this boss and grind it out" feeling there is with harder raids.
---
Renting a car would be like buying speed potions. This is more like buying a bicycle instead of a car =)
---
Hillsbrad is the best spot, but there are too many players so no point in doing aoe. Just quest to 30 then do SM graveyard, library, armory then cath to 43. Then do ZF to 51. Then you can do some quests one or two zf runs. Then at 52-53 you can start farming BRD.
---
Can‚Äôt find the server Patreon, is it PVP?
---
automatic splash clicking = ban
---
I'm a lvl 30 night elf hunter and I've hit a slow point in questing to. What do I do, and how should I better progress with questing?
---
Whats the name of this naming texture addon? Is it for chat too?
---
Yeah my kid is painfully shy. But good memory and great reflexes. I'd rather see him in an MMO than playing Fortnite. He won't even advertise in chat for a guild but if he gets in a good one he could be a real asset.
---
I killed about 10 while leveling on kromcrush. The price dropped drastically from what it was and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really worth the time to actively hunt them down and fight for them at the current price.
---
Rad, thank you!   
---
I've gotten some good advice here. I'm hoping things will even out as I'm now getting those Resto talents.   
---
To be honest i didn't realize that Druid Tanks were copacetic. I was doing it in the 20s with WC/SFK/BFD, but after that block i saw a lot of "Warrior Tanks Only" sentiment in LFG. I'll just start my own groups and see how that goes!
---
Offended?
---
This GM is a fucknut.
---
Nice
---
I would assume if you don't log you're still in an active instance so it cannot be reset - by logging out the game generates a new instance ID and plops you at the entrance when you log back in
---
Prot warr holy priest is exactly what I'd recommend; possibly switching one of you to a druid for a little bit of added flexibility. Really, any tank/healer combination will work great; and you'll be able to fill groups very quickly.
---
Lucky I rolled a mage then :D
---
deletedelete D:
---
Hasn't worked for me
---
Maxcam addon works though for camera zoom, when AIO didn't work
---
Oh seems like you might suck at wow
---
That is pretty much early frost mages only rotation.
---
If you want to switch it up to large groups/more intricate rotation you can build for aoe-farming which focuses on cone of cold, nova, and blizzard.
---
‚Äú2h warrior tank‚Äù ~ this has been my experience with every tank we‚Äôve had since RFC. Do warriors not like using sword and board anymore?
---
This is 100% the case. Ived noticed the level curve is lower compared to that of our no rp counterparts. RPers like taking their time.
---
&gt;everything is running fine, albeit a little old (2013 old)
---
When is the last time you removed the plastic case from your GPU and cleaned out dust / lint / hair that gets trapped inside? If air isn't flowing correctly through the case it can cause overheating. 
---
For whatever reason, my thermometer was showing a stable temperature even when my last card was overheating. I saw similar texture problems for a while and they kept getting worse. I realized it was a problem when I could smell burning plastic one day - while the status monitor I was running said the temperature was fine. 
---
You may want to take a look at your hardware and feel the outside of the plastic case - if its hot to the touch (not warm, hot) you probably need to clean it out.
---
Sorry, but you are fucking awesome!
---
Thank you for doing this!
---
maybe find a guild and have them do it while you can get to level 19, 20, 21, and 22 in that time...
---
As someone leveling a warrior (currently 49) I would much rather give a player character 20 silver for a stack of food vs buying it from vendor where it is way more expensive.  Dungeons is a whole other monster, but for questing I think its kinda rude not to tip for food/water considering how much you would spend at a vendor and that players time.
---
Technically every class in WoW Classic benefits from grouping up with someone else*, except Hunters who level fastest by themselves.
---
However his point was that if you have a kill quest you would normally kill **X** mobs and then another person would kill **X** mobs and you'd both get  **Y** experience.   
---
When you group up though, you kill **X** mobs together but only receive roughly **Y/2** experience.
---
Essentially, the "proper" way to do kill-quests is to go berserk on the area and kill at least twice as many mobs. This is still going to be faster than killing 12 yourself though because a team of two is very efficient.   
---
Unless you're a Hunter that is, because Hunters are already very efficient :)
---
\* This assumes the two players adopt a playstyle complimenting each other.
---
You know that is a really stupid comment right? People gain weight for all kinds of reasons, none of which have to do with depression. Medication, certain health issues like poly cystic ovaries or autoimmune disorders can also cause weight gain. Pregnancy causes weight gain. There are many other reasons, and I doubt that you are qualified to say as to why she gained weight.
---
I‚Äôve done 4 mage priest groups and 3 mage lock priest groups as well leveling far faster than the average player. Sure occasionally you get bad groups cause of bad coordination. Majority of the time it‚Äôs pretty amazing. 
---
I know it‚Äôs fotm to shit on mages right now but a lot of us are decent and just want to use our kit at it‚Äôs full capability
---
I mean, I could ask people to "bring their own kit" of healthpots and bandages, but it's vastly more efficient for everyone to just cast their spells to help each other.
---
Literally the only difference between water and healing spells is that one heals the green bar in combat the other the blue bar out of combat. Both help the group.
---
I remember in 2006 I was so annoyed by this quest and couldn't do it, until eventually after 5+ tries I got it. Now in Classic WoW I was stunned, "wait, this is it?", I just hotkey'd the item and went to bandage the npcs and got it in the first try. I don't know what I thought was so difficult about it back in the day ..
---
No lie. Wish he was heals and not a lock tho xD
---
It's really dependent on the item/server. Greens with the right stats can be sold for a decent bit more on the AH, but it's usually not more than 2-3x the vendor price. Blues usually should be sold on the AH, if not now then when battlegrounds get released in the next few months, when people start making low level alts for PvP and gear them out with the best stuff they can get.
---
I would look into installing Vendor Prices and Auctioneer addons. It'll tell you the vendor price and the estimated AH price of an item, and you can decide whether it's worth it or not then.
---
This is just pretty much entirely false. But okay
---
grats on 28
---
It'll be doable by most raiders.
---
Thats fine, i dont actually know much about hunter pvp. That being said, what youre talking about doesnt rly counter what im saying, because im saying that even tho TF isnt a max minned grab for a hunter i believe they should still get the chance to roll on it. Excluding people based on class when they can still use the weapon in a meaningful capacity is what i have an issue with.
---
Also, back to pvp for a sec, wouldnt possibly proccing the nature damage on TF be worthwhile if they close? I understand its not BiS, but it would still be very powerful, no?
---
You're responding to a joke. Literally like a "why did the chicken cross the road" joke and you're trying to give it an analytical answer.
---
If you don't know how to do it maybe? Its extremely exp efficient if done correctly
---
&gt;  premadana
---
it's primadonna btw
---
Also annoying as fuck after a few pulls.
---
Not a bad idea at all, I‚Äôm currently maining a hunter so didn‚Äôt feel like going through 1-20 again so soon. Maybe I will lvl another one in the future. But while you‚Äôre at it you should lvl to 21 so you can get both ranks of Pathfinder for +36% movement speed.
---
You're gonna hate level 50 dude... Look up a leveling guide and do every dungeon at least once with all the quests.
---
&gt;At level 60 cleaving is not common, don't sweat it. You'll be okay.
---
That's one of the answers I exepected, now I'm reassured a bit. Thanks.
---
&gt;Look I understand you're on a crusade against cleave groups because you want to be outraged at something

Remember in general that it's not because something does not bother you personally that it's not a big deal for others. Wow is a game, most people play it to have fun. If someone struggles to have fun because of a specific reason and says he's bothered at it, it's not "wanting to be outraged at something", it's expressing a worry over a game that he likes to play to have fun.
---
I had not that problem with hurried people in dungeons when I played in the past. If now it's a problem, I find it legit to complain over it in a forum.
---
And in the end, yes, life is life, and more and more people will stop playing wow classic if the issue eventually gets worse and worse. If you don't have any problem with that, then good for you, but we both have the right to have opinions without being said that we are crybabies. Thanks.
---
Not dangerous as compared to warrior leveling maybe. AP also literally doesnt increase your kill speed at lower levels so yeah, I‚Äôll take my cauldron stirrer (Source: Somebody who actually leveled a druid in classic, you‚Äôve leveled a warrior it seems.)
---
why does "the wipe begin" when "the mana ends"?
---
That like ratio
---
Wow, this sounds amazing. I'm definitely going to have to check out those videos. 
---
How is the leveling experience in general? Are you questing, or farming dungeons? Is it pretty slow trying to level up 5 characters at once?
---
Feel free to correct me
---
Dire maul isnt out? I saw multiple Dire maul LFGs in /4 yesterday
---
I have NP with them trying to sell food/water in cities. during dungeon  runs would be something else though.
---
I was doing BRD and realized my group of lvl 50s were going just as fast as a cleave group of 55s, because they always end up doing bigger pulls then we have to run back
---
i am defending paladins ability to tank aoe, because of their aoe abilities. they are bad at tanking bosses because they do not have a single target taunt and lack substantial defensive capability for niche scenarios like shield wall or last stand. 
---
in either spec, arms or prot, warriors are less effective at tanking large pulls without using a niche thorns based build, which even then is a store brand prot paladin. 
---
zero brain cells.
---
if it's so game breaking why not fix it when they went with the legion client?
---
So open warfare would be both sides nuking each other, full deployment of troops etc.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_related_to_the_Cold_War
---
Plenty of battles, skirmishes, and wars were on the periphery of the main Cold War.
---
Is there an easy way to keep track of when these all update?
---
To be fair, aside from dungeons I have no problem with mages charging for water. In the Badlands on my server there is often a level 60 mage who gives you water for 20s per stack. Having water that costs 25s per 5 for this sum is fully alright with me.
---
I would recommend you contact them because your account now has action on it for this and you obviously didn‚Äôt do anything.
---
Big problem is everyone thinks they're good. So many shit groups.
---
Today with what we know now?  It's not going to be rough unless you're in a guild that does every raid every week.
---
get ready for the classic circle jerk to begin
---
Mages are always squishy, you just need to master your abilities, or perhaps unlock more of them.
---
mah, boiz!!! For the Horde!!
---
I switched to ele from enh around 45 or so. I am very happy I did as I am building towards a resto gear set anyway. Had no trouble healing (or tanking) anything as enh until then as long as you have int gear. Ele is faster but you are very mana/water dependent.
---
Holy moly no joke. Probably prompted after realizing her huge mistake of leaving Riot.
---
Stay out of our dungoen and you wont have to ;)
---
I'm not entirely sure. I got my elvui from my friend. I customized the way it looks but he said he got it from platers from wago.io I'll see if I can get the link!
---
If you're only level 29 then you're way behind the multiboxers, who can level much much more quickly.
---
Nah dude... you killed 100 pigs and it took you 64 to correctly identify a liver after beating the pig to death with a hammer
---
On my server, herbs don‚Äôt sell for shit.
---
I‚Äôve put up many stacks of different herbs, and none of them sold.
---
It depends on a few things, but it isn't very much at all. Social media and streaming services use an ungodly amount in comparison
---
Oh, if you enjoy battlegrounds then the epic mount makes a big difference.  I forgot about that application.
---
Not even sure what we were looking at.
---
Yes I'm not sure how many mages did aoe cleave with priests and locks in dangeons but I'm sure some did. With the population of YouTube and twitch sure thing more start doing meta things. This is how the whole world is right now and that's totally fine.
---
I hate when this happens and it happens 80% of the time.
---
So it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm biased. I played a mage through MC to Naxx. 
---
I distinctly remember a huge shift when 1.11 game around. Gear was overall improved by the itemization passes and the talent overhaul had just gone live. Running older dungeons became zergfests pretty quickly, and grinding ZF through the 40s was absolutely a way to speed through that portion of the game.
---
It's the Armor... 260 Armor on a staff + 360% increase from Dire Bear Form is HUGE. The Defense also helps a ton, but the Armor is really why it's a BiS Item.
---
It works great but you need multiple good mages to do it
---
I have *heard* that this doesn't actually work for Smithing.
---
I cannot confirm myself though.
---
Same way a hunter uses a gun and an off hand, or a warrior using a bow and a two handed weapon, or a rogue using two daggers and a cross bow.
---
This is the reason I dropped mining as a profession for herb/alch. Mining routes get super saturated even on mildly populated servers depending on the hours. Herb to me feels like there's more potential spawn nodes per route/zone and You can always get great turnover for creating different elixirs/transmutes/flasks as opposed to relying on a raw goods market price
---
how much does it cost to make the food/water?
---
I've been in a few of these groups providing frost aoe coverage. Nobody was stroking their e-peen, mentioning damage meters, or masturbating to e-sports. We just enjoyed getting loot and experience quickly.
---
By all means stay out of these groups though! It doesn't sound like they're fun for you, and that's okay.
---
I‚Äôm too scared to even ask for food these days. I know it gets annoying being a vending machine. Just make my friend give me food when he‚Äôs on haha
---
That I agree with, I never expect the mage to make me food or water, I always bring my own. If they do I'll glad tip and thank them. Just like I come to dungeons with pots and a full quiver of ammo and in many instances when another hunter is there in the lower level zones I've had to give them ammo. 
---
I want go make the run as smooth as possible be the hunter they call when they need DPS.
---
Nope they stink don't  play one : ^ ]
---
I looked this up and there is an Azure silk belt that does 15% swim speed. Needs 175 tailoring and I‚Äôm going to assume silk to craft. Should be easy to get. 
---
I had no idea about this, so thanks üëç
---
based on their description of vanilla-like it should be allowed to get up there or any "wall-jump" location but just attacking seems to be what they are concerned with. The problem is, where do you draw the line? If both people are on top attacking eachother is it just PvP at that point?
---
Oh you don't have to, unless you want to.
---
Thanks, you're kind. Have a pleasant raid!
---
There's an Nvidia program you can download that works like a dash cam sort of. Records the last minute or so but if you do nothing it over writes itself, if you activate it, the last minute is saved.
---
don't have that for 95% of the levelling though haha
---
Then roll a holy Pali.  The whole I expect courtesy from others if I were them stuff is so hollow.
---
Does ench fall off after level 40 then? Seems seems as you get Stormstrike at 40! Worried now as I was playing to level as Ench to 60.
---
How's leveling been going as sub? I've been leveling as combat sword and it's super easy taking on multiple mobs, but PvP wise it's a little rough
---
technically i'm on top of a ledge that a guard can hit me on if they were close enough
---
That's definitely a good way to look at it :D
---
Mage: use your potion that you buy from AH for the sake of the group!
---
Also mage: why should i give him wather?
---
Oh man, a realistic voice in the PC thread. The three times in my life I struggled with weight gain I also was desparately trying to hide mental illnesses, mainly depression. Anectotal, yes, but food is an addiction, and in very many cases usually a form of a coping method.
---
The "this woman is strong, independent, big and beautiful who cares if she's size 24" atitude is so dangerous. Being obese is not healthy at all. It looks like she gained at least 50 pounds. Not. Healthy.
---
Well, not scared, but I understand.
---
God yeah, I've been in multiple dungeon runs where I won nothing at all, and hardly looted anything‚Äînot even cloth. RIP.
---
Feels balanced in number atm, although I still haven't went down to BB but only quested at north. I kinda dislike STV as an area, so I decided to leave it until 34-35 at least and try to get the XP elsewhere. 
---
So far the contested areas on Mograine felt pretty balanced to me, and I think it remains that way on higher levels as well. I'm in the biggest guild on the server and people are generally satisfied with faction balance.
---
The only thing that I dislike about Mograine is that it has the tendency to be full at peak playing times, like yesterday 9 PM I had 2000 people above me in queue and had to wait approx. 40 mins. It kinda pisses me off as Blizz is offering free realm transfer but most people would apparently rather wait.
---
RemindMe! 4 hours
---
Shimmering flats? PTSD intensifies
---
Auctioneer is another AH addon very similar. TSM4 is a big addon for AH data/management that supports classic, so that may be what you're looking for.
---
Honor system gets added so high levels will be a lot more active in pvp against other high levels. Right now if you're level 60 and go looking for pvp in places like Hillsbrad there's usually not much around besides a bunch of low levels to slaughter and that's not my idea of fun.
---
I'll add that +frost damage greens and wands can sell well.

As a shaman healer I only earth shock lvl 1 if they are channeling a heal/spell. And my highest earth shock if they are fleeing towards another group. There are occasions where I would immediately earth shock the second or third mob because it goes straight to channeling something that would in the long run cause me to waste more mana or prolong the fight. I don‚Äôt mind taking a few hits if it means canceling that spell. There‚Äôs only a problem when the tank ignores the mob after killing the initial targeted mob. Am I doing something wrong?
---
And You're just making claims that it's false. Lul
---
Git gud
---
There aren't many great feral items in MC, so sure, they drop off a bit until AQ where good feral gear can be found. Still, you can tank pretty much everything regardless.
---
Dungeons aren't great for making money unless you're doing lower level dungeons solo.
---
Which is basically impossible considering the jump, which you've clearly never done. Unless you're a mage you'd also die to the goblin guns before you managed to.
---
If you want a global rule, half of the terrain beyond street level of any city is exploiting, apparently. Good one.
---
Look up the definition of exploiting, simply being somewhere with no consequences to being there isn't exploiting.
---
I don't need vast intellect to understand simple logic, just the lack of a head injury, get it checked out.
---
You literally said "being up there avoids the guards and is an exploit" - now you're twisting it to claim your argument is about someone pulling aggro and THEN going up there to.. Lose it? Even though that's not really possible 9/10 for a mage, and not applicable to this discussion, it's very different to your original argument. Funny, that.
---
&gt;Go to the UI subreddit and it's pretty much all people asking for help with elvui.
---
Because people can't be bothered to Google "Elvui *description of problem*" and easily find the answer to their question.
---
That isn't at all what I said. Maybe you should read my comment again.
---
Realm caps and layers are two separate switches that Blizzard can control independently. Realm caps let more players on a server and affect how many people will have to wait in a queue. The number of layers is how many instances of the world the players on the server will be divided onto. Blizzard has already raised realm caps while simultaneously removing layers, which is proof that the two are not tied together in some 1:1 fashion (i.e. every layer must have 2000 players). The post you're referencing is talking about turning down both of these dials at the same time (decreasing realm caps in conjunction with cutting layers). The reason they were talking about this is because in the same post you're quoting they're talking about not wanting to raise realm caps now, forestalling the problem (requiring a decrease in realm caps in the future.) Turning down one dial does not necessitate turning down the other dial.   
---
I can find the blue posts if you want but one basically said "as players have spread out we have been able to cut layers. All servers are in the single digit numbers of layers and most servers are in the low single digits." (also note, the number of layers can vary server to server). Another blue post stated that they've raised player caps to help with queues.
---
I here talk about people wanting the next content released in about 1-2 months, am I‚Äôm thinking, I‚Äôll maybe have done MC once or twice at best by that time.  
---
Maybe that kind of timing in reasonable, but it feels fast.
---
Wolfshead is BiS for feral dps for all of classic. Even if you don't plan on being feral at 60 it probably isn't worth farming specific gear while leveling, just focus on getting to 60
---
So would you be okay rolling against the priest?
---
My time because i do nothing else all day
---
This. So many didn't understand that pulling MORE and dying ISNT FUCKING QUICKER THAN LESS AND LIVING.
---
I do this with my healer alt. My main is a tank, does quests and dungeons. Among my alts I have a hunter, who is my 'survivalist'. He does all the secondary professions, makes his own ammo, etc, so he stays out in the wild for long periods of time and sees almost no one. Works well when I don't feel like talking to people.
---
Then there's my priest. She exists for when I feel like being part of a social group, a team, yet I don't feel like a 60's dungeon on the tank. I load up the priest, find myself a group fairly quickly, and heal away.
---
I would recommend some kind of tank+healer pairing either way, would be easier for you guys to do dungeon groups then of course.
---
But why...  You kill immersion entirely...  If it's desirable to play less may be don't play at all.
---
Rng is being good yes ü§™
---
Can't say I've ever heard great things about Intel inbuilt graphics systems, works well enough for music production, but as someone who works in multiple digital visual art mediums, I needed something with a bit more power, and the inbuilt intel options just wouldn't have flown.
---
This has happened to me, I open a ticket to address an issue, get a canned responce, and they close the ticket before I can respond.
---
Looks like a Pinyata! Xd
---
To be fair, you‚Äôre just claiming it wasn‚Äôt a thing with no real evidence, so you‚Äôre kinda doing the same thing as OP except he‚Äôs at least mentioning balancing changes and gear adjustments, which did in fact happen.
---
Not interested in PvP either.
---
Guess that makes me and OP even? Aka nothing of value in this entire thread has been said.
---
/Spit, /lick, all those still work just the /e says makes a strange gesture.
---
I just can't feel bad for mages no matter how hard they try to make me do it.
---
This feels backwards:  
---
Why stop leveling and questing to earn nearly xp-less money? If you're going to be getting money and greens to sell from questing and gain levels AND your mount, how is this better?
---
Just dinged 40 last night and trained immediately and had 20g to spare, had bought the mount at 37.  Step 6 (DON'T BUY SKILLS) is the most important thing in this list.  As a rogue I bought skills when they were in the low silver range, after that only bought Sinister Strike and Evicerate.  I passed on all other skills.  Between this and vendoring greens and skins it was EASY to have enough gold.  No auction house, no intentional money making, nothing.  It's all about passing on those skills and not buying anything.
---
as a mage main, this makes me sad but it's 100% true.
---
PvP just gets worse.
---
Honestly if you don't like it, definitely switch to PvE. PvE RP servers are generally always a nice community.
---
You know what's ironic, this is the first month I've actually gone over my data cap (didn't know that was a thing) with comcast xfinity. They sent me an email showing how I was over like 10x the past 3 months usage in September, I also wonder if it has something to do with this?
---
Sorry? Not following
---
You said "But thank you for following up".  He was justified to end the chat.  Also, we don't have any proof that you *weren't* on the building.  So what exactly did the GM do incorrectly?
---
Blacksmithing isn't cheap either lol I have 280 and the most efficient way to level is 20 thorium per level so I am just leaving it there
---
I did brd yesterday with a lvl 55 warrior that already had it...
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x
---
Check 1.11.  Item revamp and talent overhaul for mages.
---
Two things:
---
A) Half of the people who play Classic, don't have pallies at there disposal.  You are speaking in absolutes without considering it isn't even an option for half the population.
---
B) I am sure prot pallies have an easier time with AoE threat, and saying " in either spec, arms or prot, warriors are less effective at tanking large pulls " I would agree with.
---
Saying warriors are "absolute trash at tanking dungeons" is hyperbolic and incorrect.  I think the problem is there is a ton parity in warriors that some other classes.  A dumbshit warrior who decides he wants to pretend to tank with a 2h, and doesn't understand mechanics, is going to make an awful tank.  But a warrior who understands why arms spec for tanking dungeon content is better than prot for leveling (tactical mastery, anger mangement, sweeping strikes, basically ways to hedge our lack of AoE threat) make for smooth dungeon runs.
---
That‚Äôs because The Green Tower is shit, simple as that.
---
That doesn't make mages assholes. You've got to make money somehow.
---
Yeah, works pretty well. Did a couple of Arms/Cath runs that way.
---
I mean that's the point, I have it bound to middle mouse but cba to hold shift or whatever to apply lures or equip stuff.
---
I'm a rogue, I always roll.
---
I believe they overlap the maintenance windows because that is when they do their weekly reboots and get ready for raid reset.
---
The servers may come up sooner than retail since they don't need to apply the patch to Classic.
---
The result is this:
---
Warriors are by far the most needed class for any group. This means you will have the shortest wait time to get in a group
---
Tanking is by far the most important group role. 
---
You will have to:
---
* Lead the group
---
* Mark kill targets
---
* Mark crowd control targets
---
* Make sure the healer has mana before each pull
---
* Know when to use your major cooldowns (warriors have some of the most powerful cooldowns that are on the longest cooldown timers)
---
It can be a stressful job and patience is very important. You will have to "manage" the players in your group quite often.
---
As for dealing damage, they don't do very well compared to other classes unless you are wearing the best gear available. As a hunter I do more damage with auto shot and multi-shot (which is not much effort at all).
---
They are rough to level as they take a lot of damage every fight and you will go through quite a lot of food. This is why you see posts of people talking about rolling a warrior and grouping with a friend who is a healer. This is a great combo and ensures nearly instant groups for any instance (DPS are extremely common).
---
I'm sure I missed something but if you have any questions feel free to ask me.
---
The same goes for most 50+ zones, although it's been pretty terrible ever since 45. Tanaris was pretty dead, too.
---
Even for vendor food, multiple gold per day seems excessive unless your pet is dying a lot. Make sure you're getting the full effect of each piece; wait until the "feed pet effect" buff drops off your pet before feeding them again or sending them into combat. It takes 20 seconds for them to finish eating.
---
Someone told me that even unlearning the profession entirely doesn't work for Blacksmiths
---
They don‚Äôt have enough and guys who work on that team have all but admitted so. 
---
This particular issue they don‚Äôt even want to waste time enforcing.  
---
They‚Äôd rather automate everything and eliminate customer service.
---
Unlocked chests are usually rolled for. But if the chest is locked and you are the only one in the group with the ability to open it, then it is yours. If you were not there then the chest would have never been unlocked. Anyone who argues against this is clearly just trying to troll or they don‚Äôt have any common sense. If you get a green from the chest that someone in the group could benefit from then you should give it to them. But the silver from the whites and grays that you will vendor is all yours. I have followed this rule since I started playing vanilla pservers in 2015. No one has disagreed with the rule since it is only common sense. 
---
If there are two rogues in the group who can open it then they should roll against each other. But if there is only one person who can open it, it should go to them.
---
The nameplate fixed distance is annoying. I use it to replace the font and color of people to something more appealing than tiny green, blue, red text. Also, allows me to change names color based on class for easy recognition. However, the distance they set it at I have to basically be on top of the person for it to trigger and any further it reverts back to stock names. Hell, as a caster I can cast basically x2 times the distance of the visible nameplates. Also, for whatever reason the custom name plates don't seem to work in dungeons for friendly players and just shows stock blizzard nameplates and health bars constantly obscuring screen.
---
Wait, we're already in winter squid season? I need to do more ocean fishing
---
However it synergises well with 'Classic Aura Durations' to give you timers on the target frame, which you don't get from the built in version.
---
I mean to be frank not every player is full of gum drops and candy lolipop rainbows. If I had been up there and saw you "rush" to tag the mob w/the Key I would have done the same thing. Hell I might even have made a camp fire and sat down waiting my turn cause in my eyes you "initiated" the don't really wanna help another group out thing. Just my opinion though. 
---
My example is the ZF Mallet. A group I was in got the mallet rather easily and when we corspe ran to the top of Jin'Althor (Or however it's spelt) we ended up helping three other groups get their Mallet "Attuned" for ZF. All because they helped us fight the elites at the top instead of just "rushing" to tag something.
---
If you've been 60 for a week then you're putting in a disproportionate amount of time then the vast majority of players. Just out of curiosity, what is your /played at? Also are you on a high pop server? Is the faction balanced good for your faction? All of these things matter a lot, not to mention just plain luck. The right BoE epic item/pattern might fetch you 200-400g depending on the server.
---
More power to you for being so well setup this fast, but this isn't something the majority of the player base can achieve in a week of being 60 (realistically probably not even in a month or two) and I think it's a little disingenuous to make it seem like it is. "Play the game" is good advice, but the amount of time that you put in to the game in a week might be equal to the amount of time some players can afford to play in a month (or 2) and for these players, it makes sense that they would want to be efficient when trying to make gold to get the things they want.
---
Gained weight is lightly put, seems like she more than doubled her weight.
---
I know nothing of her before this thread, I just had to Google. Pretty girl turned that spoon into a shovel.
---
Phase 2 is when honor system starts and pvp becomes bigger. It'll begin phase 2, but I guess the real demand comes in phase 3 with WSG. Free Action Pots and Swiftness Pots will sell damn near constantly if it plays out like Vanilla.
---
Same here bro, if they are grey level I hit them with the /wave. Any one else then be sure that you're taking a walk from the graveyard
---
Surprised he didnt send his pet on you...
---
haha nerd are you a mage i can tell you're a mage, i can sense it. go back to aoe cath spell cleave. i will play the game the REAL why by doing these inefficient, uninteresting quests. cya nerd
---
what I mean is, I don't think it's necessarily as much an edge case as you think it is. If someone has a lot of free time, even if they play badly, they can be 60 or near 60 in a month.
---
I'm level 38 despite that, I've had little time to play outside of the first week of release (and even then didn't play that much in the first week), and also wasted a ton of time doing professions, fishing, cooking, and levelling alts on other servers.
---
Pretty sure bad players with more time can get to 60 if they just mindlessly grind and quest, even badly.
---
I guess my overall point is, time commitment doesn't really mean skill or knowledge. Getting to 60 isn't hard, it just takes time.
---
I'm w/this guy. As a Shammie if your wanting that Pwnage weap you need to go back to Armory.
---
Oh stfu, if you dont want me to avoid the guards in pvp then dont make it possible. Would you rather I jump down and let the guards kill me when there is clearly a preventable way of dying.
---
There's a reason why I went hunter for my first 60 in classic. Pet tanks all the damage, I don't need to invest in armor/gear aside from maybe a better bow(usually can get through questing anyway), and 75% of my damage comes from Auto-attacks and pet damage. I have maybe 2 core skills and a couple one-off skills to worry about leveling aside from pet skill-ups. Don't need traps, Don't need tracking, just viper sting and arcane shot :O
---
You could always flag yourself and run alongside them. Chances are there will be a fight.  /duel exists. Could even trick them into flagging by standing by mobs they aoe.
---
(I think it's classic, I've never had an issue with anything else, and quite regularly play much more hardware intensive games, and classic didn't start doing it until I installed a few addons! Coincidence? maybe.)

Ouf, turn his chat window off.

I'm going to put my money on the average wow player or gamer having an average constitution/weight/physical condition, because that's how averages work. Saying the average gamer is overweight is completely biased.

Jesus christ, this is a troll post right?

I said I prefer seeing myself at the bottom because I know I perform well and if I'm at the bottom then it means I'm with great players. I specifically spelled that out already, that's why I said you should go back and read the comment again.

Hey dude awesome macro list ! You can post it on https://macrohub.io, in a near future you can create macro package to share it to everyone
---
Same....5s per stonescale eel...
---
Wtf man. I play on a high pop server and most of the densely packed mob locations are free besides questers, so you can farm literally anything in your level appropriate area. Search by zone and look at the mobs in it and find a loot table and location that works for you. You can farm for BoE's, crafting materials or greys that stack and make bank compared to other classes. It's a bullshit claim that every farmable spot is heavily populated, theres near endless spots
---
Kindly revert back to me.
---
The quote is literally saying that the pact is largely broken. Hence the use of "the drums of war thunder once again".

The pact is *essentially* broken. The war is beginning again.

Somebody needs to re watch the intro cinematic
---
Came here to say this as well! Skarm has wonderful content for around tanking for both warriors and druids.
---
Level 40 mount how much gold do I need.
---
Battlegrounds will be cross realm so the queues shouldn‚Äôt be horrible tbh
---
Ty :)
---
Mograines 2h from cath is around the same DPS. The only others around that level that are decent is the ZF staff (more pvp oriented). The mace from Uldaman is good but thats more 44-47 level. 
---
From there, theres 2 great upgrades in Mara but thats more of a 48-51 area. 
---
Honestly there isnt a whole lot of upgrades around 35-45 for Shaman enhance 2hander users. You just gotta grind it out until you can do Maradaun where theres 2 seperate 2handers both of which are good for leveling and provide more DPS. Theres a 2h axe off the croc boss and a 2h mace off of princess (last/main boss of Mara).

With all the griping about AOE, just start a group and advertise it as single-target focus with CC.  Good opportunity to practice those skills and the server pops are pretty big, you'll probably find players to do it.  Especially easy if you're a tank.
---
I do and I don't. I definitely like you can fight it out and its not an auto win for being max level. But I hate how reliable cc is  for lower levels. cc hits a majority of the time even if a player much higher level, which to me is bullshit. I think it should half a chance to hit for sure but not like close to 100%. I get hit by every fear/sheep/forst nova/hammstring people have my level throw at me. Its a little ridiculous. I am not saying those abilities should never hit but holy hell.... almost every time is a little absurd as well.
---
Have you seen mobs of NPCs gather and build momentum into a giant death ball? Happened with the trolls in STV.
---
everything will be alright so long as the ally scab scum doesn't come cross the picket line
---
The 2h mace from last boss in uldaman is pretty good
---
At this point, casual just means you have a job.
---
It baffles me. 
---
I was sold on the idea of a slower paced MMO where you need to use at least a few brain cells to get through. That it was about the journey and not the destination.
---
Yet I see so many people wanting their instant gratification in chat. After level 30 or so I began to notice a decline in the friendliness of Classic's community. Gravitating more towards "efficiency" over fun,  much like Old School Runescape.
---
Rend is poor aggro and a bad choice for a tank upon engaging.  Ignoring Shield slam, Revenge is your best threat ability, followed by Sunder.   Heroic Strike is good threat, but you rarely have rage to waste on it.  It is a good rage dump if you find yourself with too much rage..
---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
Hunters are a total crap-shoot. Even if they turn off Growl, it doesn't seem like I can consistently get a Hunter that knows how to properly macro their pet. Like we'll have the one mob that starts to run away and is going to die to dots and bleeds before it can pull the next pack, but the Hunter pet just follows it away and aggros the next pack anyway.
---
&gt; If your going oom in early level dungeons either your using too high a rank for healing or the tank is not mitgating damge enough
---
no one should be downranking heals at that low level.  you need a decent amount of +healing gear before downranking becomes more mana efficient than using your highest ranked spell.
---
I was just rushing trying to get out of mulgore on the first day I played I skipped alot of dialogue
---
Yeah didn't think I'd have to respond to anything as embarrassing as "why you spec anything other than feral" but here we are
---
&gt; Some people get luckier than others with the random vendor trash drops
---
I'm pretty sure it averages out pretty well over the course of the thousands of mobs and drops you get.
---
There's also Greater Stoneshield Potions, which should be more valuable than ever since the whole dual wield tank meta is at maximum popularity atm.
---
I think part of it is my server though, for a larger server it definitely leans more casual than hardcore power gamers.
---
Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to STV tomorrow.
---
&gt; **on the last one before I hearthed it finally dropped.** 
---
Won't this always be the case? It's like saying I found my keys in the last place I looked for them :)
---
Gratz though!!
---
Originally, XIV was all about holding threat, properly. I remember having to teach new tanks (specifically early GLD) how to use their combos to maintain threat on pulls. It wasn't super important in the lower level dungeons, but I like to think it helped them out in later dungeons / trials.
---
Haven't really played since they released the first expansion, tho. My hard drive failed in the late game and I didn't get back into it until shortly after the release of the first expansion. Then all my RL friends stopped playing and I shortly lost interest after. 
---
Now, I'm back on wow with my gf and it's been a blast.
---
No. You pop evasion early. It‚Äôs not a last ditch button it should be part of your opener. If Warriors can‚Äôt hit you, they‚Äôre not generating rage. No rage = white damage only. It‚Äôs so easy to trash warriors it‚Äôs pathetic.
---
I‚Äôm far from hardcore.  I didn‚Äôt take any time off going to the gym since release, I didn‚Äôt pull a single all nighter, I didn‚Äôt call off work, I didn‚Äôt stop hanging out with my gf... I know hella people who did all those things.  I just play the game how I enjoy it and try to do so at an efficient pace.  I‚Äôve leveled more than enough characters over the years to know how I like to level.  Too many people get caught up in dungeons, grinding, professions, or just don‚Äôt have a fluid leveling process and go slow.  To each their own but that‚Äôs not how I enjoy it
---
Perhaps we're not in the top of the DPS charts in later raid tiers, but we're still one of the most fun and unique classes, and raids will always want us for our tech stuff like Tranq shot, freeze trap, distracting shot.
---
Also hunter pvp is top tier fun imo.
---
How long did that take? just spamming general?
---
I've finished WPL, EPL, Azshara, and Winterspring. Where else am I supposed to quest lol. I don't think there is anything in Silithus at this point but I could be wrong. 
---
"Playing the game" for me means dungeons, not questing, at max. That's what I was hitting at with my reply.
---
A few things.
---
You're not going to top DPS charts as a mage or a priest. Save for a few fights where ranged attackers can get more hits off than melee or some big AoE fights. So very circumstantial fights. Reminder, as a mage, your biggest damage buff comes from the later phases where where you can swap to fire spec due to the availability of gear opening up (as well as non-fire resistant mobs). However, this is also where other classes get huge powerspikes in damage as well (looking at you, Warriors).
---
SPriest is debatably one of the best classes for PvP. Mages are good as well, they have a lot of tools in their tool kit which allows for particularly skilled players to stand out. SPriests have a higher floor to be effective.
---
Stop listening to min/maxers. The game is easy enough to where there are several non-optimal compositions of raids that can successfully clear all content. If you're not rushing for a world first or fastest clear time, don't worry about what the community says about your class. As long as you're nice, trustworthy and don't mess up anything, any guild would be happy to take you.
---
What do YOU think is more fun? That's what matters. It's a game, you're supposed to have fun.
---
Mages in PvE are also pretty boring. Throw in some decurses and spam downranked frostbolts. Of course this is dummed down (a bit), but a SPriest would add more value/ a different way to play than a mage.
---
In all, do what makes you happy. Don't worry about not getting spots. Join a friendly guild who will make you feel like you're a part of the community. Make sure their goals align with yours.
---
Most of what you said are speculations from other players, who, more than likely, aren't level 60 yet. A lot of information here is spread like wildfire due to the echo-chamber that is the WoW Classic community. There's a big efficiency mindset that shouldn't ruin the game for you.
---
He'll just stand there like a fucking derp. Slapper what are you fucking doing!?!?!
---
Glad I switched from mage to warrior then, mages seem to be getting a really bad rep recently and not a lot of people care for them too much
---
Which is why PvP exists in the world especially with regard to border security but not the exclusive norm in the open world.
---
Strange I was wondering what that buff in side Scholomance was.
---
Most streamers are snowflakes
---
Retail is much slower because retail is balanced more around player skill, you can reset you can run. every class has a decent CC with nukes that you either CC or pop CD's for.  
---
Vanilla is balanced around time preparing and sometimes some classes just outright shit on you. For example if you are a warrior in world pvp every single class fucks you, Unless you spend a good amount of time preparing, and even then its a struggle.
---
While classes like rogue/mage got insane advantages in classic and can just outright 1 shot you.
---
Raids won't 'get harder' till AQ from what it looks like. BWL will be as much of a pushover as MC. AQ is where the content starts to match up with the 1.12 talents.
---
As a pally I'm the other way round, cheap drinks all day and heal myself up with good ol flash of light.
---
Theres a TON of new content out there. It's called Retail.
---
Even if i picked male???
---
Idk why people play the game around what other people are doing. Yeah they're famous and may put together some pvp events, but you'll hardly see them in game and spend a lot of your time waiting in ques, just do what you want to do and dont feel the need to play on a overpopulated server just cuz a streamer is on it.
---
I'm disgusted by the recent trend to pull everything and AoE dungeons - watched a guy look for 2 mages for ZF for over an hour today while I simply ran the instance hahaha
---
During months on this sub, anytime you made a little suggestion about adding or tweaking a minor things to add a bit difficulty, unexpected or balance you were welcome with flood of #nochange and how anything different would bring the game to retail state where instances are just mindless boring AoE grind and people wanted the REAL vanilla experience.
---
And now I get asked daily to come to stupid mindless boring AoE grind group...
---
This movie still scares the shit out of me to this day.
---
Always I want to be be with you\~
---
\&gt; playing a paladin

\&gt; dying to a single non-elite mob
---
\&gt; with half of your mana bar still there when you died
---
"Could I really be so bad at this game? ...No.. It is the RNG that caused me to die."

It's free because it doesnt cost anything for the mage
---
Haha
---
HAHA
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Welcome to Hell, my friend.  I'm currently a Human wanting the Darnassus exalted.  You cannot gain rep by wearing a tabard and grinding dungeons, you need to turn in Cloth at major cities.  Go to Thunderbluff and look for the Tailoring building.  You'll hand in 60 Wool Cloth, 60 Silk Cloth, and 60 Runecloth to unlock the repeatable quest.
---
After that, spam the repeatable quest by turning in 20 Runecloth.  This will take roughly 8400 Runecloth to get from Revered to Exalted, so about 10,000 if you're still in Honored/Friendly.
---
Good luck, friend!
---
quest 2h is called Will of the Mountain Giant (39.5dps). you will need help getting it.
---
Depends on your rep but I believe it‚Äôs 20 good for training and 80 for mount.
---
100G, or 90G if at least Honored with your faction.
---
Looks like 50s each to me...
---
You must have ammo and have the ammo equipped, then use the "shoot" spell from your spellbook.
---
If your ranged weapon doesn't have stats, I recommend vendoring it and grabbing a stack of throwing daggers. The daggers don't cost you money in repairs like a bow or gun will.
---
The White Kitten is not a hot commodity.  You might have some luck selling it to the Horde, but Ally is not likely to sell.
---
I can't speak on Grob but Deviate is pretty good at calling out the turds that act like shitheads in various chats, and they get /ignored often. Overall I would say Deviate has a pretty kind and mature community overall. I can't speak on comparison to pvp realms or Grob because I haven't rolled up there. Plenty of bad eggs on Deviate that pollute chats but thankfully the majority don't let their behavior slide.
---
Hai :) Thank you so much for the comments guys. So as you can see in the end of the video i went to the AH and  checked the prices. 20x sold for 19g 20silver. So in order to sell mine i had to cut the price a little bit.
---
In the end i sold my 50 fish for 43g which still is super good :P i could push for 46-47 could but probably that would take awhile. + it depends on what day is it, if its a raid day the prices would go up a lot :)
---
sell them to the Horde.
---
they are considered a delicacy in Orgrimmar
---
ITS EXACTLY AT 12,000
---
more people fucking fit in a private server than blizz servers
---
Able to get Murky again?  I also used my Murky card already so am wondering if it's possible somehow to transfer the pet over to Classic
---
What spot is this? I'm 34 with 30 gold so I'm getting a bit anxious.
---
&gt;Remember in general that it's not because something does not bother you personally that it's not a big deal for others. Wow is a game, most people play it to have fun. If someone struggles to have fun because of a specific reason and says he's bothered at it, it's not "wanting to be outraged at something", it's expressing a worry over a game that he likes to play to have fun.
---
Yeah but you're voluntarily joining groups that are cleaving. This is a massively multiplayer game and finding a group that suits you is part of the game and it always has been. Even more so in vanilla and now classic. 
---
No one is forcing you to play with cleave groups. It is still fully possible to play the game and do every dungeon without cleaving.
---
Fine, keep your secrets.
---
I'm even noticing serious Mana issues as early as SM on a 39 elesham. I have very high DPS comparable to a mage while I have Mana but I'm drinking every 1-3 pulls lmao
---
Amazing for PvP though, I actually 3 shot a ?? Priest last night with LB and CL
---
This is great info, thank OP. Sad the post is removed.
---
Snowflakes follow snowflakes ;)
---
Exactly.
---
It was not a thing back in 2004-2005. Even if it was entirely possible to execute.
---
&gt;  who can't dps worth shit
---
I mean, I can only press my Frostbolt button so hard, man.
---
What are we looking at?
---
And this is "Classic" so i use the old one. No need for the personal attack.
---
Enhance is slightly less dps than elemental for leveling but you pay for that in downtime / drinking for mana. Theyre both very viable for leveling to 60 though. Elemental picks up at 40, enhance is decent all the way to 60.
---
The thing to think about is your end game plans. If you plan on going resto it might be beneficial to roll elemental before 50/60 so you can start putting together int/spirit/mp5/spell effect gear prior to dinging 60.
---
you talking about the jaguars?  dude 5g in 2 levels is a bold-faced lie and you know it.  Its impossible to only make 5g in 2 lvls grinding those mofos, its damn near 5-11g per hour so unless you got two levels in the 30s within an hour, youre just lying for clout
---
I mean, if nothing else he'd evolve a kink for strong women. 
---
Probably not a good idea to introduce him to over-the-top sexualisation of women at the age of 7 though. Good call. :P
---
Well if your server is that cheap might as well! My server 1 crest is 1 gold lol, total cost 15-20 gold. That is not worth it for me as a cheap blue two handed that will do relatively good damage at 30 can be bought in the AH for like 3-4 gold atm, which will last you until 34-35 bonebiter replacement. And save you 15-20 gold and mat grind in the process. But play classic how you want man !
---
You can AOE as a "prot" though you'll want consecration as well. 
---
level 41 is when this first becomes truly 'viable' in my opinion since you can get consecration plus blessing of sanctuary.  Both do a good amount of AOE damage, and you have enough protection (see what I did there) to survive large groups of mobs.  You can simply judge seal of light, and use seal of light, and consecration and let your block damage/ret aura do the rest.  
---
It takes awhile but the mobs beat themselves to death against your massive, plate-encrusted johnson
---
Ofc you play as you want I just question the idea itself...  If you rush that dungeon 3 times you waste 60 minutes with stressful rushing... But you could actually enjoy an hour of gameplay and chatting to do it once.  Sure progress gets slower but isn't it the idea of a game to be played?
---
Family father myself with 2 kids just saying
---
I saw a guildie lose Hand of Justice to a hunter. Broke my heart. I used to main a hunter in vanilla and even as a newbie I knew better than to take the best melee trinket from a warrior. That thing is godly and scales unlike any other but it had a tiny bit of attack power so hunter trinket.
---
Hahahaha this scrub deleted the post
---
? ? ? ? ? ? ?
---
If you see it on classic log-in window then yes it will be shut down
---
I was middle of the pack and then did a server first race on Firetree.
---
And I don't think he's looking to race.
---
What if a lot of other people are thinking the same thing?
---
There's a group of people reporting players on Horde-Herod for using the lookingforgroup channel. Happened to me on Saturday and I was auto silenced for 24 hours.
---
Tagged for later, thx op.
---
Thank you for your detailed explanation and the time it took you to answer my question. Much appreciated. 
---
So would it be prudent to wait until level 59 and do this in one fell-swoop or do the quests turn gray at a certain level?
---
Toally agree - all runs where I was taken low went very smoothly - we dont have to worry about hit, stop the healer discrimination!
---
Because all of the people commenting failed basic reading comprehension and for some reason think I'm the instigator.
---
Vendor price and scrap. I don't know much about Mapster but Leatrix Maps is very customisable.
---
Ah okay. Thanks!
---
There's also a counterpart for this quest, when you play for the crab and try to prevent turtles from making it to the water. It's much more fun.
---
can save as little as 30s, makes grabbing clips at full resolution and high bitrate braindead easy.
---
I always want one mage when I'm healing for date water
---
It does cost the mage something, time and mana.
---
Nah
---
My guild has a single level 60 haha.
---
This sub has a very skewed perception of where the average player is.
---
Shellfish farm in delsolace if your horde
---
Great list!
---
It's definitely more than that.  You don't have to take time off or play outside of the evenings to be at 60.  Source, myself.  
---
Really, casual means more that you aren't playing every day, and are probably closer to the 40-50 range atm.
---
It's clear that you don't understand what being a Karen is, and just throw that word without a thought to the wind and not properly understand what it means. 
---
I bet fake news websites make you salivate.
---
Doesnt that mount like the 40 mount count as a spell? I.e. cost mana and trigger the five second rule? I know i hated that with my L40 mount atleast. 
---
My 2 cents: Buy it now
---
I'd follow a guide like this one:   [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow) 
---
There's others out there too.  Or, just take whatever seems best to you. You can fix it later if needed.
---
If you don't put bleeds on a warrior how exactly do you expect to damage them through their armor...  
---
Bleeds ignore armor, poking with little knives doesn't. Enjoy tickling warriors until you get 2-3 shot with ms and an overpower proc.
---
There's a lot of good comments on here and the best being "any rogue spec can work pretty well for levelling". Imho you should spec for what you plan on doing ADDITIONALLY to levelling. Do you plan on doing lots of world pvp? Prob best to go with daggers/sub. Are you planning on grinding dungeons? Prob best to go swords/combat. Are you planning on minding your own business and just straight quest levelling to 60? Prob best to pick whichever spec feels the most fun. 
---
I personally have been hitting as many dungeons as possible with my friends so I'm combat swords and it feels great. Typically top of the deeps charts unless someone out levels me by 4-5+ levels. It's also fine for pvp since most people are terrible at pvp. 
---
Easy as that. Enjoy yo self!
---
You want to frontload your damage spells and then wand the NPC down to profit from the mana reg after 5 sec. But this doesnt mean all your damage should be from the wand - I would say not more then (the second) half of it.
---
You want to use as many spells as possible without running (more then half) oom. You will have a pretty terrible grinding experience if you just focus on wanding.
---
In general, your rotation should be:
---
Shield up (so Weakened Soul already counts down) --&gt; your damage spell with the longest cast time (probably Holy Fire) --&gt; SW:Pain (--&gt;Mind Flay if you got that Shadow Talent, to slow the enemy down) --&gt; Mind Blast --&gt; Wand (re-shield if needed) 
---
But this variates a lot depending what your most powerfull spells are, how much mana you got and if you want to stack Shadow Weavering later on. 
---
You should use about half of your mana on a target, but thanks to mana reg and Spirit Tap you should be at 80-100% shortly after the fight. You should not need to drink during normal grinding.
---
Side note: your damage improvement for shadow spells is a stunning 30% just from Shadow Form and (full stacked) Shadow Weavering!
---
You shouldn't need to split heals among 3 tanks. You should be healing one tank and occasionally a dps'er that pulls aggro. Renew is one of your most efficient heals, its the one I don't ever down rank. Focus on using the different heals you have, don't worry about the ranks to start until you get to difficult content. Focus on healing your one tank with your max ranks to start, and drink more often if needed.   
---
Once you have that down, start playing around with down ranking heals.
---
Me either! I've always spelled their name out and ignored names with weird symbols I can't recreate. This is helpful knowledge. :)
---
Pickpocketing high dungeons. Read somewhere a rogue can make 50g/hr just pickpocketing. Id check YouTube though. 
---
As a hunter I can do tribute and princess runs
---
It's already going for 25-30g on my server. I'm kicking myself because 3 weeks ago they were max 2g but I didnt have the gold to buy them out on the AH.
---
Iron grenades exist already in game. If you‚Äôre looking for just damage, use goblin sappers. If you just want the stun, any grenade works really
---
This would work except for Alliance on the Incendius server doesn't understand the AH so 99% of all trade goods are on for a few copper over vendor value. Black Pearl vendors for 8s? Selling for 8s 10c. Leather sells for 3s a piece? On for 3s 2c. 
---
A lot of my AH purchases have literally been to buy out the auction, turn around, and vendor for a profit because they didn't know said item would vendor for more. The AH is not a good place to make money selling regular mats right now. I'm just stocking up on everything for when it eventually booms...hopefully soon...
---
Did you have double gathering while leveling?
---
Well do you do anything besides play wow after work?
---
It seems /u/i_should_be_coding is always coding anyway. Thanks for the tip my dude.
---
Yea I‚Äôll believe wowhead lol k
---
Alliance doesn‚Äôt have WF so you won‚Äôt be topping shit til naxx if you‚Äôre Alliance.
---
He didn't win.  Rolled and immediately started mining.
---
3g at level 38? Wow. Alright let‚Äôs get you up to speed. First of all, I highly recommend you get the add on auctioneer. Once you scan the auction house, it will tell you the price of items are on ah in your bags and will automatically undercut someone. Second, don‚Äôt buy useless spells and at this point I wouldn‚Äôt buy any spells at all. That 1% boost in damage isn‚Äôt worth it since your so far behind. Thirdly, don‚Äôt buy stuff of ah anymore. I assume you‚Äôve been doing that or have been training everything. Fourth, start selling ore, cloth, and fish along that river in Hillsbrad.
---
"Bravely ran away away..."
---
Well, Orcs make it a tough fight on that one...but probably yes. At least until Blood Elves.
---
How can people not have internet at home? that's like the 4th most important thing after 1. food 2. a bed.  3. some clothes
---
Hey that‚Äôs not too bad man! 
---
Look at me I wanted my character to be called Nation. 
---
Only problem was I didn‚Äôt double check the spelling so I fucked up and now character is called Naison..... oops.
---
To be fair blizzard is only making around $450,000,000 a year, based off sub estimates, so you can‚Äôt expect them to hire on shore GMs that understand the game. That might cost an extra million a year. Who are you to deprive a CEOs doggo of a new diamond encrusted collar. I mean really...
---
i think you are generalizing the community faaar too much dude. Not everyone is b-lining to dungeons for AOE runs, there are plenty of people taking their time. Try this...
---
/leave world
---
/leave lookingforgroup
---
Here is another perspective for you to think about...Im doing SM AOE runs on my mage and having a blast. Being able to push the limits of your class and group and get handsomely rewarded for that is \*\*fun\*\* for me. We aren't forcing anyone to do AOE runs with us, just 5 consenting adults.
---
I meant Silk, forgot which one it was.
---
And they didn't just send like a few extra stacks of cloth, it was how much is needed to make the bag. e.g. I am getting literally nothing from it.
---
Also, people who always undercut ruin the market. It compounds the sadness.
---
Go back to retail or a normal server if you can't handle people playing the game effectively.
---
Exactly, I have no idea how AOE runs suddenly got renamed to "spellcleave" in Classic. In vanilla and pservers alike, there were cleave groups (warrior/rogue DPS only), and AOE groups (lock/mage DPS).
---
Classic drops, and "spellcleave" comes out of nowhere. It's fucking AOE, and has been forever.
---
I‚Äôve seen things that would scare you SHELL-LESS!
---
In Vanilla, Winter Squid was available between the autumn equinox and the spring equinox. The autumn equinox? It is today. 
---
I have to confirm in-game obviously but Winter Squid could be potentially available now.
---
When I level my paladin, I'm going to attempt to gank people, not kill them, and then bubble hearth lol! Part of the fun of pally is just how ridiculous and funny that is.
---
Those potions will go up when BGs exist. I don't see people drinking them in regular PVE content.
---
He just said don't do it again, what more do you want? 
---
And asking if a abusing a bug is not allowed from a GM.. You're thicker than you seem if you don't know how we will answer. Not only is he not in a position to make decisions on that, he is also not in the position to say anything about that, at least for what would be out of the company policy. So, his best answer would be that don't do it, and even then he could get into problems, as that might not be the official company policy.
---
And you're basically being mad because a guy working didn't act like your friend. You're either too American, or suffer from some parental neglect. I'd check with a doctor on that, instead of the GMs. 
---
Let me ask you, if you got a McDonald's, do you also get mad if they fix your order, and say "thank you, have a good night", instead of explaining all the ways they did wrong and simultaneously tucking you to bed, as well as, telling you how extra very sorry they are?
---
I'm just saying you're going to an awful lot of trouble over something so small. Making a tempest in a teapot. And I'm not bragging. He called me shit and I gave a statement to the contrary. Acting like I've committed a cardinal sin lmao
---
I think the best that can happen to the community is that those super grinders only stay online for a month to 24/7 complete all new content and leave to wait again...  Dont rush with content as the majority is far away from those standards.  I would even like to see (exploit xp first kill rush servers)  marked as those to sort out that kind of people and enjoy a slow paced server with nice guys.
---
The toolkit really isn't there for pugging as a Shaman Tank. I've tanked with guildies a number of times and that's fine, but don't subject randoms to half-designed spec and expect them to be happy about it.
---
It's current year people!
---
Yikes, a whole bag is completely unnecessary. I keep about a stack or maybe 2 stacks of food and a single stack of water at a time as a hunter. 
---
I think a ton of players are bad at resource management tbh. A hunter really only needs to utilize pet damage, autoattacks, and viper sting a decent amount of the time for conserving mana. Spamming moves can be a big no-no in the longrun if you're doing longer monster grinding sessions. I still could manage pulling a mob at 20-30% mana and be just fine. Some people feel like they need full mana and drink after every mob or two, then spam all their skills, which burns all their mana down.
---
Paladins that think they don‚Äôt have to go holy? Rey is pathetic.
---
YOu confused asmongold style guild bank cleaning with some random guy claiming gm from a guy who might have been offline too long.
---
We disagreed, and even after our discussion he was holding it over my head like I was lucky he graciously let me have the node.  He was continuing to be a dick about it 5 minutes later, is why I kicked him.
---
And My Axe!!!1
---
This is bad Hunter logic...

Also try starting on the RIGHT side of the waterfall and pull her LEFT when she is making her pat by the rock, and again, MAX RANGE when u pull, and get out of Dodge once she turns to u.  I NORMALLY dont pull her around the rock the 1st time and just drag her to the right wall from the start, but was in that position when i was filming that pass for the video.
---
Get literally everything handed to them but when you ask for water ‚ÄúOH WOAH IS ME MY PRECIOUS MANA WHAT AM I TO DO NOW MY EVOCATE IS ON COOLDOWN!!!! WHY WONT SOMEBODY THINK OF THE MAGES?‚Äù
---
I dont think it's much of a stretch to assume the average gamer, someone who takes part in a hobby that requires zero physical engagement, is overweight. Considering a majority of people in the world are overweight, its not a hard line to draw.
---
Do not risk your account for something as stupid as fishing lmfao.
---
This guy said he's putting all his talent points into resto. Sounds like a fucking horror story to me, no idea why he would do that.... But he's probably fine. That said, I'd never invite him cuz if you want in 5 levels under the dungeons level range, and tell me your specced resto while leveling I'm going to think you got caught in some new weaponised autism chemical weapons attack.
---
I'm not twisting anything, just explaining a rule that was in place in vanilla. And is in place in "Classic". It's is a global rule "If your somewhere the guards can't path to, your exploiting in the cities/towns"
---
Your disjointed thought process is making you hard to follow.
---
&gt;am I supposed to use every rank of every heal in dungeons?  
---
No. While you are leveling you need max level and level 1.  
---
One for tank and one to just refill DPS so they won't die from one hit.  
---
P.S. Did you took Spirit Tap? It's important talent for healer. And then Meditation in Discipline. Healer our-of-mana = dead group, so you should pick-up this talents ASAP.
---
Not to mention he is indirectly telling us he smokes weed.
---
Not to the point where a macro does checks and balances this this...
---
Letmecast is exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks man.
---
Maybe if Classic+ becomes a thing, we could turn zones like this into "lawless" zones where even members of the same faction could PVP at the cost of honor so stuff like this doesn't need to happen. Your biggest enemy when resource grinding isn't the opposite faction, it's your own faction because you can't fight over resources.
---
I mean congrats, but it didn't work for me. Those quests are finished for me.
---
If that were the case, they wouldn't even need MC at this point.
---
What does it matter if they release content that you aren't at the level at yet to participate in?  You will be eventually.
---
I sent a death coil her way but she resisted then kicked my fear...
---
It was significantly worse in vanilla lol. People stealing tags; grabbing veins or herbs while you clearly kill the only mob guarding it, sheep/mind control/entangling roots griefing *for hours* by groups; people taking over entire questing areas making them off limits to you, people solo but still refusing to join up just for kill 0/x mob quests *and tagging them with instants so you never even get one* preventing people from doing them....I could go on. 
---
Vanilla community was significantly worse in hundreds of ways. It was much more cutthroat/progress at all costs and fuck everyone else. It'd be an absolute miracle if you got anyone to say "I have my 10, how many more do you need?" *and they stay to help the rest*. 95% of players in vanilla: "I got my 10, bye" Now, like, 3 people ignore this guy over the course of an entire month and wOW ThE CoMmUnItY iSnT WhAt It OnCe WaS. It was never what these people seem to remember it being.
---
You generate more rage when you are getting hit.  You also generate rage when you attack and crit.  Side note - druids only generate rage offensively, so priests can pre-bubble a druid tank, but a warrior tank will genearte less rage with a bubble on.
---
This is why DPS opening up too early is such an issue.  If you have only 1 of the 3 mobs hitting you, you are generating less rage.  This also makes it much more difficult to pull the aggro back since you don't have enough rage.  If your DPS can let you get beat on for a bit longer, it will solve some of your problems.  It is like a down-ward spiral.
---
Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; Heroic Strike in order of most threat generated.  You rarely have enough rage for Heroic Strike.  Keep you shouts up, especially initially.  Tab target and get a sunder on each mob as rage permits. 
---
Another trick is to pull from distance, duck behind a corner, and pop your enrage ability (the one that generates rage).  Your enrage has just generated a small amount of aggro on all the mobs as they run to you.  When they arrive and round the corner, you are ready and have a bit of rage already.  DPS have to be disciplined for this though.
---
Yeah so many don‚Äôt get it. They all think we were just retarded or something in 2005. It‚Äôs because back then we had talents like Lacerate for hunter ffs. I‚Äôm not saying content was hard back then don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am however saying that the idea that we all played horribly is just off base. ElitistJerks was a thing back then too. We still theorycrafted. Shit we did it so hardcore we were theorycrafting horsemen for weeks on the forums. 
---
Even my own guild Peekay had the worlds only Druid main tank for raiding(Hugehoss). He did all sorts of math that people make use of to this day to know what gear was required to be a bear tank. We weren‚Äôt just morons running around clicking rend.
---
Engineering + alchemy if you wanna maximize your PvP abilities.
---
Marksmanship?
---
It's not. Some people just can't handle a PVP server.
---
I love it. forming little groups to try and beat out other little groups, all while dodging the other side.
---
So, from what I'm seeing in the comments is roll a mage to make some bank.  üòâ
---
Brilliant! I'll have to check that out tonight!
---
sucks that mages are getting a bad rap from new entitled players cuz they are my favorite class and I have played them since the beginning :(
---
You can't really interrupt as a holy priest or druid. You can help out with damage, but even as with appropriate level you risk wasting mana that can come in handy if someone accidentally pulls extra packs.
---
&gt;BWL will be as much of a pushover as MC.
---
That‚Äôs a hard disagree from me. Yes, there will be guilds on each server that clear it on BWL, but this is also true for AQ and Naxx. As far as the casual raider is concerned, I think there will be a drastic difference between MC and BWL.
---
Which isn‚Äôt to say BWL is particularly tough, just that there *is* a pretty steep spike in difficulty over MC, that many guilds will notice.
---
It‚Äôs not horrible, and solo, it may even net you similar dps to a ret specced paladin.  It is going to minimal damage though when you are not the target of attacks.
---
disenchanting, vendoring, or just selling specific greens on the ah. 
---
just depends what raw material i can get.
---
Tailoring is fine, you can make some nice gold off bags and some of the better green/blue recipes that other clothies are willing to pay out for (Spidersilk Boots, Azure Silk for Frost mages, Shadoweave for SPriests and Locks, Dreamweave set, etc). 
---
Enchanting tho.. enchanting is the reason I didn't get mount til 43 and had to hard grind from ~30g from 'just playing the game' to 90g for it. And now I'm broke again lol. Then you realize the Artisan Enchanting trainer is *inside Uldaman* surrounded by Troggs, Dark Iron Dwarves, and scorpion packs every time you want to train. Just don't do it guys. Get mining, get skinning, hell don't even get a 2nd profession, anything but enchanting.
---
Now you should buy my Macaw!
---
maybe cause it's a dick move? making people corpse run to do the dungeon they just spent 30 minutes running to and probably another 30 minutes finding is just cruel. If you want to pvp go to southshore or STV or somewhere like that. Killing outside of SM is just being a jerk.
---
I know about that, which makes it even worse with me not knowing why it‚Äôs called that. Imma fuckin monkey.
---
Using that same logic, you should pay your healer in dungeons/raids since it costs them time and mana.
---
which AMD's are faster than NVidias and at what price point?
---
MC is the least individually responsible Raid blizzard has ever made, to note.
---
And 'you' refers to raids full of experienced private server players, not the average playerbase that struggles in BRD.
---
This is not possible with macro as it is pretty big step towards automating.
---
As others suggest, the best you can do is to display that debuff better
---
You get enough money to survive on but it‚Äôs not great at making a profit. Those videos are pserver garbage with inflated junk box drop rates, inflated vendor trash prices and blue weapons that aren‚Äôt actually on the loot table. You mostly get health pots and poison reagents.
---
Flamestrike into Frost Nova, Blizzard and when they get close, Cone of Cold and kite with Arcane Explosion.
---
Fat acceptance is real.
---
55 lock here. I‚Äôm just buying the required mats for the dreadstead quest and banking it all until the quest come out. With PvP not giving honor I don‚Äôt see the point in WPvP now so I certainly see no point in throwing away 1k gold
---
Mages who farm quest mobs for XP are assholes, but if a mage is doing a kill quest you can't lay claim to any mobs until they've been tagged. The fact that mages have ranged instant spells with which to do the tagging doesn't make them assholes anymore than anyone else just trying to do the kill quests. I've had people whisper me nasty stuff because I'm killing mobs for my quest after they've declined my invitation to group up. Who's really the asshole in that situation?
---
&gt; Spellsword hasn't really been tried in WoW yet if you don't count Death Knights.
---
Paladin, Enh shammy(though that's like 'Spell&lt;axe/hammer&gt;'), and uh...warlock with a firestone? 0.o (j/k).  Really any non druid hybrid works well enough, depending on player/designer class requirements.  In an mmo it always ends up as just a caster with melee/short range spells, and we have plenty of those.
---
So sad what layering has done.  Someone broke t down. This is over 10k in matts farmed in a couple weeks.
---
15(ish) min 3 Boss Run - Princess | Goblin | Gator

---
So wtf is shame for then?
---
Makes sense dude I‚Äôm definitely gonna do this
---
This is why I play horde lol
---
so, this is why blizzard fired a large portion of their customer support and game masters?  To have to save money and not train the new ones they hired for lower hourly pay?
---
Eh, if you can clear MC enough and gear up, BWL isn't much different. Only a couple bosses are "harder" and thats only for specific things. First few are just dps checks and dragons are 'do you know how to LOS' checks. Chrom is probably the 'hardest' one only because you need people to decurse/dispel properly. Nef is pretty easy compared to Chrom.
---
Nope.  
---
You can grief them though, once you both reach a contested zone.
---
Blessing of Kings?

ERROR: Cannot assign value of type "NPC" to "Dungeon"
---
Yes but do I only get hit rating from gear? Isnt there some basic underlaying hit chance and you add your hit gear to that?
---
A few Priest tips:
---
\-Your first talents taken should be maxing out wand &amp; spirit tap.
---
\-Flash Heal is horrible on mana, only use it in emergencies.
---
\-Drink after every pull if needed, as the last mob is dying you're sitting down.
---
\-Install and use Clique.  Or setup mouseover macros.  Keep your focus on the mob, wand the shit out of it, use Clique/mouseovers to heal party members.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to grab carrot on a stick, trinket autoswitch addon, and badlands sprint trinket for bonus pursuit powers!
---
there's no 4-tank fight in 20 man content.
---
aggramar saw a stack of blood DK... but not to tank, just to mass death grip.
---
mistress in tomb (week 1) also had a stack of DK... to soak, not to tank.
---
there's rarely variation from the standard 2-tank setup... eternal palace is an exception with 3 3-tank fight.
---
Yeah, I've doen all that, stuck now at 44 with not much to do but grind. Hopefully a few runs of ZF can get me to the next quest bubble
---
Thats nikasaur in the video
---
Hi my name's shaman and I'd like to reroll into your guild üòÅ
---
Hunter. The one class that I can say is inevitably total fucking garbage or a godsend.
---
Most hunters you find open with multishot, get their pet killed, then bitch at you for not being able to pull threat on mobs running away from you.
---
Then you find the gloriously godlike hunters. The ones who focus single target for a little while. Letting you build threat with thunder claps or swipes. Then he weaves some multishot in. Oh, looks like its rough for you and the healer needs the dps coming in on you to loosen? OK. Marks one of the melee fucks with a square and sets the pet on it with growl. Or perhaps he uses feign death to drop a trap and uses distracting shot to bring the mob back to him freezing it. Maybe he does both. This guy is magical.
---
Keep doing what you are doing, and keep an eye on the AH for the schematic, sometimes people will list the schematic for 2.5g - 10g either not knowing what they have or wanting to make a quick buck.
---
Overheating video card.

Open the side pannel, stick a fan, see if it helps :)

You can use the giant shrinker to solo it easily.
---
370 enchanting? Didn't realize they released BC servers already
---
We did the outside Jintha Alor (hinterlands) area the other day with no tank just 2 rogues (mage/lock/resto sham and 2 rogues).    These guys were buddies and very synchronized at locking multiple targets down or stun locking a single hard hitting target.  It was actually pretty cool how they worked together to basically prevent  mobs from killing anyone.
---
Cleared the whole thing finished almost all quests, the rogues just left when we were finishing up some lingering quests, no words, no goodbyes just vanished into the night.
---
&gt; And I don't think he's looking to race.
---
Real easy way to find out.
---
/u/Shiiishkebab are you trying to be one of the best geared people on your server at all times? Like are you trying to tackle the content asap?
---
That's exactly my point. Low levels suck, high level dungeons rock, but only warriors *really* get to raid.
---
Short version:
---
1. Grab two gathering professions (herbalism, skinning, mining)
---
2. Level fishing
---
3. Cook what you fish up
---
4. Sell everything
---
Because why make the raid harder than it has to be?
---
MC may not be hard, but it sure as hell can be done faster so you're not in there for more hours than you could be.
---
Ive actually had shit luck with posting blues. I won a boe drop from the stockades. A 2h mace. Posted it like 3-4 times for like 3g. It never sold. Even when I posted it again with a 50% bid nothing. It was getting to the point where the posting fees were getting high after 3-4 postings so I just decided to keep it. I actually find trade goods and consumables are better. Just watching their prices go up and down. You can see what they go for when they sell high. So I just buy a bunch during the week and then sell when the supply and price drops.
---
I would *definitely* bank that for later. That should be going for 500+.
---
The problem is bad players. I'm a good player. Lol.
---
Another problem is that the true xp/hr increases as you level due to higher level mobs and quests reward more xp. So if you level too fast or have a too long session it will also become a bit inaccurate.
---
This is exactly how the big IT company I worked for handled things and I‚Äôve heard the same from many others. At that place something like 80% of CSRs AND developers were temporary. Most companies don‚Äôt see value in having experienced workers. Just cycle people though at a minimum pay scale. I mean, it mostly kinda works and saves a few dollars which is why companies do it.
---
This really bugs be because I never group unless I have 2 hours at a minimum and have only done a few dungeons due to lack of time. When I do have time to join a group I expect everyone else to have time freed up as well. If you only have 45 minutes and need things to be aoed down with 0 downtime then let the group know at the start.
---
There‚Äôs no real reason to.
---
He made a mistake, but GM's are people too.
---
You are saying what is fun to him is actually boring. As someone said if you said ‚Äúit‚Äôs boring to ME‚Äù you wouldn‚Äôt be passing judgement, but alas you have boomerman
---
The biggest difference is that the eye is a 1% drop, making it a realistic item to farm.
---
If you killed 100 demons there is around 66% chance the eye has dropped, you would need to kill 1000 dragons for the same chance to get the sinew.
---
51 enh - healed 1st half of BRD last night.  Healed as enh in vanilla until Garr.
---
Skill &gt; Knowledge &gt; Spec &gt; Gear
---
Delusions of grandeur not counting you expect DPS to actually wait 3 seconds for you to get aggro. lol
---
It's true though.  Mages are definitely the number one class I've been ganked by while leveling.
---
According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on global obesity, 30% of people are overweight and 10% are obese, both together still don't form a majority. If we're talking only about the USA, where obesity + overweight people exceed 70% (according to the cdc), you might be right, but globally, you are wrong.
---
Depends on how much/where you grind. I farmed the wicked leather headband from felwood satyrs over several hours and went home with a solid 50g in runecloth/vendor greys. People who do dungeons for exp instead and don't win any vendor drops are going to get a lot less, for example. And there are places where you could get more.
---
The use is in pvp when a priest is dispelling you and has to waste one dispelling unending breath
---
Engineering + mining is the general go-to if you're planning to PVP (mining allows you to save money by farming your own materials to level up engineering). If you aren't worried about PVP, blacksmithing + mining can be a good combo. Honestly more important is first aid and cooking - those are "free" and you generally want to be leveling both.
---
If that's what you gathered from this, you have horribly misjudged.  I expect the faction to work together.  I expect that after the drama has been resolved, more drama is not initiated by someone telling me how lucky I am they were nice, or by them telling me how salty I am.
---
If you're going to pick at scabs, I'm gonna make you bleed too.
---
He‚Äôs requiring multiple mobs to be cced, that‚Äôs basically never necessary as a warrior while leveling.
---
He will be oom and have to drink every pull, never necessary as a warrior.
---
He can‚Äôt pull aggro back if someone pulls off him, I can.
---
He will take more damage than I do.
---
Sounds pretty inconvenient to me.
---
Balance is last though?  And basically non existent in the logs.
---
This is Dixiewrecked. I was main tank for this group as a feral druid. For composition we had 3 warriors as tanks, 3 priests, a pally healer, a ret paladin, some rogues, some hunters, a lock, and a handful of mages.
---
I am pretty geared for this early in content. Seemed as though as feral, I was able to tank this better than the warriors could with eating damage. One of the other warriors, however, was far better at picking up aggro in phase 3 with me close behind.
---
We got this down on the fifth attempt. It was not as easy as everyone was making it out to be. It took a lot of coordination, and a great determined team. Everyone knew their class fairly well, and with aggro in phase 3 seeming to be a crap shoot, it seemed to be a good stroke of luck as well. 
---
We didn't have an optimized team, but we did make it work. And this was a true pug. We all came from different guilds having little to no play experience with each other. 
---
From this experience I want others to gather that they CAN complete this as a pick up group. It should not be glanced over as content has gotten easy. A lot of us put time in to get fairly decent gear to even attempt this. While it wasn't a mechanically intensive fight, it is still an achievement. I am glad to be a part of it. 
---
For the Alliance!

This. Is. Accurate.

Servers you right

          99

... Elemental spec?

Id wait until later if youre only lvl 30
---
fat shaming is needed
---
That is true if the player base is 50:50. I've seen polls of the population leaning closer to 45A:55H. Some have them as bad as 40A : 60H. This also depends on who actually queues up. 
---
Also those polls are probably not accurate though.
---
ok first of all, where is this coming from?
---
Second I never editing or changed anything from my post.
---
third all I am saying is that I want server transfers so my friends and I who are all level 60 can play together. it was more of a joke than anything, but I would like the feature.
---
Where did I ever say my friendship was ruined?!?! I'm so confused.
---
How DARE you ranged melee
---
At level 20 you should be fine filling any role in deadmines. It's always gonna come down to the group you're in - if they appreciate that you're new to tanking and play accordingly you'll be fine. If you get Mr. DPS Meter it'll be hard, but that's on him not you.
---
Sorry, bud. If you don't like PvP, there are plenty of servers that don't allow it. I will take dead alliance over live alliance anytime, anywhere.
---
Mages are the new huntards - confirmed

F

And you sound like a typical overweight gamerboi, your point?

Watching you sit there and not heal yourself was more painful than watching all the parrying

I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. In what world is Intel better than Nvidia for graphics?
---
I don't play on Herod, but I wouldn't judge a guild thanks to one shitty person. I hate people who act like that, and I hope you reported him! Sorry that you went through that. Now, if the guild tolerates this behavior that is when I say fuck em
---
Its the GMs job to know. If he doesn't understand the situation he needs to ask a supervisor. Downvote for you sir.
---
Do you have an enchanting alt?  Check your auction house for this shuffle:
---
Deadly Blunderbuss in engineering costs 8 copper bars + 2 medium leather + 4 silver in vendor mats to make.  It vendors for just under 12 silver (11s79c), this means that 8 copper + 2 medium leather being less than 7s 79c you could just vendor for profit (medium leather is usually around 80c, which would mean copper ore/bars just have to be under 77 copper to be under vendor price).  
---
Okay, so that is probably not worth your time because it takes forever to make all the tubes, bolts, etc.   However, they usually Disenchant into 2 greater magic essences.  When that happens, they're worth right about 30 silver instead of 11s 79c.   An enchanter can turn that into 2 greater magic wands, which vendor for \~30s.
---
What makes this a good shuffle for all levels is that you're really only looking at 1 commodity.  copper ore/bars.  Medium leather too, but you only need 2 per, your AH will run out of copper at 8 per before it runs out of medium leather.
---
Engineering isn't great for profit in this way, but if your server has a big economy, you could find a few shuffles to make some extra gold
---
the guy lies!
---
As a Mage of 15 years, it's really funny seeing people trying to play them today. On PvP servers I just attack every single one I see and watch them sort of flail about trying to figure out how to stop their shit from getting pushed in.
---
I hear your point, but my anecdotal experience has been that the healers in my group are more than capable of 5+ pulls. 
---
I didn‚Äôt spend 35 min making waters for that priest for them to passively regen mana between pulls. Drink to full ffs!
---
Rogues get tips for opening lockboxes, depending on the level a small tip is appreciated. Whether it's up to 1g at a higher lvl, or 30s at level 30/40. If I can make a full stack of decent water in one cast, I might be passing it around to everyone I see.
---
Fun?
---
Cast sw:p every 30ish seconds, cast mindflay over and over.  Occasionally cast mind blast.
---
Compelling.
---
Tried unchecking everything and it‚Äôs not there most of the time, until a fight finishes and it pops up again.
---
Grind basiliscs in thousands needles.
---
It is a gold mine. 
---
Dont tell anyone
---
Rogues win low target #, Mages win with higher target #. Warlocks win regardless until they die.
---
This is literally an example of retail mentality that you have lol.
---
I‚Äôd pay top dollar for this on a neutral AH. My wife goes crazy for the cosmetic pets.
---
Her current favorite is a black kingsnake.
---
It‚Äôs greatly appreciated, even when the person doesn‚Äôt say so. It legit makes our day so much easier.
---
I was 16 myself. Was the most epic experience in gaming I ever had. I was lucky too, it was February or March 2005 and I heard of a channel called MCFTW that somehow pugged molten core and Ony. I joined up and was instantly taken to Onyxia. We wiped for weeks but finally got her and then we made a guild to make it all official. Those moments will never happen again for me but I still love the game.
---
Hey I just got 60 today on my warrior, first aid and stacks of food are a must if solo.
---
Ah I see, ty
---
is the threat part of details build in or something I have to go add separately?  I've been using recount (cause it's what I remember) and classic threat meter, but that threat meter is pretty busted.  Half the time there is no one on the list but me and the rest of the time I'm at full threat no matter how little I've done to the mob, lol.  Might be time to give Details a try.
---
The GMs from this game are abusing there power already.
---
Oh yeah, this never happens on horde.  I've never gone through RFC and had a shaman need on guns and wands.  /sarcasm
---
Tanking or healing should be fine! Dps would definitely be lacking with that spec.
---
So you're mad because other people want to enjoy the game in a different way than you? Cool.
---
you must be retarded or just making this up trying to parrot what you've read on here because you frost nova FIRST  then flamestrike cone so you get to shatter both
---
Lmao
---
Agreed, but to be fair it does sometimes happen that irl creeps up on you unexpectedly.
---
No need for the available bag space display. I'll just assume it's always zero.
---
10s seems cheap as a stack of 45 food is 1.6g. I usually tip at least a gold since id have had to pay for it anyways
---
If you want to help maybe stand by and see if hunter needs adds pulled off.  Also you can throw a heal on hunter after, that's always nice.  Buffing the hunter before the tame is nice. Try to not mess with taming process
---
No mate, this is wrong. Only the US exists.

It was 5 minutes, now it's 10 minutes

He won the roll, then he was the only one who rolled
---
get your facts straight before you start looking for pity on reddit
---
1.12 is hardly vanilla, especially for trivial content like MC/onyxia.  it'd still be easy if we were playing on true 1.2 because people aren't bad anymore but classes are so much better now and the itemization used means most MC gear is worse than dungeon gear.
---
hoping if they ever release tbc that they use pre-nerf raids because even with 2.4 classes/itemization t5 will actually be progression for the average guild
---
That is 100% layering. Layers periodically will "collapse" when they contain too few players. Usually late at night when the population starts logging off, layers start getting merged together.
---
As a warrior you are defined not by your ability to hold aggro, but by your ability to  contain the mess once everything has gone tits up. That said, i usually use these mages as practice for that principle, until they wipe us more than 3 times and then i‚Äôll kick them.
---
Vendoring is often worth more than disenchanting until you can get eternal essences. Also, I offer enchants and get very few bites. When I do it involves a 1g tip when things like an arcanite rod cost nearly 100g. Definitely not a money making profession at this point in the game unless your guild funded your top level stuff.
---
I think this is an issue with mob leashing and spell batching.
---
For mob leashing, posts about not being able to split mob packs hints that mobs are going after pets despite them not attacking, which could be throwing the hunter back into combat.  I am curious if hunters are still having issue with fd trap without their pets out. 
---
For spell batching I noticed the lag on my spriest with blackout and mind flay.  Blackout stun is delayed and mob still get a hit off reducing my spell's channeled time.  I wonder if a similar issue is here, where there is still lingering damage on the mob that has yet to be batched and applied on the target, and the hunter feigns death, the pending attack on the target is applied after feign death.  It seems like abilities like feign are not spell batched on the target.   Again, I am curious to see if stopping all attacks on the mob for a second before feigning if there is a still an issue.
---
If I am right about the spell batching, this could be the same case with melee strikes that have yet to be batched and applied to the hunter, which is a likely scenario for an FD trap usage (mob is meleeing on top of the hunter and the hunter needs to FD trap to get the mob/enemy player off of them.) When the hunter feigns he still has melee hits that are pending on him and those are being applied after he has feigned throwing him back into combat.
---
This should be tested on basic mobs that do not have targeted abilities.
---
Could be wrong.
---
&gt;(nearly every DPS in dungeon groups are being carried by their healers because of how DPS ignore threat, prove me wrong). 
---
Stopped healing dungeons on my paladin for this reason.
---
Every few groups I'd have a DPS that recognized how ridiculous the situation was and complemented me on quality heals.
---
But the rest of the groups would rant about how terrible I was for letting DPS die when they pulled 2/3 mobs in the group and face tanked them.
---
No thanks. I've healed mythics. I have stacked +healing power gear and I'm using multiple ranks of Flash of Light. I can non-stop firehose for about 3 minutes with the amount of crit I have right now. If you die in my group, you had to *try* to fuck up. And boy howdy are people trying.
---
You fight against level 50s when you are 30 yourself? Why even bother?

May I suggest including my own creation to the list? I think it fits quite nicely:

It tethers the target portrait with your own so when you move one, the other follows but in a mirrored fashion--for symmetry lovers. Follow the link and you'll see a GIF worth a thousand words! :)
---
Gear checks are more of a thing for sure.  But there's also a bit more personal responsibility than MC, which has ... well... basically none.
---
I agree, shows a lot of useful information like exp/hour, gold/hour, durability, time to level and free bag space.
---
Damn son
---
wait how old are we ?
---
Oh thank god. It's been roughly 12 hours since the last one. I had forgotten.
---
Who said anything about actually enchanting stuff? Low level mats have two purposes, vendoring them through wand and leveling. In any case, you can sell them.

Used to be a OG WoW GM way way back when. We never did this shit, and if we did we would have gotten seriously chewed out. Most people who did this wouldn't have lasted a week. Unsurprisingly, this is the state of Blizz now.
---
I find that sometimes it's just better to do the grind method as opposed to quest. In the 30s quests were either way too much walking for that one-ish bar of xp to be worth it or the mobs/item drops are way to competitive to be worth it. I ended up grinding lvl35-38 on mobs in desolace and STV depending on the time of the day and how many people were around cause questing just felt way to slow and annoying to manage. Living that High server population life.
---
This is great.

Plagued dogs without blood
---
They replaced them with outsourced southasian underpaid semi-slaves who speak mostly in copypasted text excerpts from a scripted list of phrases.
---
What's funny is that this subreddit thinks NE is how dungeons are run and from day 1, I've yet to encounter that mentality in game.  Granted I've not seen any epics drop but of all the BoEs I have seen, no one is saying we should all need or needing when their class clearly can't use it.  Like a priest needing on mail or something.
---
People are social animals and the first person to hit need or greed will typical set the rule for that item.  No one wants to be outed as that guy who rolled need last on a BoE when the whole group greeded.  It puts too much pressure on the run and breaks the group dynamic of "us vs them".  In other words, most players are paper tigers, talking about how they NE or never open locked chests in dungeons, then bow to the unspoken social pressure when the moment presents itself.
---
MC is not Classic raids, to note.
---
It's more like a glorified world event.
---
Shift-Left click their name.
---
Seriously, picked up a pug DPS to fill a spot in the regular group that my friends and I run. Had a great time, just talking, etc while doing a dungeon. Not particularly fast, but not slow. Get to the end of the dungeon (pull just before the last boss), and the mage said "This took so much longer than my previous group".
---
Kicked him and finished the last boss s a 4-man. Assholes not welcome.
---
ending an argument with "triggered" is a telltale sign you've lost that argument
---
"Run awayyyy! Run awayyyy!"
---
You may be fine when things are going well, but you have no tools do deal with a pull going poorly. 
---
Challenging shout. Taunt
---
 Demoralizing shout. Shield block. Last stand. Shield wall.
---
These are all in the warrior toolkit for when shit hits the fan, and shaman don't have the tools that warriors do in this situation. In an ideal situation when everything is going well, the tank doesn't matter, it just makes things smooth. But warriors are equipped to prevent wipes when stuff goes wrong. Shaman are not. 
---
Furthermore, your list of mitigation abilities only get you up to the point of being as defensive as a warrior *who isn't using his abilities*. Once you factor in stuff like thunderclap, demo shout, shield slam, concussive blow? Trust me. As a healer, you're taking way more damage than a proper tank does. Again, if stuff is going well, it's fine. Shaman tabks are okay.  But I don't go into instances with randoms assuming everything will go well, and so I want a real tank, because it's smoother
---
I can tell you from farming golden pearls on the beach the pools are heavily camped.  At least on my overpopulated server.
---
Herbalism is going to require you to revisit every zone again to train it.
---
I keep seeing these types of posts on the subreddit but I legit haven't had any problems with mages/locks at all while tanking. I group with lots of them and all of them always top dps charts, use CC well, don't pull random stuff, ect. Rogues/hunters on the other hand I have had terrible luck with. Maybe being on Smolderweb is just living that true classic experience.

Stone skin OP.

It‚Äôs funny because I see it mostly on other classes to help against rogues.

Do whatever‚Äôs fun to you. You‚Äôre not hardcore raiding so you don‚Äôt have to worry. Yes Robes of the Archmage are great. But you‚Äôll replace it with T1 ASAP so don‚Äôt sweat it!
---
heelie mount when
---
Honestly, even as a mage I wasn‚Äôt bothered not getting mount until 43. I could teleport and hearth everywhere. When I did run around it was just to a dungeon, questing, or aoe farming spot.
---
Lol that might have been me, I always tip 15s for 2 stacks of food and water each and give em either a SS or HS
---
Do you have a casting add on for healers by any chance? Where you key bind left mouse right mouse to different spells on party member nameplates?
---
 Used to be a OG WoW GM way way back when. We never did this shit, and if we did we would have gotten seriously chewed out. Most people who did this wouldn't have lasted a week. Unsurprisingly, this is the state of Blizz now.
---
I blame all the aoeing streamers for mages like that.  They see them doing it then suddenly it becomes the ‚Äòmeta‚Äô (god I hate that word) and then you get more instances like above.  Also if you‚Äôre in a rush you should go back to retail.
---
I would level engineering and enchanting. Most OP combo possible.
---
God, I had an Indian boss once who said that all the damn time.  I had no idea it was an India thing; I just thought it was another facet to his idiocy.  TIL.
---
It's shitty and maybe sketchy but there is no such thing as a WoW ToS, it's just a generic EULA and says nothing about this.
---
Thank you.
---
I'm level 12, played 12h since lunch
---
It's an mmo, you kinda have to rely on people. You can't solo high level dungeons.
---
Well mostly the trash healers that can't heal cleave groups will have to drink after every pull anyways because they don't know how to heal, so the mana evens out.
---
But to actually answer the question: doing a dungeon in 10 pulls vs 30 pulls but drinking for 10 seconds after each of those 10 pulls, the math still adds up to it being better to do cleave groups.
---
I don't even know why people are arguing that cleave groups can even be comparable in speed. Sure if you don't like it, whatever. But to honestly think those people are getting less xp/hr or clearing the dungeons slower? It is just dumb.
---
If you had to kill them all by yourself, maybe. But single targeting down elites with a party, not. If you aoe 3 mobs, you will be oom when they die and have to drink.
---
Focus firing them with group, you won't oom, you did less damage overall, true, but you also killed enemies off from burdening the healer faster. Now the whole group gets to pull next pack without having to wait several people to drink to full from nothing.
---
If you're in a spellcleave aoe away, but if you're in a mixed group then all you accomplish is ooming yourself and then the next pull the party either fights as 4 or all wait for you to drink, leading to no faster clearing.
---
I definitely got a warning back in Vanilla to my parent's email for swearing. It had the chat logs in there too. I was probably 12 at the time, was kind of awkward. I never checked the TOS to see the offical rules on it, but they will act on it sometimes.
---
I honestly felt a little bit of pity when i would do my SM runs as horde and see the relentless treatment of alliance there.

I thought to myself

I was mining a rich thorium vein, got invited to a group, and stupidly accepted. Goodbye sweet sweet RTV.

Sure, that wouldn't have happened without layering in place, but it was 100% my dumb ass's fault.
---
Blizzard will mostly likely drag on the phases to maximize the life of classic. However, I think it would be interesting if they pushed out the first couple of phases pretty quick. One thing I enjoyed about classic was how there were lots of different tiers of players (mostly because people started playing at different times). With how the raids and phases are setup I can see the majority of players always with the most recent sets of gear, similar to retails progression of pvp gear. It would be boring if everyone progresses similarly the same and has all of the same equipment. Maybe BG's will solve this?
---
Esfand himself is near the bottom all the time, and that's with all his loot and consumables.  Ret is a definite meme spec.

That's... not what agile is. You don't write the entire document before you start coding. You damn sure should be documenting as you go.
---
Yeah I doubt there was any solid WoW content on youtube with a meaningful number of views until TBC at least. And even then, it would still be one of the worst sources for info compared to actual WoW dedicated sites.
---
For those of us who tanked back in vanilla, there was a golden rule.

"You pull it, you tank it".

&gt;in fact it is the most effective tool to combat obesity globally
---
This is factually wrong and just something you'd like to tell yourself because you are coming off like an asshole.  Nobody gets fat shamed into shape, people that finally decide to get into shape mostly do it because they get health scares/warnings or because they are motivated into it by family and friends.  Fat shaming only leads to hurt feelings and depression which deals to more over eating and not leaving the house.

Unfortunately deviate fish on my server sell for jack-shit since it's a high-pop server. I'd have to check back but yeah, the one time i looked into it, it just didnt' seem worth it for the investment. However the recipe for deviate fish delight is selling for like 20g

Holy shit, you really WERE salty about that 97, lol

Jesus christ, this is just embarrassing.
---
&gt;Some people, mainly large influences such as... 
---
Steamers need new content. Players don't,  and won't for a long time.
---
Some classes are 100% stronger than they were in earlier patches yes. Hunter for example is one. Warrior is another. Some of the early patches warriors were godly for burst and others their damage was nothing. It was comical to see the ups and downs. 
---
And we could do these fights with few people back then too during this patch. I remember Ropetown did Onyxia with ten people. They even did UBRS with three people.  
---
There were many godly guilds back then. Mine wasn‚Äôt godly but we were legit good. We were created in summer 2005, died in late 06 but came back together months later with new people and lasted until WoD. The idea we were all horrible just isn‚Äôt true. The game isn‚Äôt that complicated man.
---
I got my fishing from 10-125 in the TB pool in less than an hour. I missed probably 5%-10% of the fish because I wasn't paying attention that closely. It seems like it's probably one of the easiest professions to level (I know it will slow down dramatically later)
---
You see skull and run ? What a weakling, name of the game is world of warcraft, go play My lil pony world.
---
I know it's not conducive to the spirit of true classic, but as someone that's never played, wow, it doesn't take away from the fun. I played up to level 12 without questie and I kept getting frustrated with not remembering from who or where I got the quest, in order to get the reward. This is especially bad when the NPC moves around in the zone. I busted my ass to bring you bristle belts, why aren't you where I last saw you?! Ultimately, I still need help killing certain mobs and there are so many quest icons for mobs that you still have to read the quest if you want to make sure where to find those mobs (looking at you harpies in the barrens). I've been enjoying classic but there's so much bashing on questie. Furthermore, I get to experience all the quests in a zone when I could've easily missed it otherwise (those quests in that cave in thunderbluff?!). It does change how the game is played somewhat but to each his own.
---
I don't see the problem. You literally admitted to exploiting the terrain and then got a warning for it. 
---
Just because you didn't pvp doesn't mean it's still not against the rules.   
---
The GM was right.  Can't believe morons actually gave this post gold.
---
This isn't any different from.vanilla.

Make up whatever bs ruleset you want to make yourself feel better. You're crying about nothing. If anything you saying that probably means it's been used on you before. Not surprised!
---
Wonderful!!
---
They can also aggro packs that could otherwise be skipped

Do you have a non-egotistical/diva answer as to why you would ever take that advice?

use this:

\#showtooltip Sinister Strike  
---
/cleartarget [dead][help]  
---
/startattack  
---
/cast Riposte  
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
If you're enhancement, you can tank, you just have to be convincing when you recruit.
---
Other questing zones your level are Stonetalon Mountains, and Ashenvale. Southern barrens (camp Tauraje, and the dwarf excavation near the Lift) is also your level.
---
Who hurt you?
---
We often cleared MC with 28-32 on off days during vanilla, and with BWL on farm we often had alts or trials come in to fill out the raid to top it off. 20 man split raids are easily doable now with 2-3 times the framerate and an infinitely better internet connection, coupled with 15 years of time passing to perfect the gameplay.
---
I did 56-60 in 9 hours doing this.
---
&gt;LF dungeon everything locked

I hate that.  If you want an item make a group and don't invite any classes that could need that item.  Like no other plate dps or mail or whatever.
---
I am getting into groups where people are calling ninja after someone Needed an item that they equipped.  Like a wtf man.

That's why I use it :D

I have got to 37 in disenchanting just by disenchanting and making my rod. When does lv from disenchanting cap out?
---
Man i hate Tanks, they think since they get to go in first/the healer is always attentive to them they are the leaders. My server is 65% warriors bitch, ill replace you so fast.
---
You know The Office? Re-watch it while fishing and once you are done you have your mount.
---
Haha that‚Äôs impressive, how is it created?
---
I also noticed last night that it fully replaces the attack too. I can't use rank 1 heroic strike only rank 2.
---
heavily disagree, but i think the phase layout should be scrapped and less stuff be added at a faster pace instead of big chunks of content with big gaps in between them.
---
for example getting WSG before arathi, instead of both at the same time.
---
regardless we don't even know the pace blizzard are going for atm, so idk
---
Ferelas should have things for you
---
Exactly. Ironing out bugs and bad design should be praised.
---
No need to break anything for me. So far I enjoyed leveling ‚Äúmy way‚Äù.  I went where I want and did professions etc etc. Now, I just want to rush to 60 and I‚Äôm absolutely confident that I will only be bored at the end of phase 1. And that will take time.
---
Hunters cant attack you if you're within a few feet of them. 
---
Try and be too close for ranged attacks but too far for melee.
---
It's not half designed. Im level 31, have 31% reduced dmg from armor, 13.5% Dodge, 5% parry, 11% block and manage to hold threat. Those rules I stated are actually the exact same shit u have to do with a warrior tank.
---
You wish weatherboy, mages just suck
---
&gt; I remember occasionally getting dotted up by a priest or whatever in Gadgetzan but for the most part the rules were highly enforced - no PvPing from the roofs.

What would you say is the best mod to alert you when it detects a rare spawn?

Yup, I just got Warmonger the other day and instead of seeing my awesome huge red sword slashing my foe I get this dinky quiver. It was funny the first 10 or so times now it annoys me.

Did you report them?

Why tf are they making it so obvious lol
---
Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes
---
He probably has a guidebook and they follow it to the letter, just like any large institution Blizzard is run Soviet-style. OP also performed the exploit to get up there, so he got a warning.
---
If you want better GM‚Äôs, Blizzard will want to shift the costs to us, would you pay for a higher subscription fee? Maybe, but would most people who barely interact with support? Hell no. Why would they want to shift costs? Because they can, but will they? Probably not, or they would have done so already if their internal stats pointed toward retention of subscribers.
---
Right or wrong, this is where we are.
---
It only deletes the stuff when you click the delete button but I have planned on add a history of deleted items. But thinking now, addind the deletion/creation/done history would be better. Thanks!
---
Good advice! So insane haha, can't believe it. Got like 30g atm.
---
I agree between DM and cath, except for the final bosses. I just 2h ravager tank until the final bosses before I put on my shield. Never had a problem. I didn‚Äôt even really Tank in DM, BFD, GY, Lib, Arm, etc., just did dps with a few sunders.
---
Frost mage vs warrior
---
Am spriest. Have given up even trying to run dungeons because everybody thinks it's a joke. Probably going to reroll Mage
---
Rogues are better DPS, especially horde since they have access to windfury totem. They also only really compete with Fury Warriors for melee gear/DPS slots, with the occasional DPS Feral Druid. Warlocks are needed for their curses, at least 3 for Curse of Shadow, Elements, and Recklessness, and get decent DPS that gets better as more Hit/Crit gear gets phased in.
---
Don't have much experience with PvP/Battlegrounds, but they both seem good.
---

We hate mages now?

We hate mages now!
---
Mage vs Warrior
---
I generally agree, and get this, but before level 50 it really is fine.
---
Good advice, I would also add a couple things:
---
1) Stay away from the AH. You can end up paying tons of gold for marginal upgrades.
---
2) Find an easy hustle... ie: Farm the Warlock Robe recipe and sell a few every day, buy the First Aid pattern in Dustwallow and sell it for 30-50s profit. There‚Äôs tons of these little ways to add some gold.
---
3) I found watching this has actually really helped my farm: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G1IbRujko-A
---
&gt;  be playing. Its just known as a popular strategy thats leading to a meta of players terribly exectuing a half assed version.
---
wouldn't the easiest fix be to just cut the fuck out of EXP granted for trash in a dungeon and move whatever the overall cut exp amount was to the boss that trash belongs to?
---
Oh I play entirely for fun.  If it's no fun to play you should stop and do something else. Once you start to play for your ego only you failed entirely.  When gameplay and people meet in the right way things become a worth memory. 
---
But you should not complain about the others too much just introduce yourself as a tank sham and be real about expectations. You won't join every group but those you do are may be more okay with it. People don't like that kind of surprises.
---
You could start one level below as a tanking druid slightly easier to convince people.
---
Don't use evasion. All warriors want you to dodge so they can increase their dps.
---
If you see a warrior swap to shield + berserker stance, he knows you're there.
---
Warriors can aoe destealth with demo shout - dont dick around in stealth near one.
---
And honestly - if you can avoid fighting a warrior, do so.
---
Not worth it as Alliance IMO. You can get Bonebiter at 34.
---
You had to unlock Heroics by buying a key at revered with outland factions. I think they had tabards for that.
---
Later, they removed the rep/key requirement for heroics.
---
Sounds like you were doing the same thing as them when you attacked the priestess and didn‚Äôt stay to help them
---
They‚Äôre from Ashenvale
---
It is possible but some people want to check off other things from their main on their alts so i'm planning to add shared and private lists
---
The problem with "you will be eventually" is that if you get there after everyone else by a month or two, you'll be struggling to get a dozen guys together for MC, much less 25-40. It took the hard-core players a week to clear the first two raids. Release everything too quick, and those guys will all be BIS NAXX before everyone else is even starting Zul and you'll have nothing but failed PUGs for 90% of the playerbase for everything past MC and Ony. Blizz has a 2nd chance to give everyone this game in it's original form, so why would they make it so that only the top 2% see Naxx just like the first time?
---
No, where are you getting that from?
---
Utilizing any other logic, everything is free because all it costs you is time.
---
Are you seriously considering having enough rage pots to drink on cooldown as necessary to qualify a tank as "prepared for the instance?"
---
EDIT: Reading comprehension fail, you were responding to the time issue not the potions, my bad.
---
So mad.. Enjoy playing a pvp server and getting rekt just to come cry on the interwebs, lmao at you. 
---
Watch your back, might get ya questing.
---
The mage. Mages are the de facto assholes now. It's always the mage's fault.
---
Rage potions 
---
Looooooooool
---
Why is it Frost Mages? I thought the Fire build was the highest DPS?
---
Mage vs anything.
---
Some addons can give you a list of the possible mats you get. It's not always accurate, but it's usually good enough. You should also have some idea of how much each components can sell for. Something like auctionator will do both (average gold value of the output), but the mat price variations make it unreliable as it is.
---
Only the first two wands are directly profitable, yeah. Anything else is only investing in your enchanting skill for later. I'd suggest staying at 150 (as high as wands can get you), and only go higher when you can reach the end game (profitable) enchantements. Sell any mat you get from D/E before that.
---
saving
---
Nightfin, stonescale eel, Deviate fish
---
But what about all the geniuses telling me MC is so hard druids won't be able to tank
---
It has been mentioned multiple times that the difference between BoP and BoE is the cost.  So needing on all BoPs means that you are only netting a gold or two from the vendor.  E.G. If a BoE is also only selling for a small amount on the AH, saying you are needing for mount money is being miserly.
---
Also, "undervalued" is relative.  Just because one person on the server will pay 100g for a dagger does not mean the market price is 100g.  If the market cannot regularly sell an item at whatever price you list, that item is listed too high.
---
well priests do get wands, so you can always wand.  I haven't healed as a druid in anything before Wrath really so I'm not as familiar with them.
---
I can't give you one. I knew a Blizzard Staff Manager.
---
yes just google "elvui classic "
---
Oh for sure. Shedo was a huge inspiration to go feral. However, I want to get reinvited to raids, so farming MCPs are a small price to pay in order to actually get in.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt see below the graph the list of parses for each class. Druids have a little less than 400 compared to the 10k+ of warriors and mages. Gotta help bring that average up :)
---
Sounds like you were in a terrible spot for grinding then. Either the 40g or the 5g is incorrect. There is no way over a sample size that large that there would be that big a difference in vendor trash. Maybe if he got a BOE blue that auctioned for 30g, but in terms of vendoring no way.
---
Might be after tomorrow's content update, too. Would be interesting to see about hitting it hard before people realize it's out.
---
Well he is north ..it just doesnt tell you how to get north.
---
Rogues are funny because we have a lot of downtime stealth-camping mobs and players. We use that time to think of witty things to say.
---
Also we're sociopaths.
---
Could have just vendored the SOJ
---
Thanks man &lt;3  u2
---
You should at a bare minimum be deleting warlocks and priests as fury
---
Eh, I can't really see it being positive. As a melee it's not a big deal, but when you are fighting out of range of mobs as a caster, you can't see the health of anything you are fighting, you can't see how many there are, you can't switch targets easily, you can't see nameplate debuffs/cast bars... I feel so disconnected basically having no idea what is going on with the pull besides tab targeting and staring at my target frame
---
how viable is a five druid instance team in classic
---
Mostly to keep mobs from pinballing as the threat positions jump all over the place. Unless you have one person who regularly pulls ahead it just makes things annoying.
---
I think warlock companions have random names and this guys was thanos lol
---
Great list, it made me think about my add-ons. I have been using Tukui on my shaman and honestly, now that I think about it, I should experience wow as it was released since it's my very first time playing. Also, that last one for the quest frames is awesome, going to definitely use it! :D
---
&gt;I can't fathom how anyone would have 8+ days /played at not at least be 60 yet, but as long as they're having fun when they play that's all that matters as far as I'm concerned.
---
Uh hi, about 6 bubbles from 56 and over 8 days played. 215ish engineering and 200 mining checking in. 
---
Despite mages I've grouped with best efforts 0 AE groups or anybody those shenanigans. Mostly just questing and the occasional dungeon run.
---
If you're going back to town and you still have space in your bags then go grind and fill them up before going back. Try to grind the same mobs that frequently drops greys that vendor for a good amount. If you have skinning then basilisks in the Shimmering Flats are a good option, my favorite spot is near the entrance to Tanaris. Oh, and stop buying stuff on the AH. I'm also a rogue and haven't spent a copper on gear from the AH and I don't have any issues taking on multiple mobs a few levels higher than me.
---
Dude, it happens to me every few groups now.  Mages and warlocks constantly killing themselves.
---
I'd be happy to have 3 hunters with all their pets having growl on.  Whatever, 3 offtanks are cool.  As long as the healer isn't getting hit and stuff is dying at a good pace I'm cool.
---
I'm not cool with AOE mages and warlocks wasting everyone's time by killing themselves constantly.  Wtf is so hard about single targeting the skull?  I'm doing all the work for the group. I mark everything, I pull strategically, I make sure we won't aggro a pat or a nearby group.  All they have to do is target the skull and press frostbolt over and over again.  But they can't handle that.
---
i used these addons or addons that did this under a diff name 15 years ago
---
All running cool, and tested stuff since reading these comments, I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs just classic on Mac.
---
Basically funneled loot council they're meaning to specifically gear specific players over others first.  DKP overall being a point system and EPGP tend to be better alternatives if you're looking for equal standing.
---
You are the same voice on this post. Thank you. People do not seem to get that this isn't retail. By Lich King the way stats and skills worked for threat generation was unrecognizable from classic.
---
I did, almost all of Vanilla. December 2004 until BC. 
---
I expect there to be fighting in a neutral city (I certainly did lots back in Vanilla), but not outside of the guards' ability to fight you. That's why attacking from the rooftops is not allowed. The guards can't get you. 
---
As someone else said, at some point Blizzard implemented guards that could shoot you off of roofs but that's not implemented in Classic.
---
Neutral AH is only 15%, not 30%.
---
"..made the game 40% easier..."
---
Sure it wasn't 43%?  üòÇ
---
im working on that and tailoring on my priest. i think the rewards really come in at the endgame, but i could be wrong
---
Very high level enchants locked behind raid drops (3% from 2-3 bosses), and a few other very deep rep grinds are worth it. Past that, no. You can have a level 1 enchanter, disenchant anything you want for mats.
---
With the reputatuon Riot has when it comes too female Staff I'm not sure I'd say confidently that it was a mistake.
---
Except locks :) can counter mages pretty well the the Felhunter
---
Type this in and it should start working immediately.  If it doesnt work, remove the quotes.
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride ‚Äú0‚Äù
---
I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
Lmfao.
---
I died a few times but mostly I really did enjoy EPL. not so much WPL.
---
I don't see why my edit lacks credibility.  I was making comments on the first several replies and then realized people wouldn't see those before commenting.  I was responding to the feedback that people missed what I wrote, so I added that in.  This is why publishers have beta readers for books and screen tests for movies.
---
I agree, if I waited until 30 seconds later, I'd be the jerk.  He just rolled and clicked as soon as he saw a 97.
---
You‚Äôre supposed to attack mobs while they‚Äôre frozen to keep aggro, but this guys seems like a jerk. Just kick him and move on.
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt really see a problem. 
---
People are happy when they get their cigarettes or coke too but it's wildly unhealthy.
---
Feral charge is good when you need to get to someone quick (instead of that DPS bringing it back to you) but I find it a bit lackluster sometimes. I think it'll be better (and more used) in phase 2 onwards because of PvP purposes.
---
My main benefit from auctionator, besides listing vendor/auction prices on tooltips, is that it lets me condense the search results. For example, 72 stacks of 1 at the same prices shows up to me as one line. 
---
‚ÄúItem Price x stacks of 1‚Äù
---
Incredible QoL for buying anything. 
---
Automated purchasing however should definitely not happen.
---
INCREDIBLE LIST THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!
---
Which is inferior to their ranged attack option.
---
Then you‚Äôre doing it wrong
---
What in Pixelation!!

There is a copy of it in Booty Bay - [https://imgur.com/a/AqGIvnN](https://imgur.com/a/AqGIvnN)
---
Of course you do, it's called entitlement and it's usually part of a greater set of mental disorders.
---
I always remember 3 sunders... on bosses.
---
it's actually amazing in dungeons and i did it as often as i could while leveling. the best way to do it is get 3 warriors (arms), sham/pal (enhance/ret) depending on faction (4 warriors is fine though) and a priest.
---
have each warrior grab a mob in the pack (this makes damage intake pretty smooth for the priest and they get lot's of rage from taking hits), sham/pala is mostly buff support but does reasonable dmg (good for off heals when necessary) and make sure the priest is 5/5 spirit tap and everyone is letting the priest get at least 1 killing blow in each pack. the dmg intake on each individual warrior is fairly low that they'll each only need 1-2 heals a pull. arms is amazing in dungeons on up to 4 targets. between sweeping strikes, ww and cleave theyll DESTROY packs (often times the priest is healing just to top them off between pulls rather than keep them alive during the pull).
---
this melee cleave is a bit slower than a spell cleave group that is played correctly. however, the room for error on spell cleave is much bigger and typically melee cleave is a smoother experience and there is 0 down time if you let the healer get killing blows for spirit tap.
---
Stay out of Arathi.
---
Op, you sound like you have bpd. The general consensus is that your behavior was in the wrong and rather than reevaluate the situation you double down on how right you are.
---
Then it wasn't so vital, now, was it?
---
I'm almost level 29 now and have 40G in my bags. By far my best incomes while pexing. What is too bad is that this time I'm playing a warlock...
---
In retail it‚Äôs personal loot.
---
No it‚Äôs just dumb to me to prescribe a laundry list of shit that conflicts with each other when you can get a package deal that does 90% of what you need
---
Had the same issue, used quartz instead and it works great
---
Not when they are dead, My problem is solved :D
---
But i hear ya, That's why i tend to tank it. But it doesn't stop it being frustrating as all hell.
---
waa i have to play the game and buy skills like everyone else
---
I personally use Advanced Interface Options, Scrap, and What's Training among this list, and can highly recommend them. I intend on adding a few that I don't have, specifically LetMeCast sounds extremely helpful.   
---
 I would also like to recommend for your list, for casters "Five Second Rule". It adds an adjustable bar (default on your mana bar) that shows the time before you start regenerating mana again. I found it EXTREMELY helpful for my healing roles. 
---
Things that probably won't fit on this list above, but I will add are - 
---
"Titan Panel Classic" is one that has been mentioned below. I found it highly useful, especially with paired with other mods. I recommend taking a few minutes to tinker with it. I specifically recommend black background, with center aligned in the settings, and you can adjust the bits at the top by clicking and dragging over another one.  
---
"Death Counter" adds little counter for your deaths at the bottom right of your screen.  
---
"NeatPlates" is very useful, and highly customizable addon for your nameplates.  
---
"SmartQuest" is a mod that works with other players also using this mod. It shows when another player picks up, turns in, or completes a quest step (think drop rate quests 1/10) in your chat. You can customize what you see, and where it shows up. I personally have a new tab for it show up. Very helpful when questing with people.  
---
All of these can be found with the Twitch app/mod installer.
---
Ah yes sorry forgot about those! +Frost damage for sure.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been going back to the barrens a lot just to run around and find herbs hahaha
---
&gt; We dont actually care what the current market value is, just that it is the same for everyone in the group.
---
IDGAF what the cost is.  When something drops, the value is either money or leveling/dungeon.  And if the value is small, aka under 10g, saying you are needing for mount money is just sad.
---
Saying you don't care what the current market value is means that everyone should need everything because you can just buy the item on the AH, right?  And everything includes BoP or BoE, because hey, 1g is 1g, right?
---
Wow... so store mounts are herein classic too.
---
Not sure you can? Maybe some addon out there tries to parse the chatlog for it, but in general you can't see buffs on enemies in Classic without a Mage casting [Detect Magic](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Detect_Magic).
---
I said in another post that I am the "steady and careful tank" who might not be the fastest in the world but I WILL guarantee that the run gets done, and there are no deaths. And lo and behold some guy came in here bashing me, saying "then you're a bad tank".
---
First everyone says they're all about the journey but yet we have these toxic individuals who fancy themself some kinda famous streamer or saw something and want to imitate it. Seriously I don't remember the game being like this 15 years ago. Was it always? I'm not so sure, because if it was, then surely all this "sap X, sheep O" wouldn't have been a thing in The Burning Crusade.
---
So fine, all you people calling me a bad tank. You do you. You go all nuts with your AoE stuff and when you guys wipe and do yet another graveyard run back to the instance, I'll see you. No no, I won't gloat, I won't point fingers and go ha ha ha oh look. Oh no no I'm not the kind of person to rub it in.
---
But I will smile.
---
Enter stage right, grenades. What exactly are you trying to do with your ignorance?
---
Rogue vs spriest is no rose if you don't get the opener. Rogue vs warlock too since you don't have the anti fear tools warriors do
---
A employee of a game company is incompetent and has no clue about that game - shocker
---
I don't really minmax, I've just done fire and frost before.
---
Even if they knew exactly, it's not their place to do PR. Their supervisors absolutely are not available at the night of sunday. 
---
Common sense is free, sir.
---
This is a fantastic list, thank you so much.
---
That was awesome. This is one of the reasons why I love pvp, especially rp-pvp.
---
Which server was this ? I play on one of these servers, Deviate Delight (I think that's what it's called).
---
What ressources did you use to learn lua / addon dev?
---
To me the only rule I follow with my heart is the be nice rule. The other rules I follow only because the consequences are severe. However, many cheats, hacks and exploit can easily fall under ‚Äúnot being nice‚Äù department. But I will personally be the judge of what is and what is not:)
---
Ill start downloading tonight
---
These threads are great. It sucks to lose aggro and especially if the mage wipes the group but my God it's actually insane how much damage a geared mage does with AOE. I can see why they want to do it. It makes everything go so much faster if they're able to pull it off
---
I recently received a whisper from a Druid named Likeable who was willing to help me kill my Whirlwind elemental for my warrior quest if I paid 15 gold.
---
I told him he should change his name.
---
Up an elevator, impressive.
---
What an inept piece of shit.
---
Im not taking it well... Alex was my daily source of laughter... How will I follow the DEV of his MMO? LOL
---
gotta say... I haven't been ignored yet and i talk to people often. Kinda makes me look at you with suspicious hippo eyes
---
As a healer I wish could find these groups that want to pull everything, only been in 2 so far and it's only time healing dungeons so far is been worth any effort.
---
If it was a female, all would be forgiven!
---
OP needs to verify the upgradation of his ticket to speak to a Tier 2 operator.
---
Swing timers are great for hunters whose abilities can clip their autoattacks. Basically for hunter's auto attacks animations will fail if overlapped with another command. You want to time abilities between the autoattack animations for this reason.
---
 I know some melee classes use them as well, but I'm no expert on that.
---
I bet you're a gnome mage.  You midget fuck.
---
This is what I use:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cancelform [noform:1]
---
    /cast Bear Form
---
It cancels your current form only if you aren't in Bear Form, then casts Bear Form. Casting Bear while in Bear cancels it. Upgrade to Dire Bear Form when you get it. You can also use noform:3 and Cat Form with the same setup.
---
Damn dude !! Grats :3
---
Eh I'm more of a language descriptivist  than prescriptivist, so I don't think we'll see eye to eye here.
---
That is adorable lmao
---

---
I would like to know what you find boring about aoe vs fighting two mobs, you are essentially doing the same thing but more efficiently? Just not been in a group that was able to do it without death runs?
---
The more this post gets downvoted, the more I believe it.
---
I havn't reported anything, I don't even wear leather.
---
I have though always disliked this sort of xfaction win trading regardless of that, I get some people really need all the advantages  they can get but this isn't a even playing field other groups can just come into, I've seen other guilds going and trying but they can't sustain any disruption for long.
---
Edit; I don't even know if it's bannable now, I know it was in Vanilla.
---
&gt; WoW Classic is by far perfect.
---
Confusing typo there (contextually assuming you meant "far from").
---
Thats fine. Im just saying anyone saying "Why the fuck are you arcane" doesnt rly know anything about mages.
---
The change is so minor and it fixes an exploit that they are actively trying to prevent with moderation. I don't think many who still want no changes will fret about a single mob added on top of the arena.
---
Did you go to Zoram Gar Outpost in the northwest of Ashenvale? There are quests to kill level 19 Naga and level 22ish Furblogs
---
You should also run BFD at 24/25, which is in NW Ashenvale. There is a quest inside the instance that gives a 29 dps wand that I'm still using on my 37 lock.
---
Yep, that looks pretty north to me. I think some of these people may not read directions very well as I've only run into one issue so far at level 46 and it was a situation like this where it was just hard to find a path to the person.
---
A bit. DEing select quest rewards/dungeon drops and selling the mats on the AH can net some additional gold. That only requires lvl 1 enchanting though. The money comes in much more when you get endgame enchants, which players pay a lot more for. That probably won't kick in until you hit endgame, though.
---
you know vendors sell food and water, and you don't have to whisper them for it, right? There ya go, problem resolved.
---
Miss you and your antics Harkie hope you‚Äôre enjoying yourself in classic :) -Mephysto
---
Could someone please explain the different BRD runs that are advertised such as Princess Run and Arena run?  Thanks.
---
/cancelform
---
/cast XYZ Form
---
As for the cancel form on re-press should be a way to do it with stances. I will have to play with it might report back.
---
Thanks for the reply! I'll think about it once i can get on today!
---
The longest grind I've ever done in World of Warcraft is finally done. The grind was finished last night. The grind took about a total of 200 hours, all done with the 60% mount. Only thought it was fitting to take the picture with my guild mate who got Rivendare's Deathcharger the night before. The mount has been claimed on EU-Gehennas PVP.
---
I want to give a huge shoutout to the people who have been joining me for this reputation grind and have been pushing me every day to grind harder.  
---
Huge shoutout to:
---
Tierra - twitch.tv/TierraTV  
---
Rikh - twitch.tv/Rikhh  
---
Saga (My fellow 60%'er)  
---
Eyrin (The fastest FFA looter in EU)
---
They put out better threat and allow you to gear up other tanks easier, and they can also heal/decurse/dps with a simple gear set change.
---
So if mitigation isn't a issue (and let's be real it's just MC) then yeah you want a druid tank
---
Honestly, that Mage sounds a lot nicer about his stupidity than most of the DPS I've run with...  
---
Also, guys, in case you don't know, DRUID BEAR TANKS CAN ONLY HIT 3 TARGETS WITH SWIPE. T\_T We don't have AoE! Please stop attacking that 4th+ mob 0.01 seconds after I've pulled a group. It's literally impossible for me to get off anything except a roar on it.
---
I mean... I‚Äôm doing this but it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúrunning around headless‚Äù I‚Äôm just kiting and tbf I‚Äôm rarely dying. Ice block is kinda handy with the not dying part ;)
---
My husband's a mage and can confirm, it's easy as hell. Find a spot, layer hop if needed, AOE shit down. $$$$$
---
I did free transfer back in the day. It was terrible. But I guess it comes with it being free. Want quality? one has to pay for it.
---
Last night I just told my group ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to keep you guys safe and for us to have a good time. Everything else is not important‚Äù - one guy was a bit miffed that we weren‚Äôt SANIC fast, but three other guys messaged me after getting out of ZF saying how well I did and how they would group with me again any time. It was probably the best experience I‚Äôve had so far in a dungeon.
---
Tank bros, lets get these guys in and out in one piece.
---
Sheep the paladin before blessing of freedom is up. Or sheep the paladin and wait out the freedom in ice block till freedom runs out in 10 seconds. 
---
Warriors can also pop engineering trinkets and free action potions to even the field some. But it‚Äôs one of the hardest 1v1 matches. 
---
Now a warrior benefits 10 fold more with a pocket healer than a mage.
---
Few days ago I saw a mage attacking a fellow warrior in Tanaris. I charged in to the rescue. The mage frostnavaed us both, killed him and then me. Just deleted us. So yeah, mage vs warrior is the worst easily....
---
You should step into my life, where i get really good rolls on greed, and insanely shitty rolls for need.
---
A good tip is using the vendor price addon I find things on the AH that are often listed with prices below vendor sell price. I'll buy them and just vendor them.
---
Downvoting for invisibility.
---
Right, well very few macros you find on google are any good. Mostly because many of them use modifiers unnecessarily. 
---
I'm also a bit rusty, havn't touched upon macro's in many many years but take a dive into it and you'll greatly improve your gameplay.
---
As a tank on komkrush- I love having rogues in my group. Your always behind the skull and burning him down while I tab sunder, and if you pull aggro you have evasion until I can get it back.
---
Unless you're alliance. I have been ganked SO many times by stealthed rogues when I'm just running along lol
---
Warlocks have been the worst offenders with threat when I tank.  They dot everything and never focus on skull and pull threat and run around in circles the rest of the fight unable to do anything.
---
Fuck, go back
---
Bad service = manager or supervisor should know. People have bad days, but they should separate their personal feelings from their job. They‚Äôre getting paid the same for their inefficient time as they are their efficient time.
---
I am a 300 enchanter, and I use TSM with daily updated scans. I sell everything I get - the issue is I don't get a lot. Oftentimes it's also worthwhile to just vendor something rather than disenchant it unless disenchanting it would result in eternal essences.
---
In my experience only of the Owl/Bear/Monkey/Bear is worth selling, and oftentimes they also aren't worth multiple relistings + AH cut.
---
This was on Grobbulus (NA)
---
It's not broken, people are just spoiled. It never worked smoothly in Vanilla. It worked waaaay too well in Pservers - that was the first thing I noticed when leveling a hunter on a Pserver. 
---
It works for me in Classic everytime cause I do it manually instead of using a macro like a scrub. End rant.
---
A special quiver thats part of a bow ? Never seen that
---
God damn mages are ruining mage for the rest of us.
---
I was in a mc raid last night, half guild and half pug. We cleared 6 bosses and it took 4 hours. So I really wouldn't say mc is easy as its extremely time consuming. Unless you're some crazy private server guild that knows the pulls by heart.
---
Elemental Mage with Frostbite, shatter, iceshards, and ignite.
---
Freeze -&gt; Frosbolt+Fire Blast
---
Just because we don't like how something ends, that doesn't mean it isn't worth the time. We all die in the end, right? Whether it's of old age or disease. Does that make it pointless? Should we all just partake in mass suicides because we're all gonna die anyway?
---
Sorry for getting philosophical, just had to illustrate how bizarre your logic is.
---
I remember when I had a download problem, the Microsoft guy was trying to tell me 1 megabit per second was normal. Thinking he was seeing 1 megabyte per second. When I explained it he just ended the call lmao
---
You see this is the problem, loot council requires a community that trusts leadership and requires a vast majority of players to understand Bis lists and how much relevant value each of the valuable cross class items have. 
---
DKP is like a dummy system allowing people to spend currency on various things, and is one of the most easily abused loot systems ever invented. 
---
Different systems will be used based on the competency of the guild as a whole. I don‚Äôt know about you but I want to gear out my whole guild in the most beneficial way, regardless of how much they really want x y z item. 
---
The fact that people pass on loot and pool DKP is they can target a specific item that may or may not even be good for their class is the main issue. 
---
A standard loot council is filled with class leaders or role leaders that are the most knowledgeable on itemization. They then review documentation for attendance, performance and overall guild involvement along with a history of previous loot obtained and make a group vote on how the situation will be handled. 
---
Often times people are on equal standing and there is a roll off and often times with trash tier pieces and decent tier pieces it is just handled in a round robin fashion. 
---
The issue becomes most complex when very rare or powerful items drop that is when much deliberation is needed and the results are most important. No experienced vanilla player would justify putting certain very powerful items on a class that gets very little benefit from them, only because he had more DKP because he literally bought nothing.
---
Hold on to it. It will increase once more ppl actually have gold.
---
I've brought this up several times with GMs in the past, it doesn't matter. If you're cursing you can get a warning, then you will get suspended if you keep it up. The thing is, Blizzard wants to pride itself on being "family-friendly" and what ticks me off is there's actually a setting within the game that makes it so that no one can actually see the shit you say it turns it into \*&amp;\^\*&amp;\^ and even so it doesn't matter. The GMs have agreed with me that it isn't against the rules however, it's a form of "harassment" according to the higher ups because it can be construed as harassment towards someone even though you're not actually saying anything to anyone. I've had friends who were suspended for a few hours for the dumbest shit throughout the years. If you start asking around, you'll find that many people have been suspended over the years for the most asinine reasons.
---
I'm sorry but what a bullshit title. "Thank you have a good night" doesn't look like mid-conversation to me.
---
Oooooooooo I need this for every RPG I play
---
I dont get groups like this lol idk maybe im super lucky but reddit actively hates like every class that isnt a psuedo-chad warrior or a dainty healer with a mana pool of a level 4. 
---
Ffs reddit we better than this
---
at BRD and above they go fury and wield wield tank instead of using a 2H.
---
I don't get what immersion has to do with nameplate range. You might have an argument against nameplates existing to begin with, but what is immersive about having to stand unnecessarily close to your enemies as a DoT class to do your job?
---
Because of this, I actually wish the dungeon mobs did MORE damage against non-tanks. But then again - we won't have very long to wait for that to be a reality. If you pull aggro as a non-tank then you should die. That's what it should be.
---
Oh i don't mind it when it makes sense. Is it say 2-3 elites and then i don't know some random normal mobs mixed in. Yeah AOE away because i know i only need to focus on the elites. 
---
Its more the "look ive pulled 20 elites and stood in melee range spamming Arcane explosion OMG why am i dead peeps" that are the problem lol
---
always keep a 1h and shield in ur backpack for if people ask you to tank a dungeon.
---
Be upfront that you're new and most will be happy to help.
---
Make friends; warrior is fk'n hard man (i got a 36 warrior). Look for a chill guild that's medium size, not one so big where nobody cares until you're 60. You'll need help in the 30's for your whirlwind axe quest killing a level 40 elite. Also, us higher level warriors tend to sell the elemental drops for that quest on the AH. it's not too expensive.
---
Greys are worth more than white items to vendors, weapons are worth more than armor (usually), and the higher the armor class the higher vendor value. (example, a 2h grey mace is worth more to a vendor than a white dagger, and a grey mail chestpiece is worth more than a grey cloak).
---
White items like "Long Tail Feather" might be white listing them as a trade good, but not all trade goods are created equal. some are flatly worthless outside of super niche recipes or quests. 
---
Blacksmithing will not make you money until lategame. Nor will it provide good weapons/armor upgrades along the way most of the time. It might, but it's only done so once or twice for me in 36 levels. sharpening stones are handy tho.
---
good luck!
---
I asked for mage water outside an instance and the wouldn‚Äôt give it to me unless I paid 40s. Got water from another mage later on who whispered me ‚Äúwow no tip‚Äù. I‚Äôm not really bothered by either but you‚Äôre not an asshole. If people want to pay for it so being. It rather swap to my spirit gear in between mobs and waste my time than pay for water.
---
Awesome I‚Äôll try this out tonight, can‚Äôt remember how I set it up because this doesn‚Äôt look too far off! :)
---
SFK!  
---
Source: I just like SFK
---
Questie is just wowhead/thottbot in an AddOn. It's not going away.
---
Scrolling through all this grossness and your comment was the only thing still keeping my faith left in humanity, thanks.
---
yeah we are in agreement haha. That sounds incredibly frustrating to deal with as a tank
---
I tried farming [jaguars](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=767/swamp-jaguar#drops:mode=:0+14-19+1) in SoS. It's how I paid for my mount back in OG vanilla. I tried it again in classic and I think they nerfed the drop rate on [vendorables](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1688/long-soft-tail#comments) on those mobs. Wowhead they should drop ~50%+ but I got nowhere near that. I've even noticed a weird bug where the loot window pops up for a fraction of a second and then disappears. It's like the mobs are bugged or blizzard did something to intentionally nerf them.
---
As a tank, my response to groups like this is "drop him or find another tank"
---
I'm not having an argument with someone about how I should be pulling 2 packs at a time so their aoe is more efficient. You want to tank? Roll a warrior. Otherwise it takes an hour to find a tank(or healer), but 5 seconds to find a dps, let alone a mage. Be a team player, not a recount hero.
---
He didn't even ask about abusing a bug lol. He asked about going up terrain to explore. Eebro is having a superiority boner.
---
When the wlock types 'whops' mid fight, the sheep just got doted....
---
Battle shout has better aggro now i believe. I tend to drop demo shouts every now and again just to keep the debuff up but Bshout is better overall AOE aggro.
---
Buy and vendor then. Easy money &amp; no risk :)
---
Really? I've never been ignored. Everyone always mentions how much smoother my druid tanking is over warriors.
---
Druid tanks are *preferable* for dungeons
---
While on mages, I‚Äôve yet to have one in my group that knows how to consistently sheep. I mark it, tell them to sheep it, and then they fuck right off. I had a mage tell me, ‚Äúoh, I don‚Äôt think we need it‚Äù. That mage triggered me so hard.
---
I disagree. You're not following some arrow on a step by step leveling path like that of Guidelime or AAP. Questie simply puts some icons on your map to aid in finding the general locations of the quest objectives. Similar to retail. You'll still end up reading through your quest text a lot anyways with Questie.
---
Yeah locks can mess me up
---
In theory, i think, Loot Council is/would be, the best way to distribute Loot.  As you can ensure that a particular piece of loot is awarded to the person that it would benefit the most, and then by extension it maximizes the benefit to the Raid.  For example, if a particular piece of loot drops that is only a .1% improvement for johnny over there, but is a 15% improvement for Adam, It doesn't take a genius to figure out who gets that!  REgardless if it's BiS for Johnny, or not.
---
In practice however, because of the, "Human Condition", Loot Council is horrible!
---
1. There is the risk that those on the Loot Council will favor themselves, or their friends, over other people.  It happens.  I've seen it happen.  Leads to drama, leads to rage quitting the guild, everyone just suffers...
---
2. Then there is the risk that you pissed off the guy who runs Loot Council last week, so this week, you don't get your loot.  Of course they'll be a valid reason for it....which won't actually be valid....  It happens, I've seen it happen.  Leads to drama, leads to rage quitting the guild, everyone just suffers.
---
I probably wouldn't join any guild that practiced Loot Council exclusively.  The guild I'm in now, is planning a hybrid of sorts.  Loot Council with DKP.  Don't know the details.  I'm very apprehensive to find out.
---
In PVE games, most arguments are caused by differences of opinion on what a reasonable pace is.
---
You are on one extreme. Cleave groups are the other. Most of us fall somewhere in the middle.
---
Didn't use to be this way in classic, I blame streamers for making mage fotm.
---
I mean if you see 3 mages shattering off eachothers novas on the first pull that should be a pretty strong indication lol but yeah a little communication would be good
---
I never gank or kill lowbies either, cause I only find PVP fun when it's competitive.
---
You're definitely not weird.
---
The griefing aspect to it is more fun than the actual PVP for a lotta people though.
---
Informant has been working for me pretty well right now, but I also just updated it. I like to be able to know if something is used for cooking before vendoring it. I struggle remembering recipes since I quit at the end of BC.
---
Totally agree, we are not a pre made, 1-2 wipes from overpulling/dps threat is going to immediately make the run longer than just taking it at a comfortable pace.    
---
Just last night, I got invited to a zf group as 5th spot cat dps cause I had the mallet. Group was bear tank, hunter, rogue, priest heals and me. Tank wanted to pull everything, pat coming? Just pull it and down it. We made it halfway through before wiping and the tank left cause we told him to stop charging/ass pulling. I took over tanking, we got a lock and just nuked things 1 by 1. It was a great single target comp and we skipped boss mechanics just nuking them. Clean run from there and I got my carrot on a stick. Dungeon cleave is pre made thing for specific comps, don't pug it and wipe all day. That's so inefficient which is supposed to be the point of dungeon cleave
---
On that note, I started chasing down a random priest or lock and giving them all my unused mage water before I log for the day so it doesn't go to waste.
---
I am colorblind and I have trouble seeing small specks of pixels on the screen. As a result I have to constantly scan the screen with my cursor to look for mobs far away. Don't know why a QOL option which you can adujst for your own liking is dumb for you.
---
In vanilla it would fire a separate shot, not like classic where your character "casts" the proc.
---
In vanilla we had addons for putting notes on the map, so you used thottbot for finding aoi and manually made the nessecary inputs. Questie just automates this.
---
I mean you can't get and ride your epic mount before 60 so I guess the title holds up.
---
As a hunter with bow completed, and farming this for a few days... curse you gnome!
---
I‚Äôve gotten 3 robes patterns and arcanite whelpling. I‚Äôve considered just buying it but I know finding it myself would be satisfying.
---
I had never used a quest add-on before, but just recently tried questie classic. 
---
Then I turned off most of the features. So now I can see where quests can be obtained, but that's it. This way I won't miss any quests, but I still read the quests to figure out where to go and what to do. Maybe there's another add-on that would be simpler?
---
Anyways, this is working for me.
---
Ban inc
---
What's the drop rate on HoJ? I had it drop twice in three runs.. I got it on our second run and promised the tank I'd run anger/arena as long as I could to help him and boom, dropped 2 runs later.
---
I just toggle between them both as I'm running around.
---
You also kinda get a feel for where plants spawn and where nodes spawn. For example if there are no hills or rock formations in like large portions of tanaris then there probably won't be any mining nodes, so you switch to herbs.
---
At this point i'm heavily prioritizing mining tracking though and just ping for herbs as I'm running / killing in an area, as mining nodes are the business.
---
They don't ruin mine. If it weren't for questie I might not be playing wow at all. Priest quest in Goldshire requires you to heal and buff some general or something. If it weren't for questie I wouldn't know where he is. I wouldn't want to spend hours and hours looking for him.  That's 1 example.
---
basic mount is free.  epic still requires a bunch of gold worth of stuff, and isnt until phase 2 anyways--but hey, it may take me that long just to get 60 at my current rate xD
---
Stonetalon Mountains, lower parts of the Barrens. Ashenvale can work, but you might want to trek to the western side (Zoram'gar Outpost) for some earlier quests. You'll probably run into quite a few Alliance though.
---
Discounts are 15% at revered, 20% at exalted
---
Pft, next you'll start claiming Undead are humanoids and that Kalimdor is round....
---
Why are you calling a more efficient way to play a meta? Everyone are doing it because it's efficient and it doesn't require that much effort. It's not a preference, it's a straight up `x &gt; y` situation where you are trying to force `y` on people.
---
Nobody likes slow tanks who pull one by one. Because it's not how people play for decades already. Get prepared to be kicked from any group at level 60 or have people leave from your group once you inevitably decide to form a group yourself. Also don't forget to make another reddit post by then.
---
Also I'm a tank myself, both in classic and in retail, and I absolutely despise tanks like you. It's the sole reason why I myself play a tank, because slow brained anxious people like you can't handle more than 2 nameplates on their screen.  
---
*Use the last paragraph as your escape route from the point I made in the first two paragraphs in case you can't say anything about it. The reddit way.*
---
This is also the reason I have OmniCC
---
Still better then Cata Uldum.

**\[A\] &lt;America&gt; - NA-Blaumeux PvP** | PST | Raid Time TBD | Casual | DKP/Loot Council Combo
---
We're a social guild on Blaumeux currently recruiting players of all types: casual, hardcore and everything in between.
---
Lead by Mama, a veteran of Vanilla and BC raiding with ample private server experience, this Alliance guild is looking to expand its roster significantly over the coming weeks in order to prepare for raids and upcoming battlegrounds.
---
Most of use have day jobs and while our time is limited due to real life responsibilities, logging in and having a good time with guildies is our main goal. We want to bring the fun of leveling, pvp, and end game raiding to everyone! Our raid times are yet to be determined as we are growing and look to be semi-flexible to accommodate our schedules. We will likely pick two weekdays with raiding occuring at around 6PM PST.
---
Please note that occasionally our guild name seems to elicit vicious tendencies; be aware that violence, racism, sexism, transphobia and homophobia are **NOT** welcome here. We are a guild that accepts and elevates all walks of life and we work tirelessly to stamp out these attitudes.  We want our America to be the best version of America: One that is open and welcoming to all.
---
**Join our Discord:** [https://discord.gg/ZtSkbtx](https://discord.gg/ZtSkbtx)

Contact the following for an Invite:
---
**Mama** \- President
---
**Chianti** \- Vice President
---
**Wham** \- Cabinet Member
---
Really **ask anyone** for an invite - as we are in a recruitment phase, *everyone* can invite.
---
Without help when you mouse over a harm target your spell will fail with an "invalid target" error message instead of going for the @target condition.
---
With help it will evaluate the @target next
---
What about enchanting?  I know it‚Äôs a huge money sink, but are there any benefits for a mage?  Or can I just have my friends enchant stuff for me?  
---
Sorry for all the dumb questions hahaha
---
You sir are the real MVP!
---
"first ever.."
---
"How much does it usually go for?"
---
I don't anticipate my schedule allowing me to raid much, just doing mostly 5s and maybe the occasional raid if I can find a casual spot to fill in a raiding guild. Still worth the effort you think?
---
Just selling the formula will get you a pretty penny, true.
---
tbh all the bugs are a big reason I haven't played a hunter in classic yet. They are probably my 2nd fav class but I want to wait until they fix all the broken stuff.
---
By that time you've already committed to a group. Tank would be seen as an asshole leaving at that point. A simple message as soon as the group is filled or when the tank is invited is sufficient.
---
I could care less whether he uses it or not, my main point was the flaw in his argument.
---
I leveled from 1 to 20 without ever switching out rank 1 frostbolt with rank 3 or 4. I was wondering why I felt so weak lol
---
yeah was fun on dreadmist last night in hillsbrad, lvl40 rogue was fucking up anyone near yeti cave and ended up in a group of 4 of them. General blew up and then there were loads of us chasing them off. Much fun. Met one of that group later to help do the ogres in alterac, fun night
---
You cannot macro your way around the global cooldown (GCD). Not without a hack or exploit anyway. 
---
You can create a macro that casts corruption and curse of agony one after the other. But I prefer not to as you lose flexibility.
---
Thank you! I will most definitely drop you a line when i get back into things.    
---
&gt; with enchanting already at 265 I'm set.
---
That 'Heart of the Mountain'! That's definitely a goal of mine, eventually. I did LW+Skinning because i didn't know any better!
---
Level 45 you can get a quest for Maraudon where you get Resurgence Rod which is extremely good.
---
Idk how things are like on your server, but on mine people are selling Maraudon boosts like no tomorrow, particularly ring boost. As you only need to slay the boss and not loot anything, you could ask to tag along and pay 5g for the kill and pass on loot, I'm sure most boosters would take that offer as it's free money.
---
I spent my second week of gameplay in Hillsbrad loving this mentality. 
---
Unfortunately for the Alliance, I was 60, not 40, as had been reported in the chat.  Five level 25s don‚Äôt kill a 60 shadowpriest.
---
TB is the chillest city - you can try to change my mind, but you wont. 
---
Our greens are the greenest and our breezes are the breeziest. Sit back and watch the sun set over the mountains while you become one with the Earth Mother.
---
Around 20g
---
Idk man, every single all mage and one priest group I've been in is 100% faster than any other composition. Even in dungeons that we are slightly too low for.
---
I had the same problem. Googled it and it led me to a post on the us forums from 2015. Which said to cap your foreground fps to 200. It solved it for me! :)
---
Yeah agreed. Lock taps right after the fight, I heal him, heal the tank to full a few seconds before pull and then let my Regen kick in before I heal the tank again. Little trickier for shammies with constant re toteming though!
---
Yeah I saw a warlock with 280 spell power. People thinking the items are the same as 1.3 are wild.
---
I thought I would enjoy healing AOE spell cleave groups, but the more I run with them the more I just want a nice single target/CC pull group. Had a mage last night who kept insisting we AOE everything down and the druid tank was not listening. I was supposed to do Cath with them (after Arms) but I dipped earlier because he kept bitching and I could tell he was getting impatient.
---
This is pretty sweet cheers man
---
&gt;  a mage who only know AoE rotations
---
You say that as if there's any other rotation.
---
If it's not AoE, it's just Frostbolt spam.
---
To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with Frostbolt spam. AoE has its place in *specific situations*, and the Tank always calls the shots.
---
What kind of server are you on?
---
Those prices are incredibly high.
---
Can genuinely say I've yet to see a Rogue pickpocket.  As an offnote, I actually like the ones that Cheap Shot / Kidney Shot for CC.
---
If you have the spirit talents then spirit, otherwise intellect
---
I'm not super familiar with enchanting, but IIRC there's nothing special specific to mages
---
Lvl 40 BiS shoulders and offhand. Not sure what the main hand is.
---
This guy rogues
---
Or a warrior with an enhancement. The off heals and totems are so strong.
---
Trash pulls are the majority of the time spent in MC. When you start multiplying the time saved on each pull, it actually adds up.
---
We use EP/GP in order to reward people for time and effort, but a select few items will be loot counciled. Class priorities are for situations like, "this ring goes to a Resto Shaman because it has MP5 and this similar ring goes to a Priest because it has spirit." Not every item gets prioritized this way, just items that are distinctly better for one class than another. We have a spreadsheet tracking all of this.
---
Unfortunately, most of the gear in MC is not actually very good for raiding. Most classes have pretty crappy T1 itemization. We want the pieces that are actually valuable for raids to stay in the guild on players who will put them to good use.
---
Same here. I'm not down for pet battles *at all* but I wish we could name the pets.
---
I lost my cat Spot almost two years ago and I was able to name the orange tabby cat after him in retail to carry on his memory. I wish I could do the same in Classic. :(
---
Sorry bro, but I have to downvote.
---
At least avoid the class from the title, so you won't mess with people searching for useful tips about their classes.
---
We should have a way to tag for a low effort review.
---
I like to pvp and not get ganked
---
Are you alliance or horde?
---
I was thinking that most people transferring would be alliance to get away from faction imbalances... That being said it would mean the higher pop realms get a worse faction imbalance cos ally transferred... Too many scenarios, my head hurts. 
---
Think I'm just going to take the leap of faith! Now a server name to choose, ahhh!
---
As a Druid healer I roll on cloth as I level. It‚Äôs incredibly hard to find int/spirit/stam on good leather pieces for all your slots. Shoulder and head pieces are few and far between until you get to higher levels. You act as if there is a plethora of options, but not in the vanilla universe, sadly.  I would actually say it‚Äôs partly intended by the original developers. In newer WoW, this is almost completely a non issue.
---
It is completely up to the individual. If it helps there were addons in vanilla that did the exact same thing. Your experience can be whatever the hell you want it to be..
---
Reducing damage dealt on 12 mobs in the entire dungeon is nothing. Changing a boss mechanic to not be permamently immune forcing people to run specific groups to even kill him is not a nerf, it's making a dungeon playable. And a respawn timer does literally nothing in this context.
---
Cool, thanks for the help!
---
That's a clear enough answer, I can find it from there.  No need to dig further!  I briefly tried Details but it seemed more complicated than recount, so went back to what I remember.  I'll give it a more thorough try tonight and dig in to find that threat meter portion as well since it sounds like I don't have to download anything extra, just have to find the option for it.  Should be easy enough from there. :)
---
Turns out you you thought you wanted, but didn't.
---
I'm just going off of the vanilla wow wiki: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Auction_House
---
Relevant text is:
---
A Deposit fee will be charged when you list an item for auction. This fee is based on the length of the auction as well as the vendor value of the item: minimum fee of 1 silver. If your item is bid on and eventually sells, the fee will be refunded, but a 5% cut will be taken by the auction house (**15% in neutral auction houses**). If the auction ends without a bid, the fee is lost (see Formulas: Auction House: Fees).
---
Haha back in 06 when i played Tibia i reported a guy for botting and when a GM finally answered he said are you reporting or confessing? haha xD
---
I can confirm at 110 Fps it does not work.  
---
I can also confirm at 40 Fps it does work.
---
Me and two of my party members were unable to do it until i found this post and had the idea to change my fps to a low end pc's fps. 40 was the sweet spot. Just hold both mouse buttons and spam jump
---
Same.  Playing a rogue currently and locked or unlocked I have always group rolled, I opened and the winner gets it.
---
These lists ALWAYS forget the best addon that has ever been created - Elite Player Frame (Enhanced).
---
This addon will literally change your life, it's the best addon you can download, and you'll thank yourself every day you play.
---
A lot of people who are truly depressed end up losing weight because food becomes less appealing/ you just don‚Äôt care to eat a healthy amount.
---
I don‚Äôt think fat people eating because they‚Äôre sad = depression
---
I go only once I have a group. Why waste time I could be using for leveling getting ganked or standing around in sm
---
Also a consideration.  If you are making flasks that you probably want that on your main since you have to clear (most of) Scholo or (some of) BWL to make them.
---
I never look up loot from a dungeon, let alone what my BiS is, let alone what others BiS is. If someone is obviously excited about a thing dropping and it's also an upgrade for me I'll be excited about it and need too. And if I don't get it I'll still be happy because someone got it.
---
You can definitely shorten that by using:
---
Instead of that long cancelaura. Also, this should work instead of your mount (and won't need to be updated for new mounts):
---
    /dismount [mounted]
---
REEEeEEeEEEEEEE
---
Xd
---
I mean... Judging by the comments in here i think i'll be fine.
---
But thanks for your concern all the same buddy.
---
As a level 21, the idea of tipping a gold is blowing my mind right now.
---
It could cause a wipe. It's bad behavior that keeps happening as you get into higher dungeons. Best to nip it in the bud.
---
Enh feels good against mage too. Purge with the really low cd on shocks. If you connect the just melt
---
When I get jumped by the opposite faction I can still scatter shot/feign death and freeze trap the guy, just like in vanilla. So I'm not really sure what people are talking about here.
---
I don‚Äôt want free portals. I just want fairly priced ones. A port shouldn‚Äôt be 1G. This is coming from someone who played a Mage the first time around.
---
Ok thsnk you so much
---
I bet you'd like that wouldn't you
---
Well, technically it doesn't anymore since people hold it on alts and then ban everybody lol.
---
World chat is probably used on every server, though.
---
oOooo this is really neat! thanks for this!
---
I'm going to bubble hearth out of here.
---
1-10 on hunter sucks before you get your pet.  I think getting from 9 to 10 was harder than getting from 59 to 60.
---
Well played sir... Well played.
---
holy crap   
---
I don't think its doritos that she turned to, from the short skim of her twitter.
---
Ya gots to cast separately, I tried to get flamestrike and blizzard macro‚Äôed together, then gave up after an hour to go back to melting single targets like a good little fire mage
---
Thank you so much man ^^
---
Still the main reason for my dislike for morrowind, the inability to find anything. Which is funny because I havnt had this problem at all in classic yet.
---
What else are you doing? I have been grinding rep in plaguelands (getting lots of cloth and stuff from undeads) and of course dungeon runs
---
Runecloth is going for under 2g per stack on my server but it adds up
---
At level 13 are there any in-combat healing items available for purchase or able to be acquired? All of my healing items require me to sit down outside of combat. Are they worth spending money on?
---
Does moving (as a Rogue) during combat make any difference? In usually just stand there and attack without moving since the enemy attacks still hit me even if I run away and create distance. I see streamers moving a lot, jumping around, and just fighting way more mobile. Why?
---
Is there a good location by level map or outline that I can use to track where I should go next after finishing quests for my level? I like to explore the map since it‚Äôs my first time ever playing WoW at all, but I don‚Äôt know where to go. Sometimes I just get bored of grinding an area and want a change of scenery. 
---
My Rogue character is pretty good when 1v1‚Äôing enemies, but I get rekt fighting two or more at the same time. Do I as a Elf Rogue have any AOE attacks, any multi enemy targeting attacks, etc at my disposal? If not, will this become a problem later on or at any point in the game (solo mostly)? I typically just throw a dagger at an enemy to pull them away so I can 1v1, but after watching streams and YT vids it doesn‚Äôt look like that‚Äôll be an option in the later levels.
---
As a "bad tank" - to clarify, I'm a druid so no, I'm not one of those 2H warriors who insist on charging in, and just dpsing the mobs down.
---
I range pull mobs with moonfire and then LOS them if there's a caster in the group. I use as much mitigation tools that I have access to, and maintain aoe threat the best that I can. I may not be the premiere tank who's seen all the big world firsts but I AM the solid and reliable tank who ensures no deaths, is considerate of healer mana(because I also heal dungeons) and gets the job done.
---
Few things bother me more than a tank who blindly rushes from pack to pack and doesn't let me regen even 300 mana before he's already going ape. So when I tank I watch my healer's mana and make sure he's good to go. He doesn't have to be full, he just has to be where I can sense he's comfortable with.
---
ElvUI definitely takes some know-how. There's *tons* of customization options but you gotta know what to look for and what to adjust. I've got it set up perfectly right now, but it took hours of configuration and refining. I love the addon, but I get that it's not for everyone.
---
I‚Äôll try it out tonight! Yeah when I increase quality of the game it gives me the buzzing, but if I go recommended there‚Äôs a buzz but very feint. I just wanna play classic in high quality üò≠
---
It's more like 20-25 gold per hour depending on drops, almost all the gold comes from just vendoring everything unless it's a blue BOE, SFK is a bit more gold but has a few problems, vendors are far away from the instance portal (Deadmines has one out front) There's no easy and fast way out of the dungeon (Deadmines has a backdoor) and a good chunk of mobs in there stun/silence
---
Thank you very much kind sir. I updated my gameplay with a few of them, thanks!
---
This happened to me yesterday.  After the kalimdor to eastern kingdoms zone transition I fell off and had to swim

I have two side mouse buttons. The forward one I use for activating trinkets (IF I HAD ONE) and the back one is for toggling auto-run.

Wow, you're cool.

I am sitting with 10g at level 32 doing ench/tailoring.  I sell bags for money mostly.

He literally says in the post that terrible rogues keep suiciding into his Retaliation.
---
&gt;Changing a boss mechanic to not be permamently immune forcing people to run specific groups to even kill him is not a nerf, it's making a dungeon playable.
---
Get out of here. Next you're going to tell me all the other dungeons that had groups of mobs removed, or turned from elites to non-elites to speed things up and improve the 5 experience and make runs faster (Blizzards words not mine), and all the gear changes to improve gear and make it more viable make no difference.
---
I would not, obviously.
---
But u didn't clarify the thing about spending 6g, u told that noone have so much gold
---
mount
---
TipTac is what I use, works perfectly for me. I can pull a link when I get back to my desk.
---
Yeah that looks great.
---
&gt; *fairy big* 
---
sounds like an Irish phrase for "small, but respectably so"
---
But that mace spec! Also I feel like adrenaline rush is a free "i win" button against certain classes once you can lock them down.....and it's half the cd of prep.  
---
You can easily spec into improved stealth/ambush with a combat spec too if you want that as an opener.
---
To be fair, questing becomes *ass* when you get into the 40s and higher.  I don't blame people for wanting to run dungeons, I've been doing it myself more now, 49 Mage.
---
so out and in and redo it? random groups do that? sounds like a guild thing
---
Looks like we got a Schrodinger's a-hole here.
---
Nah dude getting high is my spinach. I can‚Äôt heal or tank if I‚Äôm not high. 
---
I announce this so my party members know they are in good hands (and that I might forget something every once in a while and they should please forgive!).
---
Becareful... It can give you stress...
---
This is what I try to tell all the druid haters. Could you imagine if we were actually able to be top tanks/healers/DPS. Literally everyone would be a druid. Mages are a pure DPS class, they better be good at it!
---
Amazing quality posting
---
What's funny is that once those AoE guys get to 60 they'll realize they're mistake.
---
AoE'ing dungeons don't give rep.  AoE'ing dungeons make you outlevel quests that give rep.   The rep farms at the end if they want anything from rep are going to cost hundreds of gold in cloth.  The hundreds of gold will take hours to farm...hours that were 'saved' aoe leveling.
---
If anyone wants anything that involves rep, using normal dungeon groups and questing is not an overall loss.  Rep was actually a feature for this purpose, because mob grinding was de facto in mmos previous to WoW and the design team wanted to add further incentive to actually walk around and do the quests.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre the type of person that doesn‚Äôt experience the true spirit of vanilla - you just blitz your way to 60, meatgrind your way into repetitive grinds... hope it‚Äôs fun for you.
---
&gt;So much judgment here.
---
Wtf, i saw this movie last weekend.
---
Also prot pally.  But they have to resist attacking mobs for 2 seconds.  Many mages can't handle that.
---
Wow. I need this!
---
Alliance PvP would still exist because of raiding, which is the point I was making. If PvP is your end game goal, you typically pick horde.
---
You're forgetting this game is 15 years old. This has all already been figured out. The average player now knows more about this game than when vanilla came out.
---
You should be standing behind them even if they don't cleave, attacks  in the back prevent the enemy from parrying/blocking. Also allows backstab. That's all with a party only though, playing solo it doesn't matter since mobs always face you.
---
I‚Äôm just curious are you legit not using questie and sticking to the default system/nit lookin  quests up online?
---
So.. you're selling to the tiny minority of people who are leveling 1-300 at 60, or other enchanters leveling it as they level their toon? But.. they could just DE their own greens..
---
Good example, typically for stuff like that in the past I would make a macro for /target persons name and just run around spamming that until I targeted it and could spin around and find it's name highlighted.
---
Warriors are really good melee dps. So, you end up having probably 80% want to be dps. If you were to run a census based on "are you a tank or dps/healer", I imagine the pool of druids/warriors that respond would be significantly lower than the current glut or warriors.
---
I did 31. I think 30 can be fine though
---
The filthiest, most twisted, depraved fetish ever conceived by the human mind.
---
Being vanilla.
---
Click the link
---
we re horde but the server is slightly in favor of alliance, really good balance tho
---
Things have gotten progressively worse in every dept since they started cutting costs.
---
This form post might get you started.  What I did was years ago and I don't remember the specifics.

I thought that addon only worked if everyone had it. Is there one that works decently now?

---
So the tales of alliance being run by 8 year olds was true all along.. explains why I was a dwarf hunter during vanilla.... I was also 8..
---
I can‚Äôt believe how much this terrible advice gets repeated.
---
Theres no tank in a cleave group
---
1) Healing Potions.  There are many kinds and require various level.  Minor Healing Potion is around your level.
---
2) No, moving doesn't do anything.  Streamers are just hyperactive and it's probably more entertaining to viewers as well.
---
3) There are lots of guides on where to level.  Just google a leveling guide.  There are also a few good addons for leveling.  See Questie.
---
4) For the large part Rogues are single target damage dealers.  Pull mobs 1 at a time.
---
I guess it would be interesting to see which had more impact (dungeon farming or layering). I‚Äôm sure the newer players were more interested in dungeon farming due to streamers doing it a lot, also probably easier than solo farming? (Not sure on that)
---
basically the dps are just NPC's and if the healer says something then ill listen.
---
I have never played retail past WOTLK and you're exactly the kind of greedy player people are complaining about in dungeons. "Of the Owl" mail pieces sell for vendor price on AH but you're stealing cloth gear from mages.  I'm a paladin too and you are a disgrace to our kind.
---
Do aoe in specific spots where it works if everyone's down. Don't try to aoe literally everything.

Are the two factions' quests like, completely different? Aren't there any zone in the lvl 15-25 range where we can accept mostly the same quest lines?  
---
I play much more WoW than my friend does, I play daily and he plays less than weekly now. So I will just bypass him at around the ~lvl 20 range (he started before me). Long-term, we won't be able to play together, sadly.  
---
I just had this idea that maybe we could meet up for a few hours and play, since we are on the same realm. Just a one-time experience, as the level gap will quickly grow too large.  
---
And if we can't do the same quests, are there any other activity we can do together, other than PvP? Again, I'm not looking for a long-term solution, just a few hours of fun.
---
Leaving a dungeon over water is dumb. But saying Lol time is valuable why are you playing games is also very dumb.
---
We hear you(and you're right), but at the same time we don't always know who are the bad players until the group is long formed and the dungeon goes into full swing.
---
Yes, you can look for certain signs and indicators that are red flags and possibly bail before you subject yourself to agony that is a bad group. But not all of us are in super guilds full of all chill people who know what they're doing. A hunter from a PUG needing on everything(and I do mean, *everything, even cloth*) is one thing, but when a guild member does it? It's just that much worse, because you'd reasonably expect that a guildie would far more likely have a good head on their shoulders, right?
---
But yeah when they go all cleave mode when the group composition isn't setup for it(quite possibly the most important thing), the talent allocation to enable said cleave isn't even right either...
---
As time consuming as that was sometimes , it was fun just getting the group together and flying to the instance. Never had a chance to do it in classic, I started a week before bc came out.
---
Yeah, the green gear from AH doesn't prevent that. 
---
It's actually the opposite. Without the mount, you will be a sitting duck.
---
Shhhh the tanks have to level somehow! You'll need us end game lol.
---
I don't get why the mage wasn't kicked at like 40% of the conversation, he clearly was going to mess things up
---
Is this alexensual?
---
Probably not bots, just multi-boxing fishing.
---
Yes, briefly messing with somebody in a video game on a pvp server can be funny. You'll be okay.
---
It‚Äôs under accessibility in the options but it still fucking blows. I‚Äôm severely red green blind. Barrens fuckin SUCK
---
Thanks buddy!
---
How DARE you ask a party member to do something that helps the entire party you entitled brat?!
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
i said this like 2 days after release and got sarcastic comments back saying "it works fine".  BULLSHIT about 75% of the time it does sweet FA
---
Grats!
---
A party is required to down an elite. It takes a hunter pet to down me
---
2&gt;1 is exaggerated. All of the population info is from a census add on that collects info from who list, so it‚Äôs a character count not player count. It gives you something to go off of but it is by no means exact or close and should be taken with a grain of salt. Leaving would only be worse on the allies you leave behind. If you‚Äôre scared of a fight, you can make sure you get off the school bus first and run home. Just don‚Äôt be surprised the next day when all the kids think you are a bitch.
---
I didnt take setup at all actually. I went sub because im on a pvp server and it is literally non stop. The horde are super aggressive in most places. I mentioned evasion for multiple because it adds 50% dodge plus 15% from ghostly strike means I dodge everything for a bit while I finish one off then I'm still nearly full health to fight the 2nd one 1v1. If halfway through my evasion I realize the thing isnt at 50% health and I don't think I can catch up given my current combo points I vanish. I'm okay with leveling a bit slower for more survivability though. I have escaped horde ganks over and over that people have afterwards whispered me asking how I managed to live. Ultimately though the best reason to go sub spec is imp sap. It works on skull levels just as well as non skull levels and holy crap do high levels absolutely hate when a low level rogue saps them. I watched a guy (from stealth on a ridge) spend 10 minutes combing the area I sapped him trying to find me. These moments make the slower leveling all worth it.
---
No worries, I hope you find the addon you are looking for.
---
Eveyone just greeds thats how it works.  You want to verify with the whole party that someone wants it and nobodies UI bugged every single drop? Lol
---
Wow your post history is a fucking trainwreck.
---
Get some therapy before you're too far gone.
---
And I'm saying that, as a tank, There are times when I want the challenge of holding aggro from 3 AoE goobers that don't wait for any sort of aggro, and there are times that I don't. If I am joining a group without it being advertised as a AoE spellcleave min/max speed group, I'm just wanting to casually stroll through the instance with mostly single target DPS order, and finish 4 minutes later than the Elite AoE Spellcleave min/max speed group. If people start AoEing everything without giving more than a second or two for aggro, I'm just going to leave.
---
That sounds great I appreciate it! The link I found manually and within the Twitch app keep directing to version 8.x.
---
Wow! I know this is a bit of satire but I have to say, very well written and it really hits the nail on the head as far as the mentality of AoE players goes. I really worry about tanks sometimes, they have such drastically different experiences from group to group.
---
click on the clock on the minimap, it's built-in.
---
Probably brought up in a performance review.
---
Do you have some sort of learning disability?  He commented on the appearance of the add on, I pointed out you could keep the appearance the same because other big appeal was the mouse over keybind assigning.  The add on has other functionalities besides its appearance.
---
A mage hit 750 dps in my group with spellcleave.
---
Wonder if it's more prevalent in some servers more so than others. I have been tanking a lot of dungeons on my realm and only ran into one person complaining about the pace of the pulls, but said person would also go on to be disliked by much of our server anyways. Ironically that person was a rogue. 
---
Playing on Westfall - Alliance as tank of the same level and have not personally had to deal with this.
---
Holy shit, really? That's crazy
---
1: when you try to apply a lure with one already active, you get a popup box asking are you sure. this line cancels that box before you even see it.
---
2: to mute the sound of the invisible box popup, which normally would play every time you push the button.
---
3: just place the macro on whatever button and use that to cast/lure/etc. you still need to rightclick the bobber when the fish bites.
---
Wow, what are the odds
---
I know paladins favor int over spirit. Crits refund mana, more int higher crit chance. The mp5 is still alright, but afaik pally healing light is way less mana efficient than greater heal.
---
[TipTac for Classic (quickfix)](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24959-TipTacforClassicquickfix.html)
---
&gt; Warriors are really good melee dps.
---
And they all spam heroic strike. If I am tanking I aint inviting one as a dps lmao.
---
All RP servers are pure RP servers.
---
Honestly the inital set up gets you most of the way there for people that dont have a super specific outcome in mind
---
His abilities all do AOE...thats impressive considering outside blade flurry they definitely do not. 
---
Yeah this rogue would run up to mobs not stealthed and constantly say oops sorry.
---
I had this mod back in vanilla that changed the sound the Dreadsteed made when you summoned it.  It was a modified version that got rid of the annoying screechy sound.  Will probably be looking for something similar in Classic.
---
Saving this post, thank you. 
---
I already have a few of these but some, like vendor price, were part of another addon that just doubles the size of my tooltip...
---
&gt;Total revenue was still lower than BFA
---
No shit. It's a full-priced expansion compared to a $15 subscription. I guarantee you there's more wow classic subs than BFA sales, though.
---
This changed the game for me!  Thank you so much.  Im a newb, trying REALLY hard to like WoW, this made it fun for me :)
---
Spell power it hot garbage for aoe, but if youre leveling you aren't really "stacking" anything, you're just taking gear upgrades as they come.
---
Both blizzard and non-blizzard approaches to aoe work. In my experience, the blizzard approach was a lot more consistent in spellcleave with a lot more room for error.
---
I understand hate for spellcleave if the mentality is bleeding into normal runs.  But I don't understand the blind hate towards mages/locks who just want to level as efficiently as possible.  Just make it clear the type of run you are going for when you are recruiting players, and don't join spellcleave groups if you don't want that.
---
Yeah, it's a bummer we started opposite factions. However, I play much more WoW than my friend does, I play daily and he plays less than weekly now. So I will just bypass him at around the ~lvl 20 range (he started before me). Long-term, we won't be able to play together, sadly.  
---
If we can't do the same quests (is it really true that there aren't ANY shared quests at lvl 15-30?), are there any other activity we can do together, other than PvP? Again, I'm not looking for a long-term solution, just a few hours of fun.
---
Mograine - Alliance. So maybe?
---
One in a Million.
---
You're supposed to kill the mines before they explode, or pull everything and everyone away from the mines before they go off.
---
Suggestion: allow a keybind for showing and hiding the list
---
Yeah, BYOB obviously doesnt tollerate it from what u/USFBS has messaged me and how quickly. I'm at work but I'll try to look into the /who of BYOB to see if any of the warlock names are familiar.
---
LOL yeah - "i need to run around the other side of this mob for no reason!"
---
Depends what you prioritize. Movement speed is extremely important if you are going to do most of your activities in the world itself. Though, I know plenty of people that are just grinding dungeons for their pre-raid BiS items and will buy their epic mount once their dungeon runs naturally get them to that gold amount.
---
Do you have any pic of the UI with all those enabled? I get that the point is to not change the look, but it does change a few things such as bag space, cast bars, timers and such. Would be greatly appreciated! :)
---
Such is reddit at all.
---
3% I believe ?
---
i love my enh build, i wont be changing it until end game most likely. we'll see
---
and shaman is different in classic than tbc, enh is gimped, i forgot when i rolled this toon that shamans originally couldnt dual wield.
---
Nice Enchant
---
Actually, I found tanking on my shaman easier than my warrior.
---
As a shaman your tanking threat is limited by how mich mana you have available.  Which as the other guy said should only need to drink after like 3 pulls.  You're able to shoot off burst aggro, LB-&gt;LB-&gt;shock-&gt;auto and nobody is taking threat off you.  Because your 1h dps with rockbiter is basically mid-high tier dps along with a massive threat modifier.
---
On a warrior you have to generate the rage.  And people are very used to if the tank walked up to it, you can start dps.
---
Idk why this guy seems to think you need to wait anymore than people do with a warrior.  Having everybody wait 3 seconds would be a bigger benefit to the warrior.  Establishing aggro is actually a strength for a shaman tank.  Speed is not an issue as usually the healer/caster dps would need to stop around the time I do.
---
Now.  The *actual* issue is the lack of an aoe threat generator.  And lack of a taunt.  Rockbiter + Earth Shock can get aggro.  But once you start losing threat it can be real aggravating to not have a taunt.
---
If you ever go against more than 4 mobs, it can be difficult to keep aggro off the healer since magma totem applies threat to itself only.
---
Yes just keep grinding gold and buy one after the other til you get one that has a wee wee :)
---
Yea I highly doubt my guild is going to min/max like that. But I have seniority already so it's w/e. I'll never advocate for super min/max.
---
Oh character notes sounds bloody useful. Will definatley be having a look at that.
---
Shit I just did the map quest hahah. Never thought to try and keep going! Thanks for the tip. Maybe a good spot for a guild photo üòé
---
I give 50s to mages who make me 4 stacks of lvl 45 food.  
---
It's like 1/10th the cost of vendor prices.
---
I mean, that's not a problem with the addon.  That's just how numbers work.  Personally, I like to reset it at key junctures to help gauge how 'efficient' I'm being.  For example, I'll reset it at the start of a dungeon to see how much XP the run is earning me.  Or if I return from being AFK or engaging in some non-XP generating activity for a while, I'll reset it.  Etc.
---
This is the dumbest shit I ever read, me using my AOE abilities is ruining your classic experience? As if nobody used AOE in 2004, lol
---
From now on I‚Äôll just spam frostbolt, no blizzard, no cone of cold, no novas, nothing
---
Nightfin is instant
---
Have you tried AtlasLoot? Heard it is pretty similar
---
But why male models?
---
Everyone in eu says "50g fee". We are collectively better in english although we have dozens of languages.
---
Thank you I‚Äôll check it out this evening! A few others posted a link I cannot check to see if they are the same or not. Will update findings later!!
---
Nobody said a 7-second freeze was a huge problem.
---
But being a dick to people and then laughing about it?   Let's not encourage that.
---
That's like throwing a water balloon on a stranger, laughing about it, and then saying "it's just water, you'll live."
---
It's not funny, and it's not cool.
---
I was doing some quest, the normal "kill x amount of &lt;insert random mob&gt;" and had just dotted a mob (lock here) and this mage runs by spamming arcane explosion and aggro'ing every single mob (including stealing mine).  I proceed to pull my pet back, move out of aggro range and just watch this mage get wrecked. Then he came back and tried again. And again. He was still at it when I left, after about 15min of watching him just suicide over and over. Seen mages make it work many times, but always hilarious watching the fails.
---
How many servers times how many layers and how many GMs?  The question is, do we have the manpower in the GM department to handle the potential volume of roof exploits?  It's a cumbersome method that is elegantly solved by the addition of NPCs.  No reports, no tying up GMs who could be doing something actually useful, just dealing with exploits through in game mechanics.
---
Don't Assume my Mounts Gender..
---
5??? Thought my 15 was bad
---
Moral of the story we gotta ask a few questions before inviting a mage. Solution don‚Äôt invite zoomer mages.
---
I agree, as a rogue player I think the current "efficiency" cleave meta is garbage. I get that people want the most exp possible but what point is there if you aren't having fun. This also prevents a lot of non mage classes from finding runs. My suggestion is to just make your own groups which a lot of people will say. Sure finding a tank can be rough \*cough cough dps warriors\* but it beats not getting a group at all. I also sometimes blow my load on a boss prematurely and get punished when he turns around and 1 shots me without evasion up :P
---
The only other RP servers are Grobbulus and Deviate Delight and they're both RP-PVP and greatly lack the RP aspect, unlike Bloodsail there is barely any open world RP and I only came across 2 people with RP profiles and they were blank, not only that but people were named things like "gankinululz" and nothing was enforced like on Bloodsail, they just feel like another PVP server.
---
I saw a Shadowfang for 1g in the first week... it was my first day playing and I only had 60s.
---
Head west from Lands End Beach in Tanaris until you come to a small patch of land. From there, hills are surprisingly easy to climb.
---
I have a few but one is a UI replacement. I've never liked the default UI for the game.
---
I use BenikUI which is an ElvUI edit, LeatrixPlus which automates a lot of things, Questie, and Field Guide which tells you what spells you learn at what level so you can see if you want to go back to train them or wait.
---
I get all the information I could possibly need from those.
---
Yep I love everything about neat plates. I don't like the default nameplate so I use a different style but it is there if you want it.
---
But it also gives you cast bars, combo points, buffs/debuffs, and even threat which is my favorite thing as a tank. It's so much easier to identify if you lost aggro on something when everything attacking you is colored red and then stuff that starts attacking other party members becomes blue.
---
whats the addon that shows how the energy tick timer?
---
Stonespine dead? Thing is always on high.
---
Vanilla WoW taught me the word clitoris when I was 10 years old
---
Damn srsly?
---
Thank you - (I'm a priest/healer) I've rejected or opted out of so many instances so far because I haven't had time for them. I appreciate the fact that people like you recognize that it's better to sit out than to rush people through shit gameplay mechanics. :)
---
The same thing happened to me yesterday with a Libram of Voracity -.- They still have not replied to my ticket though.
---
Agreed! I stood afk in Thunder Bluff and 50g popped into my pockets!
---
Checked, all good
---
Awesome idea.  Really hope to see it implemented soon!
---
Isn‚Äôt that like the entire design of Suramar in Legion?
---
Yea as a tank especially, that's crazy. Their mana pool isn't all that big anyways, and it's not like groups are usually waiting on prot pallies to drink, any time they need mana the rest of the group probably dies too.
---
On long play sessions I try to have a 'let no mana go to waste' policy and always burn up mana conjuring waters and food when I'm traveling or in a city crafting or something, but if I just log in and join a group with another caster, healer, and pally tank, they're going to be waiting 10-15 mins for a couple stacks each, plus int, if they all want the best water and I can only make 2 at a time.
---
For example: Stranglethorn Vale for an alliance player has a ton of 31-34 lvl quests in the north, but in the same zone -- all of the Booty Bay ones are like 37-42. Without zone swapping to like Hillsbrad, Arathi, Badlands, Duskwallow or Desolace it makes it really hard to span that gap.
---
For the other gaps, or lazy-er gapping -- dunegons.
---
Dungeon groups are a nice way to a) finish the ends of questlines or b) just add that half of a level you might need to juuust get over the hump. Ragefire is great, but Deadmines will put hair on your Warlock's chest as it is deep in Alliance territory (not quite Ragefire/Orgrimmar or Stockades/Stormwind deep but still)
---
Magtards?
---
I subscribed like you just explained, took 48 hours before my account was fully upgraded.
---
I think it says it can take up to like 3 full days for it to fully process. It will go through soon
---
Thank you for adding nothing to the conversation.
---
Why would you arcane explosion when you can blizzard with 70% reduced movespeed?
---
Same thing kept happening with a lock in my Ulda run last night. It was so frustrating, and I'm a hunter.
---
Great list but misleading, several of these do change how the game looks and plays.
---
Really? I really must not have been paying attention, I learned all my skills I missed on and found them then
---
It is a very strong item, but the ZF staff gets pretty close when you get in the 40s and it is not nearly worth the gold you lose out on IMO.
---
Yeah I know, I was just memeing some. It's pretty funny when Asmon memes on that as well. There was one moment where he was considering what would happen if he got perma-banned for breaking the servers and he was like "I can't level this character again! I can't ninja from Ozzy again!"
---
It's a pvp realm. Briefly messing with an enemy player is not uncool, and it's not being a dick. Just stop.
---
Paladins and Druids dont have most of the things you've listed, but tank perfectly fine.
---
Warriors are swarming this sub-reddit, frustrated that, despite all their 'shit hit the fan' buttons, DPS are still constantly doing dumb shit.
---
Changing up the pace isnt a difficult thing, people are just refusing to do it and want the 'GO GO GO' mentality.
---
Classic WoW needs to be WoW's reboot.
---
Man way to put a smile on my face. Thanks for sharing that, that's so wholesome
---
Except it's not bugged.  
---
What is more likely?   
---
A) You discovered a bug, multiple times that nobody else has ever in 15 years experienced and it only affects you.  
---
B) You're talking out your ass and you really don't know wtf you're talking about and unwilling to test it or admit you're wrong.  
---
Spoiler: the answer is B.  
---
I mean for God's sake dude, if you aren't going to test it, at least do a google search. 2 minutes and you'll see you were wrong. I don't understand why you are arguing with proven facts.
---
It was a green drop, not even a boss drop the mage flipped out over.
---
You probably just need to make it transparent.  The default appearance is obtrusive to me.  Moving it to the bottom and making it transparent does the trick -- for me, anyway.
---
Depends. I did RFK with 3 warrior 1 Rogue and a Healer and it wa great, but might be pretty tough for healer if tank can‚Äôt hold all the aggro. Was fun going ham and melee cleaving groups though.
---
It usually doesn‚Äôt take that long but it isn‚Äôt instant. The payment has to go all the way through.
---
You are missing the point pal. AOE is fine if intended and it is necessary in some situations. The problem is if you a fighting pack A mage A decides let me pull packs B,C and D and then fails and dies. 
---
Then you have 4 packs to deal with a no AOE at all. So you get overrun and die. Just as an example. The problem is people seem to go "Grab everything" even when there is no way that there is enough AOE dmg to do it effectivley.
---
Right there with you tbh I've stopped inviting mages. While I miss their food and water. The headache of agro chasing is much less with a group that can ff. And I'm not saying mages can't ff, but the ones I've grouped with straight up won't.
---
Not at all, the software called isoboxer let‚Äôs you place little video fx windows on your main screen allowing you to fish wack a mole style. Just google multi-box fishing.
---
You served or worked in emergency medicine with that motto.  I'm onto you lol.
---
Giving away food and water for free is one of my favorite things about my mage.
---
Yes I tried that and it didn't work on my Firefox browser, but it did work on Chrome however it didn't move my character for some reason :(
---
Did you even consider that you should continue reading before coming to show off how clever your are?
---
&gt; should be noted though, that Battle for Azeroth last year, made the company more money. This isn‚Äôt that surprising though, since players had to buy the expansion and Classic was free with a subscription. BFA was a record even for the company since they sold 3.4 million copy‚Äôs on launch day.
---
Yea I played a warrior in BC and Wrath, not in Classic. Played a rogue then.
---
AoE tanking got a big upgrade in next expansions with the buffs to thunderclap and making it defensive stance. If you used thunderclap on CD in next expansion, you could hold aoe threat.

I hate to start with this part - but it's really why I'm here. I'm tired of guild chats filled with edge lords and people who have backwards ideas in regards to race, gays, and the world in general. I'm a straight white male but the amount of ignorance I'm seeing and hearing in guild chat and Discord from the people I'm trying to run dungeons and quests with is distracting to say the least. I don't associate with racists and homophobes. 
---
With that being said I'd like to find a group of people I can regularly run dungeons, quests, and eventually raids with hopefully once or twice a week on nights around pacific time.
---
Let them die.
---
Similar, but yeah.
---
Honestly I dont want to rush to 60 so it's not worth it for me to run questie. I like wandering around trying to figure quests out for some strange reason. Everything I hear about raiding in  vanilla has been mediocre so far so I'm trying to enjoy the little things while I can. More than likely I won't create an alt so this will be my only go around. If it does get to a point where I'm just beating my head against the wall I use wowhead.
---
It costs 36-40s for five water or food.  If people do not tip for water, it better be because they are in your dungeon group, your guild, or they are going on the /ignore list.
---
Yep - as a rogue, I get kicked from groups all the time because I don‚Äôt have aoe abilities. Well come end game, when all those locks/mages/priest/holy pallies/ restro druids have to fight each other for caster gear, I‚Äôm gonna laugh and not give 2 fudges.
---
I like how its cropped to not show the other 15 horde sitting there waiting to gank. What was his alternative?
---
Seems like you guys got more pissed that he got away, when you guys were trying to piss him off by forcing him to rez.
---
Then roll a hunter today. The class is sheer awesome and kewl tricks everyone is jealous for.
---
I kept running out of quests. I'd get maybe 8 in each zone then run out of ones I could do.
---
The same thing just happened in Desolace so I'm taking a break and getting some gear at SM.
---
I can't get Clique working. Anyone having success?
---
No this is Whitemane! Your work and fellow Benix brings a smile to my face - you're doing your part!
---
That's the difference though, you need 3 mages. One mage will not make the difference needed to pull 15-20 elite mobs.
---
No, if he was in a farm group he would just keep life tapping and expect the priest to heal him. üôÑ
---
For dungeon grinding at those levels, full holy with healing stats will be overkill, FYI. 
---
But at endgame, a balance of +healing and spirit is the way to go. With int and Crit secondary.
---
Has someone made a character panel mod like the one currently used in retail? Always found that one to be superior.
---
I already feel the OWERPOWER crit
---
All it takes is one paladin to put on fire resis aura and you're all set.
---
Is that good DPS in raids and the like?
---
I'm actually on bloodsail buccaneers.
---
The casuals aren't going to be the most active reddit users, skewing everyones perception of what is normal. Level 20 zones are still fairly full.
---
Don't you love when you find some quest mobs, start wacking away then, oh woops accidentally pulled another one. Oh woops looks like I'm dead. 2 minute run back to body. Oh woops accidentally pulled a higher level one. Oh woops looks like I'm dead again. That's when I press escape look at the exit button, then do another 2 minute run back to my grave.
---
I think spirit is still a bit better, but it's not that big of a deal. You'll be fine healing without any spell power, and you can still get a good deal of regen from spirit if you heal in bursts. Having more spell power is nice in the "oh shit" scenarios. It's more important late game, when you need constant healing and rely more on straight mp/5 for mana regen.
---
IIRC the automatic silence is never for more than 24 hours and is intended to stop you from causing problems until a GM can review the situation.  A two day silence would have been given by a GM.  That's not to say you didn't get an idiot GM, of course.
---
What was the comment he reported?
---
&gt; Paladins have a seal which is similar to heroic strike on most swings.
---
That's the core difference, Heroic Strike hits a bit harder and costs no mana so you have slightly less downtime. I'm not going to tell you it's a huge difference, but saying that warriors have it the worst when paladin leveling is about as bad 10-30 and then becomes considerably worse, is just false.
---
"mid converstation" you mean at the  end of the conversation and you are wanting a little extra after the fact and you parted ways.
---
&gt;"thank you for following up"
---
&gt;GM, "thank you, have a good night"
---
Conversation ends, 
---
But GM let me find out more
---
In FF14 now, they show the rDPS column on fflogs, and you can see the dps you provided to the raid from your own numbers, and it shows the contribution from your raid buffs. I've never looked at WoW's fflog setup but, I'd like to see a DPS tier list with that in mind.
---
Sounds like the paladin came out the victor if this guy was salty enough to screenshot it, crop it, and post it to reddit.
---
I go to 3rd semester law school and have a part-time job on the side. It's about prioritizing your time, but thank you.
---
I actually missed this about vanilla when I was on Herod. Too many people. Too many layers. And it just felt like I was playing with randoms other than when playing with the guild. 
---
Now we have moved to Earthfury. It is less populated. But the population feels similar to my high pop server from vanilla release. So maybe things will feel more like vanilla now. We will have to wait and see.
---
First post I responded to:
---
&gt;I laughed out loud when I saw that you were a mage.
---
&gt;Do you have any idea how much other classes have to pay for water and food?
---
Yeah. Just ripe with sarcasm, that one. Keep desperately trying to save face, dude.
---
Hunters are the very definition of solo.
---
Rogues are very fun with their stealth mechanics and pickpocketing.  
---
Warriors suck alone and are pure garbage without the "good gear" they crave so much.  
---
Warriors are team players and they are essential for Prot Warriors are the most optimal tanks.
---
I recommend rolling a hunter then if you feel like it try a rogue for fun.
---
Save rage from prior pull. Communicate to dps to hold off before attacking. If they don't want to, accept that fact and try your damn best at peeling the aggro. At the end of the day, you did all you could really and their repair bill will reflect that.
---
Awesome List -will be downloading some of these when I get home tonight.
---
This is exactly how I got the egg as a night elf warrior, rode my mount straight to the top and lucked out that the horde let me touch the precious egg without being used to paint the walls of the cave
---
Shoot you're right.
---
I'll still make it though, maybe I can convince my buds to download it lol.
---
Thats not the first two I personally would've thought of :D 
---
But they are/were very dedicated. 
---
My first thoughts were 
---
Sco(was Warrior main until having multiple max level chars become the norm) 
---
Kungen (even tho many people meme about him now , his achievements were still great at the time) 
---
monkeynews (private server player with several achievements to his name)

---
I mean the difference is that ele/resto shamans can wear cloth pieces and playing their class and spec normally involves doing so, whereas your example would just be a mage griefing and ninja looting. 
---
Holy paladins can wear plate, but you'll see them wearing a lot of cloth pieces as well. That's just how it goes.
---
Yeah, but then there's this spy addon that tells you when enemies are around. Even without seeing nameplates you know someone's near. 
---
I wouldn't mind seeing only nameplates of NPCs at my max range. Leaves pvp situations as they are.
---
+30sp on skinning knives is a legit thing. Every caster can use it, and 30SP is insanely strong at low levels
---
Only if you have a trash weapon at 60.  The difference between a 55+ weapon that is decent and the ravager, would make you want to use the higher level weapon.
---
Mc you can be sub 60 with greens on as long as your raid has  25 people who know what to do. Mc is ez mode
---
I've actually sort of collected a friends list of people all around my level doing strictly spellcleaves.  It's super popular for a reason. But I do understand people's hate for it when dummies let it bleed into normal runs.
---
You going to share who it is?
---
Two questions:
---
1. I am interested in rolling on an RPPVP server, but there only appears to be two. Grobb and.. The other one. Are the players doing RP or not really? What are the personality differences between the two?
---
2. I saw a 60 ele shaman the other day with some tier 0 from 4 different classes. 2 pieces of Dreadmist, 1 Devout, 1 Magisters, and 1 piece of the Shammy tier 0. So does that mean as a Warlock I am competing with 5 other classes for Dreadmist (Sham, Druid, Lock, Mage, Priest)?  T.05 is class specific through a quest, right? So wouldn't it be considered scummy for me to roll on any T0 that's not specific for your class?
---
Took me 7 mount purchases but I finally got a male horse :)
---
You aren't alone. As a mage I just want to run dungeons normally and hate being stereotyped as one of those AOE mages. In fact when I see a mage of the opposing faction aoe grinding it's like a kill on sight order for giving me a bad name. 
---
I just wanna make water and turn things into sheep. And ordinary runs always go more smoothly in my experience.
---
Its genuinely true.
---
Chained overpowers aint nothing to fuck with - A warrior can def+shield the cd dump and then once the rogue runs out of tricks and burns evasion, its done.
---
The downtime thing is underrated. 
---
If dps dont have to stop to drink, then you can pull trash while healer drinks and clear very fast.
---
Some people seem to think that less than 8k people online = dead.
---
whatever happened to #nochanges lol
---
We don't need a graphs, charts, super data, sources, f'ing aggravate this and that to tell us the obv.
---
We already know.
---
Classic &gt; Retail
---
I have not experienced that myself there... There was even a post there recently discussing recommended AH addons for classic, and I was the only one to suggest TSM. I just rechecked that thread and it has 67 comments with all major addons noted (auctioneer, auctionator, aux, TSM), so I'm not sure what you're on about.
---
It's also kind of strange that you refuse to use an addon just because some mods on some subreddit like it.
---
If DPS pulls aggro, you let them die.  It's the only way they learn (unless you can definitely see that the tank isn't holding aggro enough).  They removed that concept in Cataclysm where you need DPS to finish fights because heals + tank will oom before you kill the boss.  That's usually not the case in pre-cata 5-man stuff, it just makes the fights take longer.
---
If they don't like it, what are they going to do?  Kick you?  And effectively abandon everything?  they're not going back to town to recruit another healer.
---
Mark a kill order, and mark CC.
---
&gt; at low levels (like sub 30) there's barely any difference between ranged and melee for pure single target
---
This is completely wrong. There's a reason why every decent hunter kites as much as possible pre-10 and why nobody sits in melee longer than it takes to put a Wing Clip on the target.
---
Sadly for most companies these days the way to escalate an issue you aren't happy about is to post it on their company twitter.
---
You could post a simple "can anyone explain this?" with a screenshot on their twitter page, should do the trick.
---
To be fair he may thought you were begging for gold or something.
---
Ive never heard anyone but hunters say its the hardest class to master.

---
What level? Curious to how i measure up.
---
Yeah this 60 dwarf is able to attack me with feet on the floor. Very curious.
---
Commenting cause it won‚Äôt let me save post
---
It can not :(
---
I‚Äôd rather take an overpower crit than a few auto attacks and a MS and whirlwind in the duration of evasion.
---
Hmm,  can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trying to be a jerk or not, but in case you‚Äôre not...
---
Classic wow is a version of a game that was released about 15 years ago so this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúquite‚Äù the first ever stack of grilled squid that‚Äôs been sold in the economy.
---
Additionally, there has been a pretty vibrant private server community that has been playing Vanilla wow, sooooo... I‚Äôm guessing that someone on this subreddit may be able to take a wild guess and let me know how valuable this is.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Fuck dot
---
These kind of people don‚Äôt realise they belong in retail yet. Once the new patch hits there will be new things to do and hopefully these people will go
---
Swimming form Feralas to tanaris takes a while.
---
Ask me how i know.
---
As a 46 Warrior Tank I make sure to pay attention to my Healers mana in Dungeons. I did goof once in Ulda on the 2nd to last area w/the AoE bomb dudes. I felt bad even though my healer was joking w/me about not letting him get more than 25% mana. My tanking rule of thumb has always been if the healer has less than 40% mana I'll let him/her get back to at least 75/80% b4 I pull the next group.
---
It's a lot worse if you end up dying and they have to res afterwards. If you are being that much of a burden on the healer then you need to slow down or kick the tank for just auto attacking and not using abilities (I've actually seen this).
---
Druid are really good at single target aggro. Use this to your advantage by always marking the first mob you want to kill with a skull. Open with moonfire on the skull then switch into bear. You should be able to hold the skull while your group pummels him. Once the skull goes down mark your next target with another skull and so on until clear. If you lose aggro on one of the mobs quickly use your growl and pull that one back. If your still losing aggro at the start on one or both ask your party to give you minute on the opening of the attack. If you have a mage don‚Äôt be shy to mark and moon and ask them to sheep that guy. The growl every 10 seconds will be your best friend on those dmg spike occasions where you lose aggro. Once you can swipe that should help a little bit more as well.
---
Yea , thats kinda what I wanted to confirm . But its hard when you're just playing in your own little bubble .
---
Somehow that's even worse lol
---
The way she goes. Anyone from retail is used to healers having infinite mana at this point. Takes constant reminders that you're oom now.
---
Do you think the cat version of HotW build is okay to OT or would you need to do the bear version if you wanted OT?
---
I like Demoralizing shout, get 4 things hitting you, TAB/Sunder x2 on main target, repeat once per other target.
---
Preface the run by saying only attack my target, wait until one sunder on target.  
---
If you pull it, you tank it.  I may pull it off it you if I feel it won't cause the encounter to go south.  certainly gotten comments that I go slow and methodical.  I tell them these dungeons are for all of to practice for lvl 60 content where this is required to progress.
---
Funny thing is, most groups run well.  But a few get cocky after after about 3/4 dungeon and push to go faster.
---
Not necessarily. Warriors have a high skill cap and that attracts min maxers also being the uncontested  best dps in the game helps.....
---
All the smartest players play hunter though. That's a given!
---
If that looks north to you then boy I got some land down in the Bermudas to sell you
---
Mass pulls, not holding aggro, not waiting for me to get a decent amount of Mana in between pulls, not using defensive stance, yeah...I must be doing something wrong.
---
X to Level is awesome. I only remembered using it for mob kills but the extra stats it covers now is really handy.
---
post this in that other thread.

---
Proud of you!
---
If something unexpected happens that's what shield+flash heal are for. I have had to cancel out of a greater heal into that a few times before.
---
I've never had a tank straight up die though.  Generally a max rank heal will heal a tank for about 40% of it's HP most of the time. 60% is plenty enough of a buffer for me.
---
But I guess it comes down to play style. I cut my teeth on healing playing a Cleric in the original Everquest launch. There our main heal was called 'complete heal' and healed someone to 100%, regardless of how much HP they had but it cost a bit and had a long cast time. 
---
So the goal was to let the tank fall as low as possible for when the heal hit you'd get the most value out of it. Here, I just make sure the tank is missing more health than a normal heal can cover. I still over heal on crits, but I'm OK with that since crits are unreliable and I don't go for crit gear anyway.
---
Out of curiosity, why not just use fishing buddy addon? It does all of this, and it automatically binds it to the trigger of your choice (double-click right mouse by default)
---
I find when I log on at 5am (before I work) nobody uses General.
---
But #nochanges amirite
---
If the tank dies its the healers fault, if the healer dies its the tanks fault, if the dps dies its their own damn fault.
---
If anything, healers should get priority because their gear is three times as important as dps gear in dungeons. That's how you would divide it if you were leveling as a 5 man group.
---
By definition. Mare is Female, Stallion is Male. Brown Horse and Pinto are generic so not sure what they should be.
---
It is considered a terrain exploit and is bannable.
---
um yea... theres no river in the nw. and that isnt in the nw
---
I went prot at 52. no regrets
---
The simple fact is that the mobs in dungeons don't do enough damage to punish pulling aggro, so no one really cares. As a tank I've given up caring as well. I don't bother marking anymore, just charge in and try as best as I can to keep aggro on them long enough to where if they pull off they'll die before they do much damage. I save my taunt for if the healer gets aggro or if a clothie is getting particularly pounded.
---
&gt; and are premadana's about their mage water
---
Strangest way ever to spell *[prima donna](https://www.google.com/search?q=prima+donna)*.
---
Ask a GM if you are this concerned about ways to attack people in cities
---
I wanted to be a mage when classic launched. Got one to 22 then rerolled because everyone is a fucking mage!
---
Because they dont actually know each other and most people are not that generous with strangers online. I help everywhere I can, I've given probably 100g+ away to friends to help them. Meanwhile, another person in my guild will COD charge you the 30c for the mail fee it costs to mail you an item. Yes. The 30c it costs to mail an item he will COD you for it. To guild members.
---
Come to Earthfury! Could always use more Alliance to battle the Horde... my guild transferred from Herod to EF... population has been slowly growing.. community is great so far.
---
Edit: the Horde v Alliance population feels fairly balanced on EF.
---
Because it‚Äôs low effort and attention whore behavior
---
Alright cool, thanks for helping out man. Good luck out there.
---
Were we really that bad back then ?
---
I tanked ST last night for the first time in years. I forgot how big some of those dragonkin pulls can be. A mage would have been killer. I bet you could do some los pulls and really crank out the xp/hr there.
---
It's ItemTooltipProfessionIcons.
---
Why so condecending ? All I wanted to do was confirm wether or not my thoughts are the results of playing in a isolated bubble or if this is actually how others feel aswell.
---
The weed is the chiefiest
---
The value of equipping an item is higher than the market value.
---
- The item can typically be used immediately, for the benefit of the group
---
- If a substantial upgrade, the item can turn a struggling party into a competent one
---
- To realize market value, you have to finish the instance then either mail the item to a bank alt or get to a major city and list the item.  In terms of economics, these actions have value and must be factored into the absolute value of an item.  Not to mention the value lost in deposits and AH cut.  Achieving the value you have in your mind for an item could take days or weeks, which may substantially drop the profit of said item.  Spending 10g on deposits while selling the item for 15g effectively means you made 3g after fees.  So the item's value in the dungeon, at moment of roll was actually 3g, not 15g.
---
Opportunity cost and fees play a very relevant role in determining final value of an item.  This results in the raw value of an item not being equivalent to the value of being equipped nor the final value obtained from selling it.  Saying that equipping is equal to market value is absurdly oversimplifying and is wrong after examination.
---
BoE items, blues especially, should not be subjected to NE rules due to the lost effort in attempting to realize a currency value.  I'm not here to play Wall Street, Azeroth Edition and neither is 99% of the server.  The paper tigers on reddit need to realize that their 'Need everything' mentality may be theoretically sound and maximizes the value of each item while never being actually put into practice due to human laziness, generosity, and practicality.
---
You seem to have a need to prove that it's better for everyone to play the AH when that is the worst advice.  If everyone is saving for a mount, no one has money to buy items.  If no one has money to spare, no item is going to sell for massive amounts of gold.  If no item will sell for large gold values, the market value is substantially lower and often closer to the vendor price.  Ergo, if you are arguing that a green BoE doesn't get a need roll because you get piss all from it, how does an item that barely sells for more suddenly get more attention?
---
I'll repeat this again, because you still haven't understood the very foundation of economics.  An item only has the value someone is willing to ascribe to it.  I have ten Staffs of Jordan.  I list all ten for 200g.  One sells and the other nine sit for weeks because only one person on the server had the money for the staff at this time.  If I list all ten at 50g, I might sell all ten, I might not.  But now, since we've sold more at 50g, we can definitively say the market value is closer to 50g than it is to 200g.  Apply across all BoEs and you realize that the advice of "need everything" only applies when you can liquidate BoEs for large sums of gold.  Which only happens on old servers with lots of loose capital and a need for lower level items, aka Twinks.
---
You aren't really going to be able to sell twink items until people start gearing twinks, which isn't going to be until battlegrounds in Phase 3.
---
Your warrior friend is going to outgrow those gloves quickly, so I'd personally just hold onto it.
---
Are you saying if i use ElvUI i won't need these items or that these would be the only ones i'd need in addition to ElvUI?
---
In the same faction everything can be shared, in opposite factions you can't share anything
---
It seems most of the zones they added beyond the low level ones in initial development were dont lazily as they consist of mostly desert terrain.
---
I do both, depending on what prices are on the ah.
---
Curious, what's the default value for this? It's not 20, right?
---
I have 3 twink items in my bank. You're silly if you sell them now.
---
Why
---
Thank youuu
---
https://shadowpanther.net/
---
Spiritual Healing is essential in that it provides the largest overall healing throughput per talent point spent.
---
Even though feet are on the floor? In a place where a level 53 can aggro but a level 60 does not. Do you have a blue post to back up this claim?
---
He was for sure, just maybe didn't have Talent Points in that tree ...
---
Thank you for this post.
---
Didn't answer the question, still blaming other people.
---
Looks like a trash healer.
---
that is a solid theory
---
[Carbonite](https://github.com/IrcDirk/Carbonite-Classic) literally questie with classiccodex. It's more than other map addons. Currently it's on beta stage but it improves everyday.
---
&gt; T.05 is class specific through a quest, right? So wouldn't it be considered scummy for me to roll on any T0 that's not specific for your class?
---
Not going to be out for a very long time, but should be class specific yes. As for scummy, it's stats right now, and yes there's a ton of classes who are going to go for it.
---
&gt; I ran Deadmines about 20 times yesterday 
---
If you're clearing deadmines in 30 minutes, that's 10 hours of one dungeon. And my clear speed is nowhere near 30 minutes. Crazy.
---
On point, I made a macro that says "Out of Mana - Drinking" in party chat whenever I drink in a dungeon. If people pull mobs and die after I hit that, that's their fault and I just point to party chat and ask if they can read.
---
I'm having a problem with Real Mob Health and my quest tracking add on. My quest tracking add on (can't recall the name, currently at work) displays in the tooltip if a mob is part of a quest I have, and the % chance to drop a quest item, etc. If I turn on Real Mob Health though it overrides this part in the tooltip and says like "not scanned" or "scanned" or something along those lines. Any ideas on how to get the two to play nicely?
---
Improved holy Crit &amp; BoW are pretty essential to a pally healer. Mana is life
---
As much as I like surface pros they are not ideal for gaming.  And if you really want mobile gaming you can definitely get something with a dedicated graphics card for the same price as a surface pro.  Won't be as nice for other things but if all you care about is gaming....
---
Wanted to start over. He finds fun in that. New server and faction for a newer experience.
---
Spec looks good ish. 
---
I recommend ditching Improved Charge for either two more points in toughness or improved heroic strike. Id go toughness.
---
You have some room to choose between a number of prot talents. Namely Improved Sunder, Improved Heroic, Improved Taunt, Improved Shield Wall, Improved Revenge. You can choose between these as you like. 
---
For MC,  I prefer improved taunt since everything can be taunted and its nice on annihilators.
---
I prefer Imp HS over Imp sunder for main tanking, the opposite for off tanking. Main tanks have more rage for HS spam and revenge procs, off tanks mainly use sunder bc they arent getting revenge procs.
---
Imp revenge is really nice in dungeons and ZG. I like to sneak it in if I dont feel I need imp wall.
---
Imp wall is just a nice to have, more safety.
---
Not saying any of that isny true, but for the most part gather group , blizzard down pack doesn‚Äôt have that much skill involved. It‚Äôs more about the class than the player. Sure some player are better than others but, mage is a mage for the most part.
---
You're right! Apologies, I am using a patched version I found that uses this
---
https://github.com/rgd87/LibClassicCasterino
---
I can't find the link right now to where I got the patched version.
---
This addon also uses that library if you can't wait for a link 
---

---
Big heals pulls threat, and if hunter loses threat to another char, tame fails.
---
Sorry but you‚Äôre a bad healer if you do that. This is coming from another healer. The game is not so hard that only the tank can be attacked by a mob. People like you and OP are severely overestimating the difficulty of the game and are forgetting how fluid the dungeon roles were in vanilla. Half the time you didn‚Äôt even have a dedicated tank and the groups were just a random mishmash of chaos yet it things worked fine.
---
It‚Äôs worse cause 90% of the mages that say that are bad and suck at kiting and get your team wiped
---
I already have my keybinds set. So yeah, not a big addition for me personally. It's helpful to set each character up if you're new, I guess.
---
No I just took pretty big issue with the argument that you can't pay better because other people would be mad.
---
&gt; and the new setting that changes the distance nameplates are visible from.
---
Is there any way to "fix" this? I'd like to see nameplates from a bit further away because my eyesight sucks.
---
You're definitely behind the average player and its probably only gonna get worse. 2-3 hours a week means by lvl 30-40 you're probably only gonna get 1 level or 2 a week. Its fair to say you'll be behind the content were on but the great thing about classic/vanilla is that mc and ony are easy and people will probably always be doing them. Then you got zg and bwl as the next raids which are also not too difficult and people will often be doing those raids too throughout all of classic.  You really only get behind if you're not doing mc/ony yet and the current patch is AQ+.  Honestly though you shouldn't have the mind set of being worried about getting behind if your playing so little. Just enjoy it for yourself and dont worry about everyone else
---
this is very not lore friendly... having to manipulate arbitrary game mechanics just to fight an enemy that in the real world of warcraft could just be attacked on site.
---
ROFL, wow you're persistent. I can't help you, the isn't flat get over it.
---
Darnassus rep can be gained by just buying runecloth.
---
Pro move is to get your Bank alt to 5 to DE stuff, then skinning or herb with your main for extra profit.
---
As long as it's universally acceptable (or at least for the most part), then I'll roll for stats. I just don't want to be labeled as a ninja of some sort. üòä
---
I can double check when I get home but as far as I know it is. Every time I have went into character selection it was a Warrior by default. I think the race and gender is random, but it‚Äôs always Warrior. Which makes sense since every race can be one.
---
Thanks, I like it a lot. The developer is doing good work.
---
Mostly Horde players claim ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù. So either horde tend to gank more or alliance tends to complain more. Either way they‚Äôre not the same.
---
&gt; Calling another player a jackass in trade chat is against the rules
---
Incorrect.
---
Sure I'll use rage potions, fork them over, or the 3g per pull. Yeah no thanks.
---
LPT: tanks can't really juggle more than 4 at a time effectively, it's very difficult for a good tank to juggle 3 let alone more than that. If people want to pull half the instance at a time, your job is kiting it all.
---
God this sub is so retarded. Ok man, I believe you. Every single pug you have has a mage ninja pulling 4 packs and trying to AoE them down. I am so sorry for you.
---
That's rough.
---
Well you are awake now.
---
You had an experience and you can learn from it. Now that you know you can slip into such obsessions you can watch out to keep a grasp on reality.
---
Don't give up and don't be afraid. Good luck for the future.
---
This is only true for some classes, mostly melee classes IIRC. 
---
As a mage I reached rank14 with nothing but PvP gear because things like +hit%, mp5, int, and spirit are mostly worthless in PvP. Stam, spell damage, crit% and a moderate amount of int is all you really need.
---
PvP is not nearly about min-maxing as much as PvE is.
---
I absolutely can deny it. It goes like this, "Fuck off with your AoE grind bullshit." See? Easy!
---
Oh man, it took me 17. You go so lucky.
---
Got any other macros you care to share for mages? üòä
---
Had a friend who left the slow quest chat on until level 28
---
No, you didn't correctly say what you meant. Accept the feedback rather than pretend you did nothing wrong.
---
Sure they should have been able to figure out what you meant from the context, but that still means you said the wrong thing.
---
Slow pullers need to fucking die. I can‚Äôt stand when people wait for optimal engagement on every single damn pull.
---
You cannot attain the plans elsewhere, but you could purchase the items off the AH or from another Armorsmith.
---
I didn't realize how fantastic Riposte was until I took it.  Granted it's best when fighting mobs that hold weapons but still...cheap energy with a good strong hit is fantastic.
---
Plus it really shines when fighting multiple mobs...procs a ton.
---
This is why I'm a pocket healer to a few tanks I know. I pretty much only group with them if I can help it.
---
Thanks for that info. Never did alchemy back when I played so I didn't know that. Looks like I'll be swapping, just have to decide if I want to get a few more mooncloth for bags first.
---
It probably wasn't exactly 20, but yeah, I played for about 10 hrs yesterday as it was my day off and I did spend most of my time in that area. So it was definitely quite a few times between Sat-Sun.
---
I need to look up how to make macros because that sounds like it would be useful and just doing /oom in the chat doesn't seem to do anything.
---
Omg it actually allows warriors to *play the game* !!! broken!!!
---
Or I just hearth and not use any money at all
---
Tanked WC last night with a Hunter who had no pet and melee'd everything. Never fired a shot.
---
Pog
---
If someone doesn‚Äôt want to get killed ‚Äúunfairly‚Äù, they are free to join a PVE server.
---
Can't speak to this bug personally, but they've said they kept certain ones in because they were present at the time and didn't get fixed until after classic
---
/moo
---
Precisely why I rolled a rogue. I don't always engage Horde every time, but if I see a Mage you can bet I am ganking that corpse
---
Way to blow shit out of proportion at the slightest drop of a difference of opinion.
---
Room for error being larger means you have more ability to fix a problem rather than increased likelyhood of a problem. 
---
I.e. Don't park there. With that tree there isn't much room for error.
---
&gt;this melee cleave is a bit slower than a spell cleave group that is played correctly. however, the **room for error on spell cleave is much bigger** and typically melee cleave is a smoother experience and there is 0 down time if you let the healer get killing blows for spirit tap.
---
A nameplate option to change when you get X yards away or just usual aggro range +5yd would have worked. Right now it hurts ranged classes as you can't monitor health easily. Hunters and Warlocks watching mobs die at range is harder now when juggling.
---
I thought I was going crazy when the range reverted back. Shame, didn't realize that wasn't intentional.
---
Don't really need OmniCC, there is an option to add numerical countdown right on the game UI options.
---
The issue with this is that you really only need to have your auction fail once and suddenly you would have gotten more money from just vendoring it anyway.
---
Especially when people are selling it at pretty much vendor prices anyway (or sometimes even below vendor prices for some reason).
---
If your server economy makes it worth it it's great, but if it doesn't then there's really no reason to not vendor everything
---
I try to keep a reasonable pace. Theres very little "Downtime" i tend to find i can chain pull packs fine, But its more kill a pack then kill the next.  There wasn't much of a difference because our healer didnt need to stop to drink every 5 seconds. 
---
I can mark on the fly, Its why they are keybound. The biggest thing to note is i can AOE tank just fine. It's not about not being able to do it its more that it is not fun. Though it wont be an issue at 60 really so its only an issue for now.
---
You mean up in the Bermudas.
---
Demanding that someone do something extra for you and give you the rewards for doing it without so much as asking, y'know the thing you should've been taught how to do by your parents, makes you a garbage human being. Beating your wife would make you a garbage human being. You're clearly the type of person to treat others as slaves (see your first post, which incorrectly states my ability to save a few silver, in actuality someone demanding a full stack would be a gold or more every single dungeon) who must do whatever you want of them without you needing to so much as speak to them. You're clearly a cracker, and your ancestors are speaking through you. That's the correlation, you garbage human being. None of the asshats who wanna just trade me and fucking sit there acting like I'M stupid for not already having given them water (like you) are getting any.
---
Asmonblind
---
Thanks for the kind words. I got the tanking bug back in WotLK and from my brother who was a amaze balls Holy Priest I always remembered the line, "Soon as I'm 75% mana pull to your hearts content." Kinda stuck w/that rule for the most part.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhh. Lol
---
Yea the AH is great. Not even price gouging or setting prices to astronomical levels. Even a few silver over vendor and your still doing jumping jacks every time it dings.
---
wait, thats a hunter weapon wtf
---
&gt;Oh no, a slight annoyance! How do mages even manage to level? It's not like you can just ignore people who are being annoying. You know what probably way more annoying? Being a warrior and having to pay tons of gold for food, water, and repairs. Or literally being any other class and not being able to get top dps pressing one button.
---
Literally none of your sarcasm contributed to the argument and the main thing I pointed out was the "top dps" thing, which you weren't being sarcastic about... And the other thing I told you was that I dispense water to raid/instance groups... which you also weren't being sarcastic about. Again, keep desperately trying to save face. Also you said "started" so anyone with a brain would go to the very beginning. Be more specific next time! &lt;3
---
Also, next time you accuse me of something why don't you dig it up yourself? Tired of having to point out your own stupidity to yourself.
---
Get good? SM Cath and ZF GY runs for exp. I've been running with AOE groups as a bear druid and it's great.
---
I saw about 2 that were on wowinterface but didn't check them all. I think most of them are on curse.
---
The alphabetical naming convention is satisfying.
---
Maybe it's just because I am a mage that doesn't do this and haven't really seen much of any of it in my groups AoE focused or otherwise. 
---
Started a tank alt yesterday though so maybe I can see and understand this perspective in Classic better soon enough.
---
&gt;Classic is about the journey, the people you meet...
---
Did I meet some cool people and end up grinding from mid40's to 60 and joining their guild? Sure.
---
I still loathe leveling. It was my single least favorite aspect of each expansion that came out. And after having several 60's in vanilla, for this round I pretty much just ground it out in dungeons and made it to 60 a week ago.
---
Depends on your server and the mat... When you take into account AH cut, risk of not selling the mat, etc., many of the low level skins and herbs arent even worth auctioning.
---
I‚Äôm DPS and I end up marking shit anyway, tanks are lazy af
---
ikr xD
---
It would for me, but it may not for you, depends what your goals are.
---
&gt;Or the poor healer who goes oom after every pull healing the warlock more than the tank 
---
First thing I say when I get a group:
---
I like to keep my health between 60-80%, a hot would be awesome but not required unless I screw up and pull agro. 
---
I still get heals more often than I like. I feel so guilty about it.
---
Auctioneer is my go to. I don't like Auctionator
---
Ninja would be rolling for leather, as a clothie. When in dobut, just talk to people. If something is itemized for you, and is an upgrade feel free to grab it. People are going to be salty if they lose the roll.
---
What‚Äôs your /played?
---
I believe they keys you wanted to press were ctrl+2
---
Yeah, this couldn‚Äôt be more true. 
---
Warriors have greater combat prowess. Bleeds/dots/cc literally ruin rogues where the same is not said of warriors.
---
In organized BGs rogues aren‚Äôt even sought after, if that tells you anything at all.
---
You can easily solo princess, as a druid it's probably easier than hunters and rogues as if you make a mistake, you can fix it and still have basically unlimited mana post 40.  You basically solo it the same way with a kite as long as you don't get stupid and blow your mana then make a mistake.
---
But all of those money making tricks and schemes pale in comparison to fishing.  Which you will have a direct advantage at being a druid with aquatic form.  You can take the short path in water to different areas rather than running around where the land let's you on a mount.
---
I was 40g at 39. Grinded elementals in arathi highlands for the rest. The same ones the warriors need their axe for.
---
The math on this, while you think otherwise, is wrong. Evasion is a great skill for use vs. a Warrior, but like the above user says, it needs to be popped early. If you pop it at 15% the Overpower is going to kill you, if you pop it with your opener 1 to 2 improved overpowers with a majority dodges after is less damage overall, you can also dodge hamstring spam/MS spam/etc.
---
What happened at the end there?
---
Can‚Äôt enjoy years and years of content when the current iteration of gameplay design is a snore fest
---
At least on my server, gathering professions are currently worthless as gathered resources sell for barely more than vendor prices.
---
Going to be a chore to get that mount no matter what professions you have.
---
Nope, I'm a gnome, I have blind, I have vanish, and I have sprint. I have done this to every single low level group that tries to gank me. Not exagerating or trying to sound cool - if you can't kill 3 or 4 -10 level enemies you probably just aren't as good as you think.
---
You won't really run into it until SM. Have fun :D
---
Oh right on a meme specific to one person really great job
---
SOLUTION: roll PvE and be set free of this douchebaggery.  
---
And to me if the tank is watching his healers mana well you can pull efficiently and quickly enough to still make the dungeon not seem as long.
---
Was it healbot? I'm having problems with it at the moment. Wrong health listed, showing people as ~half health that are at 100%, slow to update even though I have it at max CPU usage, constantly thinks I'm out of range, etc.
---
*et cetera*
---
If Im not mistaken the pvp gear and honor system will be availabe at phase 2 and battlegrounds in phase 3.
---
And as someone said at phase 6 you wont be able to have best gear for pvp in game without raiding.
---
Char is used in other MMOs. And even others use terms like "Alts" as in alternative character(Eve Online). It's just whichever is repeated often enough that becomes the main phrase
---
Itt: Tanks who dont get to lead and are sad.
---
There is no pull everything meta, you are just playing with idiots.
---
Use Details. Just open a second window and edit it to show threat.
---
&gt; THIS DOES NOT MEAN ITS OK TO REFER TO THEM AS MAGIC WALKING WATER FOUNTAIN.
---
I actually refer to them as a vending machine. Insert silver coins, get snacks and drinks back.
---
Sure, but, you *have to actually be heal spec*.
---
Even if i dont see much profit, would it be more convenient than just buying enchants from others?
---
Economy and prices depend on the servers. These could be worth 20s per just like they could be worth 3g per. But please go ahead and act like prices on an established are anything similar to the prices on the fresh Classic servers.
---
I thought about this because elite mob damage seems to be a lot less threatening than I remember (WAY less than private servers especially!) so I had thought about the viability of soloing green / some yellow elites in various instances.
---
I'm very attached to my blueberry.
---
yea dude, I'm QQ'ing because I hit 60 already...
---
Also 35-40k doing AoE dungeons is a fucking meme, you think that is impressive in dungeon farm? That's only double the exp/hour of my solo leveling ret paladin at 40-ish.
---
Had a tank in deadmines that was pulling everything, even non elite miners one at a time extremely carefully with his bow. Im sure he was just new so I didn't say anything but it still irritated the shit out of me lol.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/243159
---
Reminds me of the wowcrendor how to win at pugs and gear score.
---
We have a professional service called Uber on Grobbulus, they charge 50s for a portal/summon to any major city and 1g to a dungeon.
---
They have standard operating hours, a dedicated channel, and quick service.
---
They create and level alts to place in different locations to allow for more destinations.
---
Each and every spell has its own spell power coefficient. You can find them by googling that term, along with the class (or specific spell) you are curious about.
---
I believe spell power coefficients range from the 10-20% area all the way to 100%. Generally, the longer the cast time of the spell, the more benefit it receives from each point of spell power. (E.G. I believe Pyroblast has a flat 1.0 SPC.)
---
they have a hoj tho!
---
These are bland tips, and just comes down to ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù
---
Find items with little value now, that will increase later.
---
All actions in WoW take time.  Buy the stuff not worth Farming now for cheap coppers or silvers.
---
A few items I‚Äôm sucking up that will x10 or x100 in price.
---
* Stranglekelp
---
* swifthistle
---
* large fangs
---
I‚Äôm stacking about a 20 different items.  Look at things continuously consumed.  Then expect their price to jump in 3-9 months as people realize it takes equal amount of time to farm thorium ore as it does large fangs.
---
Spend my play time grinding quests and dungeons for gold.  Investing it into items bound to explode?
---
Why did I pick those few items above?  Battlegrounds.  Swiftness pots, free action pots, and rage potions.
---
You can only use 1 set of armor but potions can be used 10-20-40-80 times per night of play time.
---
Ask a friend invite your main to group -&gt; Relog to alt -&gt;  ask same friend to invite alt to same group. -&gt; get leader and ask friend to leave grp/uninvite -&gt; When done clearing. Relog inside instance to alt. Wait for leader to swap. -&gt; reset instance -&gt; Should be reseted and you good to go again from start of instance.
---
I don't really think they are. To me it's much, much more rewarding to tease out the clues in the quest description.
---
i dont use the app and prefer to not use the website.  wow interface is just for wow addons and their app, minion, does a good job!
---
Abilities will only get the full effect from +healing/damage if they have 3.5 second or longer cast times. Less than that and it will only receive a (relative) portion.
---
If you want a more indepth look:

Is there a working Outfitter add-on yet? I silently scream when I finish an instance with my paladin and find out I had my str\stam gear on in different slots.
---
My problem with this is that it seems everyone who wants to do this (in a group that isnt optimal for it) tends to suck.
---
I'm a lock, so people think "oh the lock can aoe them down"
---
what they dont realize is that both my aoe spells basically *instantly* pull aggro, so I really cant aoe anything down unless I have a mage slowing the group also.
---
Then I dont do very much damage and everyone blames me for the wipe. It's pretty frustrating.
---
Who should've got it instead ? A Fury warrior that dual wields in raids ?
---
The tickets are gonna be interesting once phase 2 starts, tons of people are gonna wanna try to exploit guards and they dont read forums. The GMs are gonna have to answer all of those instances everyday   
---
    
---
They might even stop warnings altogether and start issuing hourly+ bans
---
It‚Äôs nothing but a novelty weapon for warriors since BRE is 100000000x better for them
---
I feel this. I get overwhelmed and gotta be like don‚Äôt say anything, no one cares. And that works great and we all have a good time!
---
30 damage seems garbage when you hit for like 250 or 300+ on a crit
---
Edit I‚Äôm a noob so I might not know what I‚Äôm talking about - above should be phrased more as a question then a statement
---
You‚Äôre expected to do more than one zone at each bracket beyond level 10
---
There are plenty of people doing normal runs. No matter what game you play, there are going to be min-maxers and folks who follow the flavor of the week.
---
I was told at level 43 "mana pool is too low" as a shaman who respec'd resto. It's not the game it's the players.
---
You know perfectly well who it is lets be honest.
---
Wait, is this true?
---
As a healer across a vast array of MMORPGs I've always enjoyed VIP group finding status... :( Hate to know I'll have to put up with hard times finding groups.
---
The great thing about being a tank is that if DPS is playing poorly or not taking directions, they're a dime a dozen. Explain what they're doing wrong and if they keep doing it, kick them and replace them. Sure people make mistakes, but an unwillingness to listen to feedback and play differently is only going to prolong the experience. As a healer, I'd rather wait for a new dps or even restart a dungeon to fill that DPS roll if it means a smoother run. Because a smoother run means I'm burning less juice, have less of a repair bill, and ultimately I'm less stressed out so it's more enjoyable. DPS will learn really quickly when their ability to play as a team will dramatically decrease the amount of time they have to spend finding the next group.
---
Wut?  Nothing about this has to do with what you can and can't do, it's about teaching a lesson to bad DPS who consistently fail to monitor threat.  Sure, I can keep you alive, but DPS is so easily replaceable.  Why would I tolerate having to drink between every pull and slowing the entire group down just because somebody can't chill and pay attention to their threat?
---
I have a suspicion that you haven't yet hit any groups above level 30 if you still feel like tanks and mages have the same level of survivability.
---
True. 
---
But there is a good aggro table and I need to find it.
---
But damage is valued higher than healing for threat. 
---
Like 1/.5 ratio. So as long as the healer isnt over healing and criting they should be good.
---
Nothing that I've seen before sadly. Just your run of the mill leveling guides.
---
I remember buying a graphics card for my pc that ran vista for BC, lol. It was not a pleasant experience! Just kinda wanna make sure I can jump in without having terrible ping or fps. Thanks for the wisdom!
---
If only people worked this hard in real life they could set themselves up nicely... instead they got something that looks cool in a game but will be worthless in a year.
---
Grats - but good lord get a life outside of this game.
---
I found it best to just grind for 2 levels without quests so you outlevel everything, because hitting enemies who are 2 level below you is a massive deal to warriors, you can even kill elites super easily once you outlevel them a bit while they are almost impossible without cooldowns/potions when they are the same level.
---
That way you should also stand a fighting chance when you get ganked since you shouldn't drop below 50% hp if you are fighting lower level enemies.
---
I would just charge him for the heals too.
---
Actually no..i will probably play 31ele 20resto at 60. 
---
I was thinking of switching to ele at 40 but i still have lots of clotch and leather has int gear. Also i always see ppl saying that it have alot of downtime.
---
Its not like ench doesnt have but ele for leveling feels so mana hungry. You have experience on leveling as ele?
---
Its not his. They're inspecting somebody else who got it.
---
This is so true, the reason people can't find tanks isn't because we aren't out there, it's because we whisper the people on our friends list for a run. I'm not going to risk being annoyed by random pugs when I have and can group back up with people I'm comfortable playing with. Be nicer to your party members, and they'll invite you back!
---
Making a reposte + sinister strike macro also makes life easier so you can just sit and spam one key without having to worry about parries.
---
I wonder why he has such different list for pre-raid bis list than Skarn on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKLxwOjIMc0&amp;t=383s) video. One finds value in getting more hit while your guy is about dodge every item. Most interesting difference is boots where the difference is just agi/sta vs agi/sta/dodge in different values. I get the difference isn't huge but how did they end up having different items on so many slots?
---
I think the idea of there being multiple strategies (including AOE) is great and adds depth to the game.
---
I used to main a mage in vanilla and AoE'd in dungeons all the time.   But here's what I didn't do
---
I didn't pull more mobs after the tank pulled.
---
I gave  the tank time to get  aggro on everything.
---
If I did pull aggro I ran to the tank and stayed there were either he pulled them off of me or I died. 
---
Reading the way mages aoe now just enrages me as back in the day that kind of nonsense got.you kicked immediately from any group.amd.yoi were considers a bad mage. These days appeernetly everyone must play around the mages playstyle or you are just bad. 
---
I .glad to see people pushing back against that meta though.    It just teaches people how to play the badly and the more I am on classic the more in.convinced a majority of the players never stepped foot in vanilla. So instead of learning the basics of dungeon diving they are all tryhard wanna best trying to play the game like.theynsee all the streamers do but don't have the knowledge or expirience to make it happen
---
I'm playing Classic with my friends and family, thank you very much.

Well all I know is that right now, PvP is the only thing I'm actually having fun with with my spriest. Given up trying to even run dungeons because nobody wants a spriest, and healing just isn't fun to me.

So here we go Mage!
---
Ye but it looks like shit
---
You missed the point of the post, useful addons that dont change how the game looks

Yeah, I've been in a couple groups with a war that went well, but generally you can't pull as much with a war because they actually get hit by the swarm lol.

I applaud your bravery to try and gank a master race rogue that is 6 levels higher than you \*cheers\*

Nah, a warrior who would put it to use in PVP.
---
Loch Modan is the best option. Go quest there, get to level 17-18, then go back to westfall to continue, then Deadmines with Quests, then Redridge, then Duskwood/Wetlands, then come back in 2 weeks.
---
0 judgment.  I just feel it's a bit disingenuous to make a guide on getting your epic mount at 60 and then tell people to go fish for 5 hours to save 2 gold on bags.  You can get an epic mount at 60 in a billion different ways if you just prolong hitting 60 artificially.

Dude 17? I stopped raiding in Vanilla to farm gold to try and get the one I wanted, never managed it. Must have bought 100 at least.

There's a quest around level 4 in the Undead starting area that asks you to do something in a graveyard. The directions are : go to the graveyard and so that thing.
---
What's your /played?
---
Had a guildie help me with a loot quest. Forgot they were helping me and they didn‚Äôt need the mushrooms so I could just loot away to my heart‚Äôs content.
---
Yeah people really need to remember this. Most low level stuff is literally 1c above vendor on my server
---
 the only herb I've really cashed in on was Wildvine, mainly cause it only comes as secondary or off of trolls.
---
So I had to kill like 100 trolls one day and had 10 of those suckers for 1g a pop
---
That helped my 40 mount lol
---
I don't think tanking is all that great as a paladin, though you can definitely do it. I'd look to fill healer or dps roles before trying to tank. Paladins are a little awkward because they make a great support in the group. They can help tank if the warrior is struggling, or help heal if the healer is struggling, or just focus on DPS if the run is going fine. You can fill any role that is missing in a group.
---
The slash command I wrote out works but its annoying to type it out. I made macros:
---
1st: /join lookingforgroup
---
2nd: /leave 4
---
It usually defaults to chat number 4. I made a leave macro because there is so much activity it can flood your chat log.
---
My dad works at blizzard too.
---
And for that reason, I must quit
---
The 1h Mace that drops could be great too. 
---
believe it or not there was a shitload of testing done for shaman leveling and the overall grinding speed remained VERY similar between all combinates of 1h/shield or 2h, combined with various weapon buffs.  The conclusion of the video was the Blizz tried to normalize damage over time with all four buffs so that the only 'decision' to be made was what kind of special effect you wanted rather than which does the most DPS.  
---
I forget the name of hte video but the guy did a bunch of testing in Aszshara over many days, did like an hour at a time of grinding with all the various combos.  1h/shield had slower kill speeds but also had to heal less frequently so it still was competitive but 2h speeds were generally faster.
---
Just dumb, got it. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Nah, pservers weren't like that. They had dungeon mobs way overturned, there's a screenshot from the beta of pserver mobs doing 3x the damage. You had to be pretty careful in those dungeons.
---
Just because you want to stop and smell the roses doesn't mean the rest of us do.  I prefer to just plow through to 60 so I can begin grinding my pre raid gear, then maybe level some alts.  People play for different reasons.
---
You Fear the Evasion, also against a Rogue the Warrior doesn‚Äôt need to use a 2H
---
You can sit in Defensive with a shield and you‚Äôll still greatly outdamage the Rogue do to how strong plate is against daggers
---
Horde mage kept tagging me in Mechagon by staying on top the metal arch, didn't know this was exploitation.
---
Tab quick enough so you can't auto attack and get stuck in tab panic.
---
Hard to enjoy yourself when you‚Äôre spending more than half the time sitting and waiting for the next mob engagement.
---
yesterday he was doing hearthglen and the lumber mill in WPL
---
the general consensus is to level with a two hander, because dual-wielding makes you incur a massive penalty to your hit chance, 27% or so if i recall, and while leveling there is virtually no gear at all with +hit% so you will just miss over and over. 
---
Generally the advice is to level fury to start, though early on talents dont really matter (although the 5% crit is nice). Fury really 'turns on' when you get the talent for dealing extra dmg after receiving a crit, and of course Flurry after that. 
---
However the general consensus is to swap to Arms at level 40, because Mortal Strike is really good for leveling--to have such a large on-demand swing. 
---
So as for why slow 2hs are preferable: overpower, mortal strike, whirlwind, and execute all base their damage off the weapon damage of your weapon. So the higher the top end of the weapon, the bigger the damage. your autos will be much slower, but your instant moves will hit way harder. 
---
When you hit 60, Fury is the higher raid DPS spec, benefitting from great attack speed scaling through Frenzy (get the slowest, hardest hitting 1H wep you can find for your main hand, because bloodthirst, WW, and execute run off this). Arms is the preferable PvP option, as you rarely have the uptime on a target to utilize a fast-attacking weapon so hitting someone once every 3-4 seconds with a big weapon will do just fine, and mortal strike rocks the house.
---
Prot doesn't offer much in the way of being actually able to kill anything, so I don't think it's good for leveling. It's also not necessary to tank pre-60 dungeons as prot--you can do just fine as arms or fury, putting on a 1h+shield when necessary for mitigation. Tactical Mastery is maybe the best talent for tanking as you will need to swap stances in order to use charge, mocking blow, intercept, thunder clap, taunt etc, as needed. You could certainly, however, aim to mostly tank dungeons for xp, and invest in a prot build that would make you very reliably tanky.
---
As a fellow warrior picking up a lot of water I thought I'd just give it to the first caster I saw to free up some bag space. My dumbass gives it to a mage. I realised 10 minutes later what an idiot I was and spent the next 30 minutes after that facepalming.
---

Random question, but do you have dual monitors?
---
Why do people like this guy? I can't stand this streamer dude
---
I talk to my voidwalker, though more like "why would you do that?"
---
Sometimes, when I am very into it, I call him with the name of the voidwalker of a warlock I had back in the real vanilla. That was shocking. Especially that my actual voidwalker has a cooler name.
---
Easy start to a dungeon when you're grouping with another shaman:
---
"So, which totems will you be dropping?"
---
I believe what I use is threatplates. I'm not at comp to double check.
---
When in battle / berserker nameplates are red when I have aggro.
---
When in defensive they're green when i have aggro.
---
Nope, 55 priest here and on my bar I have max rank renew, rank 3 lesser heal, rank 1&amp;3 heal, and rank 1 greater heal.
---
EDIT:  should have included flash heal max rank and prayer of healing max rank - both only used for oh shit moments
---
Side note: there should not be three people pulling aggro, the tank tanks, the dps shouldn't be taking too much if any damage at all.  If they are, let them die and tell them not to pull aggro from the tank, they will learn.
---
30 damage is a 10% increase on 300.
---
That's pretty far from garbage.
---
And you only crit X% of the time, it's a much larger % of your base hits.
---
Yeah but when someone reads an emote directed at them it reads ‚Äúyou‚Äù and not their character name. So you could trick everyone in the general area by typing /e and  ‚Äúyou‚Äù where the name would go.
---
my lightning bolt does like 350 dmg base atm, so with +30 it would do like 380 dmg, so not bad
---
I suspect rend is muscle memory for players who mostly solo. After all, you charge, hamstring, rend, and only afterwards do you do other stuff.
---
In PvP you will take durability loss at a normal rate for hits taken and given, but you do not take the 10% loss from dying. You would have to get hit A LOT to equal 30% durability loss. That's literally the only thing I can think of.
---
I have some rage, and we need to pull them back to avoid a patrol anyway, so I pop FFF, and start taking slow steps back.
---
Wooosh!!! Warrior DPS charging past me...  thanks, dude.  That mob just stopped, the rest are still coming, and now ... well, we all know the rest of this story.
---
Lower population server means less supply = higher prices
---
This won't really work on a High/Full server
---
you walk, die or use hs
---
Except...ya know... repair bills...
---
I'm sorry but fishing right now tops EVERY other form of earning.  The winter squid have shown up.  Nothing will touch the GPH of winter squid for a couple weeks unless you exploit to get purples or recipes or something.
---
And... you were first :(
---
We all thought the same answer ;-)
---
Ive never been killed by this and i played plenty at lvl cap in retail so im not sure what id be "projecting".
---
Hey, /u/asmonsnippets might I redirect you to /r/Asmongold
---
Such is life in PVP vanilla
---
Then why are you confused DOT DOT DOT ?
---
mah dps...
---
I usually ae to get trash off another mage. Then Cone then nova.
---
That's to help the immersion.
---
&gt;Negligible and not quantifiable | See first comment
---
Very quantifiable.  If you cannot gauge opportunity cost, you cannot properly evaluate the value of any item in any economy.  As the goblins say, "Time is money, friend."  Think on the time involved to turn a BoE into gold.  Then come up with a monetary value for your time in game, such as fishing/grinding/questing/dungeons.  Such as, I can make 10g an hour fishing.  Thus each minute is worth 16s 66c.  Multiply your time spent on converting the BoE by your rate and you now have your opportunity cost for doing so.
---
&gt; You do not have to go out of your way to go to a major city or literally any mailbox. 
---
That's funny.  Because when I'm running SM back to back, going to a mailbox substantially cuts down on my gold/hour.  Or any other instance.  You are making the assumption that you are going to the mailbox and AH while it is convenient, which is an opportunity cost in and of itself.  Anytime you make a choice in economics, you have lost value.
---
&gt; It was 15g at the time of the roll for every player in the group. In your example I choose to expend that value by speculating the actual house unsuccessfully. Another example is a player exchanging that gold value for the utility of equipping that item. It does not matter what anyone does with the item after they win it. It was still worth market value at the time of rolling for every player. 
---
Incorrect.  If the net profit was 3g, it was 3g for everyone.  Sure, someone could have sold it for 10g first time but you can't factor that into your calculations, as that means the value for each person is different and that contradicts your statement of equipped = market.  Player A receiving 10g for said item and you receiving 3g for the items doesn't mean the market value for you is 10g.  It's 3g.
---
&gt; It is the only way to objectively measure the value of an item. 
---
Objectively measuring the value of an item is factoring in all aspects that detract or add to the cost of an item.  Saying the sky is blue is partially true and misses the instances where it isn't blue.  But it is simpler to say the sky is always blue while still being objectively wrong.
---
You still can't grasp the idea that achieving 100% value from an item is not how the 99% of the playerbase actually plays.  The majority of players don't cook all their food drops, sell all white/green/blue items on the AH, use vendor addons, or roll need on anything that drops.  The opportunity costs from doing all the above are more than the perceived value gained.  So it makes sense to vendor that stack of Clam Meat or to greed a Meteor Shard.  Simply because the effort to fully realize the cost is not worth the added currency.
---
But at the same time that's what made morrowind, Morrowind. Cause the flip side you get Skyrim which is basically TES with AAP lol
---
/r/gatekeeping to the maximum
---
Being in places you aren't supposed to be isn't actionable AFAIK. Only using them to gain an advatage is banned. So if you don't use it to avoid the guards, it shouldn't be an issue.
---
So you purposely want to play the game wrong? For nostalgia reasons? Which then effects other people?
---
Imagine showing up to a baseball game and insisting on using a plastic bat because you want to feel like a kid again. You hurt your team by handicapping yourself on purpose but hey, as long as you‚Äôre feeling nostalgic it‚Äôs ok?
---
"Pro aoe speed clear" mages are honestly worst then the huntards of old several hundred times over.
---
But there are so many more mages then huntards now. So fucking many.
---
&gt; I dont expect a tip when casting my heals. You shouldn't expect with for casting your spell that's free either
---
That's pretty meta of you to discuss how everyone is always discussing the meta
---
o man what are the addons exact names? I been looking for something like this! So many 60s been killing me lately I need to add to get back at them once I hit 60.
---
Yeah. Obviously it's a bit easier for Asmon than the average guild but it's an awesome group effort nonetheless.
---
Usually the people AOE farming are a little better though. I got in a group for SM cath that was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and it was so hard to stick it out. One mob at a time. Bickering, low dps, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll do anything but AOE farm. At least those people know how to play.
---
I can speak about DD, there is plenty of RP their, just have to know where to look.
---
Retail kids are ruining my runs. People keep thinking they know better than what 4 other people are telling them.  Be better dps and the posts will stop. =]
---
Well do you want longevity or burst? As a shaman you have zero ways to maintain mana regen in combat. Is 10mp5 going to be a game changer? Probably not.
---
I do not see how this is an issue. There are plenty of non aoe groups for every dungeon. You are the one pulling, so do not pull everything. If dps are fucking up, then address the issue or let them die. Also, getting a run done almost 10 mins faster in SM Cath is huge. Thats like half a run
---
At work now, but I‚Äôll do a deep dive tonight! Thanks for bringing this to my attention
---
U got ur ww axe now get fraps
---
Kinda confused...The map indicates OP is looking north into Ungoro, but the screenshot is just water. Is he actually looking south towards the ocean or is south "ungoro" really like this past the mountain range?
---
Stay mad retard. Enough people had to care about it to have a thousand people or more in attendance. Stay salty, mad and also extremely bad.
---
Homies straight up stalking my comments LOL. Bruh dont you have class to go to?
---
Good to hear! Mine was bought used, 2Gb. 1.86 available. Just getting a feel for what I may need to add, if anything!
---
Buddy, I was level 45 in the first weekend and rerolled early last week and am taking it slower on Heartseeker than Stalagg.  I'm almost level 30 on my new Druid and having a blast.
---
Best part about rerolling right now, is the starter zones aren't a giant cluster fuck of people trying to steal everything.  I got in and out so fast and it was wonderful.
---
good way for people to identify that you are a cheapskate ;)
---
Really though, you should tip something.  You don't go out of your way to heal your party, it's literally your purpose for being there in the first place.  Mages don't just exist to give you portals for free.
---
You're just full of salt, aren't you?
---
Well this is a multiplayer game with pvp elements. 40 yard nameplates has a huge impact on pvp.
---
It even has an impact to a lesser extent in pve. being able to clearly see nameplates beyond 20 yards makes it much easier to move around in the overworld and dungeons without pulling accidentally.
---
At level 40 I was involved in one of these groups for the first time over the weekend. I was the only mage but the tank was pulling 5-6 mobs in SM cath as long as he had rage. It was absolute chaos. I died four times in one SM run. It was cool to see my DPS like twice anyone elses but it wasn't really as fun as a clean, controlled run.
---
That dude that declined my group invite while killing a named quest mob made me so furious.
---
I didn't say anything about being negative about the fact it exists. I said **assuming** it was only "Boomers" that dislike the idea, is ridiculous. Tastes are less about generation, more about personal preference. You're assuming a shitload about who doesn't like the addon, and about my personal statement. Assume less.
---
XToLevel

My original main when I started playing (back in WotLK) was rogue and I loved that character so I decided to try it first in classic...... I quit at about level 22. While I hate the current rogue as it is just too self-sufficient, rogues in classic are just too much work and not very satisfying. We are supposed to be the ultimate melee damage dealers, but all I seem to do is miss. Every fight is miss, miss, parry, hit, miss, etc. Also, sapping getting you out of stealth is brutal, and while we have tons of great defensive cool-downs, I didn't pick a rogue because I wanted the best class at running away from a fight. I switched to a hunter and haven't looked back.
---
Best mage/warlock race. That 1% int is amazing.
---
I don't generally put Regrowth on myself because I just fall into the habit of staying in bear form conserving rage between pulls. But, I recognize how useful it is for boosting my threat.
---
I either spam swipe if I'm getting hit a ton, or tab between and Maul (which usually gets parried...) while keeping roars going.  I can't hold aggro against anyone higher level than me, especially shadow priests, unless my crits keep going (and that's a 15.6% chance)
---
edit: I don't have improved Enrage yet, once I do, I'd be able to shift and use furor to instantly have 20 rage while a HoT is going
---
Half the time on classic your pet won't listen to you. It stands where it is after mobs die before it decides to follow your return or attack command. It can't decide which way is what and will soon around mobs sometimes. The pet is just a huge liability in general just sucks it's half your damage as BM which leveling.
---
But the city is over
---
God bless you üò≠
---
Dude. Just click your mouse 10 times and stop crying. It takes you 30 seconds and you‚Äôre making money.
---
It's cause everyone abbreviates everything.
---
Tipping isn't bs you seem cheap online and off. You're tipping for a service. I tip higher sometimes if I'm flush but always keep it fair. At the end of the day you're just helping another player.
---
This GM probably doesn't even work "there"
---
Classic requires a lot of grinding. Grinding supplemented with quests is the fastest way to level from around 14-24 in my experience.
---
It is ironic...  I have always been a casual player, but I‚Äôve complained to my hardcore friends about the lack of imagination that used to happen.  There always seemed to be one set way to do things and if you didn‚Äôt want to conform you were ridiculed.
---
When I first heard of these AoE groups I thought ‚Äúgreat!  Some imagination for once!‚Äù  But your experience and several other posts make it sound like the problem is full circle...  the idea of ‚Äúmeta‚Äù rather than a group of casuals agreeing to what will work based on their combined play styles.
---
I will still be excited for different and unconventional approaches, but I wish the pressure to follow strict metas would be reduced
---
Oh, I thought you meant outside outside (like where the elite mobs weren't spawning). 
---
I got excited because I forgot to do those two quests when I ran WC over the weekend and didn't want to try and grind through all those elite mobs alone.
---
we have a pvp trinket now, it's called "Free Action Potion"
---
Yeah. But you will have to customize them yourself. Good luck dude :P Yeah the ui is really clean.
---
Is it safe to say with Horde having better PvP racials it may be easier to find good PvP oriented Horde guilds?
---
How do i get this axe as a dwarf warrior
---
As a healer the ones I‚Äôve been having the worst luck with are DPS warriors. Some are fine but some seem to have no idea how aggro works in a DPS context. Maybe I‚Äôve just had really bad luck though...
---
Want a portal somewhere? 
---
Guess you should of rolled a mage
---

---
I personally think the idea that ferals should go farm multiple MCP's for the effect is absolutely absurd.
---
My general advice to everyone right now is ‚Äúwait and see.‚Äù
---
You can make as much as 50-100g a day farming at level 60, possibly much more. Seeing as very few people have a level 60 character right now, the economy is still in its infancy.
---
So my general advice is: don‚Äôt sell on the AH yet. Give it a bit. Prices will naturally go up as more people reach high levels and begin to access far more cash. No point auctioning yet when your products are still priced much lower than their potential value.
---
It‚Äôs a buyer‚Äôs market right now. Personally I‚Äôve been buying up level 10-19 twink items for resale once battlegrounds are released. I found Feet of the Lynx on the AH for 3g yesterday. That‚Äôs 100g in a few months.
---
Slow and steady wins the race. I absolutely hate people, not just players - the actual person playing their character, that have this kind of personality. Unless you took the time to level a tank or level a healer shut the hell up and DPS. You have no say on this ride.
---
Lol I'll grind mobs from 44 to 60 dw
---
If someone loots and doesn't pick up the loot then anyone can loot it
---

---
I 2h tank LBRS/Strat/Scholo no problem. Get your first cycle of SS/WW off and group the pack, let the mage nova and take a step back between cleave swing timer to let the healer have some breathing room. By the time nova is done youve got a few priority targets dead/almost dead and you can DPS the rest with a taunt to get something off your healer or mage when needed.
---
Earthfury is fantastic. I transferred from Kromcrush and have been very happy. I found that unless you were considerably ahead of the leveling curve, the zones were overpopulated beyond belief on Kromcrush, even with layers. They've been better on Earthfury, though they still to tend to be pretty active. Getting groups is fairly easy and there are also plenty of people in SM/ZF/etc. 
---
One thing to consider is that the server is still growing. It's grown a lot in the two weeks I've been here. I haven't seen it hit high yet but it's consistently medium now. 
---
Anecdotally, I've found more success on the EF auction house than Kromcrush. When I first transferred, it was still really low on population but now that it's grown, the AH is great, but doesn't have the overstagnation that it did on the bigger servers. 
---
I am horde and I've been wondering if Alliance outnumber us. I've seen more Ally than horde in Tanaris and STV for sure. I'm in the mid 40s. The faction balance appears to be very healthy though. I haven't seen one side dominating the other on a consistent basis.
---
Doing (some) of this rn.
---
I should add as one more note that while tanking with a 1h and shield, generally faster weapons are considered better because of the smoother rage gains and the fact that weapon damage doesn‚Äôt affect your most common threat builder, sunder  armor. A faster weapon means that if your first attack is parried or misses, you‚Äôll have another one coming sooner so you‚Äôll get some threat up sooner and generate some rage sooner rather than just waiting a long time for the next swing to come in. Which is what I mean by a smoother rage generation. Less feast/famine.
---
Correlation ‚â† causation
---
So the stuff stays where i put it even after disabling? This does seem to solve the problem, but I haven't grouped yet to see if my moved party frames are still in the right spot.
---
I think I may stick with the Cat version because it's more useful in PvP... I don't mind healing and I'm pretty sure even the Cat HoTW is fine for raid heals (maybe not Tank Heals due to lack of Swiftmend though).
---
If they were doing this to NPC's sure. Who tf cares its robots. But it seems like people forget there are real people on the other side of those characters man. You aren't being a dick to robots you're being a dick to another human being.
---
One reason Hunter's are better, Or at least some of us are trying to be "Perfect group hunters" is to stand out / we know everyone expects badly of us from the old huntard stories.
---
It's been pretty amusing being whispered at the end of the 55+ dungeons 'Added you dude, a hunter who doesn't fuck up is a rare sight'
---
Nice. Yup just ensure you're at Max range and swap to the wand if it's going to be better DPS due to hit extending the cast time. Are you following a talent guide? Getting better crits due to shatter helps so much
---
If all of your free time is going to WoW, you're not taking care of yourself.
---
Im sure that option is already ingame, not sure if its Shift or Alt click the item you gonna buy.
---
Lol, I literally had an addon that let you play chess with other raid members that had the addon. People have been using addons since day 1.
---
The problem is most of them don't know how to play. They think they do but they don't to use the meme. 
---
They usually fuck up and die and then are like "WTF omg it works for streamers" etc etc
---
I found that people who play Classic are generally nicer overall (or maybe it's because I'm one of those rare specimans you call a tank, I dunno).
---
I remember running WC a few weeks back and my group was a bit underleveled for it (17s and 18s) and on our second wipe, the Druid healer apologized to me and gave me 15s (which was a lot for a level 18) for my repair bills.
---
I told him that he really didn't need to as I accepted the trade :)
---
Wake me up inside  
---
Call my name and save me from the dark  
---
Bid my blood to run  
---
Before I come undone  
---
Save me from the nothing I've become
---
Well, people knew boomkins and ferals and ele shamans and stuff were bad back in 2004, so I'm not sure what classic experience you're really talking about. Play what you want, but if your character is bad, you may not get the chance to do some things unless you get carried hard. And that's the classic experience.
---
True. We had a shadow priest and he kept telling us that he was sorry and what he can do. He was willing to do better. The warrior that we had kept charging mobs at the same time I did. There is such a race to be the best dps, smoother runs are better than being the best. Wipes cost time and money.
---
You must think these frostbolts just cast themselves.
---
The level of cognitive dissonance you live with is so great that it baffles my mind you are able to function.
---
Yeah it wasn‚Äôt until patch 2.3 that pets would rotate around to attack enemies in the back if they didn‚Äôt have agro
---
/me reading this out loud to my self
---
Problem yes. /nod
---
2 mages, "ok" lock. OOo... maybe I grouped with him, maybe he's talking about me. 
---
Oh noes, not me. I don't pull (on purpose).
---
/reply
---
 I might have tried to get the mage to do things like it should have been done, but no one was listening/reading. Things were sub par(non-AOE wise) but not a complete mess.
---
Yeah this isn't retail wow. Ret pally sucks in PVP
---
That wasn't in darkshore was it? Because I'm pretty sure I had the exact same problem with a quest in that zone.
---
You probably got downvotes for being "wrong," and I probably got downvotes for "correcting you." Or maybe there's just someone downvoting all the comments here.
---
No reason to get upset, I think some people just like feeling like their opinion has value, and that does it for them. Meh.
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
Is it though? 12 guilds ran by a single person isn‚Äôt really a group effort. A month after release and already a legendary.
---
The ammo the guards use is supposed to knockback. The problem is that the arena is too wide.
---
You could also Make and sell ammo for level 60 hunters
---
Edit: keep your eyes open for the schematic for Thorium Shells/Arrows
---
Except the two things are completely unrelated.
---
If you are in a dungeon as a healer, you have committed to healing and therefore are responsible to fill your role.
---
If you are out in the world, I have no expectation of you to heal and if I asked you to follow me around and heal me, I‚Äôd tip you.
---
At the end of a dungeon, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a courtesy of the mage to provide a portal for the group.
---
If you ask a mage to port you somewhere out in the world, they are providing a service and saving you time and money. The same could be said for a rogue opening a lockbox. A tip is deserved.
---
Yea, cause instead you get to fight with Warriors, Hunters and other Rogues for gear. 2 of those are top played classes. Lucky you.
---
Well I'm still only getting tipped 1g for crusader haha.
---
I'm not educated in this type of thing (economincs, business management, etc) but I'm assuming their profit margin is less now and therefore the ratio wouldn't be the same. I'm guess the more subscriptions the more profit. More profit can pay for having a higher GM:Player ratio.
---
As a healer I second this. I just want to have a good time. If you always push it to the degree that it requires full focus and attention all the time then it's just draining imo.
---
I think it's fun to alternate between pro mega cleave and normal groups. But I prefer normal ones.
---
It's because the rage cost is the same for all ranks.
---
Having fun with something and sharing it means we're attention whores
---
Yeah, I noticed these crafts as well, leather is dirt cheap on my realm. Sadly I don't have LW myself. For the barbaric tier, consider the possibility of disenchanting the one that uses 5 leathers and selling the mats on the AH. On my realm it's more profitable than vendoring.
---
Exactly! So give it to a class that would put it to use in PVP. Ret sucks.
---
Honestly, i really don't think Josh knew or foresaw the show would explode in popularity.
---
One of the best podcasts ever, not just for wow, of all podcasts. The guy (Josh) is Scott Johnson level good, but THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS Josh actually plays the game, where Scott hasn't played wow for years, but keeps the show rolling to keep the do-re-mi rolling.
---
Bottom line difference, Josh has passion for the game, same as all classic players do. Scott plays classic for 10 minutes, which??? makes him play retail again for the first time in YEARS, makes a bunch of low level alts, then is done with wow again. lmao.
---
Still who doesn't love Scott? Great guy. I just have his show on backup in case i need something to listen too, reserve show, which i rarely listen, and only recently as i wanted to know if he'd take the show classic or not, you know of a relevant interest again.
---
I know this will get downvoted, and I‚Äôm enjoying classic as much as the next guy, but it strikes me that classic is so broke that you need 23 addons to restore functionality and improve QoL.
---
So your advice is ‚Äúit‚Äôs easy if you know what to do!‚Äù.  Well thanks, I guess...
---
My advice to get 1000g per hour is to just know what to do and make sure to get multiple purple BOEs every couple of minutes by just doing the right things! It‚Äôs so simple!
---
My surface go plays wow perfectly fine when set to classic details.. runs at 60 fps and is pretty much locked there. It can crawl when maxed out but the difference in quality from classic to max is not very much for the performance hit you take. Shadows look better though.
---
Literally any laptop you'll find today at bestbuy or really anywhere should be able to play the game with ease.
---
Darkshore is the best! Doing Loch Modan -&gt; Darkshore -&gt; Loch Modan made the teens so easy to level through. I ended up not touching Westfall at all.
---
Lol, Leatrix Maps is miles better than Mapster.
---
UD: Sleep, charm, fear break every 2 min. Great to take on warlocks, and priests don‚Äôt get to keep that initial fear. 
---
Orc: 25% all the time resist stun, resist a clutch kidney shot and win the fight.
---
UD: Cannibalism, great for quick recovery, food bill and very personal when you gank someone and eat them.
---
Orc: Fucking mega burst 25% of attack power
---
-
---
Personally I would say orc for who I encounter and the challenges in the world, but it‚Äôs really up to what you value.
---
But very few are good mages, just gotta distinguish yourself
---
There is a pretty lucrative set up you can do in the settings to better value the item on whether it should be DE or sold to AH. 
---
One could say it be insider secrets.
---
I got to the last bar of 39 and stopped logging in, and I'm pretty burnt out, if I do  come back eventually I'll be able to resume at a milestone level.  I was a hunter in vanilla and now I'm doing it again as a flexible hybrid that pays my hybrid tax - my original druid wasn't made until TBC launched, and I never took it to older zones like LBRS and Stratholme as a result.
---
lol, fine, be a douche about it then. It sounds more like you're rationalizing it to yourself though.
---
Bre?
---
Or if you use the MoveAnything addon
---
Haha it happens! Nothing is scarier than a tank saying ‚Äúmy taunt missed‚Äù and vanish is down! I use a lot of energy on feints!
---
I often sell stuff in trade chat if it has nice stats. I DE worthless stuff like a 2h sword with spirit and agi.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard mix things and in beta there was an addon that allowed you to look further but blizz nixed that during the beta, iirc. So I‚Äôm curious as well
---
Edit: look further as in see nameplates from a lot further distances
---
I keep grouping with shaman healers that heal in melee range while dpsing mobs instead of purely healing like they're supposed to
---
That's not what was asked. The guy you responded to doesnt even want to click on the item, they just want the reagents to auto purchase. Kind of like how sell junk just auto sells your greys as soon as you open a shop.
---
I hope one day you have the ability to self-reflect.
---
What am I missing here? Why are you helping the enemy? Benedict Arnold your Great, great, great, great, great, grand pappi?
---
Aside from Overpower rend is your best damage per rage point ability until 36 when you get WW. You still use it from 36-40 because it's still a high damage per rage point. Once you get mortal strike you can stop using rend entirely. I believe the last rank of rend I bought was rank 4.
---
Rend is very useful before you get instant weapon strikes.
---
Look up /who and whisper every player to join your party. You will find people in no time
---
What he said\^  
---
It typically stands for the Best current item in the game for your class/spec in a specific armor/weapon/trinket/ring slot.
---
Roll ally scum!! Jk
---
LFG isn't a blizz channel.  Its a custom channel as well.
---
I love Titan Panel. It's working great for me. I get the old school nostalgia when I see it.
---
I guess you could, but in my experience HC raiding guilds like that tend to not care too much about PvP, plus all their warriors are almost certainly going to be specced for DW fury or Prot.
---
Cuz 3 mages doing a good job aoe spamming dungeons will clear much faster than rogues
---
I personally prefer AdiBags to Bagnon, of anyone out there is finding they dislike how Bagnon works.
---
Priests and mages for me. Initially a lot of rogues but not anymore. I went hunter just because I see so many damn clothies. Shamans and druids I barely see, and yeah now I‚Äôm starting to see more warlocks.
---
Iirc there was a minor glyph to reduce the cast time of Hearthing while in bubble because they had reduced the duration of bubble from 12 seconds to I think 8.
---
Ok. Have fun today you deserve it!
---
1 hour transport+2 hours food+ 1 hour cleaning +8 hours of work (full time) + 7 hours playing + 8 hours sleeping = 27 hours.
---
While you aren‚Äôt wrong that you can play 7 hours a day with a full time job. You can‚Äôt do everything you said you could while working 8 hours and playing 7 and sleeping 8.
---
Most of them are not scums and are happy to give away some food,I had mages trading me free food by only saying hi.
---
What server are you on?? I've literally never seen a cleave group on my server, I had to make a group once made up of me and 2 mages for dps to try it.
---
Every single dungeon i see advertised, and every one ive ran has been a standard, pull 1 - 3 adds at a time type deal
---
I'll add Leatrix Plus and Leatrix Maps, simple and effective to change a few minor things.  But great list, I'll definitely check a few out.
---
Do you have 200 hours?
---
And perhaps the ability to become immune to any and all damage.
---
That's pretty great
---
durrr nO cHaNgEs deeeeeerp

Man watching the server struggle and the anvil trapping him were crazy as well.
---
What is it with kids and the immediate "u mad?  Triggered!  Lol get troll'd" they pull out whenever they get called out online?  For seriously, give relaxing a try, it might be good for you.
---
Yeah I just checked, journeyman's backpack is going for 90s on my server. OP's guide is only for his server and no one elses
---
Also, smaller to see. I've had a few close calls from some not too bright horde players where I hid behind a rock or some bushes and sat down. They walked right on by.
---
Try Dominoes. I think you can set up action bars and profiles for specific classes.
---
It's an excellent add-on. I use it daily, even near hourly.
---
Could I of used recording on the PC? Sure. Did I take this with snapchat to send to my buddies? Sure did. 
---
I'm personally enjoying the tilt this is causing people that its recorded with a phone.
---
I don't think you're likely to get anyone smart enough to work out their own profitable flips to post details about them on a public forum.
---
Otherwise, there's plenty of guides/basic ideas hidden in Google.
---
No one. You seem to be tilting at windmills, and I'm asking why?  
---
And don't call me boy.
---
Or by drinking restorative potions :D

You work 56 hours a week buddy?
---
I went with 35 for full time, that's an average of 5 hours a day. Obviously you would play more on weekends and less on week days, but it would even out to 5 hours of work a day.
---
I've had the opposite problem, my dps shamans I've grouped with have been great, and my healers think they're some sort of dps/offheal. No bitch you're the healer, stop letting me (tank) die when you have half your mana bar left cause you're trying to save it for dps spells. Just fucking stop.
---
Here's the secret: both those posts have the same sentiment.
---
I might not normally go to the bathroom for many hours after I wake up, but if I drink a cup of coffee in the morning I'm on the rim within 10 minutes.
---
You can't for other players and NPCs. For mobs, it's in the blizzard interface options to display number, percent or both.
---
ArkInventory seems to be really good.
---
You can organize it how you want it, and it allows you to look at the inventories of other characters you have on that server.

He's currently the top WoW streamer, gets about 80-100,000+ viewers ever since classic has released.
---
He did seem mad tho
---
 But what makes classic good is everyone not looking the same üò≠üòÖ
---
Filthy casual trash. Quality of life is what ruined wow. That's what this is all about and why we have classic again. Having a game without extra stuff that makes the game less consuming and more fun. Imagine complaining that a video game isn't convenient enough. Filthy pleb, uninstall right now. Excuse me while I go enjoy the better social experience that vanilla provides from the comforting darkness of my mom's basement. Disgusting casuals. Nyeh!
---
Oh word, appreciate it!
---
Look up about 5 comments, you asked someone the same thing and they answered
---
I swear I have no idea how some people can get to 60 with 300g-600g in their bags. When I dinged 60 on my hunter, I didn't even have the money to buy all my skills. Took me a few mor hours of farming to buy the last few ranks of aimed shot, multi shot etc. and then I stood there with 5g in my bags.
---
I picked mining and engineering and leveled up both professions during the grind. Never bought anything on the auction house. The opposite even. I tried making some money by selling Bronze Tubes and Gyrochronatoms (you need those for a quest on Alliance side). It worked out for exactly one day, where I was able to sell 20 Bronze tubes for 25 silver each. But then, the rest of the pack caught up with me and more people started flooding the Auction House with Bronze Tubes and the price plummeted in just a few hours down to 2 silver per tube at which point you were better off just vendoring them.
---
This is true for literally everything in the game. Each and every item was unsellable on the AH because it was flooded with everything in abundance. Only the Stranglethorn Pages where a decent money maker where I could sell one for \~25s each.
---
I guess I never got rich from leveling because I tend to quest a lot instead of grinding. I imagine that all those mages that AoE grind their way to 60 without doing any quests get much, much richer since they kill a lot more stuff, thus having a lot more trash to vendor.
---
I remember trying to figure out how to make Carbonite work during TBC and front really confused because that addon had so many friggin options that guy have to manually set up (or at least it used to). This was before addons became more universally known and user friendly.
---
Hmmmm?
---
I think he means someone in their 20s or 30s should know how to record their screen.
---
If my Grandma did it, I'd give her a pass.
---
This gave me flaskback to a hunter last week... every singe pull. He either pulls, with or start multishooting right after I pull. Guess who then need to run around trying to gather mobs. Guess who dies. Guess who complains. Guess what tank say fuck it after 3 wipes to that BS and his BS in chat, and leaves.
---
Some people are just to flipping stupid to understand how tanking works in classic. You don't have infinity threat on everything by just looking in their general direction. Rage is a thing! Yes, we go faster if you just hold off a bit in the beginning. Yes, taunt has a 10-20% miss chance due to being a spell, with no partial resists and often level difference. Don't count on it to save your stupid ass. If you pull stuff, I will let you die and I do ask healers not to heal you.
---
How much was it going for?
---
Bloodfury is 25% of your ***base*** attack power, so it doesn't scale with your gear. It's not really quite as strong as many people make it out to be and the heal debuff can make bandaging and potioning after popping it a problem. I'm not a huge fan of it, personally.
---
It‚Äôs insane, props to the folks that run it. 
---
I‚Äôm glad they increased their prices (doubled) because last I heard they earned like 14g per Uber operator for 9hrs of operating time.
---
To add perspective, I ran ~5 SM Lib pickpocket runs. 7m15s/run, 1-1.2g/run including sellables from junkboxes. That‚Äôs ~8.5 to 10g/hour.
---
Except not. He said they couldn't pay the tier 1 guys more because of engineers (which is stupid) so they hired non-techs who don't value their skills as highly.
---
As a warlock leveling up if I run a dungeon what should my rotation be? Should I not use curse of agony?
---
In my experience talents don‚Äôt mean anything yet. I‚Äôm tanking and healing in cat spec just fine. Shit my guilds best healer is a shadow priest right now but he kills it.
---
There is a miscommunication somewhere. 2H tanks are NOT wanted. Every healer ive met hates it. People talk about 2h tanks holding threat like shit. Mind telling me how this concept made its way into mainstream so hard? Im assuming a streamer said it was cool?
---
General work week is 5 days at 8, granted not every job but I was illustrating that during the work week you couldn‚Äôt do half of what you said buddy.

---
A bit more context. There's a jump you can do as you navigate the hills around the Frostmaul Giants in Winterspring. I failed the jump, falled to my death, and found out I'm not the only one who missed it.
---
That sounds like a complete waste of time, to be honest.
---
Until you're making profits in levels of Gold, not copper/silver, it's probably just best to go about your day as usual.
---
Later on you can buy out BOEs that are drastically underpriced, or even just moderately, and make 5, 10, 50+ gold.  Same with common artisan level crafting mats etc.
---
But cloth seems to be the wrong spot to go, as there's always hundreds or thousands available on the AH.
---
The formula is simple
---
Final boss level = X
---
Tanks &gt;= x-1
---
DPS &gt;= x-2
---
Healer &gt;= x-3
---
He's at 12d13h total. Which is over 11 hours a day.
---
To be fair there are probably people who dwarf his playtime.
---
What changes specifically made this popular?  I never remember seeing "spellcleave" advertised for in vanilla.  At the very least, not in the mass that it is now.
---
It‚Äôs cuz your guild is probably geared and filled with experienced people that know what they‚Äôre doing. A lot different for new and returning players running raids with those that have never done it before, which will be a significant part of player base. Need shield and 1h for raids with most people.
---
The issue comes from players trying to emulate what they're seeing, without fully understanding the how / why. They just do it. Shroud's favored loadout for the CoD beta over the weekend works really well for his playstyle but some random dude might pick it up and think it sucks.
---
No, you can find guides for all
---
Plus one of the best racials in the game is the gnome racial
---
Nothing you said is of much help.  The majority of tanks know all this, they know how they get threat, they know what their skills do, they know when their supposed to use them... the problem isnt the tanks in classic. 
---
Its the dps.  They open up too fast and too hard on every single pull.
---
Los pull?  Forget it, the dps has attacked every single mob 2-3 times before they even reach the tank. Los pull fail.  Casters never ran to the tank melee are running all around toward dps.
---
Yeah obviously getting sunders up and getting revenge off is priority, but we can't sunder shit or revenge without rage.  Can't get 6-9 sunders up on 3 mobs within 3 seconds, literally impossoble.  Oh and you dont actually even have 3 second to get them off, you have less than 1 second because the dps is already going full on dps on multiple mobs.
---
Mark targets huh?  9/10 the dps just ignore that.
---
Hunters multi shotting on their open attacking the second warrior pulls.
---
Mages blizzarding and arcane explosioning
---
Warlocks hellfiring
---
Warrior charging in with tank cleaving and whirlwinding their asses off
---
The dps is opening up with all these things instantly sometimes before the tank has even gotten a hit off.  Its impossible for a tank.
---
It's a problem every single run.  Dps doesn't care they just wanna go fast and top the meters.  So hectic pulls with mobs running all over is simply the norm unless you're running with friends or guildies who wanna wait 5 seconds or so before they do anything more than auto attack.
---
That's just the way classic is, yeah it sucks, but you can't tell the dps anything.  They dont wanna hear it.  Your bad tank or hectic pulls are fine.  I've literally heard dps say it's fine if they're being attacked they're not paper they can take the hits the healer will keep them up.
---
Dps players are completely oblivious to how their shit plays affects tanks and healers, and if they're not they simply don't care
---
you can't see players health with that addon, it's a database of estimates based on the users damage done to particular mobs
---
I didn't tilt at all. All I said was "don't let the negativity get you down, I appreciate the addon." You're the one who decided to start a fuss about what was supposed to be a positive comment.
---
boy.
---
somewhat same boat, i got to lvl 45 in vanilla but gave it up when I went off to college. I was playing in bed and laughed when a gnome in dun morough waved to me after I healed him and I showed my girlfriend "wait thats another real guy online? Can you wave back??" - the magic is still there!

If you want to do it yourself use Skull of Impending Doom, you‚Äôll die but take no durability loss.
---
Ive been declined for SM Cath runs as a healer at lvl 34. This post should hopefully be illuminating for all level ranges
---
because where else are you gonna see hundreds of people gather together to do stuff server wide?
---
Ah wow, thanks for the detailed breakdown I hadn't heard of a lot of that.
---
Yeah, sounds pretty rough, definitely sub-optimal compared to lock/hunter, and much more difficult than PServers.
---
Okay 40 hours a week instead of my 35. That gives you 40 mins of less sleep a night.

Weekends exist too mate and that makes up for the week days you play less.

Oh you can write macros!

We don't give warnings. We let you die and kick you out.
---
Im definitely starting to see this more and more. What‚Äôs worse, is it‚Äôs not even people who have to log off for real life things but people who leave at the slightest inconvenience because the group isn‚Äôt 100% efficient. Have had people leave when trying to form a group because it took more than 5 min to find a tank, or we do find a tank but because he wasn‚Äôt already in SM and had to fly up from booty bay the healer leaves. 
---
Last night was getting an SM cath group together and one of the guys asked if we could detour to kill houndmaster since he had yet to do for quest. Everyone was 40+ so it literally took 3 min to do but the tank wasn‚Äôt willing to waste his time for it so he left. 
---
Feel like LFG function definitely spoiled people.
---
Oh no 100% agree. If I'm running Ulda w/a guild grp we do it the norm way. If I'm pugging we do it the stair strat way. Can't tell you how many times DPS get tunnel vision and I have to bring the boss over to a mob just so they'll switch targets.
---
I have both a level 60 mage and a level 60 rogue and that is just horseshit. Rogue and mage clearspeed are nowhere comparable. 
---
Yes, rogue have good clear speed and it is comparable to a mage group wiping a lot or failing. A mage group that successfully pulls off aoe pulls has an uncomparable clear speed.
---
The US average price is 5g-8g, that's probably why.
---
Way too many people post things for 3x what they're probably worth, and hope for the best.
---
Did a BRD yesterday with two rogues and a mage, smoothest fucking run in my life.
---
I said one of lol
---
Names aren't visible through terrain and walls. Nameplates are.
---
Glad the topic is being discussed a bit rather than dismissed by #NoChanges every 10 seconds :P I‚Äôll check this out on my commute home! Thanks!
---
I didn't use health bar add-ons back in vanilla, just built in ones and don't remember having this issue.
---
Ssshhhhh alot of people doesn't know this.
---
It has saved me a couple of times
---
This sounds like heaven compared to the SM group I was in the other night. We had 3 arms warrs, a shaman, and a priest (me). They would start pulling while at 50% hp and I'm still almost oom. Surprisingly only a couple of them died, but it was stressful as hell on my end just to keep us afloat.
---
If a rogue doesnt use evasion he isnt giving the warrior free crits.
---
Overpower chunks rogue HP - Ive seen them drop in 2.
---
Whaatttt that's first thing i do when i get home then. I didn't try it myself, given the confidence of both GM's saying it wasn't possible to use the book currently. Thanks for replying to my comment
---
how is elemental shaman in world pvp?
---
- Posted at work
---
Because nameplates show through terrain, names do not. This allows for people on pvp servers to actually hide behind terrain and setup ambushes.  
---
You can even hide in a bush, provided you can be sure your name is inside it as well. Enemy players won't see you until they're right up on you. Arguably it's more realistic for PvP scenarios.
---
I bet all of you ‚Äúdead server people‚Äù don‚Äôt even know what that means. Please, enlighten me because all I see are people to play with.....
---
My parents used to beat me with a bag of these if I acted up. Takes me back.
---
There are just a whole bunch of bad tanks out there. It's even more obvious now with classic wow. Retail is just more forgiving with bad tanks and is easier to tank. Just find a few good warrior tanks and stick with them! 
---
How do I know? well I am leveling since the start together with a priest and communicate a lot, and switch between 2h and shield/1h depending on the fight, but if I main tank, I am always in defensive stance to keep aggro and most of the time works unless there is a big level difference or all DPS just focus on their own target. The priest never had the threat over me in the dungeon.
---
I see, I always assumed I was helping by putting less pressure on the tank (and consequently, the healer) since the pet is surprisingly durable, but it definitely makes sense that things would seem chaotic for the other players.
---
DELETE WHAT LUL
---
I leveled enhance in vanilla and I remember that if I came across the opposing faction, I felt confident I could kill them even if they were up to 8 levels higher than me. But I'm not sure what the difference is between windfury when I was leveling and windfury in patch 1.12. A sweet proc was the key.
---
Yes, sorry, it's apparently only casters. I am noob. Fear not melee!
---
Make an alt &gt; grab mining while you level &gt; accumulate enough ore for main &gt; send it over &gt; ??? &gt; profit from rested exp and a free alt instead of wasting time in low level zones
---
Ah, so he is a last resort.
---
Edit: Wait a second, I see at least a dozen other accounts streaming Classic WoW right now in English. Confusion persists
---
You sell ports to people in an instance group with you?  That seems really scummy, I always dropped a port at the end of a dungeon without being asked.
---
They could also macro weapon swap so that if they're stuck in melee they can switch to a strong melee weapon and switch back to the +agi one when they regain range control. Might be too much effort for marginal gain though.
---
Dang when my wifes account got hacked they restored all the gear that was sold, gave her more gold than what she had before by a bit. Plus they left like her whole inventory full of the thorium and gems the hacker had been using her account to farm with.
---
Sort of contradicted yourself with the first 2 points lol.
---
Ok if it wasnt brand new, sure. Fair. But I'm sure its safe to say a lot of people didnt know of it till now. Also we're talking about Classic, not Wrath. Keep in the lane.
---
Easier solution: put an invisible wall around it and extend it to the top of the skybox.
---
No its really not. You are expecting the same tip as someone crafting high level gear. Get over yourself and learn to farm.
---
54s if you get the food/water combo from argent dawn
---
Sulfuras as well. The number of times I've seen 45-50 Alli camping Mirage Raceway makes up for any perceived slights in SM.
---
Thank you, I knew about the Everlook spot but didn't know where it was located, i'll add it to the OP
---
not always in range, depending on speed can also be slower.
---
Free action pots are super cheap on most realms. I personally fish and craft my own but they're dirt cheap. Keep a stack on your for mages and just worry about kicking the polymorph so they dont try to wait for your free action pot to end.
---
Priests are tough in general. The low rank rage pots are nice and cheap to grab. I'd just use sunder on the priest so you're doing more consistent damage trying to break through the shields but generally you lose that match.
---
anything with armor and stamina
---
Man, I remember I was playing Sims Online religiously before WoW came out when I was like 12 or 13. I had a couple million dollars on that from over the years but when I wanted to play WoW my parents said I had to cancel my Sims Online sub. So before I cancelled it I went to a couple small properties. One guy was very nice and welcomed me in and asked if I needed anything. We talked for a while and he was cool. So I gave him all my money.
---
He flipped out and went crazy thanking me up and down asking if he could do anything for me. I told him I'm quitting the game and to just pay it forward, whether it was in the game or irl. He was so thankful and I felt amazing making someone so happy. Always a great feeling.
---
Now if someone could just do that to me for WoW Classic....
---
What is this? Anti-mage propaganda?
---
Sir this is a Wendy's
---
I always pay 50 silver for mage water on my lock ... lol
---
Haha, excellent counter point. I do enjoy the cleaving of Arms. My guild group was blown away in that Ulda run.
---
OMEGALUL
---
**Best Race for Horde Fury Warriors? Orc or Tauren? And Why?**
---
I‚Äôm not sure if there is an equivalent for the horde tbh lol
---
If you're a mage and you think you need a warrior to spellcleave, your bad at being a mage and shouldn't be running spellcleave groups in the first place.
---
Yeah the pole really depends on the server, I sold them for around 90s :/ 
---
But I regret not checking neutral AH, I'm sure it goes for more on there to save Allies the trouble. One of the better poles for them IIRC
---
It dumbs it down in that you no longer have to choose a spec. You can swap it whenever you want. There's no need for a hybrid build because you can main spec twice.
---
Don‚Äôt judge, ok? You want who you want.
---
For combat text: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24962-MikScrollingBattleTextClassicquickfix.html
---
For predictive healing on the raid frames try HealComm. It used to be on Curse but it's gone and I don't know why.
---
Yeah, you would need so sit there and do nothing until you have built up 55 total rage (30 rage to pop SS, then 25 to Whirlwind). It's not a very long time, being in zerker stance with your 2 hander would give you tons of rage. But also tons of damage intake, which means that healer would likely heal you pretty quickly. 
---
But at the same time, if he heals you too quickly (before WW combo and shout), all the adds would instantly jump on the healer. It's a pretty risky gamble, in my opinion. But with admittedly a good payoff.
---
Growl takes threat from a tank. Unhappy tank might just let you or your pet die, and your healer might think along the same lines. (Not only is it dangerous, but it is thunder stealing and healer mana wasting)
---
KNOW your role in a dungeon is not to be the center of any mob's attention.
---
Shaman were not supposed to be a dps class.  They were a support class.
---
&gt; If you‚Äôre demanding payment, it‚Äôs no longer a tip.
---
Yes. That's the point.
---
&gt;If you demand a tip around the same value as I can get from a vendor, I‚Äôll spend my gold there on stuff that doesn‚Äôt go poof when I log out.
---
Please tell me what vendor sells lvl 45 water for 20s/stack.
---
Probably shouldn't even have a discussion about it. Just say bro we aren't going to do this.
---
I left retail years ago because of this. I prefer taking some time and clearing a dungeon methodically. I do have to deal with iccassional people in PUGs that want to chain pull everything and AoE, but actually most have been pretty good letting me set the pace as a tank.
---
That said, I still tank runs mostly with guildies and we're all on the same page.
---
&gt; owns a functional guild.
---
the streamers have multiple guilds even
---
You've misunderstood either what op has said or what this guy has said.
---
Don't listen to that dude. I've been in so many groups where shit just went crazy in a pull, and inevitably everyone gets aggro and mana starts draining out of you like you sprouted holes.
---
When things are going slow and/or smooth, my paladin healer is over 75% mana all the time. When things are all over the place (like pulling a boss with six mobs on accident), I feel lucky if we don't all die. I'll admit that triage healing is a learned skill, but even then...it doesn't mean you won't run out of mana. Yeah I can keep the tank alive, but if he's getting hit like a truck and the DPS are out of mana or dead, it'll still be a wipe.
---
I don't know where you buy your 45 water, but where I come from 1 water costs about 8s (a 5-stack is 40s on average), so 5 stacks of level 45 "regular water" would be 8 gold.
---
I personally tip 1g for a full trade window of 45s. I'm 60, 1g is literally your average grey trash drop, and 120 food/water will last me a whole day of solo farming and a couple of dungeons.
---
I pug dungeon a lot all the way up to 50, and more than half of those runs were basically 4 dps and a healer. 
---
I see more warrior tanks with a 2hd than sword and shield. It is pretty toxic as mobs go everywhere, but when he's doing triple the dps on almost every pull, the run becomes just as fast if not faster than a regular group as long as the healer can handle it. Even worse is when you have more than one warrior. They will race each other to the next group of mobs to get aggro for more rage.
---
I frigging hate it.

Thank you.!
---
Everyone I know is bulk buying twink gear that gets posted cheap lol, it's one of the better investments available right now. I've made about 150g simply upselling duplicates. 
---
I've finished a full set, and a half set for 70g. Shit that cost me 700g+ in vanilla and I'm not the only one, loads of people rebuying the 5g assassin's blades to resell at 100g, etc.
---
Ehhhh?
---
Not really.
---
Maybe the hardcore people did, but most people were terrible and didn't know.
---
Also - you could have an entire raid made up of goofball specs and be fine.  Raiding in classic wasn't finely tuned by any means.
---
(My vanilla raid team was about 3/4 from my dorm floor...we weren't exactly top tier and we cleared up through AQ40  before people broke up).
---
blizzarding 2 mobs gives better dps than frostbolts unless they crit a lot, even though i cast it only on free casts to savedowntime between pulls
---
Oh! Never checked him out, only Towellie on rare ocasions. But I guess people are attracted to arrogant sob
---
I live for threads like this when OP thinks they have a valid point and everyone ends up disagreeing with them.
---
META players are 95% new players. New players are the ones looking up "How to level fast", "Best way to level" etc. So just keep that in mind when ever you see cleave groups advertising in world chat. All the experienced players who ran cleave are already 60. 
---
Now you're left with the new players who, have gained (game)experience in regards to cleave groups through all runs they've done up to what ever level they are. But in essence that's where their knowledge of the game stops.  
---
Overall mechanics and fundamentals of the game will be lacking.
---
Can we sticky this?
---
I think your gfx card overheated.
---
Spirit &gt; intellect = stamina.  I wouldn't worry about the stats so much until you are in your late 20s though.  If you have those wands I posted above you are going to melt through mobs so quickly that stats are mostly irrelevant at low levels.
---
One other thing you should consider though is getting a decent pair of boots and putting the run speed enchant on them.
---

UNGORO Mafia is a huge gold mine. It was inevitable people would pull this tactic from pservers.
---
I get a bunch of unkwown skill spam when I log in with MSBT, I tried looking in the settings but I can't find it. Any ideas on how to disable them, perhaps?
---
that server friends one reminds me - is there an addon that will list your WoW friends ABOVE your battle.net friends? I hate having to scroll all the way down just to see people i've added in game
---
That's awesome. I'm glad you're playing and enjoying with friends and family. Props to you good sir.
---
Yea. I was a huge GW2 player and everything you loot has a chance to drop one of the most coveted and expensive items in the game (a legendary precursor). Even there some people didn't loot everything.
---
It taught me to always loot though. Even with a full inventory I take a look to see what I can trade out to always have the highest value inventory possible.
---
Water is part of what a mage contributes to a group, and it only costs them mana.
---
Heals are part of what a healer contributes to a group, and it only costs them mana.
---
So if a mage is going to charge me for part of their group duties I will repay them with the same courtesy.
---
Thanks for info
---
SAVED
---
This is so silly.
---
I can't wait to add it to my mage when I get home :D
---
Sometimes I wish I could dispel the ice block.
---
That doesn't really mimic how damage text looks though, right? It just scrolls your output on the side?
---
What did hunters do in vanilla that warrants all the hate. I literally had to deal with a full clear ulda run last night and listen to a mage nitch about me all run long (I'm a hunter). My pet never pulled, I feigned as soon as I'd get threat, I FD freeze trapped pulls that got out of hand, I toggled pet taunt on and off to peel for healers. 
---
I personally feel like I carried the hell out of that dungeon but got shit on the entire run like the reason it was taking so long wasnt cuz the tank was under leveled and couldn't hold aggro or wasnt cuz the mage cast blizzard the second the tank pulled every group or not cuz the healer went oom halfway thru every boss fight but because I was playing a hunter. 
---
The only time I deserved a tiny bit of flack was the last hallway where the tank couldn't hold aggro even if I held back 10 seconds so I left my pet taunt on and just disregarded whatever our tank was trying to do cuz my pet tanked better at that level of dungeon mobs. But even then, if the tank isnt holding aggro hunter is one of the first classes expected to step up and off tank. 
---
Wtf gives.
---
Want to see a long hike? How about Thunderaan from Silithus to Orgrimmar?

Mage shouldnt be aoeing 3 mobs anyways, it just pulls aggro off a tank, really a 1 mage group shouldnt do any aoe except for special cases. You really need atleast 2 mages so you can chain frost nova, and again, frost bolt is better for 3 mob pulls anyways (generally).
---
He‚Äôs probably like 16 and that‚Äôs all he does. 
---
That‚Äôs all I was doing when in Vanilla when I was 16 lol. No shame.
---
Big shock that the people who voluntarily GM are socially inept and incapable of normal human thought.
---
Sorry but ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt afford to offer you career growth‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid reason for anyone to stay in a dead end job. If you don‚Äôt offer competitive wages and growth opportunities, you can‚Äôt be surprised/angry when you have high turnover because you‚Äôve made it incredibly easy for people to find better offers.
---
I feel like you've never seen an actual rainbow ...
---
Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica.
---
Forgot to mention: CoWeakness is really useful on some bosses if the tank is getting crushed. 
---
To be a really good warlock you really need to figure out what curse is best in the situation and use that, and spam shadowbolts typically. (Endgame specs for warlock is either Shadow Mastery + Ruin, or Demonic Sac + Ruin, with shadowbolt spamming)
---
So to explain further the curse choices:
---
CoWeakness - lowers boss damage. Helps tanks out if they are a bit undergeared/lower level.
---
CoElements - lowers elemental resistances on boss, to increase mage damage. (Typically, mages will outdamage you, they are all in on being a damage dealing vending machine)
---
CoShadows - increases shadow damage taken by the boss. Useful if there are multiple sources of shadow damage (such as a shadow priest + you, or 2 warlocks)
---
CoRecklessness - increases boss damage but lowers their armor (thus increasing their physical damage TAKEN), great when there's multiple melee or hunter + melees in the group. But tanks will get hit a bit harder so be warned! (With that said, dungeons are a bit harder than private server benchmarks, but raids are laughably under what we have been practicing on for 10 years)
---
Just find your people!
---
I moved from Firemaw to Earthshaker, havent looked back. Even a medium pop realm has enough players for a vital community, and no queues ever. Gehennas are gonna be unplayable when layers are gone.
---
I have played on multiple pservers in the past with mining.
---
If you are used to that kind of mining, this is not gonna be anything like it.
---
There are less nodes per zone and instead of RTVs being consistently 4-5 hits they are 2-5.
---
So while the technical drop rate of crystals may be the same, limited node spawns and limited hits per node makes them much more scarce.
---
Ive been mining 1-8 hours a day for two weeks or so, and only have 13 crystals.
---
You could start a character on his faction, if it‚Äôs a pve server. You would clearly catch up and then could play at a rate to pace him on your alt. This isn‚Äôt possible on a pvp server.
---
If you‚Äôre intent in this, I guess at 30 you could hang around each other in STV or Shimmering Flats to do some quests, but that‚Äôs a few hours play at most. The areas where both factions get the same quests from say the goblins are pretty spread out.
---
I guess go meet up somewhere in the barrens such as Ratchet, realize you can‚Äôt even speak the same language, you can‚Äôt group so you can‚Äôt share quest credit even if you did have the same quest,  and realize it‚Äôs not really worth it. Get it out of your system.
---
I would also suggest respecing to swordspec until you get a better axe.
---
When you get the illustrious Windfury Swordspec proc/double crit you can damn near 1 shot elite mobs.
---
Im a 47 rogue so i may be biased, but my melee cleave groups have been the best groups ever. Rogue, shammy, and warriors DPS. No one has a ton of aoe so no one wants to pull alot. On top of that the war and rogue doesnt use mana so you can impressively chain pull. 
---
My mage groups on the otherhand have been frustrating. Mages beg for aoe pulls, tank abides, mage frost novas and mobs instantly turn on me. So i usually only do one run in these kinds of group before peacefully leaving.
---
That's the beauty of Classic. Just a simple time investment will get you to your goals.
---
.... is there one that doesn‚Äôt change the way the game is played but *does* change the way it looks?
---
Quests are there to contextualize the grind.  Instead of saying "Go Kill 40 Boars" to gain a level, they say "Go Get 10 Boar Hearts" and then give the Boar Hearts a 25% drop rate.  A simplification, obviously, but thats the general gist of it.
---
Pretty sure I read somewhere that they would stop free transfers on the 23rd, which is today, just a heads up
---
Are you going for the true classic experience of 512 MB of RAM?
---
Who cares about memory
---
This is why they gave guards bows that have a knockback to knock people down off the roofs sometime in TBC.

Spectre's blade is faster but has basically the same damage range and higher dps.

It should be obvious I mean when you are in a dungeon group together.

Cool, much appreciated.

I did a few quests with a priest I met around lvl 20 and their wand does ridiculous dmg. Just shield and wand. Then spriest is sick

Heal ZF in shadow until 51/52 then switch to your 60 build and heal brd till 58 and then Lbrs until 60

It's off topic for classic wow, but I'll give it a shot ...
---
Honestly, I started with a used G27 that came with the shifter and a wheel stand pro for 300CAD$. It doesn't have to be that expensive to start. 
---
Now, going DD and everything ... that costs a pretty penny.
---
Twitch Mod Section? Are you referring to Curseforge through the Twitch App?
---
I'll be doing that as soon as I can. Just need to verify the addon will work through those means after some alterations and get it uploaded and approved.
---
No, he can now begin playing the game.
---
go to the warrior discord. the idiots on this subreddit dont know shit.
---
I've seen warriors looking for tank more than dps.
---
The /who command has a limit of 50 results.
---
Good points! Will keep that in mind next time :) I am level 36 at the moment and mostly use the different ranks of the Heal skill and barely touch Lesser Heal. Is Lesser Heal better than let‚Äôs say rank 1 Heal?
---
Not to mention thinking the only viable class to play from there on out is a mage. God forbid they actually play and enjoy a class that's not used as a leveler. Gonna be rough times when they roll a rogue alt and realize how slow regular leveling is and that there are more than 5 zones.
---
It's not really a "skill", it's just not pushing buttons (i.e. sitting there doing nothing), that's not really all that fun.  IMO, it's one of the reasons I've just stopped running dungeons all together.   It's a huge time sink to get into a group as DPS, get to the dung, fight through the adds and any alliance in the area, only to spend 45 mins mostly auto attacking with little interaction with most my abilities otherwise I'll pull threat or go OOM 5 secs in and have to spend 15 secs drinking.   It's incredibly boring, where most the skill is simply getting into a group.
---
I didn't play vanilla, started playing in wrath (through Mop).   I think the reason why everyone said people talk more in dungeons is because most of the time you got nothing else to do if you're playing them "the right way" (i.e. pulling one mob at a time, etc.)
---
TIL wow has different "violence" levels oO
---
Why are you insulting me?
---
ah yes, because frostbolt spamming quest mobs designed to disguise the fact that classic wow is mostly a grind anyway is TONS more fun
---
Depends, can they fight back?  It‚Äôs not  simply drowning them, it‚Äôs taking their ability to fight back and killing them.
---
It would be just as gruesome to MC someone and have another player stab them to death, like running them into their own capital city and letting the guards do it.
---
That‚Äôs not pvp cause there‚Äôs no true ‚Äúverse player‚Äù here.
---
When I did vanilla I was a little late to the party and took a long time to level. Most of the way up to 60 I was pretty sure I wasn't going to be raiding, and honestly had no interest it. 
---
When I did get to 60, much to my surprise I looked around and found plenty of casual try-hard-but-not-too-hard guilds that were just getting started with MC and Ony. Sure loads of other guilds were well past that, but it didn't matter. 
---
We definitely had a schedule for raids, you kind of have to, but it was 2x per week for 3 hours each, and it was definitely not stressful. I mean, yeah, you didn't just fuck around, and people were kinda serious about getting through the content, but nothing like a hard core guild. 
---
This time around ... guess what? I'm still a slow-ass leveler. But I'm proceeding under the assumption that when I finally get to 55 or 60 I'll be able to find some group that's on the same part of the curve that I am.
---
rip your GPU
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
But yes Patchwerk is a druid's time to shine in Naxx. From memory hateful strikes cannot crit/crush (it's a physical ability being used), so druids get to meat sponge huge hits and just mitigate it, with armor cap and huge health pool, makes it much easier than trying to have warriors survive through it.
---
awesome! thanks for the help =)
---
You have to have the right pet out, and engineering helps. In high pvp areas I‚Äôd roll VW and sac him the second I heard cheapshot hit me, then toss a grenade to stun them and right into a fear. If you lose from there that‚Äôs on you. 
---
One you hit 42 it‚Äôs all about the death coil. Love that spell...
---
Not the point. Nobody is going to pay that much for temporary water that won't be there the next time they pay, *and* only costs the mage about 2 seconds to make.
---
thx for the tips! ggs

You can also hunt for greens selling for under price. You just got to learn the stats and who needs them.   
---
Leather "Monkey" gear does pretty well for rogue/ hunter/ feral druid  
---
Cloth "Owl/ Eagle" gear can also be good for casters   
---
Cloth "whale" gear is good for healers.   
---
Mail/ Plate/ Leather "Bear" gear is good for tanks  
---
Ill sometimes see something like a one-handed level 35 sword with "Bear" go for 50s when It could easily sell for at least 1-3g. Just got to learn whats good and catch those people trying to sell stuff without realizing how good it is.
---
Unpopular opinion but it looks like GM did fine?
---
They responded quickly (according to you), they punished the abusers and they also gave you a warning for exploiting - which after some discussion you agreed with, they then left and you decided to ask for clarification but they had already moved on to the next ticket...
---
The tank would not pull while I was drinking. He waited until I was standing. 
---
Later I told him he was a great tank and he said his main is a healer and he pays attention to healer mana. 
---
What a saint.
---
Find a raid that needs a shadow priest.
---
I've say no. You don't have to be prot to be able to tank thru 50-60.We ran groups with an arms warrior tanking (in def stance of) and myself healing with shadow spec. X/0/31 build. But I would also say that we were always running with IRL/guildies and chatting on discord.
---
I was just thinking about this actually, I think the real culprit is the fact that tanks, healers, and melee dps are pretty much fine chain pulling. 
---
But with mages, pulling one or two mobs will drain 50-75% of my mana anyway so it‚Äôs more efficient to pull 5+ since either way I‚Äôm gonna have to drink after every pull. And drinking is a pain of it‚Äôs own since a full drink will only give me like half my mana.
---
The horde are basically infiltrating the black dragonflight. you go undercover, transformed into a dragonkin, and talk to a member of them in duskwallow, and he has you collect the skulls of members of the other dragonflights scattered across the world as part of a ritual. The blue one is in that cave. 
---
Afterwards he makes you a seal and tells you to Report to Drakkisath to have it empowered...which obviously you can't do, because he would see through the disguise. So you ask Rexxar about it and ol rexxy is like hey man, it's cool. Just go kill Drakkisath and we'll use his blood to complete the ritual. Thereby attuning you to onyxia's lair!

Dustwallow is horrible about this. Those drakes take forever to spawn, and the whelps are all over and have an awful drop rate. Probably my least favorite quest spot in the entire game.

Up to BRD is easy mode to heal even entirely in shadow.

Is demonology a do-able talent to use for leveling a warlock? Like using the blueberry ghost to just aggro and tank?

&gt; Each [rend] tick does almost half my auto attack damage
---
Please stop punching people with your bare fists.
---
At your level, you have Rank 2 Rend.  Combined with 3/3 Improved Rend, that means that your Rend does 36 damage over the course of 12  seconds.  
---
That means that it's ticking for *NINE* damage every three seconds.  
---
So please, for your own sake; pick up a two-handed weapon.

Yet the negative scores when you start to argue with people show you defended your point extremely poorly. In fact you defended your point *so* poorly the post rebutting you now has more upvotes than you original post.

I'm currently a lvl 30 mage who rerolled from a lvl 57 priest(different faction/different server). I'm looking for a solid group to run dungeons. I am looking to get to 60 asap as I've already done the majority of the 1-60 grind recently, but I'm pretty easy going. I would prefer to do spell cleave, but I'm more than willing to run dungeons the 'sane' way provided that we can run them enough time to get everyone geared up and all the xp they'd like. Mostly looking to have a good time. EST and my schedule is pretty flexible so I can be available whenever as long as I know ahead of time.  
---
At 60 I'd like to raid as frequently as possible and in my off time farm materials and engage in wPvP activities like city/settlement raiding. Shutting down Theramore for a night sounds like a blast. If there's a solid guild looking for a dedicated player, I'm your zombie!
---
I fee your pain brother. It makes me want to roll a mage to try and show how things should be done but I‚Äôm already changing minds one group at a time as a bear.
---
Downvoted ya. Anything else I can do to make your day ?
---
Yea, that makes sense. We never had a Feral tank, but it was vanilla. So if you weren‚Äôt a warrior people would have laughed you out of Naxx.
---
To be quite honest, if you have any non-gathering professions... by level 48, you‚Äôre going to want to start grinding out the reputation you need for recipes and formulas.
---
For me, that means at 48 I‚Äôm in felwood grinding furbolgs.  At 50, I‚Äôll be in searing gorge grinding incendosaurs.  At 52, it‚Äôll be the start of grinding Argent Dawn in WPL...and so on.
---
Is this seriously how people are now?

I waa getting ready to jump from Shadowbringers to Classic.... But what in ten fucks has happened here?

---
One other thing I noticed is that it will change your action bar automatically for you when you go into stealth.  That way you can bind all the skills that require stealth (or can be used while stealthed) and reduce the number of skills bound while out of stealth.
---
It's got stats that help him live longer so he can still throw out an extra innervate and battle rez someone important who died. :P
---
I played StarCraft and sc2 for a number of years and allows me to have more apm for situations such as that Soo it's unnessecary in eyes. Though outside of later tier end game warrior dps most classes have relatively low apm requirements and even then it's not hard unless your mouse aim is bad.
---
If your conc is ready and the mobs are 1/2 hp and your threat is well ahead of dps, you can drop a lower rank just to help instead blasting all your mana every pull. Waiting for the tank to drink to full from 0 after every pull makes things take so much longer. If you're smart about it and have a good feel for dps' threat and your own, you can manage it so you only have to drink a few ticks between pulls to keep things moving.
---
Same, and never touched private servers.
---
Also to all the people spamming BRD arena aoe groups for exp....you're literally going slower than you would be if you just did quests both inside and out of dungeons. Even without the quests LBRS, Strat, and Scholo will be more exp and more fun than repeated BRD arenas.

It's not dumb to form a cleave group amongst a co-ordinated group who know each other, know exactly what to do and execute every pull like a well-oiled machine. No one is disputing that this is the highest XP/hour method of doing it.
---
The thing we *do* have a problem with, is when pugs insist on it, with a composition that's wrong, key talent points which are not allocated towards enabling the strategy, and little to no effective communication, resulting in wipes, people pointing fingers at each other etc etc. And the lessened XP/hour number tells the whole story, where they could have just done the dungeon the "regular" way.
---
With the collateral damage being the non-dps in the group.

Because you have to ask him how far his server has progressed, the economy, how many people on his server are focused on selling these. Every server is different. It would just be easiest to check the AH but I guess this logic is frowned upon on reddit lmao

I've always asked politely for water in general of whatever area I'm currently in and have never been asked to pay.

---
Dunno about your experience, but we barely get 1 or 2 spots in raids, so already no competition.

It's more intensive but a shorter fight is easier for a healer as they don't need to sustain that higher mana usage for as long.

I'm resurrecting this randomly because what you described is basically exactly what I'm doing. I've got a warrior "main" that I'm leveling and a priest and mage that I'm trying to level at the same time (I'm really just an alt-o-holic). That said, I've opted for professions that complement the warrior on the other two classes (herb/alc and mining/enchanting), which will hopefully reduce the amount of death runs I have to do on the warrior and just help him smash in general. Did you end up taking this route too?
---
But you were up there, so how were you incapable of doing the exploit?
---
Literally BIS pally and shaman weapon versus a weapon that‚Äôs sidegraded or upgraded in the next few raids for warriors. Also, if you‚Äôre 2h warrior DPS on alliance with something other than a BRE you‚Äôre doing it wrong
---
ironically they are getting to 60 slower than they would if they would just quest and do dungeon quests.
---
They were waiting for you to say you were looking for a dps so you wouldn't ask them to tank.  I've gotten to the point where the only dps warrior I'll bring is my guildmaster, I've had horrible experiences with pug dps warr's, i.e. taking a clear tanking upgrade, sure rolls happen what ever, to having a prot dps warrior in the 5 man group.

&gt;Disc/Holy is quite viable, does good damage and is alright at healing as well. I just personally feel that if I decide to go healing I want to go all-out best Healing Spec I can find instead of doing a hybrid
---
What? Disc holy is the best healing spec. Straight holy, or straight disc, is going to be way worse at healing. Spirit and lightwell suck anyway, so you don't need to go more than 30 into the holy tree.
---
Whether 21/30 or 31/20 is the better spec is up for debate.
---
just switched to markmanship, pvping is fucking impossible, i guess hunters legit should sneak up on ppl cus thats all i can do to stand a chance, if rogue open, mage blink freezes, warrior charges, pala stuns etc and im meelerange im 100% dead, feign trap doesnt even work wtf
---
Dont think there is a mod for that, but you can go farm darnassus rep and get a tiger for example if you are really sick of it
---
A large amount of people here don't realize that if the player isn't level 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 60 that they don't make the max amount of water per cast. When I'm level 50 making 1-2 level 45 water per cast and you want 40 of them it will probably take a good 2-3 minutes. I also need water for myself. "Heals aren't free" is a bad argument. You don't need to take 3-5 minutes of your time to heal me, where I need to get to the dungeon first, make water for myself and the healer who won't bring any.
---
I personally don't mind making water for people I group with, but I've had people I group with be rude outside of group when they want a portal and I said its the reagent cost.  I've probably saved a few priests on my server over 200g (I've grouped with the same 5 a massive amount of times). Yet one of them got mad about paying for a portal and said I'll never get fort again.
---
Personal experience is that warriors and hunters tip the best. Other casters are cheap about it. I've noticed a lot of people are just straight up petty. One of the richest players on my server wouldn't pay 50s for a portal, but charges 50g in town for an enchant only he has.
---
The only exploiting going on in this picture is in the guild chat, but blizzard also doesn‚Äôt care about that so save your tears.
---
You can't see them unless you're playing max quality 4k
---
The answer it seems is that most warriors have no idea how to tank, you included. Those aren't the abilities you use to generate AoE threat.
---
This is the tenth asmongold post in like an hour. Can we give it a rest already?  Doesn't he have is own fucking /r/ he can use?
---
It's not really a good spell cleave group if 1. you're worried much about aggro, or 2. your mage has enough time to drink up enough and then go and pull stuff before the tank does.  
---
It seems a lot of the hate for spell cleave groups is because people just see poor versions of it.
---
The heart wants what the heart wants...
---
I think most people get confused because of it often being pronounced neck 'n' neck
---
You do you bro
---
Being constantly out of mana from bad mage dps management and healing more players than just the tank is the worst. Then you get to sit there and drink two waters just to get full cuz the fucking mage never trained his new water because he's poor. I like to spam prayer of healing early so I go oom when a mage sends aggro into oblivion. Just as a passive aggressive way to get him to stop. I know saying something in chat won't work and will only make it worse
---
You forgot Leatrix Plus, Leatrix Maps, and ClassicLFG :)

I listed a pea-shooter I found for 10 silver instead of 10 gold by mistake.  Somebody bought, and I've never heard a word about it.  Made that person's day, I'm sure.

Aoe Tanking is easy. I'm sure you also noticed how undercalibrated the Vanilla instances are up until your 50s. If this is a problem for you than just play DPS my guy. I get that spell cleave lfgs are kind of frustrating but this post is nonsensical. 
---
I literally need to pull 3+ groups to have any rage to hold aggro anyways. If I pull one group chances are I dont have the rage to hold aggro unless we do the complete noob focus 1 target wait for 2 sunders... Just sounds like tanking 5 mans ain't for you. Maybe MC will be more what you're looking for

What the fuck kind of gear do you have with 1200 non-crit CoC? Naxx?
---
Haha yeah his main tricks are not even class specific.
---
Intimidation is not a taunt either. Just a fairly sizable amount of threat. If you hit on the tanks main target it usually won't overtake threat but if you hit it on an off target it's a nice but of CC and will usually pull aggro until tank taunts.
---
Should get bettervendorprice instead and leatrix plus rather than scrap. It adds way more functionality. Also auctioneer was released and imo is better, and has add-ons like enchantrix which are immensely helpful
---
I havent played a hunter past 30ish, but I'll try.
---
Are YOU pulling aggro or is your pet? 
---
Is there a level disparity between you and the tank?
---
What spec are you
---
His point is to say that.  Wtb lvl 45 water 5 stack, 10s tip instead of wtb mage water, will tip.  The amount doesn't matter, you will get more responses and get your water faster.
---
My endgame goals are:
---
\- Level one of each class on each faction to 60.
---
\- Max my professions and get as many recipes as possible.
---
\- Win a fishing tournament.
---
\- Win a gurubashi arena.
---
\- Get pre-raid BIS on a few toons.
---
I figure I've got at least a year and a half of content right there, without ever stepping into a raid.
---
I'm thinking so too, especially rich completionists. I mean, the item is 1 on 10,000, ofc it has a high value, especially if it looks cool. I just put it for 750g lol, let's see if it sells (won't).
---
Remindme! 12 hours
---
This is why I make my own groups. I‚Äôm kicking an inconsiderate child like that immediately if they can‚Äôt be reasoned with. This is so bad. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that.
---
Big yikes. Exactly the kind of player I avoid.
---
I mean power to you but 11h a day, every day for a month is insane amount of time to spend on anything.
---
Even if you were working, that‚Äôs nearly 80h work weeks. People do that but it‚Äôs not healthy. If you work 80h a week you barely have time for other aspects of life. 
---
The same applies for gaming, 11hours doesn‚Äôt leave you much time to do the other necessary things in life.
---
I mean... he did say if
---
Yeah same. I offered to give away for free all the extra pages I had for that stupid STV quest, and people ended up tipping me like 40 silver for like 2 pages. That‚Äôs more than they were going for at the AH.
---
I've been tanking everything up to and including BRD with a 2H with the exception of Emperor because we wiped on him so I swapped to sword and board. Never had any complaints from my healer, which was an ele/resto shammy most of the time. Laugh at my pre-60 spec all you want but it was solid gold in my experience. At level 52 i was using: 31/5/7
---
Improved Charge --&gt; pop Sweeping strikes --&gt; switch to Fury, pop improved blood rage and zerker rage, and then WW. Cleave until everything is dead.
---
Wierd spec, sure, but it worked really well. Mages/Locks could AoE for a long time without pulling off me **as long as I completed the combo mentioned above before they started AoEing**. I used a ton of +agi gear and i think the dodge and high crit chance (+5% from axe spec) really helped it work.  I usually ended up #1 or #2 on the damage meters in 5 mans.
---
I used this spec to tank no less than 69 freaking BRD arena runs this weekend as well. Was trying to grind out my savage gladiator chest piece while it could still give me a little exp. It worked great for that as well. Was gonna make a post about that farm later though
---
You can find a casual guild that will do the easy raids: Oni, MC, and later ZG and ZA-20. Or you can Pug some of those raids too, but I wouldn't recommend that. 
---
With 2-2.5 hours daily (maybe a little more in weekends) you can easily achieve rank 10 in Pvp if you are good once BG pop out.
---
prot anything is useless until late 40s
---
me sitting at level 15 be like:
---
&lt;Sine Cera&gt; I‚Äôm not the GM or an officer, but if you message one of the officers, Narcan, he‚Äôll send you an invite. I think we have like 4-5 husband and wife couples in the guild. Pretty friendly and active guild mostly levels 20s-30s with a few 40s.
---
So your saying 1g should be the tipping price for all levels of food then? Or does a Mage food/water Tipping chart needed to be handed out in mass to all players of WoW Classic? All I can say is thank god I leveled up fishing and cooking so I don't have to barter with kind of stuff.
---
Edit: barter not batter.
---
Nope, makes me an authority on it, actually.
---
Why do you need like 3gb of ram running addons¬ø When like all you really need is maybe a class specific add-on of sorts , a dps and threat meter, bagon, a ui if you desire. I just run bartender to move my bars and have a cast bar and swing timer.
---
Like are we all gonna just play peggle in raids and fuck off lmao
---
Yeah after you get to the troggs it‚Äôs time to strap on a shield. Up until then I was fine with a 2h. But those troggs hit so fn hard.
---
I play on a fairly populated server (Bigglesworth) but fortunately, I generally get on before it gets busy.
---
You also can transform yourself into pirate/ninja/skeleton with different ways
---
&gt;  more‚Ä¶ than it would cost me to buy permanent ones from the vendor?
---
Vendor price is 20s/5, 5 stacks is 4g (3.6 if honored).
---
If you're checking right now, it's because it's early - even a week after launch, servers didn't really start filling up (US at least) until later in the day.
---
Why do you also need Darnassus rep for this mount?  To learn saber riding or whatever it is called?
---
...and now you're telling me this country has computers? I didn't know that!
---
There are statistics, just not the ones you want to hear so you are ignoring them. 
---
There have been X # of exploits over the years. Y # of players abused those exploits for an advantage over players that did not abuse the exploits. Z # of players got banned for doing so, Z has intrinsically *always* been a small fraction of Y.
---
I don't know how you can be confused by that, but here we are.
---
Weirdly enough I kept more vivid memories from like the guildies voices, jokes and all.
---
8.2.5 comes out tomorrow and a new war campaign update. The theme park players might be dropping off.
---
Maybe change tactics to only battle if you see aoe madness!
---
So if I‚Äôm looking for that social experience, best get down to those popular zones. 
---
Okay, thanks!
---
You auction it or vendor?
---
The perks of wearing a loincloth. 
---
The downside of not wearing shoes.
---
You could hit 200 hours without even losing sleep and having a full time job. 16 hours a day on the weekend, 4 hours at night after work. Prolly aren't cleaning the house or taking care  of kids, but not that hard.
---
There's an LFG interface for basically everything that you just queue into that pre-assembles a group for you. It's quick and efficient which appeals to a large audience, but many classic players argue that it removes the personal interaction between players which is a cornerstone for server community building.
---
You probably won't downrank when you tank at lower levels, but as soon as you get more than ~30 spell power, rank 1 of consecration becomes more efficient than max rank.  
---
You still run into the 5 second rule though, so it is just depends on the situation.
---
Not to mention it's a random group, not this guy's group of friends who obviously trust each other and know each other's playstyles. Totally different
---
1200 is the overage which is prob why you haven't gotten one yet. I've been at 650-750 forever until this September month I'm at 1250+ randomly.
---
it's not efficient to make this group when they fail so often besides low level dungeons where you can heal a mage tank, premade with good players? very efficient
---
You literally admit to doing what he accused you of doing in your last message...
---
I've had so many people expect me to bend over backwards to give them water. I was questing in ungoro and this priest randomly invites me to a group, so I say what's up? He asks for water, and I check on the map, he's on the complete opposite side of me. He asks me to bring it to him since he's in the middle of a quest. I then tell him it's going to cost him then, he then proceeds to get super angry saying it costs you nothing bro, you can't charge for water it's a button press! Now at 60 I do not give water out for free unless you're a guildie or I'm in a dungeon with you. What people don't understand is I'm saving you money with this, so for you to expect a random person to go out of there way to help you is pretty crazy to me.
---
Looks like you've been struck with rigor mortis.....
---
Thats literally the dude's point....
---
Just tip 4 s and 20 c. They tend to get a good laugh. Im a lock so i always throw in a healthstone too!
---
There's a certain server's discord where the #mages channel is trying to form a cartel to sell all water/portals at the same price so "people get used to spending 2g on a portal".
---
Count me out. I mained a priest back in the day - watching my mana and the tank's comfort level was all I did. I rolled a mage so that I could finally look at something besides health bars *and* help my friends out with water and transport. There's a reason most every non-Priest/Warrior class has some kind of group utility.
---
Everything about the support menu screams "don't issue a ticket you idiot". I don't think I ever had a problem I could solve with the help menu or even fit under a category where you can issue a ticket. It's fucking stupid. I wish there was a category that says: there was a 20 page thread in the blizzard forums without a blue post or a solution to my problem.
---
Lvl 30 with 14g. Until today I thought tailoring/enchanting was good while leveling and thought I was doing okay money wise.
---
Whoops.
---
Where are you posting this comment again?
---
Last time I played retail was Cata.. is there really no popup window when the item drops to need roll for it?
---
she wants to know what that tongue do
---
Also following your logic you're paying your dps to do damage right?
---
Okay big difference. Grinding a Dungeon to get a BOE tailoring pattern and having the proper Profession Level to make said item is a little bit harder than leveling to a Specific level and spending like 1 gold 50 s to learn a ability you can literally do at will long as you have enough mana.
---
You have a list of your addons, I'm digging your UI.
---
Ultimately I think it is really up to what kind of person/player you are. Are you an asshole in real life or a very kind generous friendly person? If you're an asshole in real life, and like being that way, then go ahead and take the chest. If you are a cool person, friendly, generous, kind, helpful person in real life and like being that way, then go ahead and offer to allow the group to roll for the chest. Either way, eventually you will reap what you sow...
---
There's a reason most pvp hunters didn't roll hunter for Classic when blizzard confirmed they were doing scatter/freeze DR. It basically breaks the one good defensive tool hunter has. The FD/trap bug just exacerbates it.
---
I dont think theres an argument. Blizzard has stated it's an exploit. Report them and move on.
---
He makes a lot of relevant content. This is classic wow and sponsored pvp tournements, speed runs with decent money prices is pretty cool no matter who is doing it. Id say most content posted here is shitty but usally find asmongolds pretty interresting.
---
I wouldn't call it brain damage. It's more like massive self-entitlement. A lot of Brazilians have a strong identification with being...from Brazil. That being said, when they're playing with a bunch of gringos, they're not going to think twice about stealing your shit.
---
About 13 sec in the 'Wts account ' lol
---
You do realize reddit puts an asterisk next to a post if it's been edited?
---
Unbelievably dense userbase this sub has.
---
My hidden way to make my tank‚Äôs life easier as a rogue is to pickpocket all targets in a pack as the tank pulls. By the time I‚Äôm done, they‚Äôve generally build up enough threat to where I can go ham on skull.
---
You know this is a game right? There's no blood and it's hardly gruesome. Just get up and go outside if your jimmies are getting rustled.
---
Yeah immersion is amazing
---
Yea i'm judging you pretty hard but I'm aware of that fact.
---
is that because the size of the country (  expensive rates in rural areas?)
---
You‚Äôd think that money could fix his appearance
---
i forget where it was, but like 2 weeks ago i attacked a horde near a horde guard, the guard went hostile but just stood there.  it's pretty broke overall.
---
Got my first epic last night at 42. Fucking green tower. FML
---
My girlfriend back in Vanilla played a Holy Priest.  When I asked her to shackle some stuff in RFD she told me she didn't have that spell.  Having never played Priest, I assumed maybe it was a talent.
---
Turns out she thought 'playing a Holy Priest' meant only buying the Holy spells from the trainers and she willingly had been ignoring the Shadow and Discipline trees.
---
Eh, I did it for 3 weeks back in 2006 when going for Warlord. 18 hours a day of battlegrounds. Barely slept, barely ate. Just BGs all day and night.
---
After doing that for 3 weeks just for Rank 13 I said "fuck that" for another 5 weeks for Rank 14.
---
Will pay $40,000 to never hear about him again PST
---
I had one Stockades group pally who was adamant about doing whole room pulls and then getting mad when I couldnt keep pace healing as a ret paladin. I barely managed to keep him alive and we wiped twice. He then made some insulting remark and left the group. Possibly the only bad experience ive had so far. Went on another run of stocks with a normal group healing, cleared it fine.
---
I burned a rogue because of this over the weekend.
---
I'll keep it short: it was VC/DM. I was druid healing. A warrior was tanking. We had two mages and a rogue. The rogue kept pulling instead of the warrior, often waiting for the warrior to take the threat away.
---
Initially I ignored it and just healed away. Then I got frustrated and politely hinted that "we should let the warrior pull." Didn't work. I stopped healing the rogue during and between pulls - if he's doing his job, he shouldn't be taking direct damage. He didn't get that hint.
---
...so when the Blackened Defias Chest piece dropped off of VanCleef, I rolled need. I won. He...wasn't thrilled. Had he listened and adjusted, I would have mercifully just passed it to him because I don't *really* care about gear.
---
Let the tank tank.
---
I get a chuckle when I stroll through the areas that ‚ÄúAOE Mage GRIND TO 60 FAAAAST!‚Äù Videos have designated as good for mages to grind at and I see 5 mages fighting to grab the same pack. Guys... yeah it worked for the guy who got 60 first because he was ahead of the pack and had constant layers. Just go do some damn quests.
---
Situational. I certainly enjoyed a few months of down time when I was switching positions (and countries) a while back.
---
Admittedly I didn't spend the entire time playing WoW either, though.
---
Lmao truth. Mmmmmmm symmetry.
---
I'm all for aoe cleave... but if it's not a group that is specifically designed and prepped for it, for all that is good and holy, do not spam aoe.
---
I'm a swords spec combat rogue. My focus is PvP mainly along with leveling up (I'm 32). Would a different spec with daggers be better for wPvP? Sorry this is my first time playing so I'm curious.
---
It's all going to depend on supply and demand.
---
I got mine at 41. Gold gains go through the roof after level 40. I got the last 30g in a little less than a day. It helps that a ton of hunter abilities are worthless, though.
---
Yeah, you get that shit constantly too. Inaccurate and/or unspecific. And then once you‚Äôre aware of that it‚Äôs like alright, how fucking far should I go in that direction. North of razor hill.... should I run to fuckin everlook before I give up and realize it must‚Äôve actually been directly east like in OPs screenshot?
---
I‚Äôd never quest without a guide/wowhead for that reason. That struggle adds nothing for me.
---
He meant Hewkhah
---
Wholesome. A cheap laptop can run it too.. maybe something more affordable to save for, my uni laptop runs it comfortably and was ¬£300...2 years ago :)
---
This won't work, it'll just burn your mana.
---
/cancelform takes you out of whatever form you're in, and /cast XYZ Form puts you in a form.  So if you're already in a form this macro cancels it, but then immediately puts you back in.
---
So much better than Auctionator
---
But are they going to pay that well, especially for something that isn't displayed on your character?
---
Sure he can possibly get 100g or maybe even 200g for it, just depends on what the few Hunters who have the Leaf and the solo Epic quest are will to pay vs any others that are being sold.
---
1g for water/food is pretty normal tip, I would not expect/tip less.
---
The impact to census was a side effect of the main goal of RMT spam.
---
Your obviously a dog person or you wouldn‚Äôt call taking care of cats whilst farming on a pvp server low quality. 
---
I feel for you.
---
I guess there's a limit to #nochanges.
---
what class are you playing? With casters gear upgrades are less noticeable but as melee / physical DPS you really feel it
---
So why come and comment on this thread?
---
What about Battle shout, since it should be same threat but can't be resisted?
---
It‚Äôs garbage. The type of it or age of it is irrelevant
---
He said it was called "Auction Sniper" and that it auto-buys any items with a buyout price below vendor sale price.
---
I believe it because the "auction successful" notification popped up within 2 seconds of me submitting the auction. It was sold before I could even click my listings tab and cancel the auction.
---
Correct on palies.
---
Yeah, a single mage isn't supposed to do its max damage. Pretty much just spam frost bolt and nothing else when you're the only mage. But I feel mages always want to blow things up.   
---
In a group of three mages go for it. Just chain nova and lock the mobs in place while they AoE them down. But I think mages today can't separate the two roles.
---
Pretty much. Only this ‚Äúpriest‚Äù has better buffs and utility.
---
HURRY ADVENTURER! \*walks slower than RP walk\*
---
Is there an addon to see the map of the dungeon you're in?
---
Itemrack can do the gear equip/unequip on mounting.  It's not perfect yet, but it is functional.
---
I'd love to see her jungle cat ;)
---
Hold shift while you are hovering one item and it will bring up whatever you have equipped in the same slot.
---
Hilarious that you think he's the mad one.
---
You probably tamed a lower (not level) tiger. Some are elder, etc.
---
These frames have native move in default UI *already*, Move Anything is used by players that want to move other windows, that can't be moved *already*
---
Minimize downtime for mana is one good indicator. As healer if tank is taking all hits (with a shield on, none of that two hander sneakyness) i usually end a normal 2-3 mob pull with majority of mana left. I can literally Regan with spirit while tank pulls another mob. Basically zero downtime on careful, deliberate pulls.
---
Pets will only get experience on kills that are green to to the player, regardless of the level of the pet. If you are 60 with a 30 pet, killing level 30 enemies won't give your pet experience. 
---
If the enemy is grey for you, the pet won't level.
---
Yes. Yes we were, or most of us at least but that is only natural when a game gets older and older that people improve. I‚Äôd be pretty pissed if I played a game for 15 years and didn‚Äôt become MUCH better at it. Take Starcraft professionals for instance, it‚Äôs hard for me to describe just how much of a huge gap between now and a pro from 2010 is. 
---
Onyxia did get 3 manned back in vanilla by some naxx geared people though.
---
You don't "have" to tip
---
You guys replied to eachother 8 times.
---
"Hurr duurrr i aint arguing"
---
Yes you are, dont lie.
---
I am now uncomfortably aware of the fact that I commit genocide every time I log in.
---
TBC/Wotlk Arena is the dream.
---
Yeah but blizzard, frost nova, and Cone of Cold are a lot more fun than just spamming frost bolt.
---
Came to suggest this video. All time favourite PvP video.
---
I am considering it too.. 37 UD Rogue
---
My realm is perma full, Rogue is super hard to level I feel.. and I tried Horde because traditionally I was always Alliance but something just feels.. uncomfortable.
---
I'm trying to persuade myself to at least get 40 and see if that helps but I am really considering starting over on a new realm with an Alliance class. Just not sure what I'd want to play I was set on Rogue for years.. reality is way less than the expectation :(
---
Love this! My friends and I have been doing the same thing whenever one of us gets a really good Blue BoE for the other. Makes the game that much more fun.
---
Oh, there are plenty of immature names floating around on BsB
---
5th out of how many servers??? So what...
---
Hadn't really thought ahead this way. I'm lvl 43 with alchemy at 215 and herb at 260, what should I be thinking about soonish? (Alliance)
---
What add on replaced your portrait with your class icon please I like that!
---
"slightly change" the classes?
---
Are you fucking high? TBC is basically Vanilla class design, but perfected. WOTLK is a transitional time with much more QOL to classes (and attempts to employ the bring the player not the class concept) but also has the largest talent trees the game ever saw.
---
This isn't slightly changed classes. Its a whole different fucking world. That isn't to mention the vast differences in gear / stats. The armor pen days were a unique experience you can't replicate in modern wow by just going into a WOTLK raid capped at 80.
---
I mean, if the mobs are being tanked so close to the next pack that multi-shot reaches it, that's only partially your fault for risking it.  They probably would've aggro'd if they were fleeing mobs, anyways.
---
That's because in retail the tank runs in hits 1 button and can afk the rest of the fight and not lose aggro. At least it seems that way.
---
People dont realize threat is a slow ramp in classic and if you manage to pull threat from the tank you're forcing him to generate 10% more than you just to get it back THEN continue to hold it while your CDs that pulled threat to begin with come back up.
---
Yeah, those people are wrong. Surprise, lots of wrong people on reddit. It's called safespotting. Just report them. It's all you can do.
---
I agree with 90 percent of this. 
---
Dont attack the tanks target imho. I have to hit these mobs to get aggro. Attack the main mob, the one that was initially targeted. I maybe wrong on that with the aggro tables, but it seems to work for me a druid. My warrior buddy (irl) says a similar thing
---
The Hand-to-Elbow of Ragnaros
---
Damn, nice. The horde AH/econ on bloodsail is still in it's infancy and I'm not sure if it's going to get better :( the server is med pop and like 65% ally
---
So this isn't just everyone doing a /e rolls 100 (1-100) for the luls?
---
&gt; DPS is mostly a matter of making things die slightly faster.  
---
Yeah, playing melee DPS is part of why I stopped playing FFXIV. Really the role of a DPS is extremely simple, and somehow so many players don't know their rotation at all that it's ridiculously easy to meet DPS checks for raids now, so it really felt like raiding was primarily wasting time waiting on others to learn fights. At least tanks get to DO something, as a melee DPS I just dodge circles and hit stuff. I always liked the aesthetic and design of dark knights too, since I literally always prefer classes with a giant 2H weapon, so when I go back that's probably going to be what I play.
---
I really enjoyed Alexander, which was known as the static breaker, because of how rewarding it felt. Clearing A3S and A4s while they were relevant was by far the highlight of my career of FFXIV. I'm not to end-game in Classic yet, but it already feels far more rewarding than most FFXIV encounters, despite being way simpler.
---
Get more spirit.
---
Of your total stats from gear, aim for 60% spirit, 20% stamina and 20% intellect.
---
The only talents you need for leveling is first 5 in Spirit Tap, next 5 in Wand Specialization.
---
nothing else matters until 40+.
---
Last hit mobs, even other players' tagged (grey) mobs to regen massive amounts of health and mana.
---
For groups, heal in short, strong bursts so you can regenerate mana during combat.
---
Replace it with a donor ps2 controller cap. Easy fix that mostly just slides on - just have to lube the top hole so you don‚Äôt tear it wiggling it in, but it‚Äôs a massive improvement anyways.
---
lol same. Its like he doesn't know where he is.
---
Yes spread the word, I have been selling these like mad on the AH :)
---
Yeah, honestly just last night, I had to really try and focus on the fact that we're playing legitimate classic wow now. I've played multiple private servers, so I'm used to the fresh server experience. 
---
But it wasn't until last night that I really realized, oh yeah, this is not private servers anymore.
---
This now has a giant player base, largely filled with people who've never played before. It's a real trip to think about when you're so used to private servers. 
---
It's just like 2005/2006. Where those who started in 2004 were experienced, but you had a 90% chance of playing with noobs. 
---
It's so weird to play the game again with people who have never played wow before. I'm waiting for all my private server and IRL friends to all be 60 so I can just do everything with them and try and avoid this situations.
---
what in the actual fuck did i just read? jfc

---
It's the game infrastructure.  It's super outdated.
---
The dude has one of the biggest collections in WoW.
---
He runs every dungeon and raid to get what he needs. His streams were basically 30% new content and 70% farming old content until he got basically everything from older raids and dungeons.
---
His PvP rating is earned by him. He streams most of his playtime, so it's not like anyone carried him. His PvE accomplishments are also streamed. He raided everything until the end of Legion, when he stopped raiding Mythic.
---
And his "can I get that?" is a request to someone who was with him in the same content, so they BOTH earned whatever dropped. It's a request that some people accept and some deny. A lot of people give him the items because they see the passion, but he can't get a BoP that he didn't work for.
---
BoEs and gold he gets given for free, but that's not much.
---
Hahahahaha!!!! This isn't some government that is regulating gold printing. Gold is printed every single time a mob dies. Inflation is already a thing in MMO.
---
The price of devilsaur will drop due to phase 2 bringing better items possible. But it will still carry some value. Several gold per leather will probably always be the case. 
---
It takes 8+14 leather for the set. That is a minimum of 1-2 hour farming without getting griefed or whatever else. And you need skinning. People will always pay a lot to save time. 
---
Since you can have some extra gold and literally just buy these in city for amazing gear, it's going to be valuable.
---
I still have haters telling me "it's boring and grindy and that shit's going to fail after people's 3 month subs all expire because nobody likes it".
---
Seriously man, just go play retail then.  I'm loving it, not sure why you have to keep actively shitting on Classic.
---
What‚Äôs the add on that have your CC duration on a target on the side? Coz right now I would have to select that target to see how long the CC will last?
---
Priests favor spirit more than any other healer to my knowledge.  Druids/shaman were equal parts and then palies focused on int.
---
Paladins are the one exception, spirit has very little effect for them.
---
I don't see why you wouldn't give this to a shaman.  It's not like there are any raiding specs that need or even want this weapon (aside from cosmetic/prestige purposes), and it's a great weapon for shamans and paladins for PVP/Farming.  Unless I'm missing something, most guilds should/would give this to a paladin or shammy, probably a high contributor to guild functions, etc.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt honestly think that thinking a certain way of playing is boring means your judging someone
---
It's really not that hard man.  Imagine you had a hobby that you enjoyed so you post about it online.  And then someone comments with nothing more than how boring said hobby is.  Not even that it's boring, but that he's potentially **ruining** any actual fun he could be having.  That's judgmental.  What really are you trying to say about OP if you say nothing more than what he enjoys is boring and a waste of time?
---
Hold on, let me not respond to you for 6 months so you can also give completely undeserved credit to me.
---
You mean.. the mechanic that was there in vanilla?
---
It's just clearly bugged currently.
---
Vanilla had 4% resist chance for a target your level in PvP, 5%for +1, then 6%, 13% and 7% for each additional level.
---
It is just bugged currently. You should not be landing spells on skull players with any reliability.
---
Definitely. I remember fearing pallies into groups of mobs in vanilla and them bubble hearthing out. I'm sure they were happy they didn't have to eat the repair bill and I'd get a good chuckle out of it. Then 500 rogues would gank me.
---
Luckily they make pvp and pve servers. Because tons of players feel both ways.

---
Whoa, that's huge
---
Lots of people have said why. I think its just important to remember this is one of those don't try this at home kid's kinda things. You CAN do it. But unless you have practiced at it and know you have a good healer it's debatable if you should do it.
---
Revenge is a great threat generator and having a shield and shield block procs revenge.
---
WROOOOOOONG
---
It's not a race... People have fun in different ways. Some want to speed level, some want to take their time. Some want to figure out exactly how much exp they need to ding 60 with the exploration exp from undercity. 
---
Let people enjoy their fun.
---
Groceries take 20-30 minutes max, done on the way home from work. Family lives in another state, friends play wow, that's why they're friends. Most errands get done during lunch  break.

I think you overestimate how much time needs to be spent doing things during your offtime if your life  is already stable.

Sure son, as i am playing with my kids this time ...

This weekend we hit 20..... ugh.

But we are having so much fun, its all good.

Oh lvl 12 pally... when the sons at dnd...

Best spec to level as Warrior? Arms or Fury? (I'll be duo leveling with a Druid)
---
You are doing the base job in Dungeons, DPS. It's easy, it's entertaining, you don't have to worry about every one else messing up by attacking the wrong targets and pulling aggro. Just attack the tank's target, and sit back and relax. You picked a Mage because you wouldn't have any responsibility in Dungeons and could blame the tank and healer when things went south. Then you go on to make handing out Mana drinks that your class can pull from thin air like something that deserves a tip? Get out dude. I could understand asking for payment for the Reagants for a portal, but you are scum expecting a tip for supporting your group. Clearly you are an adult baby who jumps to irrational conclusions about people's personal life because you were expected to do your job in a group in a video game. I don't need your Mana drinks because I manage my Mana Regen in combat, focus on spirit gear, and activate spirit tap with last hits. You should still be more than willing to support your group still by providing drinks without a tip for clicking a spell. You have a very selfish mind set and lash out with insults when criticized.
---
This argument is all for nothing either way because you wouldn't be in the same group as me. I form my groups with some friends and one or two pick up players. If someone demanded a tip for conjuring food or drink, I would remove them for the group and grab another DPS. I played a Mage on retail back in Burning Crusade and would just hand Mana drinks to Mana users I saw questing in the world because I knew it would help them out, and it took me seconds to make with Mana that was free.
---
Imagine actually running a dungeon with children like that.

Obviously, I am from Heartseeker, however, I just went on Earthfury at 4:30 p.m. and compared the alliance and horde population to the alliance population of Heartseeker (since I can't look at the horde side on Heartseeker, unfortunately).
---
Less than 100 Level 60's online for both factions on Earthfury, barely anyone in Orgrimmar/Stormwind/Ironforge, and not many people online in general. Again, this is only at 4:30 p.m.
---
However, in comparison, I am on Heartseeker Alliance and there are WELL OVER 100-200 Level 60's online atm, more than 50+ Alliance sitting in Ironforge, and a HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE playing alliance at this SAME TIME, 4:30 p.m.
---
I do not know how much longer the free transfers are going on for, but please consider your choices before they close. I love Heartseeker, and obviously from my post, picture I posted, and the popular thread I created, many people do as well.
---
Please, HORDE JOIN US! Alliance, you can continue to join us, too. LOL
---
I know this is only a sample size at 4:30 p.m., but with those numbers, now imagine at peak hours tonight on both servers/factions. Look at my picture above, that's last night around 7:30/8:00 p.m. for Heartseeker Alliance.
---
Any questions/concerns, comment, reply, ask!

[My Classic Addons](https://imgur.com/a/tmJ9h4x).  Everyone has their set and this is mine (so far).
---
Well, I've got some bad news for ya with regards to end-game content...
---
The only problem with rogues is when I'm on my druid they want all my leather, and when I'm on my warrior they want all my tanking weapons.
---
I would say it's because they're the most viable tank spec and fury is also extremely good. I chose to level one in Classic because I didn't want to wait for groups in dungeons later on. I'm fine being FOTM, I'd rather be wanted for groups and raids later on.
---
Does this work with ghost wolf as well?
---
yes I think so
---
combat does not factor into mana regen at all.
---
I see, thanks for the feedback.
---
After seeing all the thirsty chicks after the Venom trailer, I'll believe anything at this point.
---
You're bordering harassment I say quit while you're ahead
---
I'd ask in lookingforgroup over trade. Also org general.
---
I'm a mage and I hate being expected to do AOE runs. I ask now if the group is going to do an AOE run or a normal run.
---
Wow, you are as delusional as your buddy here.
---
Who crafted world first?
---
I doubt they will expand on classic and more than likely end up releasing tbc or other expansion servers. 
---
Ultimately though I HOPE they adopt the design philosophy that made vanilla great into retail. The current version SHOULD be the version everyone wants to play.
---
Something as simple as squishing back to 60 having talent trees, resistances, and a more clear gearing path (without wf/tf and random chance loot) would do the game tons of good.
---
Basically if they reset and then start making the progression horizontal instead of vertical there is no reason retail couldn't be greater than classic.
---
Can you imagine if all 50 something raids were available at level 60 and offered gear that was different but not necessarily better. You would have to find a guild who was focusing on a specific expansion lmao the gear combinations would be out of this world.
---
Why don't you just make an alt to play with him since you play so much more than him?

Classic WoW Advanced Shaman Leveling Guide

By defcamp and malderon
---
Footsteps are another thing that annoys me. You can't adjust their volume independently, so I always disabled the Sound At Character option and just kept my camera a little ways back. Now you have to force that with the console, and it doesn't actually work correctly. Same issue. The footsteps will only come out of one ear.
---
I‚Äôve done 8 days 13 hr so 200+ hours as i was racing my mates to 60. I work 50 hours a week but yeah most remaining time was on WoW, especially at the weekend. Didn‚Äôt lose any sleep and was easily possible for a month but unsustainable long term if you want a social life. I pay a cleaner to do all chores and just order food delivery whenever which made it easier.
---
I just meant as an additional builder to start.  It ups the damage on everything you land and only takes you one talent point to have.  Especially if you are going deep enough sub to pick up cheaper cheap shot.
---
Blood
---
ü§£ thanks I needed that.
---
Otherwise known as uncrushable
---
Incredible reply
---
I don't understand why people are freaking out about a warning...
---
I think when BGs come out, the warrior meta will get a kick in the nuts.
---
To your point, he is on exactly one realm. This would be ok content for /r/Faerlina or however it's spelt. But we're not there.
---
It requires stuff from Diremaul, which isn't in until phase 2, which we still have no solid date for yet.
---
I thought i remembered have drawn out duels with FD freezing trap In vanilla....was feeling really weak inpvp as well if anyone jumped me
---
You're no different than a hunter who needs statless 2 handers. Greedy people ninjaing items their class doesn't need just because "I can equip it and I want it". People like you are why everyone tries to avoid pugs.
---
People don‚Äôt get this, but it‚Äôs true. Kill everything and you respawn more of what you need.
---
Now you're putting words in my mouth. Fuck off with that shit.
---
Also if we're just questing in the world, outside of specific elite mob quests, the healer is a DPS.
---
Making a healer waste their mana healing you while you slowly DPS down 1 mob at a time out of the 5 that you aggroed all at once for some reason is MUCH slower than if we both DPSed and focused one mob at a time.
---
I don't know where this tactic comes from but I see it a lot.

Classic WoW Advanced Shaman Leveling Guide

---
How does Elv UI work, what does it do?
---
My friend convinced me when we started playing in Legion to join an RP server. Never going back now
---
Imp voidwalker means your VW will hold aggro off you until about lvl30-40,.  Without Imp VW you will start pulling aggro around lvl 20-25 (rough numbers).  At higher levels you will start to fear, drain life or just take the hits while you finish the mob off.
---
If you go deep demonology the goal is to get soul link to up survivability.  Otherwise your best leveling talents are down the affliction tree  Very few warlocks put significant points into destruction, although it is certainly possible.  DoTs and wanding are just more mana efficient than nuking.
---
Oh. My. God.   Angry wall of text ffs.  If you have better things to do why are you even replying to someone that is looking for conjured consumables?  Your opportunity cost to click a few buttons is worth how much then?  And that goes back to my original point, if you are expecting a minimum set amount then it is NO LONGER A TIP, it is now a fee, and not even applicable to the original conversation.  No ego, at all.  I‚Äôm not saying your time is literally worthless, you‚Äôre the one acting entitled like there‚Äôs a debt to be paid for conjuring consumables.  By all means, go ahead and try selling your services, you‚Äôll get laughed out of town, even by other mages.  Hell, even rogues put more time into leveling up their lockpicking skills and they don‚Äôt cry like whiney brats the way entitled little mages do about tips for their services.
---
Or they run WAAAY up to attack something, then run ALL THE WAY BACK to where they were..  "Can we not just continue from here??!?!?!"
---
Hahahahaha. Man how right you are. I ended up killing not one but three UD mages. I'm sure were just lvling their mage as AOE spec and didn't expect a Warr to know how to prevent the Frost kite strat. I was damn proud of myself till I just saw your statement.
---
mad mage calls me a docuhe, lmao
---
what are you gonna do magelet, spellcleave me?
---
Subscriptions aren‚Äôt the biggest earner anymore
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Yup, hence why I‚Äôm asking about previous experiences in a semi similar economy.
---
I think it was added before the expansion itself released, I do remember clearly that there were tons of huge PvP fights in the corridors before sylvanas for example
---
I know it‚Äôs technically suboptimal, but I‚Äôve actually been performing really well and have noticed some interesting advantages that assassination brings to the table. 
---
Especially given that the difference between a leveling build and a dps build as assassination aren‚Äôt that different when compared to builds for leveling vs. dps as combat. 
---
I know that distinction goes away the second I reach max level content, but I do think there‚Äôs something worth exploring in assassination.
---
Scattershot into Freeze Trap is on the same diminishing return.
---
Its an old combo to get enemys chain CC'd but unlike retail it shares the same diminishing return. Usually only CC of the same kind are directly influencing each other, so if a Paladin, Rogue and Warrior stun you the stunduration is halfed for each further application down to straight Immunity for a certain timeperiod.
---
Having both Hunterskills on the same DR halfes Freeze Traps duration.
---
If you read other replies you would realize I don't like how involved elvui is. To much work to get it how I want it. Decision paralysis is a real thing. When something is too customizable it get's to the poibt where you're always tweaking and altering and then I am spending more time in elvui settings then playing wow.
---
Ugh. Mage here been playing since vanilla..and I absolutely LOVE a warrior who uses Sunders and tact.  I only AOE when the time is really right or I'm in a AOE group. Ws arent all like that and I want you to know these hype boi mages make us all look.bad and we all despise them.
---
&gt; When I'm level 50 making 1-2 level 45 water per cast and you want 40 of them it will probably take a good 2-3 minutes.
---
Definitely agree. If I'm doing a dungeon and just got a new water spell, it can take 5‚Äì10 minutes to conjure everything for everyone depending on how many mana users there are (I usually give 2 stacks to each mana user). 
---
&gt; I also need water for myself. "Heals aren't free" is a bad argument.
---
It's also a disingenuous argument, you can't just give away consumable heals (except lock rocks, and I'd expect people to tip in the same conditions as for water). If you group up, you're committing to heal, and almost all mages will give water in that situation anyway.
---
You've been warned!
---
Yeah, right? They are saying now I accused their guild of later exploiting. I in fact defended them cause I‚Äôve played with wardens members before and they are nice people generally. It‚Äôs literally this fuck who doxxed me, lister and his stupid kid friends.
---
You've never played Mount and Blade: Warband
---
I‚Äôm not really sure about alchemy recipes - I‚Äôd recommend looking up a ‚Äúreputation guide for alchemy wow classic‚Äù and it‚Äôll have a list of the recipes listed there and the required reps - so you will probably want to look for the recipes you want and/or the most lucrative ones and plan to farm those up.

Will grab imp charge/defiance if I have threat gen issues.
---
I do. I really like it actually, but I haven‚Äôt done any raids yet.
---
Tukui is perfect at showing buffs / debuffs.
---
They should probably make new alternate timeline expansions from classic. As someone who only played classic I'd do this. If they ever went on to do tbc of wotlk i'd probably just stop playing.
---
‚ÄúI eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou eat shit?‚Äù
---
Replaces your entire UI. Allows for repositioning, resizing, information visuals, etc. Intimidating at first, but can be set up completely custom from the ground up.
---
You can buy the first few, maybe up to rank 3, but at about level 15~ish it's value really starts to dop. It doesn't scale with anything and normally isn't worth the rage cost.
---
bro its not complicated he just means you farm shit... what do you want him to say lmao
---
I usually always pull while healer is at 20% but I never pull more than I can handle without heals for a good 20 to 30 seconds on my own and also pull them so I'm not los'ing the healer either. I usually whisper the healer before we start to not stop drinking unless they really have to. Most healers listen and end up adding me. Other healers immediately stop drinking when I pull and complain, but now-a-days as soon as I log in I get whispers from healers and dragged into stuff and they know how I tank and dont have to explain it.
---
Is that what's causing this? Weird, but good to know. Reloading the UI fixes it for me.
---
I double checked because if I'm correcting someone I want to make sure I'm right.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
Only ones in addition. Not sure how Elvui is different from tukui.
---
I am a rogue and also the funniest person in the group. This guy is spot on.
---
Ya'll will have to prove it. Unfortunately, im done. Too often its charge-&gt; Heroic strike rend auto heroic strike. Nope. Done. If you wanna run dungeons grab a shield like me. Then you too can literally pick the dps you run with because they are a dime a thousand.
---
Your first comment is only there to diminish this guys achievement because he has people helping him, when you could be doing the exactly opposite and acknowledging how cool it is that they worked together. Didn‚Äôt put words in your mouth, I read between the lines.
---
Skada I think. Been a while since I used that. Been using Details for a while now.
---
It shouldn't be surprising at all that server populations are dropping pretty rapidly.
---
The game is by no means dead, but a lot of people are realizing it classic isn't for them.
---
Playing as enh, your experience won't change significantly.
---
The thing is that ele becomes faster at killing because lightning bolt cast time drops to 2s due to talents at 40.  You typically don't want to switch to ele until you have mail casting gear though, because casting in cloth/leather means healing more(which slows you back down).
---
Warriors will *always* invite an enh spec with improved totems to a group though.
---
Doable but not optimal.  
---
Affliction drain tanking with succubus is best
---
I‚Äôm a mage and the spellcleave groups are always run by hyper kids who need 60 now, rage at every mistake die 10 times and then quit after one run
---
i got it mixed up, thanks.
---
I healed it no problem as a lvl 30 shadow
---
I‚Äôve had zombie runs with a good group running under 10 minutes. It is so much faster than regular groups, no tank necessary.
---
Won Cassandra‚Äôs grace as a warrior and sold it for 150g and bought two BIS items. It‚Äôs worth just as much to me as anyone else. All need is the superior system only exception is in guild groups.
---
People got tired of nolifing the game and went down to more reasonable play times, servers are still all Full during prime times.
---
I would highly suggest mace combat spec. There's no beating a 6% chance for 3 second stun per attack. It also comes with the bonus skill baked in so you save two talent points over sword spec. What better a single extra melle hit when you are already hitting fast or 3 free seconds to gain 75% of the energy of a sinister strike and 3 free seconds of hitting. Say youv hit 4 times that's a 21.9% of a restun without using combo points or energy.
---
I only have this issue when some addons go out of date. Guidelime is a big offender. Especially with how frequent it updates. Same with questie. I‚Äôll go and disable them or install the new version and the problem is gone. So far it‚Äôs been addons causing this issue for me. Maybe something you can look at to see if you‚Äôre running the latest version or not.
---
What's the best way to get healing potions without an alchemy profession? AH or vendor? THanks
---
There‚Äôs even a WORSE place in booty bay, on the Inn sign coming out of the Inn where Baron Revilgaz is. The reason I think this is worse than both of those you have mentioned is that in this location, Mages, Hunters and Warlocks can kill people coming out of the Inn, using the bank/auction house, and people coming in from the horde FP.
---
How do you learn enchanting before 5, then?
---
The last 5 man I ran was ST. Thanks for this information because I wasn't sure the best place to start.
---
You need both, but prioritize Consecration first.
---
how about you buy water at the vendor and piss off while i make the exact amount of water i feel like making.
---
Are you OCD?
---
I think the raid exp bug/exploit along with the demo shout bug is what started all the hate. Literally all the people who hit 60 in the first week were exploiting these bugs. So naturally people who dont have 9 friends to clear sm with would be upset. Those bugs were fixed and aoe dungeon grinding is not nearly as op as it was. 
---
Also i think aoe cleave groups are percieved as being brainless, and I tend to agree a little. Though brainless people will exsist regardless of an sort of cleave meta. So I dont care lol.
---
I dont blame the players though. This is blizzard's fault. More beta testing would have fixed this before it even happened.
---
Very true. Well. They can deal with the fact that I don't take warrior dps with me when I tank. Sorry heroic strike spammer. But fuck you for making life hard on the healer and i.
---
AHA!! So i was not crazy, they just popped in my book like that!
---
I've been using XPBarNone. I love it except for a bug it seems to have with ElvUI where the bar moves whenever I log in or /rl even when it's locked, but it's a minor annoyance that'll hopefully get fixed eventually (and is a total non-issue if you don't use ElvUI).
---
None of this happened lol
---
35 arms war here, also sword and board for dungeons (will be Prot end game). I completely agree with you, doing a dungeon the normal way is so much smoother. But when I have to tank big groups I really struggle keeping aggro, so the thought of even bigger pulls is horrible! Spamming demo shout just doesn‚Äôt work, nor does cleave or slice
---
They actually disabled it, or is it just lagging?
---
It's the same explanation for either though. /who was being used way too often, possibly due to the CensusData addon which constantly crawls /who to see people online and record the data
---
I'm not surprised that eventually it got shut. I was getting anywhere from 30 second wait to 2-3 minute waits on checking party applications with /who so clearly the service was being hammed by people and lagging
---
I'm curious what the longterm solution will be (aside from hoping it goes away)
---
Dude this is such a good idea THANK YOU I‚Äôm right at SM level and have been avoiding it like hell
---
OMG thank you. This addon was the very best addon during wotlk
---
Good to know. I‚Äôm grinding for gold to get my mount ASAP.
---
That‚Äôs how guilds work
---
I haven't played since Burning Crusades came out.. lol...  
---
My main was a hunter then, and I loved it, rocked.  
---
So, I went the same way this time, hit 27,, LW, First Aids, Skinning and Cooking, leveling them all up just fine...  Then a friend wanted to start out (never played before). Rolled an undead warrior... just to side kick with him and his mage.. show him the ropes a little bit..   
---
New main is my warrior.. wow... just half wish I rolled Orc... but this will do.
---
I can't decide if you actually don't see the connection between the two or if you're discussing this issue in bad faith.
---
? And?
---
Many of us tanks have been discussing this on the forums over the last couple of weeks. There‚Äôs really two completely divided camps on this, folks ought to start specifying what kind of group they‚Äôre trying to put together imho.
---
Thistle shrub pew collector
---
Lol, I love how the toxic salty creeps get brought out so easily.
---
Like I said, I know reading comprehension is hard but it would really help for you to improve yours. If you read what I said, never was I disagreeing with the other person. I was just pointing hypocrisy and letting them know I see through their act. There's no disagreement, just me calling that person out. I know improving your reading comprehension can be tough and discouraging at times, but I think you can do it. Hang in there!
---
Other guy probably stopped replying because he got banned for being toxic, careful you might be next.
---
Honestly as a holy priest doing brd/brs/strat etc, as long as the tank is playing well and using a 2h doesn't mean going oom every fight and the run is going smooth I don't care.        
---
Also I always try to be positive with every kind of tank because they have the most stress inducing role and are expected to lead even if they don't know the instance well.        
---
        
---
Honestly I only have problems with tanks that as soon as I heal them lose aggro and the mobs come for me, I pw:s me and run to them and they still don't get the mobs of me. Everything else it's solvable.
---
Anyone know what the nameplate distance in Vanilla was?
---
Speaking as someone who made greater wands on day 1, they weren't nearly as profitable as you might think. A combination of people not having money to buy them right away, a lack of decently priced materials/greens early on, and a lot of people flooding the auction house with wands ended up making them fall to vendor price pretty quickly.
---
Efficiency is a ‚Äúnew player‚Äù friendly guild. My aim is to assist in the farming, leveling and questing aspect to be as efficient as possible.
---
Finally something funny
---
Ok will have to check that one out
---
Ding ding
---
Yes. And then you give them a Nightfall and they benefit mages/locks too.
---
Ah/Vendor! There's limited supply on some vendors but takes a while for those to respawn, and auction house people sell them by the truckload. (Also mob drop but less common, humanoid mobs are pretty common)
---
No I don't think so. Doesn't bartender have a customize option I know experience bar is in there.
---
You get very consistent revenge procs even without a shield on aoe pulls. 2h tanked a stockades run and was revenging at least every 4-5s threat felt super consistent. Helped ZF runs on my shaman with 2h tanking  warriors, and it's nice because threat is just generally a non-issue unless you're over 4 mobs
---
Just don't play with mages and you don't come across this bullshit. Unfortunately the class is full of retail kids
---
I think its shift+v like he said.
---
&gt; I'll be dipped in shit.
---
Um so I haven't heard this phrase yet. Is it just like "Well I'll be damned"?
---
‚ÄúPrivate servers could‚Äù except for the majority that couldn‚Äôt. For those that could I‚Äôd be willing to bet they were 1000x more hackable than classic. But more likely than not, the private server didn‚Äôt actually outperform the blizzard server by that much, you simply don‚Äôt have the numbers of actual people involved in each situation to make the comparison
---
Well I play a shaman and constantly aim to stay 50%+ hp because it's a pvp server as well
---
its really a pally weapon for alliance.
---
Note though that this is only how you do the Ony attunement if you're alliance. The horde quests involve Blackrock Spire and don't require you to enter BRD at all.
---
Yee, I was a warlock in Vanilla but druid/shaman through BC so I picked up a bit of knowledge on that all there. The reason for it is just so prot pallys can't spam overheal for agro/use things like LoH for huge agro gen, as it + righteous fury would be too much.
---
Also, are we able to share trade windows?
---
Drink your 50 silver potion that has a 2 minute cool down each and every pull, scrub.
---
DBM works just fine. Not sure if big/little wigs has a working classic version yet.
---
I've looked into this and it doesn't seem to be possible because there is no API for it.
---
The workaround I found is to give ballpark estimates based on skill range.
---
Check Serpent Sting in range-\&gt;display 35 yards (higher if marksman talent)
---
Check Scatter Shot in range-\&gt;display 15 yards
---
Check Wing Clip in range-\&gt;display 5 yards.
---
Yikes. I guess you will never read over an elementary school level. I hope you find some happiness in your dull life.
---
Is there any pre-raid bis list that contains like, levels of pre-raid bis - say the fifth best in slot, fourth, third etc. all the way to absolute bis? I can easily find the like the absolute bis but not a layered list for items I could target in other dungeons? Mostly interested in restoration shaman
---
Swifty was and is greater.
---
Much slower, world of walk craft lol
---
But yeah, it's about experiencing the locations and the story, not so much being steamrolled into end content in a few days.
---
Finding people are friendlier, more helpful. Needs to be a dedicated lfg channel for questing and / or dungeons. 
---
But like regular wow, just put on a movie or tv show in the background, or put on your favorite show and grind out quests or dungeons. Farm leather and ores/herbs to auction for cash, worry about professions at end level lol

I know those gold making guides online are bullshit and aren‚Äôt accurate at all, but I recommend watching this one. There‚Äôs no click bait title and it‚Äôs really not edited at all.

Just focus on getting to 60 and run dungeons for your gear. You don't need an epic mount to do dungeons (what are you gona do with it, save 5 seconds on riding from thorium point to BRM?) and you have to run tons of them anyway and it yields decent gold so you'll have your mount soon enough unless you want to cash out on devilsaur set/epic robes/warden staff/etc.
---
If your class is capable of soloing Maraudon that's very good GPM and most importantly is completely consistent (unless the other faction decides to camp purple entrance for some reason lol).
---
There can be faster ways with professions/flipping stuff on AH but you'll have to figure that out yourself since it's different on every server.
---
The only time a timer quest in wow gave me anxiety.
---
How did you level so fast?
---
Definitely a troll. Dude is pming me acting buttburt, it's so obvious.
---
It isn't ideal, since many raid groups expect the mages to contribute to aoe, and ice block is a really useful defensive cooldown for when something goes wrong.
---
If my memory is correct, I had no trouble matching frost mage DPS, though I did occasionally run into mana issues on longer fights.
---
Holy Priester are, by far, the better healer but most Priests level as Shadow and have no (fundamental) problem healing dungeons, same for Druids leveling as ferals, Shamane/enhancement and Paladins/retribution, but compared to those ypu dont even have to manage a second set of int-gear (since it's your regular gear anyway.) Managing your mana wisely is in the end the most important aspect of healing anyway and using down-ranked heals is key. 
---
You WILL be less effective healing as a shadow priest, but take that as a part of the learning curve.
---
Or stay holy, it's your game, you might enjoy grinding dungeons far more then grinding mobs. I don't say you MUST go shadow, just that you dont need to be a holy priest to be a good healer until 60.
---
2h tank is great through zf. Source: 48 warrior got 4 levels yesterday no-shield tanking zf. The amount of front end threat generated from SS+WW is unmatchable.
---
Humans aren't hunters in classic though...
---
Thank you! I've had so many groups where the DPS thinks they know what they are doing and starts pulling extra mobs and doing stupid, crazy shit. I'm not even going that slow, I'm shooting the next pack before we are finished the one we are currently fighting as long as the healer has a comfortable mana pool. The aoe mages are, frankly, the worst.
---
Awesome, I will do that.
---
Is why i rolled a mage but i will say i didnt exspect to lvl threw dungs so much
---
Few little tricks for druid tanks-
---
HoT yourself up before you pull if you can,  that way you generate extra aggro from healing yourself. 
---
If you run through a group and tab target around to get a hit on a few mobs you can get some good group threat before swiping away.  Don't just run at one mob and try to build up to swipes. 
---
Demoralizing roar does a bit of threat,  but the main benefit is there's no max enemies omit can affect (like there is with swipe), so try to use that early and keep it up. 
---
Keep your rage high by chain pulling as much as your healer can handle.  Druids have great threat generation,  but not so much in bursts the way mages do,  so you want to go into fights with enough rage to get on top of threat and stay there. If you're on the last mob of a group and your healer is good on mana,  just walk right into the next group to keep going. 
---
Mark targets.  Everyone loves AoE spam,  but throwing a skull up can let players know they need to focus a target,  even just the first one while you build rage and group aggro. 
---
Save charge and taunt in case a mob gets at from the group.
---
I just installed ElvUI. How do you get the trade windows from the right panel to be part of the panel on the left?
---
Nah, it's maybe 1/30 groups.  It does happen though and it's always funny to see.
---
I've called in a couple of times over the years, usually for authentication issues, and it's been resolved in under 10 minutes every time. Worth a shot.
---
To each their own. Just want to point out though, that no one can prove it to you if you never let them.
---
Either way, hope you don't whittle down your compatibles too much, then you'll be alone. There's baddies in every class.
---
Even if you're going full Prot you spend your first 11-12+ points into Arms wich leads to you getting Shieldslam in your mid fifties.
---
You gain very little from Prot spec too tho, you might want to look into Fury Tanking just to compare what is considered baseline tanking talents...
---
I'm maining Warrior and imo Prot Talents are a fucking joke and the entire spec is extremely poor designed but hey, I'm still playing it.
---
Also if you're joining spellcleave runs you won't be tanking much anyways so whatever.
---
I wouldn't recommend going for Prot if you're into Quests outside of dungeons / groups. You really want offensive talents in open world and besides double Shieldblock stacks you gain no further noteworthy functionality.
---
Just to extend on what he said, it's arms because of how sweeping strikes works. Your cleave will double up and hit two enemies twice. Your whirlwind will hit four enemies twice. It's pretty bonkers.
---
I‚Äôve never done raiding before. Thought that fire mages were good for that. Why don‚Äôt you think they are?
---
I'm horse so I dont know what the pally life is like for classic. My buddy was a pally tank in bc. And was successful with it. 
---
But BC was the best expansion and should have been the original release. It was balanced as fuck
---
What do you mean?
---
Get enchanting, just lvl it enough for disenchanting items that have a lower vendor price than the shard is currently worth.
---
Get tailoring, save cloth untill you get bag pattern, turn it all in to bags, sell the bags, buy mount at 36 and wait 4 lvls before you can learn the actual skill?
---
Gratz man! Hope you get to help a guildie out or make some gold for your mount.
---
On a side note. Only an opinion, but It seems strange to me to show your own name and guild. It‚Äôs strictly preference.
---
Again, congratulations!
---
But its not political trolling though? For me barrens chat was always just people messing around and saying stupid shit. Never any serious discussions and people being outright toxic and racist. Maybe I do remember it incorrectly, but back in the day barrens chat usually made me laugh. Now it makes me cringe. And laugh sometimes, there's still some golden moments, Ill give it that!
---
Zombie runs sure. But sm where most people first run into spellcleave groups is not much faster. Ulda is definitely not faster. I think mages just see 5 mobs and immediate assume aoe is the best way to clear it and it really depends on what dungeon you're in. Most dungeons are not viable for aoe clearing by an average group.
---
It was the same in TBC, just the dungeons were shorter (although some TBC heroics were harder at launch than any vanilla dungeons).
---
Kirtonos - by far best choice
---
Sulfurus good balance and only 15 min max Q time during peak. Check out our server discord. https://discord.gg/jRpBqD
---
Okay, BRD is a whole nother ballgame, 'cause it's like three dungeons in one. Likewise when Dire Maul comes out someone wanting to do an entirely different wing than the group is advertised for is being a dick.
---
But if someone wants to kill Bly for their quest, kill Bly. Don't be that guy.
---
Why do people who have no clue how private channels work keep replying with flawed facts? You understand that once the leader logs out, a new owner gets assigned right? A RANDOM PERSON
---
This is the kind of dumbed down guide someone like me needed, thank you.
---
That's a good thing to do, but i fully understand people powering through the easy content. They already know what they're against so they can take more liberties with their aggro, while still knowing that later on they'll have to hold back a little bit. If the group clearly can't handle chain-pulls then someone in the group needs to make it clear, and just kick/leave if they aren't listening.
---
I had a mage who kept fscepulling the next two packs then run back to us and frost nova. We just kicked him.
---
I agree, it's not completely worthless - just have to find the right buyer or maybe even someone buying as an 'investment' to flip.
---
Yeah. Mining has been straight garbage for me so far, due to too many other miners. Very common to do a whole lap around a zone checking every spawn and get 0 rich thorium veins. I have found 1 arcane crystal total.
---
Hard = fun is not always true for everyone. At least in the "usual" context of hard &gt; challenging.
---
oK, thanks. Iam not seeing the friends online, when Iam on anyway.
---
&gt; Triggered because they cant get in and are getting left behind in levels and gold/xp hour.
---
It's a videogame my dude. There's no where to be left behind because every hour spent is the same for everyone: pissing away free time. If you think you're achieving something here that's just sad. Find real skills to care about.
---
Yep. It helps a lot if people know how to conserve mana, too.
---
Don't frostbolt the mob at 5% life with plenty of DoTs on it. Don't DoT the mob at 10% life. Be aware of the 5 second rule for regen and try to maximize regen time.
---
It's okay to wand as a mage/warlock, especially as the fight is wrapping up. Don't worry about the damage meter.
---
CC is a good way to conserve healer mana, even if it's an easy pack. Interrupting spells (especially AoE spells) also helps a lot.
---
Try to rebuff one person here and there when you find yourself with extra mana, rather than needing to take a break to rebuff everyone and drink.
---
Purely because company leaders don't respect the role of CS as a department that doesn't actively bring in a positive impact on their balance sheet.
---
This is the sole reason for Twitch's apparent biases. They have quotas, they don't have enough resources. So what you naturally get is a class system governed by the two ancient pillars of civilization: popularity and thirst.
---
If they had the resources they needed you wouldn't need to have either of those to get a fair shake.
---
They are actually *very* important to the reputation of a brand or platform and should always be given the resources they need. Not laid off like blizz did last year.
---
HOES MAD LOLOLOLOL
---
Blizzard-Activision
---
1. Warlock felhunter devouring shield, shaman purging, etc.    
---
2. Avoiding melee range if a ranged class to remove their only CC (aoe fear)   
---
3. Dispelling SW Pain
---
All of these things can be exploited greatly in group pvp if accounted for and played around.     
---
They are still fine, but absolutely have mechanics that hard counter them.
---
So people with free time who want to play should play as slow and non optimal as much as possible?

Welcome to the future, where meta rules and your crying doesn't matter.
---
It was already said this would happen, and it's really not that surprising. You can't tell others how to play the game.
---
Are rare elite mobs really a gold dragon in classic?
---
Because I'm 99% positive I've killed mobs that had the silver elite dragon
---
Sounds about right...
---
If you mean the loot/trade chat tab, just right click and unlock it from the right panel and then left click and drag it over to the left chat tabs.
---
With the improved vw talent I found it held aggro well enough at 25-29. Against strong targets I didn't want to take any hits from I'd just have to pause a couple seconds after dotting for the second torment to hit before proceeding to shadowbolt/wand spam. And if I'm not worried too much about health management I'd just let myself get aggro halfway thorough the fight and the VW will still have taken half the damage for me.
---
Against moderate to easy targets I'd dot one, let vw keep it busy, and go dot another using fear kiting to chain kill mobs so one would always be on the VW while I'm dealing with one or more others or doing minor downtime things like looting and skinning while the dots do efficient damage.
---
Right now though I just hit 30 and now the VW has a new torment rank and can tank a lot easier for now.
---
I think it might have something to do with a small patch implemented last week? Over the weekend, everyone I knew who ran Gnomer was running into this bug. Multiple randoms had experienced it as well as guildies. Out of a couple dozen mines, I only saw one activate properly.
---
Unfortunately retail has slightly corrupted a lot of people in regards to pacing.
---
As a healer, it can get annoying. A 3-4 mob group can easily OOM me, especially when everyone's taking damage. Yet everyone is immediately sprinting towards the next pull and I'm constantly playing catch-up.
---
&gt; Oh. My. God.   Angry wall of text ffs.  If you have better things to do why are you even replying to someone that is looking for conjured consumables?
---
I don't. Might consider it if they offer a high enough price.
---
&gt; Your opportunity cost to click a few buttons is worth how much then?  And that goes back to my original point, if you are expecting a minimum set amount then it is NO LONGER A TIP, it is now a fee, and not even applicable to the original conversation.  
---
Yes, it's a fee. Perhaps you misunderstand the original post's point, it's that people should give set prices rather than tips.
---
&gt; No ego, at all. I‚Äôm not saying your time is literally worthless, you‚Äôre the one acting entitled like there‚Äôs a debt to be paid for conjuring consumables.  
---
You really don't understand the value of time, do you?
---
&gt; By all means, go ahead and try selling your services, you‚Äôll get laughed out of town, even by other mages.  
---
I don't bother, I'd rather go grind and get xp along with the gold.
---
&gt; Hell, even rogues put more time into leveling up their lockpicking skills and they don‚Äôt cry like whiney brats the way entitled little mages do about tips for their services.
---
Opening boxes _is_ how they level. Even if they don't get a tip, they get value from the skill point. Same reason why you often see low-level enchanters offer enchants for tips but high-level ones have a set price.
---
Agreed! I never see people talk about it but I really like it. And it has plenty of different ways to display the data so it's easy to blend it into my elvui or whatever gui you use.
---
Fuck asmongold.
---
Thank you for putting this together. Still haven't installed any addons but will be soon. This will be a great help.

I tank in berserker no problem, have since I got ww at 36.

Just play better or communicate with your party.
---
 /facepalm
---
Yes, there's a (mostly) working one now.
---
&gt; where most of the time there will only be like 1-3 druids
---
To be fair, that's basically all of the 60 druids in the faction online on the server at the time of the raid. 
---
Least popular class be least popular yo

---
As a drain lock I love single target runs. I have infinite mana and we just run from pack to pack with little to no down time and no corpse runs due to the wipe caused by the inevitable agro pull

Definitely get (gnome) engineering for net-o-matic and death ray alongside other gimmicks which are hilarious to use and may or may not be actually useful. Rocket boots! Mind control cap!

Winterfall firewater can be farmed from furbolgs in winterspring at 50+ and makes you character bigger, same with elixir of giant growth (alchemy).

Dust devils in westfall drop magic dust that can put enemies to sleep.

Why would he return? How dare you ask for a return? This is fucked up on many levels. You are responsible for your actions in REAL LIFE. You fuck up, you have to clean it up. Not others. This is why gamers are underachieving bastards in real life as a stereotype. You expect a compensation for your mistakes every time.
---
As a Druid (Teleport: Moonglade spell), I used to have success buying the Runed Arcanite Rod recipe in Moonglade (only place it's sold and it's limited buy), because there's a lot of people too lazy to run out to get it. 
---
I also had a route I would run to grab all of the limited buy recipes for cooking (usually out of the way) and a couple of enchanting and engineering recipes that are way out there.
---
So far I haven't had much success arbitraging those recipes because I think more people today go to Wowhead or ClassicDB than they did in the past.

She is a hunter in-character, as in someone who goes out to hunt animals for meat and leather.

Mechanically, she's a rogue, but that has very little effect on the RP character I play.

You're like the 4th person to ask for a video. I really don't understand how a video would be useful here. Like I said in the post, this addon implements the typical controls found in other MMOs. To put it simply, it's like you're always holding down RMB and you talk to NPCs by pressing F.
---
Just open youtube and search for any MMO that has action combat: TERA, Vindicuts, Dragon Nest, BnS, BDO, Revelation Online, GW2, etc... They all use the same control scheme.

Wait so this is essentially a personal quest maker?! Would be cool if you could shift-click them to add them to the stock blizz quest tracker.

Ravager is a bad tank weapon because you have 0 avoidance during a proc. That's probably the problem in that instance. I 2h tank lib with no problem from like 33-37.

Not intended to share so the layout is god awful, but it might give you a few ideas. I included a lot of picture guides; like fishing/cooking/first aid, all the skills by level for my class, a checklist for end game, map of BRD with bosses, some macros, a progression list for all wands, and a pro/con list I made when I was trying to pick classes. Hope this helps!

---
Decent price.... has 30s left. RIP big guy.
---
I‚Äôd trade the 5/5 in defiance for cruelty. Unless you find agro generation to be a problem.
---
I‚Äôd trade the 2h specialization for improved overpower. Generally you want the crit. 
---
My thinking here is, giving up 3% damage vs burst potential in PvP is worth it.
---
haha, fair enough!
---
Help is essential for modal-healing spells, or else it will enable fail states that do not propagate downwards.
---
&gt;/use [@mouseover,nodead,help][@target,nodead,help][ ] Healing Wave(Rank X)  
---
You want Help in there, because there are cases where [Mouseover,nodead,harm] is true and it will fail.  Now in this case the [] part handles the fail-through, but the help modifier is key for spells that are target agnostic, such as Pennance or Holy Shock.
---
Yep I use the vendor addon and any green item even a couple silver under vendor I'll bid on and just vendor it. It's easy money and it adds up. And it helps prevent me from making the same mistake.
---
Is it supposed to be the lock's cheeks gettin spanked or the succubus slapping her own ass?  Legit asking, I thought it was a whip cracking the whole time!
---
I picked enchanting and tailoring, used all my cloth to level tailoring and de low value greens. I have also been torch farming most of the way from 53-60. I still have 150g so doing ok. Hopefully make back that money in mooncloth down the line.
---
SM is not really the best example as you run into the 5 instance/hour limit. The exp per hour will depend on your level and how much exp you get from 5 instances at your level. Gotta say AoE groups was pretty nice though since you got afk time. We had 6 minute clears of armory so we could afk for 30 minutes every hour. 
---
The difference really becomes blatant at higher levels where the instances are bigger. A melee group will for example not be able to hold 150k/h in BRD. 
---
The biggest difference of all is at max level where time is the only factor. AoE runs are usually more than double the speed in most level 60 dungeons.
---
I was trying to catch the boat in Menethil to join my group at BFD for a run. I wanted to go fast because everyone was waiting for me. I was surprised and happy when I saw the boat there already as I ran up, but I couldn't help but think to myself "It's going to go away as I run up to it". Sure enough, when I was getting closer the boat started leaving the docks. I just barely reached it in time to try for the jump and, of course, I missed the jump. What a sad day for me. At least the people in my group were nice and didnt kick me as I ran to BFD from another continent.
---
Well because you know mc and bwl bosses are immune to fire damage
---
I don't see the sense behind waiting. I know too many people that have stopped Classic and want to come back as soon as BGs and Honor are in, so if they wait for all realms to be on one layer, they will be completely overpopulated on day one again.
---
Nicely done
---
Looks great.  What add ons?
---
This zone gives me so much anxiety. There is no safe place to put your back at. You‚Äôre just surrounded by mobs that hate you, then patrolling fuck you Trexs. To run away you‚Äôre usually running into the path of other mobs.
---
I literally did this for 10 levels.
---
100% agree with avoidance.
---
I'll keep an eye out for 2h tanks without it tonight.
---
I like it, always the damn bears eh.. (Also a fellow bear here as well)
---
I play on a server that has nearly a 10:1 imbalance of Horde over Alliance.
---
As an alliance player, Gadgeztan is almost 100% off limits as it currently stands on all layers unless I hide behind buildings. It's sort of insane. I think if it was a rare thing, it'd be a nuisance/annoyance, but as it stands there is almost always a half dozen players on top of the arena (Including a multiboxer) that just instantly blows people up.
---
Questing is virtually impossible in neutral zones on the server for my faction and now neutral cities are a no-go because of evade exploits.
---
[Group XP](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/group-xp) is a great addon for seeing the XP of everyone in your party, so you can stop asking all the time "how close to level"?

Why do I find people clapping like this on cringy?
---
Being critical of questie does not equal being mad at how others play the game.

Are bear Druids actually unable to main tank raids? I want to tank but I‚Äôm not enjoying classic warrior. I am horde so no paladins either.

I only read the first 2 paragraphs because that's when I, the tank, would have removed the mage from the group *without a word*.
---
Didn't know people had this. My organization is logging in, looking at my lvl/skills/equipment and saying "I should upgrade this one today I guess" and trying to do that.
---
CTmod lets you keep the gryphons.

Don't play on a streamer server. Problem solved. 
---
It's like PvP - you picked that server, you knew what baggage came with it.
---
Actually really good!
---
Wow ten whole levels!
---
I once rode a unicorn, can you believe that?
---
quite surprised that Druids are that high, considering the reputation of people not wanting to bring them in raids.
---
I'm not questioning the viability of it for yourself. More for the poster. If he's asking why should you do it. Then I'm thinking he doesn't have enough experience to try it without some practice with a forgiving team.
---
I'm on Benediction. Care to let me know in a message what it is?
---
It simply doesn't make any sense to cater an item of superior quality to a class that has little to no usage of it.
---
I'm a level 56 mage ya dink

Or maybe he can handle it. Guess you'll have to ask him for his autobiography in a couple years if you really care that much.

Everyone chilling between pulls, drinking and eating, maybe talking. Meanwhile purple psycho in the corner maniacally chunking his own health like a teen with severe attention deficiency.

Honestly the only dots i throw on adds are CoA and corruption. For bosses I swap out CoA with either CoS if you have locks/spriests and CoE with mages. Either way once dots are up I‚Äôd shadowbolt spam bosses and wand adds

Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don‚Äôts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. Days are finalized to be Mondays and Tuesdays, 5-8 PM PST. If you cannot commit to those times, we have a second raid roster on Saturday and Sunday 5-8PM PST. However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 5-8PM PST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can‚Äôt roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won‚Äôt stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who‚Äôs friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you‚Äôre a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you‚Äôre a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla ‚Äì you‚Äôre welcome, and you‚Äôre wanted.

I‚Äôm assuming you understand what the other two replies have pointed out‚Äîthat this addon is for enemy cast bars. That being said, do you use an addon for nameplates (assuming cast bars aren‚Äôt showing on nameplates)? What about unit frames (assuming cast bar not showing on target frame)!

Threat of battle shout is based on the amount of people buffed. If you charge into group of mobs chances are you are the only one in range, possibly 1 more teammate so the threat is quite small.
---
It's not that they didnt drop a hoof. It's that when you killed it you destroyed the hoof

Oh I didn‚Äôt realize you were his official spokesman. Thanks commander on the spectrum! Hot take!

/join LookingForGroup
---
I usually go for 4 CPs, then Bite. 
---
I do go for Bear form if I know I‚Äôm going to be multi-pulling or if there are a lot of casters that heal because I don‚Äôt have a reliable interrupt in Cat.
---
Imp wands?
---
Yikes, unlucky! Nah this has been the case for me on Pyrewood Village (EU) since launch, right from RFC through to where I am now which is like ZF level. I would suggest though joining LookingForGroup (all one word) as that's simplest for group finding.
---
I'm not sure how threat will be now at 60 but leveling I found holding threat to be a pain in my ass. I was always rage starved and everyone blowing burst into whatever target they want.
---
Sorry. Ill elaborate. I didnt leave sm, zf or brd from 26 on. So yes, aoe in 5 mans can give you 100k xp an hour if not more. You can speed run ALL OF ZF IN 11 MINUTES. so you just are dumb.
---
Where are They getting these gross sales figures. I'm 99% sure blizzards financials for august are not publicly available
---
This is completely false. Alcor's is only better on Vael due to its speed and capped rage.
---
What addons you running?? I want this so bad!!
---
What do you dislike about the IcyVeins guide?
---
Funny enough you are the first person to type that. Actually a little upset it took this long
---
If you were on an RP server this deserves some credit
---
I think bartender lets you hide it, show it, or scale it. Not much else flexibility outside of that.
---
Do the private servers have spell batching? I wonder if that has something to do with it. and that one video looks sped up for some reason, shit seems to be moving way too fast.
---
Which is fine. But most people seem to be defining "little to no use" as "is not the top of the meta class for it". I.e. all thunderfuries and sulfuras go to warriors exclusivly, which is what im complaining about.
---
Back in vanilla or classic?
---
I use the line 'hunter lfg \[x\], know how to turn off growl' in hopes of getting picked in chat.
---
So only for horde and no alternative for alliance dang.
---
Whoa someone finally unlocked Rainbow Dash
---
Vanilla
---
ElvUI is definitely NOT for people interested in this list. ElvUI will straight up refuse to let you use the Blizzard skin on some of its modules.
---
yeah if you send them all to a bank alt and forget about them for awhile they will go up in auction price as more people get the pattern. They likely won‚Äôt ever be worth a lot as a lot of players are saving their wicked claws this time around, supply is high, so I can‚Äôt say I would recommend trying to flip them. But if you hang on to them for awhile it won‚Äôt cost you anything and you‚Äôll probably make a decent bit.
---
Mapster will window the map, and is a pretty lightweight addon
---
nice
---
And basically you guys, i dont like being main healer, i can be a secondary healer, but i damn good at healing... but i dont want this role, i want dps... should I pursue spriest? What if I run out of mana in middle pvp when 60?
---
I prefer Pre-Madonna. 
---
I am a man of culture.
---
You are being chased by a walking goldmine üòú
---
Yeah I played in vanilla---&gt;wotlk and came back for legion ...I should of known this lol
---
My opinion, without any actual data to make a truly informed decision, is that I would take an honest look at private servers and consider what they did right, and what myself, as Blizzard could copy and improve upon due to owning the code base.
---
Specifically, I'd look at Nostalrius for WoW and Project 1999 for Everquest - what I would deem as high profile private emulations of "vanilla" experiences in the two big RPGs for the past 20 years.
---
Nostalrius was chugging along with the original timeline from my understanding, which would tell me that there would be 0 reason to release content earlier than the live timeline.
---
P99 EQ, however, was/is a great demonstration of what happens when a vanilla recreation goes stagnant in one expansion for too long. It also is a great example of the bump that happens when the next expansion drops.
---
In my perfect world, they would launch BWL on the original timeline and then launch AQ on the original timeline. THEN slow it down. Bwl -&gt; AQ -&gt; Naxx were massive leaps in progression on vanilla and the game would do well to let AQ sit for a bit longer, let more players and guilds gear up and when things start to go stagnant, then drop the next tier.
---
Then let Naxx sit and when things go stagnant, drop TBC and also drop a new set of vanilla servers. The TBC launch would bring back an influx of people who go tbored and quit throughout the classic timeline. It would bring in an influx of people who ignored classic because they preferred TBC. And it would provide an outlet to people who want vanilla.
---
I think sitting on vanilla forever would be a dumb move - you would see things stagnant horribly and the population on the servers would all die out.
---
Ahh damn. I don't have any other ideas.
---
Does this addon work now? The latest version I d/l from the TukUI site doesn't work for me
---
5 seconds delay? spell batching?
---
Idk man.. But yes they do have some sort of spellbatching, it's a big wonky how it works but the actual gameplay is incredibly smooth because of how it works, and you still get the double CC double charge stuff.
---
As a rogue, I appreciate you.
---
I run with a druid tank who is my buddy. We don't get the benefit of enormous AOE pulls but we have actually had so many people compliment us saying things like, "Smoothest dungeon run I've had in a while."
---
Meanwhile the mages and priests in my group are constantly complaining about groups that just don't know how to spellcleave or are also sick of the giant pulls.
---
Dont get me wrong, I've no doubt that if done well, spellcleave works great. Efficiency is a beautiful thing when done right.
---
Nice and clean, good job. What's the quest tracker?
---
I see they're testing the next Retail Store mount.
---
Zandalar Tribe?!
---
&gt; The tank (me) is dying
---
If you are dying, the healer isn't doing their job.   I prefaced my comments with that caveat.  Agreed that healers that let people die are baddies and need to l2p.  Healers standing in fire(ie, cleave damage), need to l2p.  Letting a health bar get low =/= dying though, and that's what a lot of people are complaining about.
---
The healer shouldn't be dps'ing to get bigger numbers, they should be dps'ing to conserve mana.  Different intent.  It's not about going faster because it doesn't impact drinking frequency, it's about having an extra cast when the mage aoe's or hunter pet aggros.
---
I totally agree, it was just a joke.
---
If I was in op's position of be writing a complain as well
---
The real reason not to invite a dps warrior is that you can get all the dps plate for yourself.
---
"play the game wrong"
---
Is that really enough to make you healable, or are you paired with an exceptional healer? If I saw a tank in a 5 man without a shield as a healer,  I'd nope the hell out of that. It will be way too much work.
---
Well excuse my ignorance but this discussion was originally started about sulfuras and it was brought to TF as a bad example because i thought it saw about the same amount of use. Also, i originally excluded progression raid groups from the discussion(because obviously they want to max-min) and it seems like youre bringing it back to talking about progression raiders
---
Im currently lvl 40 and have tanked many dungeons with pure arms talents. 
---
Many people do big aoe pulls with mages anyway. 
---
You dont need to think about prot talents until 60 in my opninion
---
And they said shaman dps was poor! Bah!
---
Yeah I realize that but I appreciate it.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295238/classic-wow-world-first-sulfuras-hand-of-ragnaros
---
So it could be North America first?
---
Nah it really wasn't. BfA is just Legion os steroids and what part of that is great? 
---
I really don't know why but Legion is the most overrated expansion after MoP.
---
Classic + classic + ! ! !
---
Just go 2h arms for leveling (axe spec), and keep a 1h+shield for dungeon tanking (and for using shield bash before you learn pummel). Since you're arms, you can save your rage when you switch stances, so charging in, switching to defensive and just spamming sunder+revenge on all mobs will be most effective.
---
Do NOT dual wield while leveling.
---
Do NOT level as protection.
---
Edit: Here's the spec I'm leveling as. I'd put the 5 in protection once you have 5/5 in Cruelty. Best to get the defense skill over block chance so you get some benefit while soloing as well. Go arms first until you have mortal strike. Make sure to wait to get Impale until you at least learn Whirlwind.

ps. did your guildie ninja alliance warlock bis mount? shame on him;)
---
raiding in classic is like the most casual shit ever bro you're fine
---
But do you have a Karen haircut as well?
---
Yeah, I keep seeing people hoping for a Classic+ remake of Karazhan, Uldum, Gilneas, etc. but I‚Äôm afraid that is would feel a lot like the recreations of the TBC zones that they put in WOD, which I wasn‚Äôt a fan of. I‚Äôd like to see fresh Classic+ content but I‚Äôm not sure where they could even bring us that they aren‚Äôt already planning on adding to retail.
---
Cause you start out with minimal training to do what people are calling in for. Then when you see training on your scedule and you think "cool, i might know how to fix 'x' now". But the training turns out to be all about trying to sell more shit, instead of fixing the issue the customer called in for.
---
Dominos lets you fiddle with xp bar, but if you‚Äôre using bartender it seems silly to have both.
---
Thanks for the recommendation !
---
Bartender, z-perl, titan panel, bagnon, questie, (some config of sexymap?) and the cast bar i dunno
---
Oh well Quartz works with less work and I know quartz as I've used it in retail and it's been around awhile.
---
Looks like I gotta update mine! Thanks again for all your hard work on this!
---
Most people who hot 60 in the first 2 weeks are rich, and if they're bot they're clueless.
---
I easily got over 1.5k gold doing herbing/mining in that time.
---
3 but I don't think they intersect so you kinda end up doing the same one over and over, the obvious choice being the kill quest.
---
Hell yes
---
I think there used to be an addon like this that worked for guildies
---
It's literally a must have for rogues but ok
---
Looking for an add-on that will drop in a 4x2 or something similar cluster of action buttons, so i can put potions and emotes on it for quick pvp fights. Anyone know anything?
---
I've know %t since vanilla but I've never heard of the rest! Thank you!!!
---
Shift does let you compare but and addon should give you the stat crunch between gained and lost.
---
&gt; They also don't bring too much to raids though.
---
they do nearly as much dps as warriors while not competing for warrior loot, they have some occasionally-useful cc, and they have a threat dump which warriors do not
---
not sure what else you'd want a pure dps class to bring to a raid besides that
---
Here\`s a simple script:  
---
/oom  
---
/yell HEAL OUT OF MANA
---
Only if you arent already on a gc.
---
HS is absolutely not better lmao. Rend does more damage and costs like 40% of HS.
---
I'm a mage, so I don't personally have any problems with this whole Gadgetzan thing actually, but I know that a lot of people do. Getting ganked isn't the problem, i'm not here complaining "wah wah wah, I got polymorphed off my mount and dogpiled", it's a neutral safe town. You absolutely can and are supposed to be able to raid the town, but the downside is losing reputation by killing the guards. Circumventing that downside is the problem.
---
It is right there in the article you linked:
---
Update: Apparently LongDD of the Chinese guild Old Boys, made up Dota 2 veterans,¬†created the weapon¬†even earlier on September 17th, three days after looting the eye.
---
I almost always attack the other faction if I have CDs up because I know I can win.  However sometimes you want to get your quest done so you finish quest then kill em on the way out...seems like the allys always outnumbered so they rarely initiate PvP anyway
---
I don't understand how people are so extremely obsessed with min-maxing everything, maximum efficiency, no time wastes allowed, everyone prefers their own pace but it isn't exactly how I visioned classic.
---
Laughs in dazed, drowning gnome
---
Red = Dead
---
Thanks mate seems like alot of time went into this picture I hope it was worth it.
---
You will likely need to go back and gather to get the levels up. There will be no Peacebloom/ Copper nodes/ low level beasts to skin in higher level areas. The good thing is, you can make some good money from the materials you gather, even if you just end up vendoring them.
---
That's where the pigs get all theur booze from?
---
Thanks! I'll add this aswell
---
I like the wand progression idea.  I think once I start leveling an alt I'll try to do something similar
---
Well done lol
---
You goofy. The unlikely option is a Classic+. Classic+ means too many different things to different people, and of course no-change psychos gotta yell their inane bits as the majority slowly comes around for changes. 
---
TBC and Wrath are almost inevitable. TBC and Wrath were the peaks of playerbase so for many players those things are just part of WoW. Personally, TBC and Wrath = retail and I'm not sure how the nochanges nerds deal with that, but even TBC is massive departure from Classic that turns some portion of people away.
---
I just checked IcyVeins, you must've read the PvE DPS Enhancement guide, not the PvP one; the PvP one puts some 20 odd points into Elemental, not Resto.
---
So how are rogues farming gold? I just turned 60 and tried pick pocketting BRD (with both stealth talents!). Well, i get resisted every 5-10 mobs. Vanish doesnt always work (they still attack me) so I literally can't farm. I also read somewhere that Razorfen Downs doesnt give you much in classic aswell (unlike on private servers).
---
Any tips?
---
&gt; Its the dps. They open up too fast and too hard on every single pull.
---
I just got to 60 a few nights ago. I tanked every dungeon. I am now MTing Rag and Onyxia.
---
Your comments are not my experience. The worst offenders of threat ripping are mages but the smart ones know when to nova.
---
&gt;Los pull? Forget it, the dps has attacked every single mob 2-3 times before they even reach the tank.
---
This happens sometimes. Good tanks know to pay attention to which targets are getting creamed and which targets are *not*. Spread threat to the ones that are not getting destroyed. Taunt and mocking blow the ones that are getting ripped. You may be forced to abandon a target in favor of stacking a few extra sunders on individual targets to contain the threat imbalance but this is hardly the case for *every single fight in the game.*
---
You're being extremely excessive in your description of how bad DPS are when it comes to ripping threat.
---
And if you are finding that is the case here are a couple options for you.
---
1. Pull early while your casters are still drinking, giving yourself a little buffer time before they are ready to go ham. This means pulling about 20% mana ahead of where you normally would, so that they are forced to sit and drink more while you have time to build threat.
---
2. Ask your DPS to slow down and give you time. I've found simple honest communication without being rude or demeaning goes a long way in getting your DPS to behave.
---
3. If one DPS has been asked repeatedly to stop ripping aggro and keeps doing it, focus target enemies not going after him. Let another one or two through and let his ass die and then blame him for ripping threat.
---
4. Get better at your rotation because if the above 3 options aren't working, then it's probably you who is the problem.
---
&gt;Mark targets huh? 9/10 the dps just ignore that.
---
9/10 DPS?
---
You're really being extreme here. This has not been my experience and speaking for other tanks in my guild this has not been a problem most of the time. Sometimes? Of course. 9/10 times? That's a fucking lie.
---
&gt;Its impossible for a tank.
---
No, it's just more difficult when your team starts building threat first or right after you engage. A *good* tank can learn to work around that or learn to properly communicate and guide their team to stop doing that.
---
&gt;That's just the way classic is, yeah it sucks, but you can't tell the dps anything. They dont wanna hear it.
---
I have done exactly that and my DPS has listened.
---
Maybe you've got a problem where you are too mean when telling people how to improve. I take a light hearted and most importantly *kind* tone with my group members to let them know they made a mistake but can easily error correct by simply making a few short changes.
---
&gt;It's a problem every single run.
---
**Have you ever heard this saying? If everywhere you go it smells like shit, maybe it's time to check your own shoes.**
---
You either need to get better at the game or you need to get better at kindly communicating your concerns to your group mates.
---
Saying 9/10 DPS are trash makes you sound like a scrub who can't be bothered to admit maybe, *just maybe*, they are not 100% perfect Mega-Professional All-Star WOW playing extraordinaire and have a little room for personal improvement.
---
You don't want to be that person who sucks at the game and then blames everyone else and never admits they might have made a few mistakes themselves. You need to learn your role better.
---
I'm good at tanking and a kind lenient group mate who never yells or screams or whines at his party members..... and I haven't had half the problems you've seemed to encounter.
---
I saw me in there. FPS was around 12. It was neat to see a big crowd. Some horde came to watch.
---
I'd rather actually, you know, *play the game* at some point.   It is a game after all and not a internet forum.  If all you want to do is chat, well there's plenty of social media platforms or even the phone. 
---
But that wasn't really my point.  My point is that 70% of time in a dungeon is doing nothing (e.g. watching auto attacks, drinking, waiting for next pull, walking, etc) doing it "the right way".  Classic dungeons so far have been by far the most mind numbingly boring content I've played in my time in wow (wrath -&gt; MoP).   The biggest challenge is resisting the urge to actually do something.   Because if you try to so something that's actually fun or challenging, you're rewarded with a nice long boring walk.
---
What happens in a couple weeks?
---
000
---
Necrosis does that for warlock mount ups. I always turn it off though as it's super annoying!
---
Im pulling aggro, i turn off growl to make sure the pet doesnt. I think i was 2 lvls up on the tank, the mobs were lvl i think 28? I was lvl 29. Im a beast master spec.
---
I'm looking to toggle names with a macro or keybind, but not nameplates. Those are a different feature.
---
[Here is an example](https://i.imgur.com/IcvpMaO.png) of Names (top) and Nameplates (bottom). What I'm meaning to do is turn both of them off to display nothing above the NPCs, without having to open Interface Options &gt; Names and tick the boxes every time.
---
Bingo.  I guess it's a fairly regional rural Texas saying.
---
Must go faster...
---
yeah in disc tree.
---
Your best bet is likely going to be your server discord if there is any.
---
If you think your servers LFG channel is too full, how do you think a discord for every server is going to look? It'll be thousands of times worse
---
It should be. I used to kite Gamon a fair bit on my Warlock by spamming CoR, got him all the way to Moonglade on my best attempt. Route was Org -&gt; Durotar -&gt; Barrens -&gt; Ashenvale -&gt; Felwood -&gt; Moonglade. At the time I thought this was the furthest I could take him, because lifts would cause him to evade so I couldn't head south. Later I realised it IS possible, just requires an extremely scenic route- Org -&gt; Durotar -&gt; Barrens -&gt; Stonetalon -&gt; Desolace -&gt; Feralas -&gt; 1KN -&gt; Tanaris -&gt; Un'goro -&gt; Silithis. I never got a chance to do this before he was made elite, but someone else had the same idea and I've seen proof of it done.
---
SO. The query I have with OP's image is how the hell someone got the mob onto the elevator, and then off again, without having him evade. A carryover from retail code where elevators don't break pathing perhaps? I'm also curious about why he's just chilling out. Could be related to the elevators, like he can't find a valid path home or something. Likely just evading in OP's picture.
---
Leveling is an absolute joke with that spec actually. Im finding I can take down mobs 3-4 levels above me with no problem and there is pretty much no downtime with Spirit Tap.
---
I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôll go Shadow at 45 like I was planning since I‚Äôm not sure I could get more efficient than I am.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d8d5lf/tethrys_egy_csicska/). 
---
Indeed. In spellcleave tank's job is to pull and gather the mobs in one lump, not actually tank, because it's impossible to do so, not because of threat issue but because no one can take that much damage. After the mobs have been grouped up it's the job of mages to snare, root, kite and aoe and that's why you want at least 2 with some other aoe dps of preferably 3. Some drop the tank completely and use warlock to pull with eye.
---
RIP clothie.
---
&gt; The only talents you need for leveling is first 5 in Spirit Tap, next 5 in Wand Specialization. 
---
I literally had this and 2 points in Healing Focus and was on the fence about all my other talent points for a few levels. I ended up going to Mind Flay after a PvP encounter (because no one wants to cast smite and lock out the holy school).
---
Damage meters don't have a heals received option?
---
MC trash is legit harder to deal with than most bosses. I'm not belittiling the bosses, but we haven't wiped on one so far whereas we've had a few wipes because we pulled something accidentally.
---
Never forget Necrosis. I'm so happy to have it back!!!!
---
Just have a buzzer sitting in front of you for every character....  
---
That does sound like a bit of fun
---
My experience so far as a priest that has never ever ever healed (and has told every group this) is that every tank I've had has wanted to rush and pull as much as possible, and they do not check mana levels or even give ready checks. 
---
I'm not enjoying dungeons as a priest so far, though I did DPS/off heal a group that had two warriors fighting to tank which was weird but fun at least.
---
Haha, I was in STV with four other Sparkmetal Coif wearers. Coif Bros unite!
---
I prefer combuctor as it looks more like the actual bag frames
---
Last night I took my level 36 priest to Scarlet Monastery. I'd been drinking since noon and spent most of the day in Stranglethorn, and figured a mellow dungeon run might be the best way to cap the evening. Little did I know that, a nano-second after announcing my candidacy for a healing position, I'd be invited into a "spellcleave" group.
---
My first hint that something was wrong, was by the number of mana bars. There were five mana bars. Four Undead and myself, the Troll. Hm. I spoke up; "Listen, fellas," I said, "I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade here, but we seem to be lacking a tank."
---
The three mages and the warlock got a good chuckle out of this. Their leader walked me through it. "Your job is to shield this eyeball," she said. "And then shield us, too, when the shit goes down."
---
"Sure thing!" I said, fully prepared for said shit show -- and my total abandonment of it. My group was clearly hopped up on dangerous drugs. But the zone wall was right there. I could be out of this drug-fueled nightmare in seconds. So why not stick around and observe, for scientific purposes, the Internet neanderthal in its native habitat.
---
I shielded the eyeball and watched it zip down the hallway and out into the courtyard. It never returned. But soon a horde of Scarlet warriors descended upon us. And I experienced what they call a Come to Jesus moment. These degenerates were on to something! It was a massacre. I tossed shields left and right as the icicles rained down and the bodies dropped.
---
In short, we did this several times. It was frighteningly efficient. Eventually the leader intimated that she could no longer waste her time in the cathedral. She had a greater calling, in Zul'Farrak, and bid us all a fond farewell. The group dissipated, and I stood out in the dungeon lobby, wondering just what in God's name had happened. Would I ever be able to adjust to a normal dungeon run again? I decided it was best to get into one of these normal groups pronto, before I could let this insane new method get to my head.
---
The next invite came from a group full of warriors and a shaman and they all had Herod axes. The hundred stack of conjured waters the mages of the spellcleave group had summoned for me vanished in no time. As they spun around like imbecile children, I felt the pain of losing that previous group. After we managed to clear the dungeon, they asked if I wanted to go again. I said, No, can't do it, sorry, it's getting late... But what I meant was, You fucking fools! God help the next poor son of a bitch gets roped into this charade!
---
Thanks. I thought I was missing the joke since he kept writing the same redundant sentence over and over.
---
Tuned in for 30 seconds because people were spamming about Asmon. Saw him get gold from tons of random people standing around, probably in some slight hope he might acknowledge their existence if they give him their money. Clicked X again.  
---
What a joke all of this is.
---
Yep. It‚Äôs really impressive how far out of their way they‚Äôll go to no see the problem. Opened a ticket a few months ago about the Druid glyph for sentinel  owl disappearing when I switched to lunarwing (or away from it, I don‚Äôt remember) and I got some horseshit about how glyphs don‚Äôt apply if you switch specs.
---
Nowhere in my ticket did I say anything about switching specs. In fact I even specified that I hadn‚Äôt switched specs bc I figured it would be part of the troubleshooting process for the gm who got the ticket
---
Just go fury/arms until end game when you feel like you need it most.  There‚Äôs no need to go Prot spec until end game.  Just focus on leveling and  getting your BiS items for dps and tanking.
---
Does anyone have any addon recommendations for tracking the timer on energy ticks for rogues/feral druids?
---
I know the offical servers has batching and that creates a "delay". There was a few posts by PServer PVPer's bitching about it. Basically the official "classic" spell batching is way longer than what the pservers was. 
---
Also that video was sped up (if you slow it down to .75 speed it looks perfectly normal), however it was still 100x smoother than the official servers.
---
You're amazing. Haven't tested with this version but I noticed one bug in the previous one! Different characters have different to-do lists, but the number of pending tasks that show up when you log in is account wide.
---
Feature request is a /command that only opens the window, or only closes it. Not a toggle. Id love a macro that would open the Todo window when I start to hearthstone, but right now I can only toggle :)
---
I play hunter and I have not lost against a warlock yet, the big thing to watch out for is the pet using intimidate. I've canceled a lock trying to fear by using that Everytime, stunned for 3 sec lets me get an auto shot and multi shot off for big damage and throw in a serpent sting or concussive shot for slow. Lock could try fearing pet and get it off but by then I have done a lot of damage to the lock and if they try to fear me I can just feign death mid cast to cancel it. After that lock is dead. Biggest way to deal with them like other comments said, fear pet, nuke hunter but really gotta be careful of the pet stun
---
Sucks man, all of warrior threat is determined by rage gen, which is determined by getting hit. Without getting hit, war threat is poo. 
---
I‚Äôve outright refused to group with Pug mages after my last BRD run. I‚Äôm fine with any other class(other than insta multishot hunters) üòÇ

Hopefully I just made a person's day, instead of helping a gold farmer inflate the economy

Thank you for your replies.

Rogue is the class I always wished I was when I played Priest originally. Their gear looks great, dual weapons look great.. I just found it disheartening that I got rejected from 75% of groups I'd ask to join, what this is down to I can't say for sure but someone in my guild in mid 50's was complaining the same issue. Levelling speed wasn't exactly bad but Rogues live and die by their weapons and there really wasn't much choice that I found. I'm level 37 still using the BRD quest reward and a dagger I picked up from the AH at level 21. I know there is RFD / SM quest swords coming up but.. how will I ever find a group to do the quests for these? Levelling has not been particularly enjoyable and StV open world PvP has been the highlight so far. 
---
I think these issues have been compounded by the fact that I feel.. weird.. playing Horde. The cities are strange, I don't know the zones very well / at all, it's kind of uncomfortable honestly. On top of that I rolled onto Firemaw with a guild I was chatting over discord with for 6 months but while most of them took 2 weeks off to grind 60 ASAP I got left behind with IRL stuff and have been kind of cut off.. which is fine there is plenty of other communities but I don't feel like fretting over queues is actually for a reason now and a fresh start may be just what I need. 
---
I did play Priest for many years and so I am quite happy with the style of play etc. But.. having said that I am majorly considering Warlock because I have never ever tried that hero.
---
I suppose for advice, well I am grateful for any but mostly with regards realm choice as I have only played Firemaw so far which has guaranteed queues every evening and is far too crowded out in the world.
---
At least blur out the GM's name. I dont think witch hunting is allowed here
---
There is a quest in the Barrens like this. Except he also takes breathers from exhaustion and talks about how fast he is.
---
Healer here. No complaints so far.
---
One mage youtuber does a guide on AoE pulls. Now it becomes the norm and only way....
---
....you realize the issue isn't that players can't get up there, but the guards can't? THAT'S the problem.
---
This comment caused my face to begin twitching.
---
Commenting so I can find this later
---
Yeah that druid name is pretty rare to get.
---
Sure dude blame "retail kids" for the fact that you can't hold aggro
---
i've been there before.  You just assume that you'll kill it and be able to heal afterwards.  That's how it goes 99% of the time.
---
Doesn't work Im afraid which is ashame only humanoids.
---
And yeah Ik an experienced hunter would see the pet attacking a dummy but most won't so it won't wirk even as a half assed trick?
---
Yarp dead zoning a Hunter is the worst....for them.
---
Yes if they do classic+ instead of BC I would hope class balance would be at the top of the list.  Everyone pretty knows it was awful in vanilla including blizzard and at that point there would be no #nochanges garbage against better balance.
---
Yeah that's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. You guys are all friends who know each other, can even joke with each other mid-fight but everything is all co-ordinated, people are making calls, everything just blends in smoothly.
---
Vs a pug group where it's really a box of chocolates.
---
\*GRONK\* swim swim swim...
---
is there a expected release date on world ranked pvp? I want to get some Hks so bad.
---
I hopped on retail during the classic beta, it was awful.
---
I was just making a comment. I‚Äôm not mad that you use questie, even if I think it‚Äôs silly.
---
Lol. Welcome to Classic, bud.
---
If you right click on your chat tab, go to settings you can turn it on/off and is one of the 4 default channels. It just is off by default.
---
Priest/warrior.
---
What is the dead zone?
---
If you need to ask how to do it you should just stick to the twitch app.
---
You are in for a painful life if this broke you.
---
I say it out loud. 
---
I am the tank. It‚Äôs a lot easier to replace them than it is me. 
---
Now my guild is big enough I don‚Äôt have to do PUGs at all and it‚Äôs a lot less common in guild runs.
---
IM about to be lvl 30 arms warrior.  Meaning I have 2/2 Impale and 1/1 sweeping strikes.
---
I dont like to tank, and I plan on trying to do as much dungeon-based leveling as possible.  So I want to maximize perhaps aoe/cleave.  I think early 30s I get whirlwind, and then, of course, the axe....
---
I see my Orc racial plus SS + whirlwind as perhaps being the combo im looking for.  
---
As I add more points, should I consider branching into fury maybe?  so by 60 I would be 21/x/0 ?  (and then after 60 respec ill be whatever i am then)?
---
The quest "In Dreams?"
---
It is funny looking at the spell batching post on the bug forum and seeing mostly poaitive responses to it. After experiencing it, I wonder how many people still feel that way.
---
Agreed, some methodology would be nice. It seems pretty legit and all, but who knows for sure?
---
I tell my healers to just not heal me when I do this, no real point when I just suck back all my life in the next pull
---
somebody tried to buy up the market on 10-slot bags a week and a half ago on my server
---
i was like "okay cool have fun throwing money away buying up my bags at 15s under your price to keep the market under control" and then i spammed sm cath for an entire weekend and threw 20 bags on the AH
---
he bought them all
---
lmao thanks for financing my mount idiot
---
the down side of trying to aggressively control markets on the AH is that if somebody comes along with a lot of the thing you're trying to price regulate, you can either fuck your wallet up buying every unit they list to keep the price where you want it, or all the money you spent buying up the market previously is now wasted and you lose your deposits too lowering your prices to compete
---
hi i'm /u/meowtiger and i'm from eve online
---
*please* try and manipulate my AH
---
I hope this is satire.
---
What exactly are you trying to get people's thoughts on? How good they are? How much it helps out one of the classes? Which is the fastest overall?
---
In vanilla locks would always try to duel my on my mage, with their felhunter out.  I have zero chance of winning that so I would just try to kill their pet before losing.
---
Gay
---
I guess I leveled ahead of all the zoomers and retailers because I never once got into a group that even so much as mentioned any kind of "cleave" or "aoe" or "pull everything" or "meta".
---
If you are referring to quest givers / quests that aren't there, it's because they aren't in the game yet.  They are released in later phases.
---
1 silver???? i spend up to 5g on that stuff every day
---
If you can, do BRD at 51-52, on priest you can do everything until Bael'gar and then you're on the bosses that lv60 will always farm.
---
But even if you dont have the time dont worry, 2 months isnt much, in 2 months I think we will still have lots of new 60's.
---
Just imagine anybody who happens to be reading this, just picture this is a 25 year old adult.  Been out of high school for almost 8 years.    Imagine being this guy.
---
I have healed it at 48, was rough. But recently been healing it at 52.
---
Could you share you backpack addon?
---
True, except for the part where you said he's a good player. For someone who's played something like 20k hours on warrior, it's pretty painful to see him never use taunt or shield wall or good macros. Every other warrior streamer is much better than him at the game
---
Yeah, it's kind of mind blowing that people are legit accepting the idea that mages should be paid for something like that. It's also mind blowing that mages think it's appropriate. I play a mage and it's never occurred to me to charge some for water/food. I mean, I recall tipping for portals when not in a group/heading to the same place the mage is going. But, that made sense given they had to pay for reagents. I guess we paid for the skill? But that still seems silly...everyone pays for all of their skills too! We don't pay priests for shields or renews!
---
vuhdo works if you want something a bit more customisable
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vuhdo
---
im using the alpha as a priest and have added custom markers for eg weakened soul
---
Well I know what I'm doing all week.
---
Even if we assume absolute best case of mage vs 2 warrior, my money would still be on the warriors if they are pvp geared/specced (all though it would be close). If you swap any other class in there like priest/hunter/rogue/druid than that + warrior will easily beat a single mage, no how matter good the mage is, even if they don't have pvp trinkets. 
---
Pretty much every single pvp video montage you'll ever find of them beating multiple opponents relies on the opponent not in pvp spec/gear, being vastly outgeared, and or playing badly.
---
But you could just kill all the guards in the city.. And people are getting warned/reported just for standing in places not even killing. People are getting reported for ganking from intelligent locations even without terrain/evading guards. If I slip thru a guards aggro range in an intelligent way, people call it an exploit. It's getting out of hand.
---
The cost is 1000 for mount and 20 for riding. If you have honoured that becomes 900 for mount and 18 for riding.
---
I highly recommend adibag. I tried arkinventory and bagnon. Used bagnon in retail forever but adibag is by far the best imo.
---
As a mage that is always OOM. I wish my tank would slow down.
---
op will need to be put on suicide watch once they reach hillsbrad/stv.
---
It must be
---
No sweat. Keep in mind, since there are no coordinates in a dungeon, the map will not show your current location. But, at least you won't have to alt+tab out to get an idea. Also, check out https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/the-guide
---
It also shows the dungeon maps with suggested routes.
---
Head to un‚Äôgoro crater, and along the main river that is there, there is a crashed boat you can loot that gives a little crate. When you open the crate it will have multiple items. One of which is a photograph of two gnomes. Very unique because I believe it‚Äôs the only photograph in all of wow.
---
If you do the quest chain as well you also get a pretty unique sword.
---
Re-read my post.
---
Yes, gms of all ranks got  flat raise across the board. I literally listed the office location, which makes me question if you read my post.
---
Tidal charm FTW! (First time I ever checked for him, killed him, dropped haha)
---
No joke, I vendored my gd verdant keepers aim and bought a griffonwing longbow due yo random breaking of scattershot from this. I will now never use any ranged weapon that has a proc on it.
---
HAVE PEOPLE LOST ALL DECENCY
---
a heinous crime
---
Not drowning is great.
---
PepeHands
---
Shaman main here.
---
Weapon buffs are personal preferance as the kill time/eficiency are minimal. And if you are not a hardcore play it does not matter.
---
Personally i use rockbiter because i can predict the number of auto attacks I need to kill the mob. Just feels good to know and easier to manage mana if I can plan that.
---
While leveling you should use whatever you got the highest rank reacently. Again I vote for rockbiter.
---
Just remember if you are a Dps in a dungeon don't use rockbiter because you will get aggro all the time.
---
in classic, this only applies to raids unfortunately
---
I mean...that's where I am. I don't ask mages for water because I understand that it is inconvenient and takes time, but I also don't want to spend the amount of money on it that would justify their time.
---
I also don't buy it from vendors, because it costs even more money.
---
I mostly try to get by on autoattacks as much as possible... I know it's actually less efficient but spending gold on mana "feels" worse.
---
Yeah we‚Äôre slightly more casual. I‚Äôm leveling 3 toons at once and the tank is my main but I‚Äôm not in any rush to grind out to 60. 
---
Plus when the GM dropped a Green Tower (purple shield) on me when I was like 35, that‚Äôs the kinda shit I couldn‚Äôt get if I was already near maxed :D
---
New to the game, but is there any addon that would display the droptable and dropchances of npcs you encounter?
---
Ony wasn't too bad because your butt was in a wall to begin with so you didn't run usually *that* far, but she was annoying to get positioned again if you did and folks had to be super breath/tail-conscious in the meantime.
---
The only other things I can think of that I wasn't allowed to tank regularly (other than "no, you have to decurse" fights ;p) was Maggy and Nef but I think they would have let me try Nef if we hadn't had people hiding from that "I don't have a cloak" thing (forgot name) so they were really worried about his positioning.
---
So it was *possible* to have a no-fear-ward bear do it, it was just (like /u/Mtitan1 said) kinda risky.
---
Feel like we need to report for potential self harm. I mean this is tame beyond what is coming.
---
Taunts do work if their pet is aggressive or defensive but most good hunters would have their pet on passive.
---
Can't enable healing floating combat text even though advanced interface option says that's an option. There is no floating combat text option under addon interface. Anyone know how to solve this?
---
You maybe could put the dummy down before they click to target you and just stand behind it hoping they accidentally put focus on that thinking its you xD might work rarely but would be hilarious
---
!remindme three hours
---
It definitely works with textures, not sure about other stuff.
---
It was still TBC, which had 5 major cities per faction. So there was probably less people in the Azeroth cities than there was in Outlands. Plus depending on the server you were on, not everyone might of got involved either. I know some PVE and RP servers at times don't put up much of a fight (esp on Tuesdays when everyone is raiding), at least in my experience doing it as Horde against the Alliance.
---
That's exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
---
Level an alt, make a twink, level your professions, play the AH. So many opportunities.
---
/cast feign death  
---
/pet passive  
---
/cast freezing trap
---
works if you spam the shit out of it but theres still a delay. Scatter shotting in to that works perfectly tho.
---
I‚Äôve never played WoW before Classic. I haven‚Äôt done anything extra to make money. I‚Äôm at 60g at level 38 from just selling stuff to vendors that I find in dungeons and other random loot. Sure, I probably won‚Äôt have 90g by the time I hit 40 but I don‚Äôt get why so many people struggle to get their first mount.
---
Yeahhhhh, they honestly most likely wouldn‚Äôt even respond to this request. Some players are just dicks. If this is going to get to you, wait until someone ninja loots you. You‚Äôll be pissed
---
Right?  Can't have a mage function as they are supposed to (sheeping, not taking threat, mana efficiency) and also have them topping damage charts.  Either you want them to top damage and have to deal with them taking threat or you want them to be good mages and have to deal with lower damage output.  Can't have it both ways.
---
TLDR: Yes but lack of sunders and less threat
---
Just get better. In order for a lock's DoT to tag a mob it first must to damage \~1 second or so after applying which is more than enough time for a melee attack (or a charge). Most of the time we steal tags from locks because of that reason (not on purpose) but sounds like you have to be a little faster.
---
Some addons dont work with twitch, no need to be hostile
---
&gt;You can use google
---
I don't have to though. If you say something as crazy as classes are 2x as strong at a base level in 1.12 than they were then it's your responsibility to back that up. Until then everyone can easily just say "nah" and it's as strong of an argument as yours. 
---
&gt;it literally improved their damage so much it was doubled because ya know the tree was a melee one originally.
---
There're very very few hunters in these crazy runs in Classic. They're what? Mages, Rogues, Locks, and warriors mostly. One spec of one class getting a huge buff ‚â† every class is 2x as strong. 
---
&gt;Because I played them
---
So you remember your exact dps numbers as well as the gear level from 15 years ago?
---
Red Meth OD
---
Not so much as the Arcane Crystals.  And the transmute cooldowns, of course.  I'm just using thorium as an easy example because, well, I'm a miner and it's the first thing that comes to my mind.
---
Sulfuron Ingots have a high drop chance, having a few coordinating guilds and some people farming resources, and that's not hard.
---
Even if you had infinite rage and did nothing else, 5 sunders on 6 mobs would take 45 seconds to apply.
---
Anyone want to place a bet on whether mages of this sort are going to be able to control themselves for 45 seconds sitting there doing nothing while this gets set up?
---
World first raiding, optimized raiding, racing, rank focused BGs.
---
It would be cool if each character had its own tab. That way if say you have your main as an engineer but your alt is the miner, you can check how many bars you need to send over.
---
Also it would be cool if we could share our lists or like recount, have it print our list in the chat.
---
Most Alliance comment I've ever seen
---
I rushed 60 so I can farm MC on my main. I've got alts to take my time and level with. To each their own.
---
We like to party?
---
Theres a new update on the [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher that says wow classic maintenance will be 7-8.
---
As a horde hunter, I distinctly remember cheering for this change. Call it jealousy or whatever, but I was happy. And that was pre normalizatuin, too, so you could get gigantic aimed shot crits right out of stealth.
---
\^exactly. I try to make sure the healer knows what life tap even is, and remind them that I can take care of myself.
---
Who spams damage tables in lowbie dungeons?  That alone warrants a boot!
---
retailers make me hate running dungeons!
---
Yeah, it's just about what you're comfortable on. When I'm playing a tank, I feel the same way you do on a DPS. But when I'm on DPS, I've got tons of tricks and habits I've built up over the years that make the experience comfortable and easier for me. I played DRG for several years, then switched to SAM, and once I learned the new rotation it was just like playing DRG, but with less positionals.
---
There are a lot of people who didn't come back for Classic who might play Wrath. This is by no means the maximum number of people who are interested in legacy content.
---
Servers are also going to die down the line when all the content has been released, unless they do Classic+, which would split the playerbase anyway.
---
Customer service is the first thing to go in a failing company

You can disable 90% of the things it re-skins, not to mention all the options you have in the way in which the re-skinned things look. If you wanted, you could get a pretty vanilla feeling setup with it.
---
OP's post history is mostly just a lot of really poor trolling attempts.
---
This is what I was thinking. 
---
I specifically remember attacking ?? Players to help others, and the only goal there was to land a cc to interrupt so the higher level of my faction would be able to win. 
---
Now it seems as if everything is landing on me, even with 10-20 levels.
---
You just have to get used to it. It's not how people ran in classic, but players are better now. You won't distinguish yourself if all you do is stick to the old meta.
---
The problem is they have to adapt to how classi works or we constantly die. It's a waste of time and resources. Play the game how it's intended. If you pull aggro from the tank, good or bad tank, you're pulling off the tank, you're wrong.
---
Because it's a steep slope. Haircuts are important to you, because well....but other aspects, like transmog, or flying mounts, are important to other people. It really is #nochanges or #changes.
---
I dont really care bout ur haircut so #nochanges.
---
&gt; Plus the people that do enjoy Retail would very likely hate the classic experience.
---
They killed WoW for the original fans, turning it into something perverse and unplayable to us. They should do it back to the retail fans so they know how it feels üòÇ
---
So you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance?!
---
Some people just get enjoyment knowing they're making someone else's experience worse. Those kinds of people really suck, and sadly there's quite a few of them out there. Some do it to try to get higher level players to come fight to protect the low levels. I'm just short of 60 right now and I've got probably 30 or so people added to my kill on sight list in the Spy addon for doing that stuff, like the level 45+ rogue who sat at the farm in Hillsbrad repeatedly killing level 30 players.
---
The thorium brotherhood will interest you greatly I think.
---
And looking at some multiboxers, they can defo afford multiple monitors. On my server runs a guy around who multiboxes 40 Shamans.
---
Been using like 5 addons most on here but this is The end of the beginning for me. RIP classic UI oh how I love your nostalgia but I got a fucking game to play! Thanks for List!
---
None of those reasons you listed would necessarily go away by having escort missions work the way they described.

Dishonorable kills only happen when you kill low level NPCs not players.

Killing all the guards is not exploiting and intended as a way to raid a town. Standing in areas guards dont agro but they can path to if they somehow do agro is not exploiting. Standing where guards can not path to if they agro is exploiting. This is incredibly simple to understand.

I can assure you Im no asom fanboy but I think the idea is that without Asmon being who he is those guilds and communities wouldnt exist like they do, regardless of if Asmon actually does anything for them (he doesnt).

I think the quest log is a big strange looking(for example you cannot resize the amount of quests displayed). But i plan to add a "sub-item" logic that works just like questlog's "place name-&gt;quest name"

Id rather be wealthy and far below average looking instead of looking like a supermodel but poor tbh. You guys really work full time trying to hate on successful people in order to feel better about yourself, its kinda sad.

I had a priest doing that to me on my first ever WC run. He proceeded to bitch every time we died after he pulled like 8 mobs. Lol I think he might have been in the wrong game.
---
Yeah exactly. My memories fuzzy on warlock damage, but I'm also pretty sure shadowbolt is going to outdamage dots too so it seems just better to focus the skull and be a shadow mage. I'm not certain on that though so I could be wrong.
---
Is there any other decent use for tailoring apart from this eh, for my levelling adventures at least?
---
not the intended purpose but i would use this addon to post positive affirmations about me being the best even when i'm not.

Once this one starts to go, my next will be Trinity üòã

Interesting! Did not know this Addon existed. Will check it out, thanks.

Man I don't know how I didn't think of that! Noted!

It would be fun if dyes and style guides were items you could use to change your hair. Desirable colors could require rare alchemy materials, and there could be exclusive styles as dungeon loot.

Why is the Priest telling people they're Out Of Mobs if they don't want the mage to kindly supply more mobs?

Seduce hunter , kill pet, deadzone kill hunter.

Option 2-  grenade , fear pet , kill hunter.

Both cases curse of exhaust helps a lot. Low lvl BM hunters are hard to kill, dont get frustrated.

I knew a few guys at Blizzard Austin who were gm's I think they started at $8 an hour in 2005 or so. So yeah, even back then the pay was shit. Most of them liked the job though.
---
Awkward, because I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm days passed that. But I have left my character logged in for many hours while hanging out with my gf or just running quick errands so my toon doesn‚Äôt have to wait in line.
---
As a hunter in previous iterations (and a tank who looks for dps now) it‚Äôs almost unheard of that someone would actually have reached out to me specifically to run a group as a hunter. That would have made me feel really good.
---
I‚Äôve been experimenting with various group makeups as I instance my way to 60 as a tank and I‚Äôm pleased to say that in a lot of dungeons hunters do make the party‚Äôs life a lot easier if they know what they are doing. I can recall specifically a few Uldaman runs at the very end where the pulls get a little tough where hunters that know what they are doing end up pet tanking the big elemental dudes while we focus the dwarves and it makes the run way smoother and cleaner. Plus frost trap is totally underrated. It‚Äôs kind of rare for me though because only like 1 in 5 hunters I group with actually knows what they are doing in my experience. So it‚Äôs always a risk with random hunter

Definitely a coincidence, addons shouldn't affect graphics since the game UI is totally different code from the graphics. Most likely a GPU bug on Mac that manifests itself when playing WoW Classic.

Because Horde is BIS.
---
Regardless of how many of what faction there are. It goes both ways: Horde jumps Ally, Ally jump Horde. Doesn‚Äôt mean everyone does, but it‚Äôs constantly happening.

Solution: Transfer to a PvE server when it becomes available. Otherwise, get used to Horde. üôÉ

Are you playing an enhancement shaman and are you complaining about threat while using earthstrike and rockbiter because if so your doing it wrong also if your tanks marking skull that‚Äôs the go ham target I literally don‚Äôt care if you pull threat on it. Because it should die fast anyways I mostly hold it with taunt while building threat on other guys.

Also if you know the history of development of MMOs you‚Äôd realize that they originated as literally virtual chat room muds and became 3D overtime the gameplay imo is more satisfying when I‚Äôm not trying to reach a certain actions per minute to be competitive like live is currently setup.

Groups of 2 or 3 mobs just need 1 mark at pull to get focus, combined with medium aoe you can easily build about 2 sunders on non-marked targets while keeping aggro and save your 2 force-aggro‚Äôs on the marked target before it runs off. Also, a lot of times the tank does not need 100% of the mobs agro. Lots of time its useless to run after stray mobs. You miss out on aggro on current mobs and the dps will prio the stray mob most of the time bc its doing direct dmg to them. Groups w more than 3 mobs can get cc aoe‚Äôd nicely by mages without them ever touching anyone. Holding off dps for 2 sunders per mob in a 3 mob pull just bc you want 100% guaranteed aggro is extremely unnecessary.
---
Also: the annoying behaviour of people pulling too many mobs can literally be applied to any class. Not just mages. Ive seen hunters, shamans rogues, druids and even priests do this.
---
Check wow interface.
---
These same opportunities to go from high pop to low pop servers were something that actually took place during vanilla.  The ability to change your haircut was not.  The free server transfer option will eventually be taken away once they feel like the server populations are balanced and healthy.
---
This is more of a "which should I play" question but I figured I'd ask it anyways. I'm wanting to level tailoring but I know I need a supply of cloth so I was curious what class/method would be better? I know mages are AoE kings but that wont help if the open world spots are taken, and I could also dungeon dive with a hunter for earlier levels and single mob farming, but I'm not sure which to focus on.
---
My ultimate goal is to be able to make bags for me and my friends who play
---
What the fuck. I swear to God Rare-Elites are silver already in Classic. Somebody tell me I'm not crazy.
---
EDIT: [Oh thank God.](https://puu.sh/EkB99/07060a9acb.jpg)
---
Mage/Mage if you aren‚Äôt going to go a full 5-boxes.
---
Grenade hunter or pet for option 2?
---
What if he is Undead and breaks my cc?
---
Hahahah chill
---
If you're like me and only care about the annoying loop of your own mount the only one you need to care about is:
---
    World of Warcraft\_classic_\Sound\Creature\Mechastrider\MechaStriderLoop.ogg
---
Also, THANK YOU SO MUCH /u/btz_exhausted now I don't have to mute my whole game every time I mount up.
---
you leave that place like vegeta ingraining in a time chamber
---
all raggedy, exhausted, battle hardened and leveled up
---
Yep. Makes me extremely uncomfortable
---
You seems really to focus on the less of the things.
---
The main reason I prefer a suite instead of having a cobbled together UI is mainly for style. Following by not having to deal with two hundred different quirks and issues due to an addon maybe messing with something another addon need.
---
Just stop with this "memory" thing, it's ridiculous.
---
What is the backpack addon called?
---
What rotation do you use in dungeons? Full dots on the whole pull and wand or do you shadowbolt the tank target after dots?
---
Get some Free Action Potions. Don't intercept until they blink to gap close, hamstring like crazy. When they ice block try and leave combat to reengage with charge. 
---
Come phase 3 when we get trinkets, mages fall down the warriors problem list and a GOOD Hunter becomes a warriors bane
---
&gt; I'm not one of those 2H warriors
---
This should be clarified - there are many parts of the game where 2H weapons are the best a tank can (reasonably) get. I ran Deadmines the other day and the hunter kept hassling me about not using a shield when I had Crescent Staff. I was not able to explain that my threat generation was higher on the staff than any of the 1h maces I had + a shield. Shield Block and Shield Bash just aren't good enough to give up all that threat generation at level 20.
---
What addon works for energy ticking?  
---
I've tried reinstalling NugEnergy 5 times. It doesn't show up for me at all. Can't make it work :(
---
1 agi = 2 ap or something like that
---
I mean, I get that. I personally like having that degree of customization. I definitely understand how it‚Äôs not for everyone, though. Honestly the biggest feature of ElvUI that I couldn‚Äôt live without is the easy keybinding ability. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other programs that‚Äôll do it, but ElvUI makes it seamless.
---
60 now still happens in lbrs and if you look at asmond golds raid video he‚Äôs encouraging the mages to just aoe you can take the hit from the trash. Ie dogs and giants in MC. Imo damage is underfunded fix it and all this drama goes away.
---
yeah i got more crits then i should have
---
Yeah, the other day I was doing quests in Redridge and was getting a group together for the orcs while we did Fangore. Ended up with 3 mages, a lock and a druid going through the zone just AoE bombing all of our quests down and it was hella fun.
---
Paid transfers were a thing in Vanilla
---
Death is the best aggro drop in the game.
---
Yeah that was probably the cringriest comment I‚Äôve ever seen on a forum, BIG yikes. Ttyl BoomyBoi
---
Or you can just grind dungeons. Much slower gold but you level up in the process.
---
Critical thinking includes realizing that a company whose business model is aggregating data aren't going to divulge the methods they use to collect that data, because then they have no proprietary information to sell. 
---
They're not an academic source, and they aren't going to act one. It's fine to be dubious, but recognize that they aren't going to just give out their IP for free. 
---
And so the question I asked that has been so misunderstood is: what data do you think that company could provide you that they wouldn't expect you to pay them for?
---
Those are the elites going in with full consumables/buffs, 90% of casual raids will take well over 2 hours.
---
No one ever mentioned free.  No reason to spread .misinformation
---
You def aren‚Äôt wrong HAHAHAHA
---
LMAO this bootlicker didn't even read the OP
---
lol okay. I mean I did it. I had T1 when it was still placeholder models and T2 dropped off MC bosses. I think I know what was available at the time, and the general skill level and knowledgebase that was even available at the time.
---
That said, you didn't even read what I wrote I don't think. Judging all of vanilla WoW's difficulties based on MC and Onyxia is moronic, because even at the time it was considered easy, especially after all of the QOL changes that Blizz made leading up to the first couple years the game was even out.
---
There's a pretty good reason why people PUG'd Onyxia and MC at the time, and barely a handful of guilds existed on a server that even did BWL or beyond.
---
But then I guess that lends the question, is 15 year old content ever going to be difficult? I bet if you re-released Wrath of the Lich King content it'd be completed in just the fashion of speed as what's happening with classic. Maybe the only differential being that Blizz implemented arbitrary enrage timers on everything that were mostly just gear checks. If that's the case, then can we say anything in WoW was ever difficult?
---
This conversation is just entirely stupid to begin with, and frankly I don't know what people like you are even trying to prove other than saying that people doing retail WoW have some sort of higher e-clout over those who played 15 years ago.
---
TC generates shit for rage anyway. Unless I want to mitigate damage, I don't touch it.
---
Have fun sending this same reply to the twenty other people that will also comment the same thing after me... If you know this why did you even make a post, clearly you think differently.
---
Where are you based?
---
I‚Äôm ready for a bit of the old ultra violence.
---
If you see a dps pulling retarded threat like this, well, they are probably not the type of person to give a shit in the first place. If they will listen though, recommend them to download NeatPlates addon. It colors the plates blue for low threat, yellow if you are about to pull and red if you have threat on their nameplate. 
---
It's very helpful for figuring out which targets you can attack and when without pulling threat. Details and other threat meters are nice for a single boss where you want a detailed bar readout of your threat vs the tanks, but it's too annoying to read for multiple mobs, especially since you have to look over at it, so NeatPlates is a must for trash threat management, imo.
---
Doesn't this meme require the top half to be true? Competitive  is just not. Raids only need one druid. Really not much reason for another unless you just need bodies.
---
Not safe for the bears.
---
You can‚Äôt override a slow with another slow that‚Äôs less potent, even if the duration is longer. As in if there‚Äôs a 60% blizzard slow(3 talent point with none in permafrost), then your CoC slow(50% with no talents), will not apply as it is less than blizzard. So yes only two in blizzard If you want your CoC to apply when blizzard is already applied. 
---
Tho every mage and their mom is going aoe blizzard build..and good grind spots are hard to find. 
---
I switched around level 30 to a single target build forgoing imp blizzard and permafrost. My aoe rotation would be frost nova &gt; flamestrike &gt; CoC &gt; AE. I also use engineering so I toss a grenade in their as well. 
---
IMO this is a much more bursty AoE and while it costs more mana and is more dangerous, once you have ice barrier it‚Äôs totally manageable and works fantastically. The engineering might be what‚Äôs making it work so well for me though. 
---
And when I‚Äôm not AoE‚Äôing, my single target damage is amazing and I can build my gear towards +spell/frost damage for even more single target damage. 
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
SO! lets go buckle down on Method shall we ?
---
Just use something like Quyn. Its a much better, much more unique name IMO. But i always found names that are just real words pretty dumb so
---
Exactly, even words that do not imply King like Parking can't be used.
---
Eating a sandwich, watching Netflix. Liar
---
And here I am trying to sheep the pat but the priest keeps putting his dot on every single mob.
---
I'm on Linux and it works just fine.
---
" Mage: Oh fuck off with that, I've done this before. " This was your hint to kick him.
---
Taelan Fordring is his son, not brother :p

Something like QuestLogEx would be nice

---
I haven‚Äôt seen a single female Tauren warrior yet, but plenty of other female taurens.
---
Considering you are a hybrid class, how will this help you heal? Or is this for PvP?
---
Just mortal strike and zerker rage, blood rage. If you've got excess rage or multiple mobs obviously do Ww with sweeping strikes.
---
Don't execute unless you've only got less than 20 rage.
---
Don't rend anymore.
---
Weak auras 2
---
The settings are in the interface menu.
---
Seriously? Nobody agrees with your entitlement. Treating paladins as primary healers yet only letting others roll on healer cloth is just fucking garbage mentality.
---
Equal responsibility but getting all the cons. Just have the neighbouring druid take it all. *I'll wait here and never roll need until specifically mail+ appears.* Not like they can wear leather, right? Just solely the paladin's fault here.
---
Paladins have the magical power to roll high *needs* to make you saltier about the **fair RNG.**
---
Haha. Shit happens to both of us I suppose.
---
so feign death + trap works in combat if u spam it? 
---
then scatter shot &gt; walk to enemy and feign death trap?
---
Yeah I went even farther overboard than you. I pretty much aoe grinded from 32 to 40 and had 68g when I hit 40. I pretty much DE‚Äôed everything from 1-30 which cost me a lot of gold. I got 155 enchanting in the process though. Finally got my mount before dinging 42 and now I‚Äôll probably go back to training enchanting again since I don‚Äôt care too much about saving gold now.
---
i know, just that the rest of the players don't
---
Cheers in dwarf. First time doing vanilla I was a human. Wanted that gnome mount so bad. Got it on my alt, but still.
---
Name checks out
---
Yeah, setting it to 0 isn't actually disabled as you might think. It's a 1-4 scale numbered 0-3 in typical confusing programmer fashion.
---
Female dwarf rogue
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been thinking reading all this guys comments lol, he literally describes what his comment was as the definition of judgement then argues it isnt, god boomers are funny
---
Wait yeah so do Tauren just pass on the roll since they can‚Äôt ride skeleton horses? Or is the deathcharger an exception for them?
---
And then the NPC should unpredictably decide to go back to where it initiated combat rather than continue following you as you would expect about a minute outside steamwheedle port. This way, you can spend another 20 minutes escorting this turtle back because that is time thoroughly enjoyed.
---
Yes cause i actually want to play a MMORPG and not a MMO.
---
Thank you thank you!

I feel like tanks should really never use Bloodfury, unless the boss is one of those "no one really holds the aggro" like Arugal
---
The debuff is worth FAR more than the mild DPS buff from a tank
---
Pretty sure you can't make characters of opposite faction on the same server.
---
Playing Classic Wow, I have Auctioneer installed. Auctionator takes too damn long to scan anything (unless I'm doing something wrong).
---
I want to set it up so that, at the click of one button, I can see all the prices for whichever items I set.
---
For instance:
---
Light Leather (tell me how cheap/which auctions)
---
Medium Leather
---
Medium Hide
---
Can this be done? Thanks in advance!
---
As long as you can spare maybe 3-4 hours 1-2 times a week you can raid. As guild raids are on a schedule, you dont have to sit around for ages trying to find people.
---
Are druids being accepted into raiding guilds at 60? I enjoy tanking, and I always see groups looking for tanks. I leveled a warrior up to 31, but I was missing being able to explore the world easily and do some quests outside of dungeons.
---
I started a druid and got him quickly to level 14 and I am enjoying it. I realize that druids are unlikely to be the MT in raids, which is fine because I will not have the time or schedule to be relied on by a guild to be the MT. I do however enjoy tanking dungeons. 
---
I am totally fine with healing at 60 as a druid, but I have read that even being a healer, it can be difficult for druids to get into guilds. Just worried I will spend the majority of my time leveling a druid and enjoying it only to find I am worthless in the end game.
---
I have read a lot and realize that druids are NOT worthless in the end game, but my question is, will the other people playing classic WoW realize this? Or will I be doomed to irrelevance?
---
if you constantly die in leveling dungons to people pulling off of you, then it's way more likely everyone in the group is just bad.
---
tanks aren't even necessary until like 50+, let alone you complaining about 'retail kids'. you sound like a 45 year old guy who refuses to adapt, and instead spends your time clicking half of your abilities.
---
Also no there are no pet attack animations when underwater
---
Too late.
---
Yeah it's not like he would admit it.
---
Classic is a museum piece, and in that context it makes sense that changes and improvements made in later expansions were removed.  I'm glad they didn't try to make an idealized version of it, and did for the most part deliver on their true classic promise.  
---
At the same time, I'm hoping that Classic+ servers will be a thing so that real QoL stuff like focus target, which has been completely disabled, can be made functional again.  I'm using a bunch of these same addons because I do like what they add.  It would be interesting if Blizzard added an option for a "modern UI" or "advanced UI" or something that reincorporated some of the less controversial ui improvements made over the years, sort of like an integrated official addon pack.
---
I also tried to make a meme name pumkinking named after a garbage garbage mage I played with in cata...it was a sad sad day then I rolled a lock.
---
I have no idea if it works , but I will try this asap :

---
ITT retail  players.
---
this is nothing new guys. same thing happened in vanilla.  same actions where taken.  it pretty much stopped overnight when BLizz started banning people.  so the solution is to report people you seeing doing this just like we did back in vanilla.  this is quite literally a non issue and ya'll are freakin out over nothing.
---
Goddamn, that's good.
---
Damnit Triumphant21, as your future ganker I demand you tell me the level!
---
I think even in retail people rarely make female tauren or dorfs
---
Found that 2h tanking wasn‚Äôt viable up around Mara and ST, but that‚Äôs also probably because of the lack of WF totems in my group and lower level healers.
---
It's definitely one of the most 1-sided pvp matchups in this game. I think the consensus is we just hope mages go easy on us with lube until we have the gear to blow them up later down the line.
---
Frost mages will have an answer for everything in your base warrior kit. Ccing you with novas, blinking any of your charges, a barrier that prevents you from building any rage. Iceblocking and waiting on blink/nova cds. Or even resetting an unfavorable position with poly.
---
Free action pot- You damn well better be on top of him with the rage to pummel and not get fake casted on that polly or it's GG. 
---
Like we probably need every trick in the bag to have a fighting chance. Rocket boots/charge helm from Ulda/Engi grenades and frost reflectors come to mind.
---
Tauren can use it, the only way they get a skeleton horse
---
I totally agree with your evaluation. However, GMs and newbs cannot distinguish the difference between the last two. Even people jumping around exploring are getting lumped into the exploiter reports.
---
Yeah but if you end up fighting anything, he will run back to where you started combat, which randomly boned me at about the pirate area latitude. I just gave up and determined Tooga is gonna have to learn to be single.
---
Yes it's too late. The game won't even let you try, it'll come up with a big error. 
---
Sarcasm aside, it can literally never be "too late". You'll have to run back to lower level zones to farm beasts so it might be a waste of time if you only want the gold for your 40 mount. 
---
If you plan to keep up skinning until later as well for money then it won't be nearly as big a use of time.
---
Paladins can't wield staffs.
---
Also Spirit is tits for warriors leveling.
---
I went with my level 1 bank to OG and trained it :)
---
Is this to OP, or to the #nochange crowd?
---
Log in
---
Yes they do, otherwise they can not do the skips, so both are true. You just have to clear more and some people are not willing to do that.
---
writing on my todolist to download this addon
---
Because you need to kite princess
---
Surprisingly, I completed all of Un'Goro without ever getting jumped by a devilsaur.
---
...though they did get close, a couple times, before I saw them and ran the fuck away.
---
You're so different than all of those other stiffs that come through here.
---
I mean, I had no issues running cleave groups up to BRD. But it seems that AoE everything mentality is carrying over into areas where it‚Äôs not really effective.
---
For example, I had a pug mage try and AoE down the interrogator boss in BRD, breaking 2 sheep‚Äôs in the process. Only to get feared and wipe our group.
---
My fellow tanks, Why do you tolerate this shit? There are countless DPS itching to get into all dungeons. Why do you even waste time arguing with these kids? Just boot and replace. 
---
Honestly, the salty, rage-filled whispers you get from booting these turds is all the reward you could want.
---
Yes you can change key bindings.
---
Aoe cleaves worked well when every player was hardcore. Problem is around 30-40 is now a lot of casuals and you'll wipe a lot. Also when I did sm and zg it was 7 to 8nman groups to cleave was much more efficient which isn't the case after the fix.
---
Can druids gather herbs while shapeshifted?
---
Fixing grammar errors will send us right back into BFA!
---
Doesn't matter since you can basically fly anywhere in retail whilst in classic you have to either use a horse, walk or use a flight path.
---
On my server gehennas mages are getting 1g per portal and 1g per 6stack of water/food in kargath wich is pretty much the hs for all lvl 60 players on horde haha, i dont care about paying 1g tho but i bet the mages make like 20g/h there alone
---
Ah yeah that makes sense. In that sense, I agree that it is unlikely GMs have the time to sift through logs to settle these things as I'm sure they are probably swamped in tickets due to the popularity.
---
some people enjoy leveling efficiently. I'm sure this is the first you're hearing of this concept but yes it does exist
---
People on this sub have circlejerked over how hard it is to see herbs on the ground in classic. There is nothing beyond the pale for some folks lol. There are probably people out there who think the 1.0 or beta versions of vanilla are the true experience and everything beyond MC is a bastardized vision of WoW.
---
I don't get why people like NE mounts, I'm a NE and I'm thinking about farming rep with SW to get a horse.
---
Well, global realm transfers were available in vanilla. And they limited the amount of times you can transfer / require payment so you couldn't just hop server to server. I think this point is kind of moot.
---
yea
---
"It" is not defined properly. GMs and right click report babies are not differentiating between actual exploiting, and someone just standing on a fun spot when they killed you.
---
Press F for Stanley
---
Seeing how people were banned for layering abuse, I'd be willing to bet it was unintentional. Layers will be removed come phase 2, so they are a temporary part of the game.
---
Does layering exist, yes absolutely.
---
Does layering in dungeons exist, probably I don't know if it was removed after the bans went out.
---
Did people use layering in dungeons, similar to how people use the ledge in Qia's room? Yup.
---
How'd that go for them? Crazy how they got banned for just using game mechanics! Almost like even though it was a part of the game, using it unintentionally will get you banned.
---
I can only explain things for you, I can't understand them for you.
---
Probably because people use too much addons like Questies, but I'm surprised no one mentioned QuestLogEx. Big QoL IMO
---
That's awesome.  I had one drop in wetlands on day 3 and general chat went absolutely nuts.
---
3x Mage who know the pulls in LBRS is godly, legit 120k/hr when I did it as a Resto Shammy
---
She's the best companion mechanically. She ends up bring nothing but a benefit to you since you dont need to worry about defending her and she can give you help in a pinch.
---
Unfortunately this also means that she's removed from the equation entirely. She's helpful in gameplay but it really undermines how centric she is to the story with how much of a nonissue she is during these moments. 
---
I guess it's based mostly on what perspective you look at her from. She's useful when the gameplay becomes overwhelming, but doesn't bring any weight to encounters which makes her feel like 1s and 0s as opposed to a character in the world with her own agency.
---

Thats why he mentioned a second account.

yea that's what I meant. I have mostly but not quite full pre-raid bis and no raid gear

He just managed to beat the last little bit of fun out of it

It's so you remember to eat and sleep.

Press ESC while logged and the game menu will appear, graphic options are into the system section.

And the nelf girl in north feralas, between the harpies
---
This used to be viable before demo shout fix. We'd pull 3 to 4 groups and 3 mages would hardly pull agro.
---
IMO there will always be room for healing druids because there are going to be druid drops. A smart raid will bring at least one of everything. Because otherwise you're throwing out an 8th of the set pieces that drop. 
---
A fully geared resto druid is still gonna be better than an ungeared priest.
---
Also, battle rez is valuable. As is MotW
---
Tldr: yeah. Guilds will bring druids.
---
How much sleep do you get? I‚Äôm not seeing how this is possible lol (unless you‚Äôre fiendish with the ~~adderall~~ stimulants )
---
Most high level mats are worth something but low level mats are worthless because a disproportionately large amount of people use gathering profs while leveling because they don't want to bother with crafting until 60.
---
I believe you have to be exalted to get a mount in a faction other than your own race. With exalted rep, you get a 20% discount, so $800 gold.
---
I got my warrior to 60 in 7 days 15 hours. I also have 300 cooking, mining and skinning (about to use my banked mining shit to get to 300 engineering tonight)
---
I followed the classicwow.live website guide (highly recommend). I would break away from the guide to do dungeons every now and again. Which put me at any time around 1-3 levels ahead of the guide. I've used other guides before which are no where near as good as this one

I decided to grit my teeth and attempt to watch this weekend. Made it three minutes before I couldn't take that level of ego combined with ignorance anymore. Doesn't deserve any of the success he's been lucky enough to have given to him.

Absolutely not. Because I see Ally doing it constantly. It‚Äôs both sides. I‚Äôm not sure what or why you‚Äôre trying to fight it lol. Both sides take off on everyone 90% of the time they see the opposing faction and are in a party. Period. End of discussion. GG and GL on your Azeroth Adventures Bud.
---
Healing Touch is the most mana efficient. 
---
If you have +healing gear then down rank. 
---
This isn't how it works exactly but it'll get the point across. 
---
If you have +100 healing then both your max rank HT and rank 1 HT have +100 healing. Except the rank 1 one has a quick cast time and costs almost no mana.

I am beyond certain that offensive/dps paladins in pvp are a complete waste. We complained about it until WotLK beta.
---
I'm not talking about invites, I'm talking about functionality. You can go for a walk with your shoes tied together but it's not a particularly great idea. Similarly, having to fight your own class or spec's inherent and glaring flaws (be it mana issues, lacking a gap closer/interrupt, whatever) is not something that is worth doing unless you're madly in love with the idea of the thing. Vanilla/Classic is great but hybrids were designed poorly.
---
that's one thing that always pisses me off, like I get it you want to finish the quest too, but decline my group invite and then pull all the mobs to you so I have nothing left to do but wait for them to respawn...not cool...
---
Cheating out a name change by creating a character with your name on the server you planned to transfer to before you actually transferred, I'm pretty sure was possible in Vanilla.  You're right about us not starting with patch 1.12 back in Vanilla, but I still think it was the best way to do things because of how bad balance issues were in earlier patches.  I do wish the game had more of the difficulty it had with earlier game patches, but AQ40 and Naxx should still be a challenge for people that haven't been playing private servers for the past decade or so.  Just to be clear, I personally wouldn't give a shit if they allowed people to change hair styles, but you asked, so I answered.
---
How I remember to pick up my girl from work everyday
---
Yes you can. You should most likely respec at 60 but enhance is a decent leveling spec after 40. Just don't use stormstrike too mich because it drains your mana quickly and you will hate yourself for drinking all the time.
---
I wonder if they patched that in recently. I tried to do this early on and it wasn't working. You also used to be able to type /timer
---
&gt; Best time to pull is when the healer is ready but the dps are oom

The question is, why do Druids kill so many animals?

I have never seen someone carebear this hard.

Any group with a brain that has 1 rogue and 1 mage. The mage will always do more overall, and also you drink while tank is pulling, there isn't very much downtime.

You could probably just set up your own local private server with moderator tools to do this.  There‚Äôs plenty of resources how to do this on google.

Hello everybody!
---
I saw a post here a couple of weeks ago and nobody answered me there, so I'll ask it here instead:
---
**Does anybody know [which AddOns are present in this picture?](https://i.redd.it/3ksxa3wk31m31.jpg)** More specifically, I'd like to know how to:
---
- Make my character screen look like that, with a full body and information on a "separate" window to the right;
---
- Those numbers on top of the equipped items, what are those?
---
Thank you in advance!!
---
I bet you submit a ticket every time you get ganked.
---
Very very very good OP. Very good indeed.
---
As a 44 lock with full shadoweave set i‚Äôd say it is crucial. The helmet pattern is rarer right now so if you obtain it you will make a lot of money while the niche still exists. I did this for the Robes of Arcana and so far i‚Äôve made almost 50g in profit.
---
Does it not work at 60? Never played a rogue...
---
You under estimate the number of quests one can complete in the low 40s, which is fine grind it out, it just sucks when you can't find a group at 7pm on Stalag...
---
Hello! Fair question and I'm glad you asked. Sunder is the warrior tank ability called Sunder Armor. It stacks multiple times, and it generates high threat on the monster when used. As a damage dealer you don't want to be attacking until your warrior has sunder up. You'll get a feel for that as you play. If you're doing insane damage you'd want to take it slow until he has multiple sunder stacks. But if your damage isn't too hot you can start your attacking when he has just one up. But always wait until you see that up. Look it up with google for a picture of the icon too, that can help if you're unsure what to check for.
---
Lol I'm 53 and consider myself to have made GREAT progress so far. Given I'm leveling as a Prot Warrior so maybe it's graded on a curve in my mind. Regardless it took me 6 months back in the day so the near month to get to this point feels like one H-ll of an accomplishment
---
&gt;Type /stuck if you are stuck in an area and you will be teleported to your hearthstone location
---
Does this trigger my Hearthstone cooldown?
---
Thankfully i can pseudo raid-mark things because I just hunters mark the mob people should be hitting lol. Even then I have people spamming all their CD's and pulling aggro on the wrong target where they're the only ones focusing on.
---
Hey that was exactly my timeline!! I installed retail wow today to check it out, and from my mininmal exposure now i kinda understand what people have been complaining about.
---
Dragonfire Chili, too!
---
I'm not even playing a healer this time around, but I get furious when I see a lock lifetap himself to 1 health in the middle of a fight, with mobs running around everywhere, the healer at 20% mana and the tank dead. They were at half mana when they started too.
---
Hell, I've seen some lifetap themselves to 1 health and sit there while we all are drinking because we also had zero mana. I gave you fucking mage drinks, use them in this situation since we all have to anyway, you are making the healer drink twice. And no, they weren't lifetapping and then eating food either. I've seen some terrible locks.
---
Nobody's carebearing, dude.  Guy was a dick to somebody, then bragged about it online.
---
This isn't complicated.
---
Me and my OCD thank you :)
---
Yea there's a difference between the "classic experience" in taking a lvl 1 for the first time in 15 years and going to 60 in classes and specs that are only vaguely reminiscent to modern day wow and then having that be the case for 6th expansion. 
---
Cataclysm brought back ***a lot*** of things that are found in classic but not retail and people hated it, Legion showed us that "retail xpac" can succeed. WoD and BFA showed that if you put out a bad product people won't like it. 
---
The false dichotomy between "classic vs retail" is really lame to see constantly pushed.
---
It does but it isn't that much tbh, there are like 5 quests at 44 for me there
---
Sick
---
Yeah this is the least played
---
Don't level prot imo
---
Oh sorry, I meant the quest tracker UI, not the quest log.
---
Having a way to select certain Todo's to go to a tracking quest-like interface, just like in quest log.
---
what about "The Shadowfoot Stabber"  obviously lower level but easier to aquire just dont want to have gimp dps till perditions etc
---
i dont know, i heard its so they can aoe kite with CoC? Im not sure... but thanks
---
4 months of the same phase without introducing any kind of pvp when all content got cleared in one week is a bit too long imo, on the other hand you can go back to real life and come back and play hard again when new phases appear.
---
Where's the addon that makes the hitmarker sound effect on hit, airhorn on crit, [hide and seek](https://youtu.be/UYIAfiVGluk?t=172) when you die, ["MOM GET THE CAMERA"](https://youtu.be/mLRbZJS5A_E?t=16) when you kill the boss, and [Darude - Dankstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9ymUX1fJLw) during the fight?
---
[Holy shit, some memelord already did it](https://youtu.be/qEKyzVSaKLM)
---
Thank you for that! It really took some time and effort to make. Making an addon is no easy task
---
I've been using this nonstop. Thanks for update. And future ones!
---
Look at my horse, my horse is amazing...
---
Is there a way (or an add-on) to make keybinds computer-specific?
---
I need different bindings between my laptop and PC.
---
Nice one dude.
---
Isn‚Äôt the whole point of mage aoe to take improved blizzard so when you draw agro with it they take ages to get to you and when they do you just frost nova blink and do it again?
---

---
and that temp fixes it for me
---
To add - a really good warlock will know to use Curse of Recklessness on humanoid trash mobs that like to run away - CoR stops them running.
---
Also - don't neglect Curse of Tongues either - great for throwing on those pesky caster mobs to slow their damage or healing output.
---
I refuse to do escort quests.  They take too long and I always get ganked along the way.
---
This post makes it obvious that you aren't doing spellcleave right.
---
You need at least 2 mages to rotate through frost nova and cone of cold for it work properly.
---
If you do it right everything dies so quick you barely even need a tank.  
---
Pretty funny how people are complaining about it not working when they aren't even doing it right.
---
I thought the food was 45s for 5? I've been using it for a long time but all of my guildies are cheap and refuse to buy it lol.
---
You don't spec into it anymore at 60, because you're not mostly soloing anymore, you'll want your talents to be DPSing for dungeons and raids, where riposte never triggers
---
It requires 5 points in Parry talent, which is also pointless for DPSing
---
Sure raiding in classic in general doesnt take much skill. Pvp is where the skill shows, bad locks in pvp are laughable whereas good ones are a true terror.
---
We could throw out examples of bad people playing any class, but mages are all the rage due to streamers AOE grinding, so all of a sudden we have people that want to take the easy or popular thing to play and I may be generalizing but those people IMO are usually worse at playing.
---
Oh ok, and what if you have 3/3 in permafrost too? would it be the same?
---
Why? They are under very high demand in the endgame.
---
Personally, I believe any spot a player can reach, should be fair game as long as other players can possibly get to and kill them back. If Blizzard wants Goblin cities to be magical safezones, then make flying guards that come from thin air when pvp starts. Otherwise, having rules like this is only going to negatively affect people who are trying to play the game. You can literally get reported by idiots for jumping onto a rock in a neutral city, even if no guards are around to see or evade. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THE GUARDS ARE KILLABLE.
---
That deserves some sort of compensation surely ?
---
Tell them to do a dungeon or two without you. Let the random tank get furious at them and say all the shit you want to say.
---
Which is exactly why my wife and I made a pair of dwarf rogues together. Just to buck the trend. lol
---
Unless the big heal overheats by a lot but then we are just talking about skill.
---
As a warlock myself, I feel the hot is nice (especially during a long encounter) bc it almost signals to me 'hey, healer here, you have this renew/rejuvi to use to life tap, try not to exceed it bc I'm almost oom'
---
It‚Äôs still a bad practice generally, especially because PW:S can take a decent amount of mana from you, too.
---
I use bubble on a tank only if I know I can‚Äôt save them with any heal. It‚Äôs a break in case of emergency button. Using it more frequently than that on a tank is just a bad idea.
---
It‚Äôs not like the GM would get in trouble, probably just be asked to check the class of the player and reporter first. Not like he was very rude to the player just...unaware.
---
Karen would demand to speak with head GM‚Äôs boss and try to have the GM fired. Karen is a bitch
---
It can be a great motivator, or a great motivation kille seing mobs to level. Which titanpanel also has out of the box mind
---
You sir are a golden god.

Aren't all warriors?

Only if you are inside of a run/script call. Most of the functions are protected like CastSpellByName so it only works for a few use cases. (Post one message to multiple channels, Edit a CVar, some others I can‚Äôt remember)

For now you can only make the entire window transparent and move THAT window :(

It's not a laxative effect in a strict sense, the central stimulation causes contractions in your rectum. This basically means if you have a charge loaded it's go time, but it won't help if you're truly constipated.

sunder. Tanks have to sunder every mob in a group, don't treat it as a mark.

Where did you find Carbonite update?

Man, it can't really do that but that's an awesome suggestion. Noted!
---
Dat neckbeard though. Stretched out that poor t-shirt. Prolly needs a better laundry soap. Kappa
---
I was doing this for the first week or two. I'd buy any cheap green weapons that drop Greater Magic Essences on the AH. Wands net like 14.97s after the wood cost so I'd buy a lot of 10s-14s weapons and they USUALLY drop one Greater Essence, sometimes TWO. But now I guess everyone does this as I never see green weapons below 15s anymore. It was a sick way to make silver early on... but by your mid 20's you make more money questing anyway.  
---
I hit tailoring and enchanting lvl 150 WAY too early. Kinda hard to progress in enchanting at level 20 when I need to get mats from disenchanting items for lvl 35 players.
---
Sanity when you end up alternating between conjuring two at a time and having to drink some of the stuff every few casts.
---
I think that most aoe grind builds use 2/3 improved blizzard because nthe last point adds a chance to root the target. You don't want one mob running at you while the other 2 are rooted in place. It just makes things messy for aoe damage.
---
Fear pet. Seduce hunter. Kill pet.
---
Go close to hunter. Wave. Fear hunter. Kill hunter.

+1 rep if you manage to fear him into trash.

I always tanked pally bc onward, so curious on talents too

Lol get this man a tissue, his idol has done been insulted and he dropped a tear.

B-Bro...
---
If you're that far in the tree, i'd probably continue to get mortal strike. It's such a good skill. Could pick up axe mastery and 2h weapon specialization on the way. Though if you are trying to min/max the aoe damage, I couldn't tell you if that is optimal. There are definitely good fury talents you could pick up.
---
Westfall
---
The problem with spell cleave right now is that the mages doing it don't know THEY'RE the ones doing it. They expect a warrior to tank for them while they spam Blizzard. It does not work this way. This is not Wrath+, holding aggro on AOE groups is nearly impossible for a warrior without CDs. The best thing I can do is put on a two hander and run in for a whirlwind when they're kiting. Bust an AOE taunt if they're low and getting closed in on. I can't really help you with this. I am here for the bosses. 
---
What ends up happening is you get average mages who aren't that spectacular at AOE farming. They overpull, your group wipes way too much, and your run is actually slower than doing the dungeon normal. Every pull is an event with full stops for health/mana. I honestly can't see how it is more efficient unless you have 3 mages and like a holy nova priest.
---
The trick is to not be shit at the game.
---
Me too.
---
I give zero credit to pedants who can't see the difference between minor qol improvements and LFR, though.
---
Bahaha yeah, I can understand wanting to leave after a while if one is only into the new version. It‚Äôs an extreme flanderization of WoW‚Äîit‚Äôs what happens when they give the loudest people exactly what they want over a long period of time and make things more convenient. My friend started retail last year and was jazzed to try classic.  He hasn‚Äôt played much in MMOs before.. he left after a few hours. He just can‚Äôt fathom why someone would want something less convenient, and my words do not convince him. That‚Äôs okay, though. I‚Äôm having the best time ever.
---
CoolStoryBob
---
Damn you, Jeff Kaplan!!!!!!!!
---
So I can work for 4 hours IRL and get more gold in that game then probably a whole day of farming or whatever lol (or whatever time it takes, last time I played that game was 12 years ago and I thought my trimmed mithril was cool).
---
Would I make more money selling the recipe: Flask of supreme power or farming the mats, make them and sell them? I'm a 300 alchemist and herbalist.
---
If they stayed in combat their character would remain in the world. You need to be OOC for 20 seconds to log out.
---
You can get around this by reopening the game and logging in to a different character, which will boot you out right away.
---
I dont watch streamers and I've been playing private servers for years. Nice try though. No need to get mad just cause you're talking out your ass
---
Multi box whales

Surprise ending: the mage wasn't the asshole.
---
[This guy?](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11072/kitta-firewind) If classic.wowhead is correct, it only go up to 225. For 225 - 250 range I don't think there's any option other than [her](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11073/annora).

I'd very much like to be wrong about that.

So will this cast and catch the first all in one go?
---
TSM lets you do this.
---
He's not wrong, friends were doing this AoE dun spamming to rush us to 60 to catch up to them, but these were done on year old servers, not on a new one.
---
This wasn't the case back upon 1st release on Vanilla, but was repeated as a leveling method with the new BC servers that came with that launch.
---
Looks good. Only thing is that if you have enough buffs on you, it might overlap with the cast bar.
---
That‚Äôs not what I read at all. Yes, Dyaxler has a working version, he doesn‚Äôt want to release it without Aznamir‚Äôs support and he stated the addon does not work how it did in Vanilla because of the modern API, and has no desire to work further on it.
---
Unless I missed something.
---
Pretty much only quest items behave that way though, where you can have only 1 equipped. I know of no unique armour, only of unique equipped, which would allow you to loot another of the same item but prevent you from equipping it
---
Yeah, I wouldn't mind relying on quest text (would actually prefer it) if the quest text was actually useful. Some are, but most are vague as hell, assuming they're correct at all.

---
Thank you! While at level 31, casting lower rank spells is hardly necessary. With a tank who knows what they're doing, well timed, highest rank, heals are more than plenty.
---
When the time comes that down rank heals are required, I might use more hotkey modifier buttons (like explained in the video, but I don't think you watched it considering the speed of your reply :-)).
---
I ain't freakin out, not everything has to be a freak out. You gotta remember that Classic customer support is only gonna shrink over time, not grow. And if the problem stopped overnight back in Vanilla then why did they fix it in Burning Crusade? Legit question, i'm open to discussion here
---
If a dps is raiding without a threat meter that they pay attention to then you are better off letting them be dead.
---
You‚Äôre obviously clueless so I‚Äôll just let you realize that on your own time.
---
Cause no one called it by that stupid AF name, it was just AoE grinding back then.
---
Is the rage coming from your UI blocking half the screen or the fact you didn't heal yourself or bubble or use any tool a paladin has to survive?
---
&gt; If anyone wants anything that involves rep, using normal dungeon groups and questing is not an overall loss
---
Already addressed in my original comment with caveat :P
---
Really I'm just baiting every non AoE'r in to going for rep rewards so they don't feel their time is wasted, effectively wasting more time finishing the rep grind.  =[
---
Funny, I got feared down there last night too. Unfortunately the characters above were out of LoS‚Ä¶
---
Somehow I cannot tel whether or not there‚Äôs a reference in the title.
---
They're rushing to farm MC and Only for 3 months and then BWL for another few months lol. I'm choosing a chill levelling experience visiting new zones I'm not familiar with and trying to do every dungeon rather then that.
---
Lol if you start a profession at 60 you're literally a moron amd might as well re roll
---
It's the opposite. Bears have more threat but less tankiness for burst-heavy fights. They are beefier overall but have no defensive cooldowns like Shield Wall, or ways to prevent crushing blows like Shield Block.
---
I always give mages 30-50s unless they tell me I have to pay for it. Those guys get the cold shoulder and I literally just walk away without food and don‚Äôt say anything.
---
Can I ask what server you‚Äôre on? Because a mage said 1s to me the other day too but I realized he actually meant ‚Äú1 sec‚Äù
---
I dont even use clique but tukui is the best addon ive found for pretty much everything. Super easy to set it up so I have to recommend checking it out
---
I begrudgingly use windows because I'm too lazy to set up WINE at home
---
Runs perfectly fine on my work computer, a 2019 imac 5k, no need for bootcamp or any other fiddling - thank god.
---
What u do is you have the dungeon cleared till the boss then just show up on the twink for just that boss then rinse and repeat till u get it... If you level from that it's just not meant to be.
---
But a real twink would just buy the necklace since it's better by even 1 stat
---
Someone‚Äôs salty.
---
You can free action potion but I‚Äôll just use an invulnerability potion and laugh at you.
---
Short story: I'm out questing, I see a Gnome doing the same. Obviously I'm doing my duty to the Horde and since all Gnome's are KoS I do what I must, I slay him. He comes back later and bests me in single combat.  No big surprise really - but what surprises me is that this guy starts whispering me from a second account. Haha, damn.  
---
If ya want to see the Gnome; [https://i.imgur.com/Q8v7u54.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Q8v7u54.jpg)

Enjoy the game fellas! Don't be so serious. Use emotes to communicate.
---
Trade chat in the nearest city. Ogrimmar is pretty active recruiting for dungeons. Also Barrens char for WC. Generally city chats.
---
CTmod is an old school vanilla mod that has a classic update.  Does a lot of different things you would use several addons to do, and allows you to move party frames around.
---
Gotta have a degree to be considered for humanhood.
---
Can't just give privileged jobs to people who's parents didn't come from generational wealth. At least not without lifelong debt.
---
&gt; What did hunters do in vanilla that warrants all the hate.
---
They didn't dismiss pet, so it pulled 40+ mobs in certain places that was a guarantee'd wipe and long fucking run back. They left taunt on their pet, messing up the tank threat. They autoshot random mobs when tabbing over to the next mob and pulled extra mobs. They multi-shot and hit sheep'd/CC'd targets and woke them up. etc. etc.
---
Aside from the not dismissing pet thing which I still see, most of that is gone due to the higher skill floor or even the shittiest players these days. In 2004, people were so fucking bad that if you put a 5 year old with down syndrome on the character, he would play as well or better than a lot of them at the time. Now, it's 2019 and the mechanics are so basic, even absolute retards are moderately competent. 
---
Huntards huntarding isn't going to be that prevalent anymore, but another huge reason why is probably because of how unappealing classic Hunter is today. On retail you don't need to feed your pet, you don't need to use 1/4th of your bag space for ammo, you don't have a mana bar to deal with etc. Most people who would choose hunter just aren't willing to deal with that shit and rolled something else. It seems like Mage, Lock and Rogue are the obvious candidates for their replacements.
---
Hypnotic Blade is quite a bit better. Spellpower on gear is extremely MEH for leveling pre 50ish.
---
Every spell is (Cast time before modifiers) / (3.5), with even more reductions based on stuff like AoE healing.
---
So if he uses a 2 second heal, the 2 spellpower difference will literally make almost no difference in healig potency and youre missing out on that juicy mana pool and crit from int.
---
Tell your friend to do some research.

I once reported a night elf hunter in wsg for wall walking with the flag to somewhere out of los so we basically had to lose because we couldn't win it either. Blizzard then suggested me to delete my addons if they cause troubles :D
---
Welp I‚Äôm not getting my mount anytime soon. Sitting on a solid 1g after skills at lvl 32.
---
Dis you not read what I said? Because they show through terrain. Names do not.
---
No I'm not.   I said pull threat *or OOM*.   I could pump out 50% more DPS if I wanted to, but I'd be OOM after one mob.   Instead, I just autoattack and check my timers on my totems/weapon effects.   I don't even shock half the time anymore because OOM.   Even earthbound kiting has been nerfed apparently in classic (possibly inadvertently by using Legion client), so now you just stand there and face tank when in the world questing. 
---
I know the current history of MMOs, I actually played everquest for a brief time.   I listened to vanilla players endlessly complain about almost everything *for years* during the time I did play wow and say how much more challenging vanilla was.   The only challenging thing about the dungeons is not getting lost and giving in to your urge to do something. 
---
The most fun I had in wow was when I got to run Fury war in Firelands because someone else wanted a crack at main tanking.  That was like playing wak-a-mole with your procs, but you had to know which one had priority.  I felt like I was actually *doing* something.  Oh and somehow we still managed to talk.
---
Honestly the most challenging dungeons I've run were cata heroics, before everyone outgeared them.  You couldn't pull things one at a time, the packs were all 4-6 mobs large (didn't have LOS opportunities either).  So you needed to CC, manage damage reduction CDs and the healer had to heal.
---
This. You can even look up other people‚Äôs weakauras for an exp bar and import it, so all you have to do it move it and adjust the sizing.
---
You can honestly build an entire ui from just weakauras if you so desired.
---
Actually calibrated rifle is better than xbow and i won a roll for the weapon. Hope you day gets better
---
Snurk? Is that you?
---
I still think there's room for a middle ground, but yeah, that's the biggest issue with retail - it no longer feels like an MMO with a true persistent world at all.
---
FFS I logged in and flew around for hours, middle of prime time, literally didn't see a single other player anywhere.
---
Exactly this.
---
If you know what you are doing and utilizing a little bit of tactical awareness, Warriors are not bad levelers at all, and the gameplay is very rewarding.    Plan a weapon progression path or just invest in a new weapon every few levels, and keep First Aid up to date.   If played well a warrior isn‚Äôt even in the bottom three leveling classes.  Sure, you can optimize your gameplay with any class, but a warrior played correctly is better than even the most try-hard rogues, shamans and paladins for most of the leveling experience.  I don‚Äôt have much experience with Druids though so I can‚Äôt speak to how they compare.
---
Search for quest runs. I am also a mage an I avoid spellckeave runs since they are annoying to play.
---
I would kill for this
---
Well, at least you don't need all the pages from 1 to 27.

I threw it.

It was gone.

Then I discovered the throwing knife vendor...
---
No quest in Silithus mate. It‚Äôs baron in phase one. I recommend farming felcloth in azshara.
---
In vanilla wow my tanking policy was if the DPS wants to tank something I didn't mark to kill, I let them.  Then I'd /w the healer not to heal them if they pull aggro.  They usually got the point.
---
Where Dyaxler stated the addon does not work how it did in Vanilla because of the modern API  ?  
---
&gt; Aznamir,  
---
&gt;Since you have no plans to update this for Classic can you change the license rights to GNU? I have a working version for Classic I'd like to give to the community based on your [Version 3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pally-power/files/446442) code that was available in Wrath of the Lich King. I've updated it to Ace3 along with all the necessary code changes to work. My guilds Paladins have been using it for a couple weeks now and its far superior than anything else out there. There is a butchered version on GitHub I'd like to prevent from spreading any further because it doesn't give you any credit at all and it's based on code that was used on private servers.  
---
&gt;Thanks,

*Laughs in Vanish*

As a mage, first time I bought a bunch of greens to replace all my whites I noticed a huge drop in mana used per mob pull. That‚Äôs about the only difference I noticed
---
Im not going to lie it's a constant struggle. 
---
Im having fun leveling my mage but the end game mage isn't really for me in PvE. As back in the day I played a healer or a tank. DPS in raids/dungeons just doesn't really appeal to me. I only really enjoyed DPS classes in PVP and the BGs and HKs are a ways away.
---
Not really sure what I want to do currently.
---
Did you not read what I said? Because they just removed it instead of doing what I proposed.

I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way

A few points that might be helpful:
---
\-Always try to get the first charge off. Once you're in combat, hardly any more charging.
---
\-Once you're novaed, don't panic. Switch to defensive stance and suck it up. As soon as you're free, head towards him.
---
\-While you're novaed and in defensive stance, don't just stand there. Shoot him with your ranged weapon. Every bit of damage helps.
---
\-If he blinks, IMMEDIATELY intercept him. 9 out of 10 times, the fight will be yours.
---
\-A good mage won't blink before you intercept. So you'll have to use it regardless to close the gap. As soon as you reach him, start running towards the direction he was facing. If he blinks, you'll have less of a gap to close. Often, you'll be right on top of him.
---
\-If he blocks, use a bandage. That'll force him to exit the block or allow you to heal a good chunk.
---
I hope these quick tips help.
---
a great site to search for other created bars and trackers would be wago.io
---
What does it drop?
---
No, there's no character armory - that was introduced in Burning Crusade.

I'm on Linux with the Lutris tool for WINE and it works great! Was having trouble logging into battle.net with Lutris, but I just had to toggle a setting. PM me if you encounter that problem.
---
Sleep?
---
Coincidentally, that's where I was just leveling up fishing last night! I was so surprised I wasn't able to fish there at 190, had to use some nightcrawlers
---
My priest healed me with the same rank 2 heal from deadmines to MC.
---
Yes every spell in the game has a different coefficient for healing and damage increases. 
---
It's not unique to those two spells. 
---
For druids however you'll want to use a trinket that refunds 25 mana when you cast HT which makes the rank 1 even better.
---
Aka a one of a kind mount!
---
I would always set mine at whichever zone I was in a lot, whether I was leveling there or farming stuff, etc. :)
---
I like you're 'find me proof on video' back when having the hardware to record gameplay was not the standard for people's computer at the time, let alone even having a place to share footage of what people did.
---
And mages can also make good use of the tailoring-specific gear offered.
---
Succubus at 20 shuts them down during stunlock. Succ is best leveling pet anyway so she should already be out. Even if you're still using blueberry for some reason, sacc shield can be cast while stunned. Deathcoil at 42 ensures rogues are no match from then on.
---
Do you have an add on that can add a search bar to my Enchanting interface? I‚Äôve been recommended TSM but it doesn‚Äôt work too well.
---
What's your build?  Currently 47, want to switch to sub.
---
This is mine:
---
`#showtooltip cat form`
---
`/cancelform [form:1/2/4]`
---
`/use cat form`
---
`/use [mod:shift] prowl`
---
Shift should put you in stealth immediately.
---
And here's my cheetah form
---
`#showtooltip travel form`
---
`/cancelform [form:1/2/3]`
---
`/use [swimming] aquatic form;[mod:shift,outdoors] travel form;[nocombat,outdoors] travel form`
---
This will put you in travel or aquatic forms, depending on where you are and what you're doing.  I added the shift modifier because I kept accidentally hitting this during combat.
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
It's an EU RP server so might've as you said, just feels weird to watch it lag everytime when he tries to do it, must be more than a thousand people
---
In my experience let one tick of ravaged go off and as soon as it hits the second time cancel it and go back to your regular cleaving and thunder clapping. The thing bad 2 handed tanks do it not stance dance, not use defensive stance, not do anything a tank should be doing....play like a tank and use whatever weapon set you feel like and it will be fine (plz don‚Äôt DW tho)
---
For sure took me at least 30 seconds.
---
What‚Äôs the name? You probably could get a bunch of random players to report it. They (the game masters) might change it to playerhhhhghg and then I‚Äôm not sure if you can change it.
---
You‚Äôre just as cringe as he is.
---
how about a hidden dungeon xp bar that mimics the rested bar.  it restores over time when you're outside of dungeons, depletes when you kill things inside a dungeon.  
---
when it's empty it creates an xp penalty.  they could put it behind the scenes (no ui update)
---
Just keep being a stingy mage and see how many times you get asked back to groups once you get past the aoe meta.  Acting like 18s is a lot of money lol.
---
not sure man, you say its not a skill then go on to list a bunch of things that sound like skills? you go through a lot of effort to agree while saying you dont agree
---
If you change your hearthstones home destination after you start the cast you can "reset" back to where you were by using your hearthstone again.
---
So imagine you set your HS to undercity and you're in tanaris. You start the HS cast, set your HS to tanaris, your cast goes off and you're now in undercity. When your HS is off CD you can cast it again and be sent to Tanaris. 
---
Keep in mind this really is only helpful for shaman as they have a hearthstone copycat ability.
---
There's no Epic Riding skill. There's only Ram/Tiger/Horse etc Riding and it costs 20g.
---
Shaman is totally gonna roll on the chapeau though :)
---
I'd have kicked him a while ago. And rage pots are: (1) expensive, (2) on a 2 min CD, and (3) won't let you gain enough rage to save him from his own dumbass pulls.
---
Moveanything does that, but I wouldn't recomment it, bugs out so often...doesn't save settings etc.
---
Thats How i level, seasoned vanilla player, played all expansions, love vanilla, really Looking forward to phase 2 PvP, but leveling for me now is skimming the green quests in a zone then doing 2-3 dungeon runs.. i like the consistency of it, and surprisingly annoyed by the intense competition for ALL quest mobs.
---
Just use the ClassicLFG addon to help filter chat into what you‚Äôre looking for.
---
I was pretty sure I didn't.
---
Caught the bug anyway, and now here I am.
---
Those guys go along with whatever activision-blizzard does already, plus they already experienced the ‚Äòcataclysmic‚Äô shift in gameplay and tone already. They‚Äôll be fine.
---
I've made a list of dick bags that I will hunt when I hit 60.
---
still a skill regardless. knowing when to attack and when to not.. which mob to attack, etc.
---
this is from retail and other modern mmos. every duengen from ffxiv is "pull whole room and AOE down" and retail is the same way to an extent.
---
Right - let me revoke what I said and change it to:
---
This was happening on private servers BUT it was still not public knowledge at that point. 
---
A few key points: 
---
1. Wow classic has garnered a lot of subs to where a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù exists as common folk instead of a niche group of people.
---
2. We are all aware of how popular WoW classic was on Twitch, especially in the first few days. 
---
Method was doing their livestream where someone told them the strategy. They did the strategy. The strategy then became mainstream. I‚Äôm not sure if another streamer did it first, but in my opinion that was the dawn of the idea reaching the public eye.
---
Those are my thoughts.
---
Our anvil is right next to our mailboxes and ah
---
On my server - as well as on the pservers I played on before Classic - most warriors want to DPS at 60.
---
or 2 druid 3 rogue groups become the new meta.  just stealth to the boss
---
As a noob tank this will surely be useful. Thanks again.
---
Mage is the money maker, to be honest.
---
No, its not trolling. I have seen SO many absolutely dogshit slow ass, 0 aggro, 0 adaptation tanks. Its literally why I respecced into a tanking build. If a tank is forcing a mage to single target trash, they are a bad tank, period. Its ignorant to your group composition and the strengths of your party. Most classes have some degree of cleave, they don't need to be mage good at it to benefit from multi target pulls.
---
I respecced tank only after many, many stressful, unsuccessful, and slow runs with bad tanks who refuse to adapt or play to party strengths.
---
Maybe its because the last time I spammed dungeons was +10s in Legion, but i'm accutely aware of how bad your average tank is in classic. The content is not hard, but many tanks are struggling both with external mechanics and their own rotations.
---
I've not even once seen a warrior with a weaponswap macro dancing between 2h and sword board.
---
Solely from a farming perspective, warlock is the cheap knockoff version of hunter. Hunter is far better at it.
---
Your other option is mage for AoE grinding mobs. Typical to do something like farm SM graveyard solo at 60, sell the cloth and vendor more or less everything else.
---
Friendsinfo lets you add a tooltipp to the player.
---
Double click on the player and add your note -&gt; Done
---
Weird
---
What lvl could you possibly start duoing these big fellas?
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt talk to broke boys
---
PvP is en entirely different matter, and not one that changes my point. If anything, I would say properly spacing and using your CC on mage requires more skill than Lock. This argument isn't really in your favor either and might actually be worse. At best, Mage and Lock are equally easy to play, at worst, Mage is harder in certain aspects like PvP.
---
Yeah I've used TypeScript. What's gross about Electron is the paradigm. Bundled chromium with a bunch of js libraries and having to use IPC to go between node.js and the frontend for even the most basic shit - not a fan. Java is better but not by much. The language is bloated and so are all their GUI techs.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs easy.

Who cares about main faction rep? They‚Äôll have quested enough to get honoured which is all you need for 10% mount discount.  Most people don‚Äôt give a shit about getting another faction‚Äôs mount.
---
That's what I've been saying this entire time. Everyone here seems to be having trouble with their shaman dps not listening. But I have the opposite problem, the dps shamans I've run with have been awesome, but the shaman healers I've run with have been absolute garbage, standing next to me taking cleave damage while meleeing mobs and using thier mana for damage instead of keeping me alive
---
Zandalar Forever!
---
Lorti UI soooo good
---
The full set adds silly damage to your dots, pvp is so fun at level 45
---
It‚Äôs best to just pretend they don‚Äôt even exist. Their cute little egos are ever so fragile
---
&gt;there were no clothies in the group
---
I wouldn't be shocked to see any healer roll on that, though. The loss of armor as a healer in that range feels negligible.
---
The majority of the "steady" population should be 60 and starting endgame content. This will expose the class imbalance inherent in classic to the majority of the population thus prompting complaints for balance to "underperforming" classes/specs
---
You can pull it off with 5 people now if you really wanted. People on pservers kill Ony with 8 players, but people still take 40.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs a peasant you two would get along well
---
Are you by chance from Pertento, Kronos 3?
---
Just pick a new name?  You expect them just to keep making exceptions for you forever?  Be glad they did it for your retail character.  Your friends are capable of reading another name right?  Shouldn't be an issue.  Go change it up legolas.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, you're objectively right. People think the downvote arrow is for a simple disagreement, but it's not. 
---
Let me put you back at "1" at least.
---
I think it's more around 200%. 
---
Healvsbabyface did a recent video on it.
---
Fucking freaks
---
Just finished this quest line today on my first classic character so this is perfect!
---
But the game IS about the destination.  Grinding is a chore, the game doesnt start until 60
---
Nah hes still pissed I'm plowing your mom but hes gotta make rent somehow so he doesnt make too much of a fuss
---
It would only be changed if reported if it violates policy. First infraction is usually a warning. If it is a violation of their naming policy, you can self-report it. If it's not they won't change it no matter how many reports.
---
I'm embarrassed at how many times that thing has snuck up on me.
---
genius level
---
Plot twist and mind blown
---
Rogues can buy relic coffer keys from the AH and stealth through BRD opening all the coffer chests (Epic BoE's available).  they can also pickpocket Scarlet Monastery solo and make some good bank on that too.  If you're able to aoe farm with a frost mage, that can make good money, but it's easily interrupted by other players in the area.   So rogues seem to be the farming dungeons way to go.  If you're farming stuff out in the world, it should be more aoe focused, so Mage/Warlock, and right now Skinning seems to be the way to go, but as the economy matures, it will be less profitable, along with all of the availble profession cooldowns (salt shaker, arcanite, mooncloth), same concept.
---
Real talk do pallys do anything in pvp? Made the mistake of rolling one on a pvp server and had a blast until i got to stonetalon. Legit having an awful time
---
I am not trying to take anything away from this post, it's obviously some good tips but the thing is right, all this crafting, banking and auction housing takes time. By the time you hit 40 and had the gold for your mount, people were 60 and farming gold that way.
---
When you are level 40 at 6 days played, then yes, you should probably have mount money by then. But the people who just keep on questing are gonna be 40 in lets say 3-4 days played and not have the gold.
---
Falsely reporting accounts is almost certainly against the rules, but I'm not sure how much punishment would come from it if any. Submit a support ticket, explain yourself and ask nicely.
---
In general name changes are against the vibe in classic because it breaks character identity. Bob is not DemonBoy next time you see him, so you can actually remember who he is between meeting him. There's also the issue of ignore lists, and social backlash from people ninjalooting/scamming/etc that name changes make more or less impossible.
---
Overall, it shouldn't be allowed imo, and I know it goes against classic philosophy. But you still might be able to get a special exemption from a GM? Who knows sometimes they bend rules.
---
Thunderclap and whirlwind dont do jack for aoe threat anyway.  The only threat they do is straight damage, which is garbage on clap, and only decent with a 2her for ww.  Add in the .8 multiplier for threat in battle and berserk stance and there's basically no reason to use then side from just getting any threat at all at the start of a pull.
---
RemindMe! 16 hours
---
this is why I use questie.  that and when they say "to the west" it could mean very close or halfway across the zone
---
&gt; Healvsbabyface 
---
2 seconds of watching his video shows his source is superdata, which is not a reliable source
---
Can anyone recommend an addon that shows auras on the default nameplates, similar to the castbar addon?
---
Threatplates does this, but changes the nameplates entirely in the process.
---
&gt; I just want them to behave the same
---
But they didnt in vanilla...why would they in classic?
---
I agree, someone needs to teach that guildie about stat weights.  +heal/SP &gt; spi &gt; int stat priority doesn't mean +heal/SP maximized to the exclusion of all else.
---
&gt; blizz will give em the ban hammer.
---
More like the very-light-suspension-hammer.
---
I have yet to group with a hunter that wasn‚Äôt terrible at their class.  I‚Äôm not saying good hunters don‚Äôt exist, it just seems that there are a shitload of terrible hunters in the game.
---
And how so? From my limited experience mages seem more expensive to level, hard to support a duo if a big chunk of profits need to be invested
---
Now that I'm 60 I try to only run with melee and restore sham to avoid loot comp as a mage
---
As Ret, They can hit pretty hard when geared. And they‚Äôre phenomenal at Bubble Hearthing. 
---
Holy Pally is where it‚Äôs at. HPals are arguably the best Healers in the Game.
---
So I am attempting to play for the first time and my position in queue keeps going up, no matter what I do. I have tried reinstalling the game multiple times. I started with a 15 minute queue about an hour and a half ago, and now I am looking at about 70 minutes. It appears as though I keep getting pushed to the end of the queue. I have waited until the download is complete every time to start.
---
Potatoes orcs are the best orcs
---
Just a note but you do have a rez as a druid, if i'm not mistaken druids have the only rez that can be used in combat "Rebirth".
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20484/rebirth
---
also same, haven't played wow since before Cata and i'm having so much fun too :)
---
That is how much time I give myself, I have had some bad runs that go long, especially if you wipe near the end and have things respawn. Obviously most of the time it doesn't go that long, but its the upper limit I see a 5 man taking.
---
All of the above only works on Arms. None of this will work if the warrior is Prot. He will just tank you until Evasion expires then open up with fucktons of stuns and you'll never see a Retal; you'll see a Shield Wall as he segues into a finisher. Hitting his shield *gives* him rage, and you're hitting it a lot. Not to mention shredding on his spikes.
---
If you do not escape he will kill you, every time.
---
There are certain types of items that ***should*** become highly valuable in the future. However currently because nobody really has any gold there isn't much demand to spend top dollar on those "valuable" items. Eventually the prices will rise but that could take months.
---
Moonguard SW is like empty compared to before. 
---
There used to be a lot of people hanging out there but now there barely is. Unless I‚Äôm logging in at the wrong times or something but I‚Äôm sure I went on during prime time a few times. But usually late hours didn‚Äôt affect moonguard before
---
Does hunters speed offset the cost of meat and arrows?
---
Pretty sure hunters can beat them out in this phase at least by solo farming certain bosses.
---
Private server
---
i fucking love Immersion man
---
He didn't say he wanted a thank you, he said he wanted the rest of the group to all open trade and give him 4s50c to help pay for the massive 18s investment for a portal rune.
---
And btw they are entitled to it.  If you are in a group with a mage you are entitled to water.  Full stop.
---
Have you tried a different server?
---

yeah that sounds possible to me. one of the rules is not being named after real live people so it should work. just report it and see what happens, nothing to lose really.
---
Imagine being this confident while being this wrong. Sheesh.
---
Yes, Prot is in demand @ End game. As a Warrior though until 55..hell even 60 you can Arms tank most dungeons w/a 1h and a shield. I'm lvl 46 right now and tank and spank a lot.
---
I wouldn't level as prot cause you won't ever die but you also won't ever kill anything.

That's a different talent that freezes them.  Nothing to do with imp blizzard, it's purely just for the slow.
---
Lol right. Have fun jerking off in your moms basement and trying to convince people on the internet you're not a loser fucking weeb
---
Good tips I think.  This matches my playstyle pretty well, but only up to ZF so far.  I had read on like Icy Veins or something to spam Demo Shout, so I did eventually try it a little, but it didn't seem that effective, and I wasn't sure if they took into account this nerf that I'd heard about. I dunno what the nerf actually was, but folks kept talking about it.  Quickly went back to Sundering and Taunting and praying for Ravager procs (while in Defensive) in any case.
---
Good to know you respecced  before 60, I was thinking of doing that too (for BRD+).  Do you still use a 2h (or dw?) at times for threat gen, or do you stick to SnB now that you're prot?  I'd assume the latter so you can more easily Shield Slam on cooldown.
---
Thinking I'll respec to something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZVZxizoeMzVo) though not sure where to spend the last 4 points.  3 in Imp Revenge and 1 in Anticipation?  4 in Imp Demo Shout?  4 in Anticipation?

Of course he bubbled hearstone, you didn't show the 4 horde behind you

---
You lost, grats.
---
Not everything is layering abuse for fucks sake
---
The reason I‚Äôm enjoying classic is because the game‚Äôs difficulty forces player interaction. It makes the game more social and, therefore, to me at least, fun.
---
Yeah you have a point. Tanks act like they have more authority than they do. Tanks can lead the group‚Äôs direction and mark kill order if they want so dps knows where their threat generation is going if it‚Äôs not immediately obvious...but it‚Äôs just silly when they lay out dumbass rules. They‚Äôre usually not even good tanks, maybe because they spend 65% of their time typing instead of sundering, but I usually just leave if they or their friend is leader because I‚Äôm not gonna risk getting kicked because I decide to offtank the mob going at the healer instead of blindly attacking the skull
---
 Be careful, I hear she  bucksquick..
---
By endgame food/ammo costs are trivial for PvE.

Oh a first offense yes, but I knew a Spriest who kept doing it and rightfully so got a 3 month ban. He came into Ventrillo on raid night telling us he was banned for 3 months for doing this. 39 people exploded in laughing at him.

It seems to me like they ported some code from live and something didn't get changed back. Remember the first couple weeks of bfa where leveling players with war mode on were gods against 120's because they were trying to normalize/template everyone who had war mode turned on and the low level players were getting too much of a buff from their system? It feels like they're using code from that system.
---
*Laughs in enchanter*

Just checked today again and prices dropped, the auction house is crazy rn lol. 50s a crest now.

It was definitely a user error on my part. I prefer to use addons I can just download with twitch without having to go modify things in order for it to work, I'm fully capable just prefer the app to do it. Quartz didnt need any manual adjustments.

---
Right lol. That's why I have videos posted of $1800 piece of glass
---
The armor is the real benefit
---
But...but...why?!?
---
If you check down, there is a comment that is offering a little more insight.
---
Apparently (and I can confirm) there is a huge input lag all around that really make hard to pull things off like the FD+Trap.
---
Proof of that is that when you leave an "indoor" area, it takes several seconds to register and allow you to use outdoor-only abilities.
---
Hunters' pets have a big delay in returning to the master after finishing killing a target (this only happens if they are in a mode that is not "passive").
---
There are plenty issues around and it honestly should bother more people that an official release is more bugged than many private servers that are currently "free".
---
As for to "calculate it" you could use it for 10 min vs rockbiter for 10 min and see what gives you a higher dps. 
---
That being said I always use windfury because it's unavailable in its classic form on retail and its 10x more fun.
---
Server side, yes, not client side.
---
Regardless of whether or not it's the most efficient way to heal, the amount of Priests getting chewed up over this - from what amounts to little more than a Warrior hissy fit, is ridiculous. 
---
Again, it's not worth making Priests give up a core piece of their kit, and it's certainly not worth the deafening amounts of whining and crying it generates.
---
No, warriors and mages are still the fotm on pvp servers. There are far less rogues.
---
No promotions like that, but you don't need to purchase anything up-front, just the ongoing subscription.
---
Yeah marking is extremely helpful. Without a mark you are pretty much guaranteeing split DPS or people trying to AoE. 
---
I understand that some groups won't pay attention but a lot of people will.
---
I mean, you "won" the argument by putting words in his mouth. He never said shit about wearing leather. He said warriors should use 2H to tank while leveling. I know my healer IRL. We've heal/tank duo'd dozens of games together over the years. We have done dungeons where I used a 2H the entire time, dungeons where I used 1H/shield the entire time, and dungeons where I used weapon swap macros to get the best of both worlds. He has said it was twice as easy to heal when I was on my 2H. 
---
There are a few reasons:
---
-2H with Arms spec allows you a level of AoE damage (and by extension AoE threat) that sword and shield do not.  
---
-2H adds a substantial amount to your group's DPS. I often finish 1st or 2nd on the DPS meters with a 2H, usually falling down the list depending on how many bosses there are in the dungeon.  
---
-Sword and shield is decent, if your group wants to CC every pull and fight mobs one by one, allowing you to easily control the fight. But these runs go slower, even if they're more "controlled" so good luck getting a pug to do it.  
---
-Sword and shield makes fights last longer, burning your healer's mana even more. The amount of damage reduced per hit is not worth the amount of damage reduced by killing the mob faster.
---
Basically, damage is king. Let's say you are being hit by a mob for 200dmg per hit and you reduce that to 150 by using a sword and shield. You engage and kill the mob. In the time that you took to kill him, he hit you 20 times. You took roughly 3000dmg. Now, if you kill him 30% faster, which is easily doable with a 2H, he only hits you 14 times for 200dmg. This totals out to 2800dmg. This formula is even more lopsided toward two handers when you consider AoE using SS/Whirlwind/Cleave, as well as the fact that you will hold AoE threat better, allowing the healer to focus on only keeping you alive. 
---
It's a shame, and there are definitely times I miss my sword and shield, but 2H is better in 90% of groups.
---
But when I hit 60 tonight I have 280+ enchanting/tailoring and all the recipes I could grab.
---
Gotcha. Thought that was the reason but rereading the talent tree shows that I was wrong.
---
Ah, downloading from the twitch app shouldn‚Äôt require any adjustment either! Same way I did it. Either way, as long as you‚Äôve got your feature, you‚Äôre good.

you can go with a trial account and level til 20. there is no time limit on that like it used to be so i find it really nice for new players to come in
---
Bu bu but #nOcHaNgEs
---
I know u meant the dps, but wanding is what I use on low health mobs running away when I'm out of mana so I dont prio that
---
Now that's the spirit of world pvp !
---
I guess what I'm saying is that Blizzard used to be a passionate company that wanted to make money by selling good products. Now they just want to microtransaction the crap out of everything (Overwatch, Diablo Immortals, Retail wow... etc. etc.)

---
Just my opinion but you can normal rez since the reagent is pretty cheap and being able to rez in combat is way more useful than other classes rezs, the 30 mins CD is normal or else you could spam rezs :D
---
Could you not just keep killing him for big exp
---
I think a lot of addons have been harmful to the overall game design throughout the yera, especally addons like DBM which has forced Blizzard into a corner when it comes to raid design (when they have to design every raid assuming that every single player has an addon that plays half the game for them).
---
Some addons should also just have been a standard, such as auto-sell, or that you can at least put things on quick sell like in other games.
---
Obviously there are some addons that are quite minor, like UI changes and what not, but I really dislike addons that halfway play the game for you such as healbot or decursive that allows you to not even select your target.
---
And then you have addons that shows the castbars (which is intentionally not a feature in vanila, but with addons you can cheat), what buffs they are obtaining (which is literally a mage spell) etc.
---
My uncle works at Blizztendo, so I can do this without a ban.

Still, "set it to passive" is not a solution. There is a problem and it should be addressed.

They're still pretty rare when everyone and their mother is rolling human for the PVE racial and the handful of non-humans are mostly nelves and gnomes.

Depends on the time scale.  In the long run, you'll make money selling the flasks since you are performing a service - specifically - going into scholomance (or later, BWL) to craft the item.

I guess you‚Äôre just not reading my posts but to reiterate: everyone needs 1000g. The extra ‚Äúfun‚Äù you might get from equipping a found BoE immediately rather than grinding for the purchase price doesn‚Äôt override other players‚Äô shot at a chance to overhaul their character. 
---
And please don‚Äôt talk about ‚Äúthe spirit of the game‚Äù and then talk about how ‚Äúgold will be worthless in six months‚Äù in the same paragraph. You either take the game seriously or you don‚Äôt. If you take the game seriously it‚Äôs not just worthless gold, it‚Äôs real value to a real character in a living world; if you don‚Äôt take the game seriously then feel free to ninja or pass, it doesn‚Äôt matter to you anyway.
---
I've got 9 character slots worth of bank space. Nice try getting people to dump em lol.
---
Usualy I do have imp out, but when things are horrible I use the VW shield to not take a huge amount of damage.
---
I've been leveling up my druid on the side, and the amount of times I've been thanked just for tossing someone Heart of the Wild and Thorns is staggering. It's been an amazing experience and really kicked my nostalgia into overdrive.
---
Good luck on your adventure to get your mount!
---
Yetis near Everlook in Winterspring,
---
You can skin them, I grinded them from 58-60 and made around 150-200g from selling the leather on the AH and vendoring everything else.
---
I also got lucky and had an epic BoE drop (Skullflame Shield) so it worked out really well for me.
---
I usually don't have an issue when I let people know up front that I've never run that instance before so I have no idea where anything is. I'm not new to tanking, I've mained tank in every mmo I've ever played, but new to an area means there's a big learning curve
---
You could use the addon "Clique". It lets you set custom keybindings directly from the spellbook, and since it's an addon, the settings will be stored locally per computer. You could easily do two completely different setups on each computer
---
Every single mage is like this
---
different strokes for different folks. Who really cares at the end of the day?. If people report you don‚Äôt be butt- hurt. It‚Äôs just part in parcel...
---
My only experience is with soloing them, on a rogue in vanilla and hunter now. It‚Äôs fairly easy even on a fresh level 60, for those classes at least. 
---
They‚Äôre 54-56 elites so probably want to be at least 56. I‚Äôd recommend just get 60 first though for efficiency
---
I've been doing a ton of dungeon tanking, and I swear to god the bonobos made me *make a fucking macro* because I kept having to tell DPS how to do their fucking jobs.
---
"I will pull mobs. You pull, you tank. You DPS what I focus. I will mark focus. If you DPS the wrong target because you don't know what you are doing, when you pull aggro I will not waste taunt for you. I will let you die. You do not aoe spam unless I tell you. If you aoe spam you will pull aggro. You will die."
---
You lost your pet because it was at a low loyalty level which means you needed to feed alot more often. Once youve had a pet for a while you dont need nearly as much.

You don't understand, we have to purposely handicap ourselves so we can pretend it's 15 years ago when everyone was terrible at the game. If you don't play our way you just don't understand the game
---
Little trick I learned a few weeks ago while leveling my own warrior. 
---
Don‚Äôt use Heroic Strike. Auto attack, sunder armor and rend are your BFFs. 
---
Heroic Strike takes rage, and won‚Äôt let you generate rage while hitting. Sunder armor generates rage and reduces armor. Try it out, and see how much more rage you‚Äôll have. 
---
I was about to ask if you're in my guild. This exact thing happened to them last night, even including the priest taking rez sickness üòÇ were horde though, so no pallies.... haha
---
Amazing
---
Just kill mobs your level and your pet will get a good amount of EXP, eventually it will be caught up, that's the downside to being a hunter, if you don't get a good pet to level with right off the bat you have to spend a good chunk grinding mobs to level it up.
---
Might as well do it now while everything is cheap. Lots of cheap greens and mats on the AH.
---
Yeah, sorry man I was responding to the topic generically and you're initial comment didn't distinguish enough from the normal 'heals is wanding!' comment.
---
I agree 100% that wasting mana on dps and standing in fire while letting your tank die makes for a bad player.
---
I can confirm that this WILL PROC on AOE and is actually one of the best AOE weapons for mages/warlocks.
---
It will however not proc in DOTS/Drains
---
Don‚Äôt be mad cause you‚Äôre broke bro
---
I've played both classes in pvp and raiding, mage pvp is by far easier. I can link you literal forum posts about Warlocks having the highest if not one if the highest skill caps in Vanilla.
---
Barrens chat makes me sad.  Not because of the content.  Because it's not real.  It is just a bunch of poser memelords trying to recreate something that happened naturally back in vanilla.  It's completely forced in classic.
---
Barrens is just a copy/paste depository for shitty reddit memes at this point.
---
I absolutely don't remember the combat taking a couple of seconds to "drop". And for sure not on patch 1.12.3
---
Casual!
---
I used to use CT mod back in the day for this so I feel like it is possible somehow
---
Are you a parrot?
---
Ask in "/1 (General)" once you want one. "/2 (Trade)" can work but is a bit more of a longshot.
---
Take a break then, there‚Äôs no huge rush
---
No one cares that you want to play the game as inefficiently as possible for the sake of it. Keep on strawmanning an entire class for 0 reason, more mages for everyone else. This sub is so obnoxious.
---
They weren't listing then at vendor price, they were listing with a profit. There are obviously big money makers, but I remembered that tip because it's a pretty brainless, almost passive way to generate income.
---
What?  I deal with third party support all the time, this kind of thing is exactly what anyone that has dealt with them more than on a personal issue level has come to expect.

Not sure if you're trying to claim my comment is stupid because 3rd world outsourcing companies are worthless, or because you don't think that they are worthless and are trying to defend them.

So which is it?

However, that is only the with BFA. To play Classic, you need a sub.

I was about to say this. It's a brand new day boys

How did you get through the trogg cave at level 1?
---
There are no faction bound dungeons. RFC and Stockades entrances are in the capital cities but it doesn‚Äôt prevent the other faction from zoning.
---
Kinda thinking this. But also thinking I might get valuable gear from LW. It seems that all would be BoE so I could get it from others though. 
---
Maybe go enchanting/skinning?
---
Yeah I was gonna say - average pleb in full time work watches 4 hours of tv a night.  Play wow instead and that‚Äôs 20 hours a week, then add double on weekends and you‚Äôre at 36-40 hours a week even with a full time job.
---
i always used dm
---
I don't feel that's the case.
---
From arms you get improved charge and overpower as well as tactical mastery and anger management. The rend--&gt;impale path isn't that great with limited crit. Sweeping strikes at a 30 sec cooldown great increases DPS.
---
In fury you get 5% crit, enrage and a little longer of a battle shout bonus. Unbridled Wrath is less rage generation than anger management, and frenzied regen doesn't matter with someone who can HoT you. At 30, Deathwish as a cooldown is kinda long.
---
I don't know. Maybe I'm missing out on something.
---
But "+x% chance" is way better to understand, I love it.
---
It's recommended to not use an SSD for shadowplay, since SSD's are more bound by amount of writes than traditional hard drives. It does increase the chance of failure on traditional hard drives as well, but traditional hard drives are total coinflips on when they fail anyway, so it's questionable how much of a difference it'll make. Just make sure you have backups.
---
Does that guy deserve to be paid? I'd say no, fuck him, but that doesn't mean you're entitled to it.
---
Raids are different, but in PUG runs DPS is to DPS, Heal is to Heal, and Tank is to Tank. 
---
I'm not entitled to a Soulstone/healthstone, I'm not entitled to health potions just because someone is an alchemist, and I'd say I'm not even entitled to a rezz if I die. 
---
The only thing I'm entitled to is for DPS to DPS, heals to heal, and tank to tank. Most people do more and that's great, but I'm not going to tell someone it's their job to portal me around at their expense or give me food/water by saying I'm "entitled" to it. Just like they can't expect you to pay for it.

Hey, I had a few name issues on my main on an RP server. Basically got reported only once I taunted some people in a BG, but rules is rules. My other names later got reported and came with a temporary ban, so I appealed and talked to a GM and we went over all my toon names on that server to flag if okay or not lol. The GM told me if I ever had doubts about my chosen name, I could self report my name and they'd flag it for a change without the ban penalty. 
---
So report yourself o your own character, don't go making fake alts to report yourself haha
---
This an Ozzie reference?
---
because your own opinion isn't shared by every other person. that's why it's possible that people like something that you don't

---
I have looked for an addon that shows the location of the flightmasters on the map... I never found one that worked. Can OP or anybody else recommend one?
---
&gt; but the help modifier is key for spells that are target agnostic, such as Pennance or Holy Shock.
---
Is there a reason it's in there for this healing wave macro?
---
That‚Äôs actually sort of funny
---
Ty!
---
I was disc until 40, then switched to shadow to 60.
---
I did a few instances ( Deadmines twice, Stockades/SM/Mara/BRD once when I was asked late at night).
---
I know that there is a smite spec that is viable as well (mainly you open and cast like one more smite then wand) but Shadow is definitely the most straight-forward.
---
Imagine wiping on RFD/RFK and you're the only one with a rez. Meaning you can only rez 1 person and all the others have to walk back taking 10 minutes.
---
I wish more people look at the situation like that. 
---
I think it just boils down to everyone has different reasons for playing, as well as general values. Cashing in while denying an upgrade from others isn‚Äôt one of mine, even if it gives someone else the opportunity to steal. That‚Äôs still on their reputation in the end, and my day continues working for 60 goals. 
---
I shared my experience of the group taking an upgrade for me, and understand why people rolled the way they did. It‚Äôs whatever. I think there are just too many greedy or untrusting people out there. Guild/friends groups it is from now on, as much as possible.
---
I'm a durid tank and most of my groups had warrior(s) who refuse to tank. Usually saying "I'm not prot specced"
---
The ugliest seal ever
---
I dont know what you're ranting about but he commented on my comment specifically saying 2h warriors wearing rogue leather arent tanks... they arent. That's all.
---
I'm gonna guess neither you or him actually read my comment though and just replied with a stock reply about 2h is best lulz though because idk how else you could defend that as a valid strategy lol.
---
Auctioneer &gt; Auctionator
---
There is a classic version of Auctioneer.
---
I empathize and hope your PT goes well
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Every class is going to be gear dependent. PVP gear will come out in phase 2 but still requires ranking up to get it.
---
Raiding is very easy compared to vanilla to the point you could raid for gear one night and PvP another.
---
Poor guy, could have just used the skip and saved himself a headache.
---
Worth mentioning that some CC can take damage without breaking. Dots have a harder time breaking roots/fear than a heroic strike
---
I noticed that for classic, most of the addons seem to have moved to the twitch launcher. Even really obscure ones like Aux.
---
I hear healing is a good profession for druids at 60
---
actually dying as a paladin while leveling lmao
---
Mining if you‚Äôre Horde. The BS trinket is needed w/o fear ward if you plan on raiding. It‚Äôs also super helpful in PVP since Lock and SP are a hard counter.
---
On EU its fucking gnome mages everywhere, EVERYWHERE.
---
3/3 seems a lot better for leveling imo. I tried both. At 60 I think 2/3 is better but kind of comes down to preference. 3/3 allows 2 blizzards after a blink to max range which makes aoe farming easier.
---
Edit: the advantage to 2/3 is that blizzard won't overide the long slow from cone of cold with a short blizzard slow. So 3/3 in certain scenarios you can lose control of the mobs.
---
One thing i find funny, is that a lot of mages i meet out questing, or alliance when i pvp, really have no idea how to play their class outside of AoE spam.
---
Pull an extra mob by mistake?  I know, I'll just aoe spam because thats what we do now.  Im not going to sheep that so we can keep our single target focus!
---
A simple example but it happens so often I really think people have forgotten, or not learned, how to properly play a class.  Sure, aoe is a thing and being good at it and having control is a skill, but theres a lot more nuance to playing well than epeen and numbers.
---
PS.  I play a warlock and I have refused every invite to spellcleave I have been given or /w about, even from guildies.  Edit:  Im 52 now, have over a year of /played time on my warlock main in retail, so its not like i dont know how to spellcleave if i wanted.
---
I know the entrance to Deadmines is obviously full of alliance folks grouping up.  On a PvP server is it realistic for horde to ever go into Deadmines?
---
Thanks for clarifying, haven't been following.
---
This is wrong. Only is a 5 day reset with no bearing on a Tuesday. Its every 5 days. Aq20/ZG are also shorter resets 3 or 5 days don‚Äôt remember.
---
Not everyone needs 1000g. Is that the part I‚Äôve been missing or the part you refuse to admit is wrong? The loot system and etiquette are there to ensure that loot goes to players who can use it.
---
Now you‚Äôre giving ultimatums. There‚Äôs more to it than playing like a mindless drone or doing whatever the fuck you want regardless of the consequences.
---
1. What is the average wait time per thousand players in queue? For example, if I login and there's a queue of over 3k players, how long should it take for me to get on? I am planning on remoting in from work before I get home.
---
2. Let's say I spend a couple hours in the queue, I get to the character screen but I get disconnect because I didn't arrive on time. How long do I have to log back in until I'm sent to the back of the queue again?
---
Let us know how the tanking goes.  I play a druid as main, havn't done *war* tank in a long time.  A mage dosn't need to single target kill, but it's often faster when your pulling 1 trash pack at a time.  Sure if your in there with a group who has enough aoe to do bigger pulls as a tank, adapt to the bigger pulls.  But the problem most people are having is when the aoe isn't strong enough to finish mobs, the mage's are aoe'ing early in the fight...running outa steam...and eating healer mana/dieing/slowing the group down.  They are so used to all their control working for "long enough", and when it's not enough due to group makeup they are the ones not switching gears.
---
Weird flex on your achievements from 15 years ago, but grats! 
---
Further, suggesting enrage timers are arbitrary is all the evidence anyone needs to see how little you know about what makes difficult endgame content. Content becomes difficult when there‚Äôs a danger of dying. That danger doesn‚Äôt exist when you can overheal every boss in the game because there isn‚Äôt a timer. There has only been, at most, one real gear check boss per tier in modern wow, which offers dps a chance to really push their classes and showcase their mastery just like fights just like varimathras, vectis, and tyrant velhari really exposed your healers in their relevant tiers. 
---
You‚Äôre comparing vanilla raiding to wrath, but I can assure you, no one will do naxx 25 with a 13 person pug in the first month, and that raid was by far the easiest intro raid in any expansion aside from emerald nightmare if you outgeared it with m+ from the week before mythic opened. 
---
The ‚Äústupid conversation‚Äù was initiated by your reply, wasn‚Äôt it? The discussion isn‚Äôt about proving any superiority. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre getting out of it, then your reading comprehension needs serious work. It‚Äôs about the absurdity in saying classic is better than modern wow because it‚Äôs harder. The fact that has been spotlighted in the past month is that it simply isn‚Äôt true. There are a ton of things that make classic wow an amazing game that I‚Äôm currently playing a bit too much, but a challenging endgame isn‚Äôt one of them.
---
I just spam frostbolt because I‚Äôm lazy and I drink enough while questing. FROSTBOLT SPAM FOREVER
---
It does  increase rap aswell as melee ap. Read the tooltip.
---
There is melee ap, flat ap and ranged ap. Flat ap works for both ...ranged and melee
---
Yeah, my point is, if the rogue is good and has all his CDs ready, he has a 95% chance to win, regardless of gear level.
---
This is basically the reason I respecced my warrior and am currently soloing. Everyone seems to love these "fast aoe runs", but it's stressful for the tank and hard on the healer. I have a mage alt now and try to be respectful to the tank, I have threat reduction and time my aoes properly. People think it's faster to aoe the hell out of everything but you burn out your mana faster and usually pull threat essentially burning the healers mana too. This means more down time. I say go at a nice sustainable pace. It's safer and usually you're completing the dungeon at the same speed if not faster in my opinion.

Spell cleave is a lot better.  Melee cleave is fine enough though.

Except that he specifically said "Do you think warriors with plate are rogues?" And you continued pretending he said something about a warrior wearing leather. You're fucking loony tunes bro
---
Oh to add on to this ; does pet training seem off ?
---
Like greater stamina will cost 100 points but you can randomly buy it with &lt;100 points.

I'm not sure if the pet loyalty level is supposed to reduce the cost but the values just seem straight up wacky right now.

Yes, you will die a few times running there, mostly to mobs in STV, maybe a death or two to alliance but eventually you'll get there.

It's not any more difficult than getting into BRD during peak hours, really.

Judgemental alliance scum, typical.
---
bruh, the GM's back in the day were such awesome people. They would come out and meet you in person (in game) and talk to you, and would take the time to have a genuine chat with you. You could tell they were enjoying the game as much as you. It was such a nice experience. 
---
This is just sad.
---
I only speak Common. Is this Gnomish?
---
You can totally /ignore people in your 5 man.
---
I use to 2H tank on my shaman with my arcanite reaper and sweet windfury procs. Was fine tanking UBRS and DM
---
Theyre completely different. It sucks healing as a 5 man and having two die on a bad pull as a druid.
---
Bosses get tricky with no tank, at least that's my experience.
---
Was definitely going to post this. So many addons in that list, when ElvUI does most of them.
---
I had a similar cross faction experience with a Gnome the other day. I was finishing up Heroes of Darrowshire in WPL and I had to pick up Davil‚Äôs Libram out of a room full of elites, and a 60 gnome warrior helped me clear the entire room and get my book; communicating solely through emotes. ‚ÄòTwas a good feeling
---
Thatd be because he disregarded half my comment.. but anyway good luck tanking rag with that 2her and of the monkey gear. Glad you've got a healer that can handle it
---
Human is just an average race though. They just have higher regen and have weapons skill boosts making them ideal for melee classes.
---
Gnomes are better suited for mana classes.
---
Tanks are treating classic dungeons like retail cause its extremely easy and if you know 30% of your buttons you won't die and hold aggro. Tanks who chain pull but have no idea what they're doing is a concern. I don't see a problem with AOE meta with a good tank. I won't make the dungeon seem harder then people think it is. My experience the only dungeon I was extremely careful was scholo.
---
Gutterspeak
---
Yeah. Once you get it set up, it‚Äôs amazing.
---
I am

You'll usually see an even split of healers in pug raids, they're all useful. Guilds might prefer stacking paladins eventually, but there's always space for druids.

I‚Äôve opted to try out the fire spec as mage, can‚Äôt do shit with AoE really but I can fucking melt bosses (literally). I‚Äôm disgusted by the frost spec AoE meta so I hope my decision will inspire at least like one other mage

You can usually get by on renews. I only ever cast on someone if they fall below ~65%, if they‚Äôre above 65 then they aren‚Äôt in any real danger, and it‚Äôs not worth the mana for heals. If you spec Disc (as I did to level), I usually pop the free heal for a Prayer of Healing to get everyone topped off and comfortable. As a healer, it‚Äôs your job to keep people alive. Topped off feels satisfying, but that isn‚Äôt your job and will often leave you mana starved. This was my biggest hurdle coming from retail healing, you just have to accept that alive is the goal, not topped off. Hope this helps!

No idea enough to have ghostly strike and hemo
---
Then the first few in combat to improve crit chances
---
I feel Feign Death has still something odd behavior, is this working as intended? Especially FD+Trap has no reliability even if not resisted.
---
20% of total meal... So level 25 water is 10s for stack of 5, so 40s per stack of 20. So 80c*2 for food and drink. 1s60c...
---
Yeah, it gets old. It's the norm in FFXIV and why I stopped tanking PuGs there entirely. It doesn't speed anything up really, especially if you get a wipe.
---
Why are you asking us?
---
Check if you got charged, if you did, contact Blizz.

Great story but where is the kid that turns out to be Einstein?
---
I have LW and Skinning almost maxed at level 40. At 60 I plan on dropping skinning, picking up enchanting for tank trinket, then dropping it for engineering.
---
Torch room?
---
You mean the Lyceum?
---
It has a name yano
---
It's not a good guide overall, you should just get 60 asap and grind gold at that lvl you'll be way faster to 900g that way
---
Yeah thats why its PVP. A level 60 camping a spot in STV or Gadgetstan through exploit is pushing it. If theres no other 60s around, you should be punished. Or they just need to implement the dishonor system ASAP.
---
As for lockbox. The box could be anything, even a boat... So 1g
---
Yesss good lookin out man. This might be the spot.
---
I joined a few aoe runs in sm and stopped, the exp isn't as fast as people claim and just isn't as rewarding when compared to a proper group.
---
Because 1/5th of dungeon groups are tanks, while raids only have 1/20th of tanks. It's a pretty bad oversight that was fixed in later expansions, but in classic we have to deal with dungeons being nearly impossible to run once most people got their BIS and moved to other things.
---
people have been saying this is happening in classic. all you gotta do is log back in because the transaction is working but classic isn't recognizing it until after it works so you have to relog
---
On the flipside it does let you actually hide in the environment in world pvp.
---
Not an asshole, actually make it a point to be friendly on herod. But you'd remember if you were ganked by a dude named Shidiot. I would at least.
---
It would be 100 points if you didn't have the previous rank.  Pretty much it's gunna be 25 points for every rank.  
---
Also to the hunters that are having issues with FD + Trap.  Are you fools forgetting your pet keeps you in combat?  If you FD it doesn't stop your pet from attacking and it doesn't drop its aggro either if it was just attacking.  If your pet is in combat, so are you.  I'm a 52 hunter and I played hunter in vanilla.  I have not run into issues with FD.
---
It's sort of sad that the buffing goes away when everyone gets mounts, but it's super awesome at the lower levels.
---
I like that this post doesnt try to claim world or server first. Its just a post.
---
Even in retail this was the way to go, friend of mine rolls healer I roll tank or vice versa and we just dungeon grind as a pair all the way. Easy groups, easily replaceable DPS if theyre being douchebags.
---
*Then cries in enchanter*
---
A true and proper spellcleave doesn't use a tank. 3 mages, 1 lock, 1 priest.
---
This is probably stupid but you downloaded the classic version, correct?
---
For more casual players? High-end retail is infinitely more hardcore than anything classic has to offer. Classic is very casual, it just takes more patience because everything but raids takes longer.
---
Yep! Double checked that lol
---
No matter how dumb the DPS get, my rule of thumb is that as long as everyone lives despite their stupidity, I don't get to complain. Why?
---
I was about to blow up at a group that included a max rank earthshocker, an AoE triggered mage and a warrior that straight up refused to attack skull.
---
When we finished I was pretty mad. Just mere seconds from me hitting enter on a rage filled paragraph, the healer goes "Wow good group!! You all have been a dream to heal!!"
---
The mage and shaman goes "yeah great group, gj everyone"
---
The warr says "gj tank".
---
I then pressed Esc instead of Enter. Sometimes its sll about perspective.
---
I was looking forward to this post today - I feel like I‚Äôm right in front of your posts as I level so they‚Äôre all so relevant. Keep up the great work!
---
This is why I run ZF exclusively in 5 Mage groups.
---
Move tooltip is another one.
---
I got to level 17.  The barrens burned me out really quickly.  
---
Unfortunately I also despise BFA so I guess I‚Äôll check back for the final patch and just play catch-up.
---
Has it been layer abuse that loot would have been removed and the player banned, no?
---
I‚Äôd want a higher threshold, or a threshold that accounts for the whole playerbase not just those who vote.
---
So it‚Äôs not just 75% of voters, but 75% of the whole playerbase voting yes for it.
---
Yeee shame I'm not doing that
---
I miss the Chuck Norris jokes...
---
Esc.  Interface options. Elvui 
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work, you installed incorrectly 
---
Uninstall.  Delete folders. Delete wtf values. 
---
Go to elvui site and download the installer and use it to reinstall.
---
Met this guy outside ULD. He was the fucking man and we took turns tagging mobs and helping each other. He straight up cheered when i face ganked some other warlock who rolled up and tried to kill me while I helped him. Help a brother out. You'll get a much more rewarding experience than just ganking ang camping.  Lok'tar, but damn. Good people are good people. Thank you tiny friend, all the best.
---
Barrens General Chat.
---
I think id rather it say kill 40 boars. Because then you dont get frustrated when it doesnt droo
---
You are definitely right, distract is super useful. Besides it's obvious use for questing and pickpocketing, you can also use it to delay a pack of adds in a dungeon who are approaching. Note that you can also use it in PvP to instant change an enemy's direction 180 degree, or to stop eating/drinking.
---
Thistle tea is definitely useful and very strong. I think it's worth the price of materials (which is just swiftthistle and spring water, so not that expensive). Getting someone in a full kidney shot and then chugging a thistle tea to then unload an entire energy bar into your target is extremely strong for pvp. That full energy bar can save your life in PvE/questing as well. If you can afford it, id keep a stack on you at all times and use it as sort of a big, powerful cooldown, for emergencies and/or pvp.
---
And again, after accusing people of having no reading comprehension, you missed where I said "while leveling, it's easier to tank with a 2H". Like, keep twisting peoples' points and moving goalposts all you want, bud. You just keep looking like a tool
---
Are you dumb? They‚Äôre fotm because they are the fastest. People would have learned they are the fastest without streamers
---
Cleave works but it's stupid to expect PUGs to do it unless they specify they want to do a cleave group. 
---
The average person is not running the dungeon to dungeon grind, they want to run the dungeon and probably do quests and have fun and shit.
---
Also might wanna save the gold and try to snipe a warden staff for cheap gold while possible, if you don't already have it. That's my first prio before spending the remaining on levelling enchantinf
---
I guess I will try this next, thank you!
---
Substandard warrior detected
---
This was exactly my plan up until I started questioning it today haha. Thanks!
---
Wvery bad group ive had in classic is an AOE group. Ive just assumed all the biggest noobs are looking for AOE groups. 
---
It becomes so bad that literally level and get more xp faster with a solid single target group. Plus its a way higher chance of not wiping and if you have warriors, rogues, hunters, and warlocks you almost never have to wait for mana if your healer is good and youre killing priority targets real fast.
---
The game has been out for a few weeks. What kind of guild would kick you for being inactive during such a short time? 
---
I mean, this is just a level 7 item with the most basic of stats. I feel it takes maybe a few hours to get to level 6-8. Those really early levels are inconsequential and even the levels 1-12 experience is over in a flash. 
---
What I mean to say is that it seems like you are coming over as super dramatic and celebrating something not really worth celebrating.
---
Which is why you mark skull so your ST DPS focus down specific targets, so when your squad runs out of AoE mana, most of the mobs are either dead, or dying rapidly. If your non-AoE DPS are focusing skulls down while the AoE DPS are nuking packs, priority mobs die, and the packs melt. I personally prefer 2 AoE and 1 ST DPS comps, so that myself and the ST DPS can blast down priority targets while the AoE DPS shred the pack down. So far, I've really only gotten praise from groups for being able to hold aggro better than other tanks. Not even SB spamming locks are giving me problems, even though I have 0 clue why they fuck they're spamming SB while leveling.
---
I've never had the issue where the group totally gases out. I try to get a feel for group mana consumption on the first 1 or 2 pulls, then go off of that. Usually if I gas myself out, the party is gassed too. When I pull, I try to guess the number of adds to grab to make sure at the end of the pull, myself and the healer have about 20% mana in case shit goes sideways. 
---
Mages cannot pull aggro off of me, I can match their mana consumption and keep threat. I make sure to throttle my mana so that while the mages go ham, I go ham, when the mages chill out, I start downranking because I dont need the threat and sustained mana goes farther. I don't need to worry about their control wearing off and them dying, and I'm not worried about personally dying. I've got a set of defense/stam gear as well, so I'm not worried about dying to random damage.
---
5m play in classic is all about group play and syncing with the other players. Most tanks I've played with struggle with this.
---
Honestly after playing so much Prot Paladin, I'm regretting not playing warrior for that sweet, sweet fury/prot action. Insanely fun build, I used it in Naxx raiding on some undocumented server. Wanted to rock Paladin for the memes, but rolling into endgame, I'm feeling far more like a tank than I am a healer.
---
If you have more than 2-3 wipes you might as well have just done slow pulls anyway imo.
---
git gud
---
A lot of people, I'd think. Literally the only thing holding me back from that is having a girlfriend. Without that factor, it would be very easy. Groceries take like an hour tops for the entire week. You have more than enough time to throw something in the oven and text family/friends while on flight paths or auto-run.
---
TIL. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6nusu/suspended_for_ganking_in_booty_bay_on_a_pvp_server/) is the thread in question, I didn't see any CS rep posts replying to it and OP hasnt updated with anything like that. Maybe I'm wrong, I looked thru most of the reply threads and I figure a blizz CS rep post would be high up. Seems like this guy was banned merely for pvping in BB for too long in the eyes of blizzard, which is ridiculous. Its a PvP server, this is part of what happens.
---
edit: https://imgur.com/a/COCfhos
---
the last line of the reply blizz gave to his email inquiry seems like they are saying he was banned merely because he was camping an area for too long 
---
additionally I found some threads of people being banned in retail for PvPing, seems like this is probably because of the right click report system. Guess if you get flagged enough you will just be automatically banned, which is a pretty awful system.

I would never advocate like berating people for doing something like that, but I would think it would be appropriate to send the priest a whisper or something and let them know. Same if they are constantly overhealing or running out of mana. 
---
I want people telling me if I‚Äôm making mistakes; it‚Äôs the only way I can learn. Obviously there is an appropriate way to do it and many inappropriate ones, but still.
---
You're both cringe af
---
I mean other than warriors they are just the most played class rn.
---
Do you need to farm gnomer for the wep as a bear tank? Or is that mostly just feral dps?
---
My undead all say this when using cannibalize
---
You forgot the menethil harbor boat videos and the fake rp letters from someone they helped in STV 4 hours ago and thought they'll never hear from again.
---
That's a good point. Though I feel like the trinket is better than Warden Staff with alternative pre-raid BiS weapons? Maybe not though
---
Depends on server. I was just trying to finish my quests for the elementals and it took me forever to tag enough mobs to then have enough drops to finish. Let alone farming for money.
---
Needs more wanding.
---
I do not understand how reputation works. There's 3000 rep between hostile and unfriendly, right? And I get 5 rep for each one o these furbolg. So to go from hostile to unfriendly with the timbermaw should take me 600 kills, right? That's what I was thinking. I was happily surprised to find it only took me, like, 50 kills. But I don't understand how that's possible.
---
I chose druid because cat form.
---
Or you may have an addon conflict. Do the above, and ONLY install Elvui then see if you can edit it via menu, or /elvui
---
My first positive cross-faction experience was me ganking someone.  I don't even remember who won.
---
Implying you can't do both.
---
record scratch freeze frame yup that's me
---
I did that earlier this month. 
---
I ended up in the courtyard your not suppose to access and the entire structure around me was levitating a foot off the ground. 
---
Strange place.
---
Right, like yeah if you have a 5 man you know who knows how to do it, it's super fast. 
---
For me a "good" PUG is one where the hunter knows how to passive and de-growl his pet.
---
Boomers in this sub literally crying and playing fortnite players and kids for being efficient and aoeing. 
---
The same kids who play fortnite aren't the ones who are 30+ making spellcleave groups, like Christ.
---
this shit fucking disables itself every time i log off or reload UI what's the DEAL
---
Found a fix for it on the Discord channel for the UI. Go into the HUD settings of the UI and disable Pixel Perfect. Should fix it for good
---
It's a 1/5000 drop. 
---
People were 60 after the first week, its almost been 3 weeks since then. 
---
How many people you think are doing Strat UD? (I see groups all the time on just my server). So lets say 100 total runs per day on my server alone.
---
Thats 21 x 100 = 2100...almost a 50% chance on my server alone one has been seen with a low estimate. Now multiply 100 x how many servers and you get a whole lot better odds they start popping up.
---
You were not prepared...
---
I‚Äôll want when I‚Äôm oom 
---
(To the tune of ill sleep when I‚Äôm dead)
---
How dare someone enjoys something on their own terms!
---
shant
---
it also wasn't working for me about a week ago.
---
I‚Äôve collected maaaaaany things over the years
---
I only factor healers level when thinking about the healers bodypull range, thats it. But general rule I use is that tanks needs to face yellow mobs, DPS orange mobs, and healers can be 2 levels below them. (These are minimum requirements, not preferred.)
---
I‚Äôve leveled characters to 31, 24, and 15 and I feel like I‚Äôve been playing a LOT.
---
I mean lfg addons existed since vanilla too, but blizz fixed it so those wouldnt work.
