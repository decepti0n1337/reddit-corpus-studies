Same for me, I've been leveling an alt on the side and there's so many people still in the leveling zone. I love it.

---
Are any of these farmable solo via stealth runs?
---
play druid, you can do anything.
---
The problem with getting t0 is you'll have ppl pming you saying "you know none of that's BiS, you should do x y and z"

Say it, say car ramrod.

Rather than have a daily question thread, we should have a daily mount screenshot thread instead.

Go ahead then, google and give him this anwer, lets see how easy it truly is.

rogues are the ultimate edgelords so id say, Hawthorne Heights, simple plan etc.

The power of the rewards were pretty out of line compared to what was available in early Vanilla.

So I'm not a fan of people crying about mods, you can always find other forums. BUT, I do believe this only occurs on realms that are still layered, and will go away once the layering is over.
---

---
If you dont get the answer you want in one forum, why keep posting about how that forums is shitty in THE SAME FORUM? Go to another forum and maybe find some real help. Just my opinion.
---
Good luck and happy travels.
---
What a waste. Boof that shit
---
Look up the engineering leveling guide on wowhead. Will even give estimated mats needed

Evasion tanking is great. For 10 seconds.

I will always save innervate for healer. Ill stick to my mana potions and demonic runes

If he’s getting 28 whispers, I doubt he’s talking about the 4 people he might be grouped with.

Top-Right is Winterspring, I think. demon section near hyjal sneak-in.
---
“Both my dads play alliance” my top tier guild name
---
What’s your ign?
---
Warlocks have the best looking tier sets by far, they have fairly easy questing because of their pets and their damage is pretty good overall a decent class and a fast leveler.
---
They get a free mount at 40 and they get at 60 an epic mount for a less good than most classes overall a great class as long as it's your thing. In PVP they're a nightmare in 1v1s from what I've seen so far fearing you away and killing you slowly with dots.
---
'Choice' is always subjective.
---
Those are Cata assets and the majority of the screenshot is Cata Hyjal.
---
I'm Horde on Skeram and it's the same lower level. My main I had no problems getting dungeons while leveling but leveling my alts, my tank is finding issues starting at level 20+.
---
They have plate armor and can heal. With a bubble.  I’d say so there not OP.
---
It only works in a group tho...
---
What level were you when you went to westfall? I think that is the first bad design you run into as alliance. You are normally 11 or 12 when you are directed to westfall but that place is too hard for those levels. Even though it’s a pain you are better off going to darkshore or the dwarve lands then coming back to westfall at around 17
---
/join LookingForGroup
---
How do I get my video settings this low? Is this just the lowest resolution with lowest graphics settings?
---
You’re level 15 and been playing since launch?
---
I guess this answers your question lmfao
---
It now also allows loot trading etc... fucking dumb change.. should have stuck to how it was in vanilla
---
And WA in retail is a WHOOOOOOOLE lot more powerful than classic. You could your entire UI in WA. (might be possible in classic but with a lot more work.)
---
I had this problem too...I believe it was bartender or weakauras maybe? What addons do you have? If you list them it would probably help figure out which one it is
---
run some dungeons
---
find people doing the same quest
---
do lower level quests / switch zones (barrens /silverpine for horde)

---
This happened to me when I Mind Controlled a poor alliance right as the boat was supposed to zone out. We ended up not hitting the load screen and just stood there, unable to move, waving at each other like idiots. Then all of a sudden there was a load screen and I spawned way underneath Stonetalon Mountains. I had to unstuck my char and take rez sickness. I never saw him again. 
---
I like to think he’s still on that boat, unable to move, waving at people as they pass him by.
---
Only a couple in north and east. Did it a couple times today. None in west
---
The automatic organization is so nice. I was doing manually with ArkInventory many years ago, and this is so much nicer. The only thing I don't like about Adibags is I don't think I can create separate sections for gear sets. Having to sift through my 2-3 spare gear sets in my bank (to put them in my main inventory) prior to every raid is annoying, since I'm my guild's MT and need a survivability and FR suit on top of my generic TPS gear.
---
I feel discriminated against, I'm actually quite a courteous warrior!
---
Some of the spots are and require skill since there are many mobs that have special agro range against stealthing so you need to know your shit.
---
For 20 bucks, ill call the guy CHICKEN FUCKER!
---
Sounds like someone who didn't farm pre bis or use consumes &amp; expected free loot. Also "cite you being 20 minutes late for being 1 hour early to the 5 hour BRM raid defence on your off day" Huh?
---
The lock that feared you: oh my GOD
---
You guys are so adorable
---
I’ve not tried to do this but I’m pretty sure you can create your own categories. Dig around in the options.
---
I think that makes more sense. Highly depends on guild.
---
imo, he should be 3rd priority for tank gear and then roll as normal as dps spec. 
---
Should he also be in dps gear?
---
Ah okey, thats helpful. Thank you
---
As an AoE farm mage, I can confirm I've killed unsuspecting Gnome mages AoE farming just so their mobs can go from grey to red on me and I can farm the juicy XP the Gnome just pulled for me :) This is also almost zero down time, and zero risk. I think it is worth it, cause I dont have to sit for a whole minute just drinking to full mana again.
---
I tried, very hard to find. For me atleast
---
I main a shadow priest and have been leveling a hunter. Think I can slow my alt's pace now I know the gold is pretty close to farming mara which I can do with my feet up.
---
Arcane crystal goes for about 30g each. Same thing with Black Lotus (on average)
---
This is why hit is one of the most valuable stats right? It improves the effectiveness of your crit, AP, and proc effects. I haven't delved into how hit should be prioritised for different classes after yellow hit cap but it still looks really valuable
---

Engineering is pretty helpful.  Keep food buff up.  It's kinda rough regardless though.
---
I’m loving  white mane as an alliance right now. I believe horde has the majority but it hasn’t been bad at all especially if you play during the day.
---
This could have easily been avoided if you had just told him the price you wanted to sell for. Instead you kept dicking him around asking him to pick a price. If you're selling something you should know how much you're looking to get for it
---
For all the dragons.
---
If you are specifically collecting the mats to do it, then do what the other guy said and look at wowheads engineering guide. They list the total number of mats and which recipes to use them on.
---
There’s a lack of them on Mankrik
---
i always go to the dungeon entrance before i form or join a group for it. i dont understand why other people dont do the same
---
the looking for gorup channel, if you go to your chat tab setting you can click to join it then click what tabs it shows on
---
You're able to make these decisions and make this work because you understand the threat table and how threat generation works. Lots of people are missing the fundamentals and get frustrated when the things don't go the way they want it to.
---
It's not working. When I change the ammo it keeps showing the previous ammo on the screen :(
---
You've forgot the moment a tank instantly leaves again because the group composition is not meta enough, while there are two warlocks, a priest healer and a rogue that are absolutely fine for the dungeon. 
---
When someone complains about group composition, I silently weep for all our alliance Druid friends who will never find a dungeon group. May their questing be eventful and fulfilling.
---
I don’t know lol.  The name comes from the Dark Tower series by Stephen King.
---
Yeah, I can change the ammo. But I wanted to see which amm I'm currently using (in TBC it would be #showtooltip 0)
---
The above previous comment is good advice, I will echo just whispering someone you see that is likely working nearby on the same quest as you. More often than not they'll be happy to group up and get it done more quickly and easily. 
---
Levels 15-25 were very sluggish, but now that I've hit 38 on my warrior I'm enjoying the experience MUCH more. Although penny pinching is important, I've spent a decent amount on health potions, which often gave me the boost of health needed to take on two mobs instead of one. 
---
Hold on and be patient my friend! I felt very similar frustration at that point in my experience. Push through!
---
I've personally found that crafting items from the engineering skill is the fastest way to level engineering. 
---
However this does not work with alchemy, that will just increase your alchemy skill.
---
&gt;There is a thread for legitimate questions. Regardless of what you think a rule was broken and a bot removed it. This is a pretty standard rule for many large subreddits. It wasnt gonna lead to any "actual gameplay discussion". Just a simple answer and then that's it. Better to go in that thread where it belongs.
---
Well then we should have a place for even more worthless shit like meme's, stupid ass pictures of people on their mounts, and someone getting gold in their mailbox that they probably staged with their alt just to get karma...because it won't lead to any actual gameplay discussion because I said so.
---
Does his dick open up to drop last month's balls?
---
That doesn't even look like Bagnon, what?
---
I use bagnon and it doesn't look remotely like this. You have some other addon that's conflicting.
---
Start disabling addons (leaving bagnon enabled) one by one until the problem goes away. The last one you disabled is the problem.
---
EDIT: The addon is "Combuctor" so if you have both it and Bagnon installed, I'd pick one or the other as they're likely conflicting.
---
Care to expand? Under what circumstances and does that change the target for hit chance? How does it compare to two one hands
---
Wow so wrong on so many levels. I'd love to see anything 2v2 a gears/skilled warrior paladin team. Literally anything.
---
I've seen a pali pull mobs and bubble skin while the other toon get all the aggro lol
---
Did you read it all? That was fast. Like you posted within 20 seconds. Please read it and offer advice instead of just saying it's wrong with no examples.
---
It is; hyjal took that part of winterspring when it became a real zone.
---
But in classic, it's winterspring.
---
Can confirm this doesn’t work.
---
Shit, really? I couldn't find it when I looked last, but I'll have to check again later tonight.
---
That's a different discussion
---
You're confusing trolls bartering for your groupmates wanting a summon, they just want some, mon.
---
Cool give us your list and examples so we can understand your side of the discussion
---
just not sure how useful this info even is? If you're resetting, you're doing it for a reason and thus need to exit and re-enter soo... wtf does this info give us??
---
Reminds me of the opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj.  Server crash and some people got put into the eastern kingdoms.  Riding the boat to Kalimdor cause the boat to load into Stonetalon Mountains.
---
The screenshot is not from classic.
---
Evasión is 15 seconds
---
I don't seem to recall doing that actually - but interesting where you draw the line.. volunteering for a soup kitchen is great but anything less deserves no respect? I think you'd be surprised to see how many people out there work for free in ways that benefit you.
---
Bottom line these places don't work without moderation. If you'd like to see what forums without moderation look like then they're out there for you to see. Imagine that every single one was like that, then tell me you'd prefer it.
---
2h hit chance is the same as yellow hit chance. Below 305 skill your hitcap is 9, which goes down to 6 once you reach 305 skill.
---
I would nuke the entire addon and make sure you download the correct Bagnon version. Shamefully I did this at the very start of classic and got the "retail" version. It looked a lot like the problems you're having
---
There are free ones going on but not sure about yours
---
Im close to 30 baron runs aswell and no legs for my class.
---
Which tbh makes the joke even better.
---
You're upset, but have you actually looked at what happened?
---
User posted a question that was removed by the automod, which responded to the thread and told them exactly why their thread was removed. Instead of reading this they messaged the mods, then tried to publicly shame them.
---
Maybe the mods were a bit harsh and could have explained things better.. but the user could also have put in literally any effort.
---
Which site?
---
Good point. This definitely isn’t Bagnon.
---
lol triggered
---
A bit worse than priest mc lmao
---
Him: "I actually couldn't play because I was getting deleted by horde any time I logged on"
---
You: "But now *I* can't bully people anymore and it suuucks :("

Wow dude
---
Healer from mankrik here, can confirm atleast on horde their is a large amount of healers.
---
I hope everyone stays on Mograine because it appears to be a really balanced realm so far. Don't ruin it!
---
You are the butt of the joke bud, move along.
---
Why is the tank completely failing to maintain aggro?...  
---
  
---
That’s a paladin.
---
Healer LFG DM any part. Please just invite me already.
---
That might be productive, but maybe better as its own post. I'd start off with something like Paladin vs. Warlock or Class vs Class with a 1v1 focus since that's what most people are going to encounter right now in Classic and in the open world.
---
The auto mod reply to your thread has a very clear explanation why it was in breach of the rules - it didn't exceed 75 characters, which is really just a medium length sentence explaining your query. 
---
Whilst the blunt reply from the mod is unnecessary, it's also unnecessary to message them in the first place. The breach is clear and it is an easy rule breach to remedy - I can understand why it might be frustrating from the mods end. 
---
Also, why didn't you just ask in the daily questions thread? It's almost always stickied, it's referenced in the detailed version of the rule you breached, and is clearly linked below the sidebar version of the rule as well.
---
Probably sl/nightfall. There are a lot of options and it depends a lot on what kind of pvp you want, though, like 1v1, 1vX, small group, large group, etc.
---
I guess I'm not the only one who uses Nagle fishing pole to proc WF haha
---
Yes
---
you really did a "I get it" edit like 100 people were replying. You got 2 replies homey.
---
Ur kind of nice cutie
---
For me it's HoJ from BRD.  I leveled from 53 to 60 doing nothing but BRD with angerforge in the run.  I still haven't seen the fucking thing drop. I've lost count on the runs.   I've seen two Glat BP drops and won one.   But still no HOJ....  This game is no longer WOW to me it is only B. R. D.  There is nothing else, I've seen every group comp imaginable every combination of bosses. The game feels numb yet that sweet sweet 2% to strike again calls to me.  It must and will be mine.
---
I have 2 things; 22 bank alts and a wildly different interpretation of "amazing". Mine are all full t1 with legendaries and BC titles.
---
The first 5 in East probably are. I always check for the 2 in The Court yard during lasher runs.
---
I would prefer less moderation.  The best threads are usually purged to kingdom come, thank god for removeddit. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Fact of the matter is this website is worth millions and it's all because lame people want a small amount of power and moderate this garbage for free.  People are getting rich off your back.  If that doesn't bother you then whatever, just don't be surprised when people view you as an absolute sucker.  It's not like you're cultivating any kind of community anyways - reddit is far different from specialized forums of the past.
---
Also fury warrior, same on the tank whispers.  Go to silithus to do my rounds of regular thorium needed to level my other profession.  See some sweet darkened rich thorium vein dots calling my name in the elite bug cave below.  Can't let those go. Grab a healer friend or a mage friend and head in, because I'm too squishy to solo them face to face at a decent speed without wasting consumables in my bis dps gear or even my plate set.  Spend 10 minutes trying to get to that first vein that was calling my name from below.  Almost there, I hope it's all worth it and I finally get a gem.  Fighting the last few bugs in the way and the excitement is building.  Suddenly that familiar stealthed player sound enters my headphones.  It's a rogue or a druid sneaking past me and taking the mine I convinced someone to take their time out and we worked so hard to get to.  Soul is crushed.  Go fury tank and blow up BRD or something for my guildies in their 50s to feel better about the whole thing.  They don't get what they were hoping for.  Rinse and repeat the next day because silithus farming nets me the most normal thorium veins but those damn rich thorium veins are so enticing.
---
/purr on a druid
---
30 mins for 35% of a level and almost a gold is pretty nice
---
edit: percent change
---
A good sl warlock won’t die to a solo player, and what does kill it becomes post-soulstone prey.
---
Looks like Details! to me my man
---
You need to be aware of prices, though. At least on my server, only illusion dust is really worth anything, and basically all other greens are better off vendored or AHed.
---
World PvP is no fun without honor. You are essentially simply killing people who really don't wanna fight right now so they don't put up a fight.
---
This is what I saw from census numbers as well
---
Absolutely! It's up to you to go through Leatherworking recipes and work out how you profit at those price points but I guarantee you if you can consistently buy light leather at 25c ea and medium leather at 65c ea you can flip to vendors for profit and at least get your mount money early.
---
They are available to hordies, also the map quest (captain Sanders' treasure map). I completed them all (as I did more than 10 years ago on one of my Horde characters).
---
But what are the options? A rating system so the better players with less time can get it? Too much retail imo. A lesser time consuming grind or no decay, so everyone who puts in the work gets it in time? Then the title doesnt mean as much. As someone who wont be able to replicate my ranking from vanilla im still for no changes even though that makes it impossible to get r14.
---
Instant castness offered by NF is nice for casters because it means it's harder to stop you doing your stuff and allows you to be mobile.
---
Hey if you didnt know, you can pull a mob, and if you run away and do damage to that mob, any other mobs of that pack pulled will reset if you don't do any damage. Leaving you 1 mob at a time. It's a little time consuming but its effective for solo content. 
---
This is how I clear packs that are guarding chests I want lol
---
Eh https://wow.gamepedia.com/Darkwhisper_Gorge
---
The thing about retail is that it’s incredibly easy to swap specs though so it isn’t near as big of an issue. I have played a blood DK for the last 2 expansions for mythic+ but have played as dps in raids. I can still play to 95% efficiency for no additional cost.
---
I missed the window :(
---
Plenty of things in Wow are steam powered though. Dwarven tanks for example.
---
Because of people “having fun” the rest of the raid has to work harder.  The fights last longer.  You get less room for recovery.  Even in easy content, time is a resource.  I’m not saying you have to speed run, but some truly awful specs are a waste of time, and if people do them they need to understand that and be more selfless. In your example (true math and numbers aside) you would rather have 25000 more damage than 100,000? The longer the fight the more likely the moonkin will run out of mana even with innervate and pots and be stuck standing around.  And all they do is spam star fire so it’s not exactly a fun build.
---
In dungeons, I don’t see many moonkins but they can barely keep up with the tank in damage.
---
I think orcs are superior rogues but for some reason every energyboy i've seen are either undead or troll.
---
This is how I originally discovered fatigue was a thing.

I’m glowing my dkp load on this if it drops tonight.

Please make these an add on! I love how they look.

---
True, I need some more practice, I hate burning my vanish and feeling like a knucklehead.
---
I got a very short queue on Tuesday (Fairbanks) after not having one for a couple weeks. I assume it was because of DM.

I feel so sorry for all you mods for having to deal with those lazy asses.

Btw. Good faction and class youve chosen.

For your level you can go SM Cath and Uldaman, although it would be wise to get a few more levels for Ulda as a tank

---
I'm a level 43 rogue, having a blast so far.  I keep going through spec ideas for 60 and I'm not sure if the precision skill will matter for PvP.  Do you need the 5 points in precision to not miss special attacks in PvP at 60?
---
Im real life I am into violent sex and domination. In WoW I wear a dress and give people cancer
---
Yeah.  I was pretty sure they were going to shut down when classic dropped but I'm not sure if they followed through on that or not.  Do you know?

Not gonna lie, I was half expecting the Skyrim cart.

---
There's a variant of the build in that guide that I'd pay more attention to.  You still want to be casting some HT as it's drastically more mana efficient than Regrowth.  Very good throughput, just requires a lot better gear than we have available right now.
---
I get what you're saying, but at the same time...
---
Not with that attitude.

If only reddit was around during hitlers rise to power.  The downvotes he would get would stop him in his tracks!

So lame. Actual PvP with level 60 is where the fun is at
---
Lmfao is he actually doing whippits? What a knob
---
I actually don't disagree with you really, it wasn't the best response. But at the same time.. mods get pretty weary dealing with the same old stuff day in and day out. They work for free and only really ask that people *try* before making everything their problem.
---
And while the mods response was a bit average, OPs reaction was to make a thread calling them "dickish" despite being at least partly in the wrong themselves.
---
What do you use for an off-hand? I've heard the dagger "Felstriker" supplements Ironfoe tremendously, especially since your ironfoes double hit procs can all be crits if both proc together. It's hard to farm the dagger just a heads up lol. Here is the wowhead link. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12590/felstriker#comments
---
Keep in mind if you get both of these I wouldn't replace either of them for quite a while possibly even phase 3/4. If you are just using Ironfoe, I'd replace it with bloodletter from Onyxia IMO.
---
Seconded
---
Soloing lashers as a priest?
---
Same, my main is a rogue and I have had countless mobs stolen from me. But exactly, they can't see me when I am stealth so I can't really get mad about it.
---
 Most people add me to their farming groups once they see me break stealth and have been chill but this guy was having a bad day I guess lol.
---
Cannot agree with your assessment of Warriors. Are we playing the same game??
---
Welcome to the club. That’s the pain we all go through to play the best class at lvl 60

I'm  with you buddy! Until blizzard stop bowing to their china overlord... I won't  support them with my money. I won't  say I don't  miss classic wow because I do, but human rights is more important!  Plus, I had the pleasure of traveling to HK and It's  a lovely place unlike China
---
... there is so much I can go on about but no digress.

All I'm  saying here is I'm  also with the people of HK and people like you.

There's a Google fishing test you can take. It's pretty easy but some people would no doubt find it challenging. They are the people who should be taking the test before someone gives them internet access...
---
Please don't leave :(
---
Be happy your spec even has tier gear. Shadow priests and other specs don't ever see a set for them.
---
If it worked the first time, it should work again -- Reddit!
---
&gt; Warlocks aren't very good at farming and will die if attacked by small groups of mobs.
---
What game are you playing?
---
A very simple solution to this is to never tank for another warrior in 5 mans.  It’s what I did on my warrior and I was able to get all the dps and tank drops I needed.
---
&gt; the heal over time p
---
Thanks for the reply, I was looking at the HoT as a bonus if the main part crits. The crit on the main heal should almost make it as high as a typical healing touch heal.

Still applies to Horde if your hearth is Kargath and you're in EK when the group forms.

Thats probably the hardest part and the reason I haven't jumped ship already. A couple of the members, the founders, have been really nice and such. Just feel bad bailing on them.

Also the party leader happens to be a rogue

How about farming gold to buy the sinew? If you farmed 8 hours mara/dm instead of sinew, you would have already your sinew
---
I agree... To a point.

This post assumes that everyone involved in good natured about the bumps that occur. This has not been my experience.

I find myself using that spell to apply mass fort to groups when I enter a dungeon, because I'm sick of the tank pulling one second after I fort the entire group with my mana at 0. :D
---
Go away
---
They’re removing them for a reason
---
&gt;  have no idea what to do: I can't pull more than one mob without dying around level 15 and some quests are just not doable at the recommended level due to mob grouping.
---
So pull one mob at the time with a ranged weapon, run away until the mobs you didn't attack reset and you are fighting one mob.

I'm chill just asking questions. Maybe stop trying to apply emotion to text when no emotion has been mentioned.

Then you need to start a movement you say going there isn’t feasible. But it looks to me like you have a passion for it considering you are canceling your sub to something you enjoy. So take that passion and start a movement, you don’t even have to leave your chair get on all social media’s, create a web page, start a online strike, and push push push get people to unsubscribe get people to stand behind you. 
---
Again if not, just you alone canceling will mean nothing and only punish yourself.

You'd spend more silver paying for the flights back and forth your current zone and the closest major city to auction shit. Don't forget the time wasted in doing so where you could just post your shit in 30 seconds and be on your way again and just log in to your alt later.

 I'm horde Ashbringer aswell and can confirm what you said. Glad to hear that it's a casual server, I like that! Do you know any servers that are Ashbringer-equivalent on the alliance side?
---
honestly any mage that gives out more then 2 stacks of water for 1g is an idiot.
---
the new 55 water is roughly the same as the water+food combo people can buy at the argent dawn with friendly rep.
---
i dont remember how much it costs outright, its something like 5-10g per stack, so people saying "oh hello mage can i please get some water for 1g" are lucky to get half a stack lul
---
most mages just dont care, they see it i as a win win as it cost them nothing. then a few days after; they find themselves being spammed by people asking for more and more water til eventually they snap.
---
Sure, give me a link.

I’m a level 42 hunter and I’m a bit lost on where to run for armor right now. Is it okay to mix mail and leather armor? As DPS should I be more concerned about individual stats than just the armor increase for mail?

No it doesn't.

You said warriors have no business in PvP.

This is objectively wrong.

They are S tier in organized group play. Period.

Have you played all of these classes at 60 in actual pvp?  Or just in general? You seem to have thoughts on what all the classes do well at but like, claiming warriors are not good in PvP is ridiculous. You say warlocks are not good at farming and will be killed by a pack of small mobs seems irrelevant to PvP.  Some of the stuff you write is not inherently wrong even though some of it is just straight up wrong. You clearly don't want to listen to anyone though, judging on your replies, just realize you cant lump a class like warlock/priest together or rogue/druid together just because they share something in common, every class in WoW has its distinct advantages and disadvantages when it comes to PvP, and if a player based what class they played off reading your post they would be extremely misguided. Lol.

Hmm a passove aggressive response to a passive aggressive response. Funny that.
---
Yeah you can't gain skillpoints when attacking other players, period
---
Compared to many other games - and it took me a while to realize this - crit is quite good in WoW. Getting a piece of gear with 1% crit really increases your chance to crit by that much. In most other games I played, that 1% crit is only under the condition that your attack actually hits. In those games having a hit chance of 80% means each 1% crit effectively only nets you 0.8%, but not in WoW.
---
Such is life as a warrior. Once you hit 30 you can spec into sweeping strikes which makes taking down two mobs possible. I also recommend installing a swing timer add-on and learning how to hamstring kite which can allow you to take down mobs and lose as little health as possible compared to just standing there taking damage on each enemy auto attack. It's a grind, I'm a 39 warrior myself and it's rough but there's a light at the end of the tunnel, just keep grinding my man.

---
The fact that you think fire mages just stand there using fireball makes it very very obvious that you've either never been one or that you were very bad at one. I don't meant to make things personal but the way you're even conceited as shit about it is just embarrassing. 
---
Fire mages have everything at their disposal. They still use Frost Nova and CoC. They also get Blastwave and a shorter CD on Fireblast, use it every other spell. At higher levels you get PoM/pyro set up and get an insta-cast Pyroblast. If you time Combustion right you can stack up to 3 crits and instakill anything, even elites or players higher level than you. That's just the tip of the iceberg. 
---
The funny thing is the type of person who likes frost mage aoe grinding would be the type of fire mage who just stands there and uses fireball. It all makes complete sense to me now
---
You're still confused. I definitely support the protests.
---
10/10
---
It's been around for longer than that.
---
This did not work for me in Wailing Caverns yesterday.
---
This is so funny, I love the Missing, and Bounty sections. 
---
They also leave me very conflicted, as I had a long standing rivalry against this Gnome Mage which started in Duskwallow Marsh, where we would literally kill each other on sight, this happened for days. 
---
Reasons I would put him In Bounty:
---
He was a little shit leveling an alt mage, and had his main lvl 60 dwarf priest camping anyone that messed with his alt. 
---
Had to kill his mage multiple time, and instantly run while he would log out of his alt and into his main. I did this to fuck with him, cause he wanted to use his 60 to fuck with lowbies. I thought of it as fair, I would go so far as to wait until he pulled a good AoE group, kill him and take the mobs, xp and loot. So I can easily assume he hates me and thinks I'm the worst human being on earth. 
---
Luckily, after Duskwallow, I moved on to Tanaris, where I happened to run into him again. Then I tried to play it civil, as I'm a man with honor. The little shit gnome silenced me in a mid pull, luckily I was in a party, we turned and killed him. It was myself (a mage), a druid and a priest all mid lvl 40s. 
---
I knew what was next, he would get on his 60 priest and shit on us. I waited knowing he was bound to show up eventually. Took him 30 minutes to travel from wherever he was to Tanaris and attack us. He killed my team but I survived. I told my team that I thought as a unified team, we could kill him. So we did just that, we fought him for a tough 10 minutes or so, he went oom. And that's how we killed him.
---
We then continued questing, while waiting for him to res, then killed him again while he was trying to drink and eat after res. I felt like this was a good time to get some revenge for the times he stood at my corpse camping me for 20 minutes. It was satisfying to kill him twice and make him do that painful walk from Tanaris spirit healer to the docks. 
---
Since then, my nemesis has gone missing. 
---
I miss the kill on sight vengeance he had towards me, I would like to put him in the missing section to just make sure he was alright. But mostly to make sure that I do have another shot at fighting him in the field of battle.
---
Incendius is a blast
---
I, too, enjoy shitposting on subreddits that China doesn't give two shits about so I can feel better about myself.
---
It beats actually putting in effort to help, but I still feel good about myself!
---
The only reason that it looks this bad is because OP's render scale is set at less than 100%. Even the worst wow setting dont look this bad unless you turn down the render scale.
---
60 Hunter here, never once gotten declined to a group if I try to pug due to being a Hunter (unless it's something obvious like angerforge runs). You will do just fine in dungeons, hell even top damage on quite a few, including bosses. You are strong in PvP if you know how to deal with other classes and you can solo a lot of the PvE content.
---
But then you enter raid and realise that you are only here cause else loot will be wasted or you have to kite. But who cares, raids are 2h of your time, the actual content is still there for you to enjoy just fine.
---
Hi i was just evaluating ur emotional state. If u want know how u did, pls respond to me again.
---
Hey :)
---
Even worse when you never find a tank so the group falls apart and you're stuck sitting in front of a dungeon on the other side of the world for a run that never even began.
---
Anyone else a Warlock and feel like we rarely ask questions?  Nothing but warriors in here.  That’s fine, haha.  Just feels lonely sometimes!

---
Think about helping lower level randoms in instances. Never actually do it.
---
Check LFG to see if anyone needs a healer or dps. If healer, buy mana pots and head to instance. (Usually 5-10 min wait)
---
If DPS get ignored or asked for spec (anywhere from 10 - 30 min wait), 1 in 5 ask if I’m willing to pass on caster dps items, melee dps items, and healer items.
---
At instance: WF totem every fight. 4x totems every boss. Obsessively check dps meter to justify my choice to be an elemental shaman.
---
If in MC/ONY say I’m healer and pray nobody notices I don’t have mana tide.
---
After instance decide whether to farm or gank.

---
* This happens even with guildies
---
* Settle for doing open world farming
---
* Deal with getting ganked for 30 minutes to an hour
---
* Get spam pinged asking if I can heal or DPS x dungeon and when I say sure never get a response, being disappointed that I am never going to gear progress. 
---
* Finally get a dungeon group for a dungeon I don't need just so I can make money and feel good helping other people, get harassed about not dropping windfury for the one underleveled rogue or warrior when there is a hunter and a druid tank that benefit more from grace, oh and we constantly pull when I'm oom so totem upkeep is hell. 
---
* Log off game or decide to play alt.

Sadly thats true. Low effort meme rule is the biggest issue.. Only thing that happens with that rule is that the same meme gets spammed to death because only one person actually takes time to create a matching theme

Don’t assume everyone has read all the guides and has done it 50 times. Good luck!
---
This is not a good way to reset though. The real way is to invite a 6th character (can be anyones alt or a 6th person willing to reset for you), give the character that will reset the dungeon lead, everyone who is running the dungeon loggs out to character select screen, waits for the 6th person the reset the dungeon for you and then you logg back in. This way the dungeon is completly reset and you will be teleported to the beginning of the instance with everything reset.

---
Are you talking lvl 60 alts?
---
Cos sure. But just alts in general, most had atleast a couple.
---
Man i only read the first 5 sentences and i think youve mistaken something its not called daycare its called /wowclassic
---
Wow
---
well alot of that is reaction.
---
1. you can hear the stealth sound (and there are even addons that tell you if some form of stealth is used nearby)
---
2. they arnt going to 1 shot a decent mage before he can react.
---
the strat (macro) isnt really just for duels, it just assumes you know someones there. 
---
yes shit can happen, a rogue could come out when im completely oom with no hp and 1 shot me. but thats not a real strat, most 60s arnt walking around oom or low on hp.
---
this isnt 2 people fighting on equal footing, thats just ganking someone. which any class can do at any time, and the only counter play to that in solo play is too be paranoid as fuck.
---
on top of that the GCD is something like 1.5 to 2 seconds. if a player cant react to something after 2 seconds, no strat is going to help them. i have been ambushed while in the world out of know where, and i just did a normal blink+poly, like that macro isnt for 99% of the rogues. its for the tryhard rogues that i either duel or if i know a rogue is coming for me (and i know he'll open like that).
---
and lastly, most rogues in general, let alone ones ganking out in the world. arnt usually that good...they dont exactly react too quickly to things so they would struggle to gouge after the ambush before a blink or some other instant cast type of escape/cc.
---
thats why most 1v1 strats are focused on duels and psuedo duels (where 2 ppl of an enemy faction allow eachother to heal up and get ready, which is rare but they do sometimes happen) and not random ganks in world pvp.
---
ganking in world pvp =/= skill, anyone regardless of skill could pop every offensive cooldown and kill someone really fast if they dont expect it. well cept the classes have that no offensive cds but they usually have really high raw dmg.
---
for me im just hyper paranoid, i always refresh ice barrier, i run around in ice armor instead of mage armor simply so i can hurt any melee's that may attack me from some random corner. and ofc as im casting im always looking around.
---
generally i can spot a rogue as they circle me, cuz for some reason they always circle me like there a fucking shark. and i can start spamming my macro if needed.
---
Yes and at the same time this kind of human expects them to help. Funny innit lad
---
Wait did i call it human? Nvm.
---
Yesterday I was saying in /g that earlier I wanted to run dmw but no one else wanted in response to someone who just logged on saying they wanted to run it. Anyways we got a full group formed after some more people said they'd do it. And one guy was like can I get a summon. I'm like I'm in burning stepes, I can guarantee you'll beat me there.
---
I think you're putting too much importance in the job, I remember when the /r/lol subreddit had a mod free week, the sub essentially didn't change significantly aside from the post here and there largely incited by moderatora asking other subs to brigade /r/lol that week.

god this subreddit sucks ass

Ah, gotcha.

As a woyer tank, I always mock my dungeonmates when they sit to drink, with a "me mana be running low" followed with a male troll laugh.

I've been leveling feral and I think I'll stay feral for awhile at 60.  I'm a pretty decent tank, and since tanks are the hardest thing to find and I enjoy running five mans more than raiding anyways, I can build up my healing set for those rare raids I plan on doing simply by getting rot loot.
---
How can I calculate my healing properly? I have gear with + healing, but I don‘t know how to come to a definitive number. I‘ve heard my healing as a paladin should be between 100-200 and the rest on INT and mana regen. Should I just add the +healing together? 
---
And how much +INT is better than a certain ammount of + healing? 
---
Cheers!

You’re such a hero.

This loops so perfectly that I've watched it like 15 times on loop every few hours since you posted it.
---
I've played all of them except a Druid and Priest to 60. For those, you can watch streamers or old videos and see exactly what I'm talking about. I did list a few pros/cons that aren't PVP related, as in the Warlock sucking at farming, but I don't think that detracts from the overall article.
---
There's a spell with a higher aggro modifier called searing something. If you see them using that in a group, then you'll know why they pulled aggro.
---
So don’t join the group if you aren’t prepared with a close by hearth or some other way to get there 🤷‍♂️
---
It says so in the tooltip?
---
It's ok to admit when you are wrong.
---
Feral has BIG damage in PVP and self-heals which Rogues do not. I think it's a fair comparison.
---
No it's because they're pre raid lists.  You're not gonna go from 5 mans straight into Naxx.
---
How do you not run out of mana? The 5 sec rule doesn’t kick in so you don’t regen and even if it’s low ranked spells, you will go oom.
---
Reserved loot is hilarious, it makes me laugh even more when it's "lf1m tank (Most desired item in this instance reserved)" Why would a tank want to come with a group that selfish, even if the tank already has said item?
---
Half the time at least one of the assholes waiting for summon is like a five minute fp away.
---
Fair enough

I just wanted to make a shitpost where I got to reference my favorite scene from "The Office".
---
A warrior with a pocket healer happens rarely in open world play or even BGs unless organized beforehand. But in this case, it can give them a leg up, but it won't stop CC and if they take out the healer the Warrior is done.
---
Looks like Sid Haig from the Rob Zombie movies.

If there is lots of enemy faction inside and you can just dump for a second then it's hard to coordinate to make your entire party leave, reset and jump back in.

Attacks in berserker stance generate less threat. The only great options are fury/prot or arms/prot

I think my problem is I leveled too fast, and I'm more casual than I thought, and got mixed up in a guild that promised to be casual and definitely isn't. The kind of people that have the same, not-so elitist mindset all seem to be in the 30s and 40s still... I just didnt want to miss out on raiding... lol
---
Also, Many of my guilds hunters are topping the raid dps charts simply because people playing fury warrior and frost mage are terrible... Play what you want, try hard, you'll do fine.
---
Because they don't value anyone's time except their own.  A lot of people play incredibly selfishly.  Like, I understand people join dungeons to get loot and will roll on anything they can equip, but I really get pissed off by people who show zero respect for the time of their groupmates. I tank, and if I'm running to the instance I'll check the map and ask people if they're hearthed near. If they aren't and I see they're farming somewhere and making no progress towards the instances, I'll politely ask them to begin heading there. If they don't respond or if they say "I'm just finishing X before I head there" I'll ask them to begin moving right now because it's already going to take them 15+ minutes to get to the instance and it's rude to make everyone wait just so they can farm/mine or whatever solo activity they're doing.  If they cop an attitude I just leave the group.
---

Ungrouped play mainly. Leveling. 1v1 open world. 99% of what most players will be doing in P1. P2 will have a BG and a nerfed trinket, so that will help some.

I also have problems with getting the health bar to actually go down when taking damage.  The mana bar will go up and down with mana use, but health stays showing "full" despite being like 1500/2500 on the right.
---
You did a great job justifying why you acted like an asshole!
---
vielleicht bin ich zu gutgläubig um 3 Uhr nachts
---
What I did quite a lot while leveling (and now) is at the end of the instance, if it's been a good group just say 'thanks for the run, please feel free to add and /w me if you ever need a tank!'. Youd be surprised how much this works and gives tiu a good rep.
---
but then once you're raiding you basically have no competition because other rogues want to stick with swords.
---
Once I hit 60, how long does it take as a fury warrior to get the proper gear before I can start dual wielding?
---
Locks have zero threat reduction talents. Rogues/warriors will miss a lot of attack to help reduce their threat(well, not reduce, but miss hit = no threat), but locks get 100% of it.
---
Honestly, I tried the exact same thing lol... TBC was released and I was like “OH I GET TO PLAY PALLY AS HORDE NOW!!!” So I made a paladin and I got to around 40 and was so frustrated I couldn’t teleport.. lol not being able to tele anywhere I wanted made me main my mage until end of MoP (when I stopped playing). Good that you found the class you love. 
---
I had multiple alts but they were all twinks!! I’m excited for my 49 shammy twink!
---
tanks dont take an hour to get there. i play a tank and as i just said, i always go to the dungeon entrance before making or joining a group. always the first person
---
Gut möglich haha.
---
my first char in vanilla was a lock so i always had to be at the dungeon to summon the other 2 members that cbf'd going to it.
---
it's now a habit to at least be on the same continent before joining a group on my war. alt. if they advertise as 'can summon' i join if i want to run it. 
---
although my hearth is at UC so it's pretty quick to get to the ones i want to run.
---
Unless he's using searing pain (which he shouldn't be) threat works normally for locks. Supposedly at least.
---
Searing pain generates more threat than it's damage would normally generate just fyi
---
No they aren't. Blizzard decided to release Dire Maul on their own - majority wasnt asking for it. If you blame someone blame blizzard instead of people playing the game.
---
Keep in mind you can also buy the cheapest low level white gun off a vendor and thus do total shit tier damage with it while training weapon skill.
---
&gt; It was refreshing being able to actually play the game.
---
You: Yeah, but now it's ruining my experience as a Horde :-/
---

---
You can always farm maraudon for gold as well.
---
I'm pretty well informed, If I have any other way of supporting, trust me that I'm acting on it. To be real with you, I think it's pretty weak willed that you're so well informed but still unwilling to act on it. You have to be willing to give up a mite of happiness for someone else, or else your principles are just ideals, and you're not really "standing" for anything.
---
Bruh
---
Oh yes you’re right I read your statement wrong. 
---
Isn’t that good for threat gen tho? Probably a useful rage dumb I suppose idk
---
No.
---
I should do that lol
---
If you can't support blizzard because of political views that's fine.
---
But I have chinese clothes, chinese phone, chinese monitors, several parts of my computer are chinese made. Chinese power cables.
---
I am not rich enough to be able to avoid everything made in china. And as much as I hate what blizzard is doing that's just how it is.
---
You should see a doctor.
---
I am lvl 300, +20 (fishing pole) and +100 (aquadynamic fish attractor), so 420 total, and I still get the occasional 'fish go away', albeit quite rare though.
---
&gt;I’m fury!
---
Best and most relatable part.
---
But for real... a feral off tank will out DPS a fury warrior in this phase (single target with MCP and it’s not even debatable — most good druids could match their DPS without MCP on single target) *and* tank eons better. Not to mention they bring LotP. No clue why more ferals aren’t allowed...especially in these early phases and especially on Alliance.
---
Feral Equality!
---
The ones I'm aware of aren't getting any money from me either.
---
You are very uninformed. No BG release in P2. Is this list a troll post?
---
**This is from wiki:**   
---
" Players also receive 1 point of ranged attack power (RAP) per point of agility. Also, 1 AP = 1 Ranged Attack Power (RAP). Unless an item or effect specifically says "+\_\_ to Melee Attack Power" or "+\_\_ to Ranged Attack Power" then this is true. If it adds to Attack Power and does not specify "Melee" or "Ranged" then it always adds equally to both Ranged Attack Power and Melee Attack Power. "  
---
**This is from icy veinz:**  
---
 Attack Power increases the damage you deal. The damage of all of your abilities and attacks are calculated based off your AP. It is important to note that ranged attack power and melee attack power are separate stats. If something increases your attack power, it affects both, but sometimes items will specify either ranged or melee attack power, which only affect your ranged and melee attacks respectively.
---
I'm in Heartseeker, as a horde.
---
You keep making these broad claims but I'll just say it happens all the time in BGs, even when not predetermined
---
You can make a choice, one piece at a time.
---
I agree with some of this in terms of 1v1 but I guess this is more opinion based. I feel like priests and locks are too low on that list and rogues druids are a tier too high or should be seperated more than anything.
---
I disagree .. 2 point in HS are a waste. You almost never use it. Parry is the better choice
---
total bruh moment tbqh
---
This is so wrong in so many ways. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
---
There's an addon (MRP/TRP) that allows you to write an RP profile for your character, every RP server is normally flooded with people who have them, because they are a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE part of RPing, if someone doesn't have one that normally means they aren't interested in RP at all.
---
Without herbalism enchanting would be better imo.  Not much difference in AC crystals vs. bars price and buying herbs to convert to consumables would be less profitable than tips for enchants and the value of DE instead of vendoring.
---
/How is warlock?
---
HoJ is irreplaceable. The hit will outweigh the crit if you've got no hit.
---
You can't? Seems fake
---
Yes its ok for rage dumb. But if you can't use ur instant abilites on CD if you use HS its not worth imo (and this happens quite often)
---
To be fair, tanking can be hard. For a new player, one very shitty experience is all it takes to stick with dps.
---
I honestly just put a point in imp cleave because i had a talent point left. It seemed the most reasonable because of the dps increase, rather than some rage cost decrease, because this build  makes a lot of rage anyways.
---
working as intended
---
You have to be trolling. Because I refuse to believe that you’re this stupid.
---
if you are instance capped it does use hearthstone right? that would explain some things for me
---
Fly on icarus
---
They can ban me. So far, I haven't read a single word from you that would change my mind. Let alone a word that has any substance.
---
Here I am, 69 years old, married for 42.0 of them and have 3.50 children and 2 full time jobs working 25/8 of the week. Still only level 7. Take your time, people. Game's been out for less than 2 months, jeez. Don't let anyone tell you how to play! Slow down.
---
You will be waiting a while. We do not remove posts complaining about moderation, unless it blatantly breaks a rule. This doesn't break any rules.

I'm top 3 dps in MC, the 4 times I've run it so far. Hunter falls off later
---
10 minutes after they join
---
"hey man you coming?"
---
"yea my bad I was just doing 4 quests, collecting herbs, and getting my timbermaul rep to exalted"
---
Ya pretty much this. If there’s a piece of gear I want, I either reserve it or compile a group so only I can roll on it. #tanklife
---
This is why I just go there and post in local.
---
I try to understand your point but I don't see hard ore people having negative effect on the game. Classic is classic and nothing is changing the game from what it was then.
---
I could argue casual mindset ruined retail and that's why we are here trying all enjoy classic.
---
I use it instead of sunder armor when i have applied 5, but i can see your point
---
Lol
---
Classic STV is extremely tame compared to Vanilla. Back then red=dead meant something and wasn't some tryhard phrase. Most players did attack any member of the opposing faction, there was no peaceful questing side by side. The very notion of looking for blue shards for Kebok and sharing the spawns with the opposing faction? Unthinkable. Yet here at the Venture Co Strip miner area you have  multiple alliance and horde grinding goblins. 
---
In retrospect they should have launched with the honor system already in place. The whole way to level 60 was way too peaceful.
---
The turtle's name completes this scene perfectly.
---
As someone who didn’t get their mount until like 46 and mains a healer... I’m sorry lol. I also was pretty bad until I got the right addons. With that being said, my priest is Alliance so the run isn’t near as bad pretty sure.
---
Edit: I just registered they ran from UC holy shit lol.
---
what the fuck is even that?!
---
get on, raid MC / ony, log off
---
You have to figure out what you want to do with this build then.., because in the title you suggest this is for tanking dungeons. 5\5 parry is what you should take for tanking dungeons.... Not imp rend or hs. Hs shouldn't even be on your bars.  Go no farther than anger management arms, grab everything good in prot and have enough left for 4\5 cruelty.
---
wouldnt gut ripper be a better oh while having a thrash blade mainhand then the vanq sword on offhand more dps and faster attackspeed on gut ripper until marah
---
By "screenshot" you mean a poloroid of the monitor, right?
---
Y’all hate him but Asmon does exceptional DPS as a tank.
---
I dunno, l2p? Separate mobs with the technique of pulling from range, running, tag it again and keep running until all but the mob you want to fight leashes back to spawn. This is basic stuff here.
---
If you're having troubles now I'd submit that maybe Warrior class isn't for you in Classic.
---
Thanks for tips man but I forgot mentioning im Europoor.
---
Man dont forget to write ding! Each time you lvl up. In g chat general AND global.
---
But for real the answer can be found within the first 3 google results. Dont even have to open the link, its in the description below the link.
---
What would be the point if it’s the same as trade then..... it works everywhere
---
just change spec to dps
---
As horde this is questionable
---
So you're saying one day I'm gonna regret this when blizzard changes their stance, and I'm gonna regret it because I won't be able to play any more?
---
It's just the dogs. The dogs have extra stealth detection range.
---
The speed of this video was aids
---
Does cleave ever get more than two mobs at once?
---
I am 100% sure someone has posted something like this 2 times today and 3 times yesterday. But I'll bite, again.
---
Druids being able to interact with NPCs and use consumables while shapeshifted.
---
Somebody edit this with that falling song lmao 
---
I’m disappointed it wasn’t already edited
---
Fury/prot warrior.
---
This has been the last few days for me: Log in, open inventory and look at sweet sweet lionheart helm. Check mail for ah, and put non-sold items back on. Ask guildies who wants to do dm:e for the bow, quel serrar and veins. Someone usually does, if not I go to lfg and find group.use engineering to to gadgetzan, so I gotta wait a bit for ppl to get there. Tank the whole dung including imp. I’m usually one of the top dps and it’s quite fun and engaging gameplay, except for no stance-dance. Do a tribute run after 1 or 2 east runs, for the buffs and the ring (and QS obv). Then there are raid nights where it’s the same except for the 11/11 after 2,5-3,5 hrs, and then back to dm. Got 11 dm:e clears this far, where I have seen 2 dusty tomes. One had priest book and the other a grey fishing book. Repeat until I get bored and go level an alt for future phase pvp. Yep that’s right I don’t have a job atm.
---
Yeah the dev had a chuckle with that one.
---
Just join one of the leveler guilds there's always groups going. Then when you get to 60 you join a real guild
---
I’m completely relaxed mate, we’ve gone over that. But if you’re done then great, you have a good one.
---
All these people saying you should tank but I feel you man.  I tanked more than a few dungeons in classic so far and its just so frustrating how bad dps can be.
---
"Sigh"... Blizzard isnt taking a stance on anything except people using broadcasted streams to promote something completely unrelated to the broadcast. They cant pick a side, and for not doing it you say that they did.
---
I’m a daggers rogue because I’m insane. Currently level 40. But I look at the available daggers between where I am (Black Menace) and 60 and it’s kinda depressing. Widowmaker at 42 if a miracle happens, Satyr’s Lash at 45, Lifeforce Dirk at 50, and after that, I’d almost have more luck getting a Perdition’s Blade or Core Hound Tooth than any of the preBiS options.
---
I honestly do wish locks had a spell that transported their enemy to a realm of nightmares and when it gets used on you your whole screen gets spooky AF
---
I do as a Paladin, yeah. It takes up a lot of bag and bank space but I really enjoy playing all three roles in dungeons. Makes the game more interesting IMO.
---
More flight paths.
---
Elemental shaman. Alch/herbs

-Do I go around and pick flowers while looking for a fight? Or, do I hunt some bis? Both equally fun/useful.

Lashers are not impossible, in fact they are pretty easy to solo as a warlock but their loot table is crap not worth doing.
---
I solo the first 3 bosses in East that's decent with a bit of good luck, not sure if it will be better than mara though.
---
Saying nothing is pretty loud. The same as any human watching a wrong and doing nothing.
---
Right on, thanks. I RP on Grob and had no idea.
---
Druids able to create a portal to Moonglade at higher levels / rep with Cenarion Circle
---
That’s what’s annoyed me about this community. I’m new to wow and even I’ve experienced it in the game as well. If you know what the answer it just say it. If you don’t want to waste the time to answer it then just ignore it instead of trying to seem superior in a community for a video game.
---
Yeah, but at least m+ is itself competitive and challenging and scales both in difficulty and reward so rolling a tank just to do m+ content is fun.
---
i love my class for these cases, when party leader advertises "have warlock can tp" party instantly fills lol.
---
No, he has to be out of shift. Just be good with positioning. The imp usually dies by the end but it doesn't matter, keep it alive as long as possible.
---
Honeslty? 
---
Probably just the barbershop. Since it has literally zero effect on gameplay. 
---
Maybe expanded character creation options? Obviously not the never models or anything, just more faces/hairstyles/skin tones. (But then even retail WoW is behind the curve in this department compared to other games).
---
You're so upset guildies invite me to groups lol.
---
Eh, you have utility talents without power talents. If you like to PvP or farm in the world, you can tank dungeons fine with https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023150213520105001-05-05204103
---
If you might want to foray into raid tanking or feel like you're making life too hard for your healer and PvP and farming is less a focus but still a consideration, try https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/023150213520105001-05-5420013

Just thoughts if you like using a 2H sometimes.

It definitely is
---
LFG unironically
---
Instant mail to alt characters on the same account.
---
Do something with Uldum?
---
What?  Warriors are one of the best raiding class, druid is probably tied for last with hunter.  What's your logic again?
---
If you think a few thousand westerners cancelling their wow subs will make a statement, you're wrong. If it helps you sleep at night , cancel your sub, but dont think you're "sticking it to the man".
---
What did you smoke?
---
Barbershop. Hair change only, no plastic surgery (although i dont really care about the latter, but I know some do).
---
That’s where I made my mount gold. Solid stream of money right there.
---
But its within the first 3 results on google...
---
Its less reasonable to start drama on reddit instead of googling something and literally click on one of the first 3 results....

was running BRD with this mage earlier, and he kept asking us to help him finish this one quest in the dungeon, despite us telling him we will after we cleared the bosses we needed.  we finally caved and just helped him so he would shut up.  he then hearths to kagarth to hand in the quest and walks back to the dungeon.  like why wouldn't you wait until the run is over
---
I spent a year in UBRS trying to get my shadow craft chest piece. RNG can be a bitch.
---
Youre right, but being condescending just for fun is dickish.
---
&gt;We aren't here to be assholes.
---
Then stop being one.
---
We'll here's good news. Druids can tank almost any boss a warrior can in raids. Look up skarmtank for some good advice on what you'll need. Do what you like, especially when it comes to tanking. I'm about to start my druid once I get my warrior rounded out, myself.
---
haha you suck and we hate you!
---
Edit: Fuck you’re a mod need to add this: /s
---
Is it possible to do a mouseover emote macro?
---
Yes you could, and you'd be right. However, never before have single people been in possession of crowds of followers in game that constitute very vocal factions, and which are viewed by their number by games companies and their marketing teams, and who have nothing else to do but chew through content 12 hours a day. That's why you have situations like in the video linked here where lead devs are fawning over the influence of streamers, and responding in podcasts with "we're open to your ideas, what are they?"
---
Who are these streamers to have a clear voice into games? I've watched lots of them, and just as often as not they are simply self-serving businessmen trying to make a living from having people watch them play. They are entertainers trying to secure views and subs. Who are Esfan, Asmongold, BeSafe but oftentimes ragey opinionists with an inflated sense of their own importance. I don't want them having a voice into the games I'm playing. Why should they?
---
In contrast, devs used to hold the opinions of their fans and the "influencers" in tension, which is why I mentioned MMO "Uber Guilds". I can't recall how many times the player base in games was told "no, we're not doing that". And games were better for it. Now you and I have to trust the ongoing future of games we are invested in to the toxic view-grabbing gibberings of stay at home entertainers with nothing to recommend their opinions above anyone else's except that it's loaded _literally_ with monetary self-interest.
---
It's not that hard if you don't make it your life to tank every single enemy. Stick to 3 targets at max and keep aggro from the healer. The DDs can handle aggro themselves fairly well.
---
I'm in the same boat! I'm thinking of going for distracting dagger in off hand, and main handing whatever dagger has the best weapon damage I can find until I get one of the daggers from MC. As for gear I think sticking to the normal rogue bis is fine unless you can snatch up 6/8 of shadowcraft
---
Aw I need a meme generator for this!!!
---
This was the only thing op said that i agreed with lol. Ice block, blink, poly, mages have some of the strongest spells in the game.
---
I am full prebis besides dal rend MH which I have done over 70 runs for, and I have used best consumables every raid. It is a shit guild. I see one of the officers has found the thread.
---
You have full prebis? Oh lets give the loot to an officer so he wont have to grind x item, and we know he will stay. Lets also gove him the next 4 epics because you know, reasons
---
No he's not saying that. He's saying it takes an hour to find a tank to fill the last spot in the group
---
It is extremely disheartening when mods act callously/their messages come off the way yours did. Maybe think about getting more mods if you are so overwhelmed with mod work that you need to be rude to people to get through it quickly.
---
Well he could have a point using another economic principle: Each additional dollar had a lesser value in "happiness" than the previous one.
---
So if you're early in the game and lose 10 times a 1 gold to the 5% fee and then later when you have more money lose 10 gold to the same fee you've technically lost the same amount but the subsequent 10 golds are worth less than your previous 10 gold (I'm keeping inflation equal because the 5% fee is multiplicative with inflation so inflation has no effect here except to change the specific values of my example but not its point).
---
This would only make sense of you ran with the exact same group each time wouldn't it?
---
Didn't know Ironfoe's speed at the time; figured it was 2.9 (turns out 2.4; not a bad guess!) with chance on hit for x2 hits.
---
He was just trying to get more attuned to Elune.
---
You picked 2-handed specialisation. Is that because you are tanking with two-handers or you want that one for farming when out of a dungeon? You might as well go full arms, you can still tank dungeons (and  even raids if you are allowed) with it.
---
Greater Nether Essences are super valuable
---
'Need more pylons'
---
Can you post an example of it?
---
I wish furblogs made the playable list along the way. Ah well.
---
Shouldn't take too long. You can start your gear grind earlier than 60. Mara ring from princess is wonderful and you can start farming that pretty early.
---
Go start a sub that has a particular direction you want it to go, get a significant number of users, then don't moderate it. Your view will change quite rapidly unless that view is "emulate the worst places on the internet until the reddit admins ban you".
---
Spamming demoralizing shout is hard?
---
Or just roll with the punches instead of being so damn rigid?
---
Yeah except for when someone else is lead and resets the dungeon, or you get feared under the portal and that counts as a "reset".
---
You can still do DME lasherfarm easily in any spec. Around as profitable as ZF if you have herbalism, depending on herb prices on your server
---
That’s pretty reasonable, i’ll keep that in mind!
---
No it wasnt...
---
they stop BUT a player will press W out of habit once the fear is over and if you're right on the edge... you fall
---
Take my upvote good sir.  I did not know this, and infact read it as "You can't" and was like, ya no shit dude.. hahaha.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I think it's the other way around. The servers you can transfer to are pretty much empty and Blizz wants people to make them more crowded I'd say.
---
PRAISE TALOS
---
&gt; i play a tank
---
So you never need to wait for one. What he is saying is that to find a tank for a run, not even the travel time for the tank to get to the instance, is like an hour.
---
Priest is the most demanding healing class on alliance, but Paladins probably have the highest impact. Stacking paladins provides a much better benefit than stacking priests or druids because their buffs stack (each Paladin can buff each group member with a different buff). And their single targets heal efficiency just outshines everything else.
---
It takes 3 people to summon a person. I doubt that any high level warlock will go through the hassle of finding 2 people to summon you just for 1g.
---

the first priest in the screenshot is in a different pug (which i would have gone to instead) as this raid they didn't have the waters to summon domo.
---
the bottom druid you can see is in the raid (assistant rl) and say nothing about reserves, in fact they added the line of open rolls on mats as well.

Boy. this classic experience is exactly how I remember it! #nochanges

Today on the Internet: Group of forum users shocked that moderator of video game subreddit is an edgy shitlord,  more at 10.
---
I was about to say, that doesn't look familiar...
---
What would happen if we had no mods? Could people possible handle the chaos? Could they be relied upon to use the voting buttons to better their internet experience themselves? OH god no. Thank fuck for you self nominating parents. Power tripping losers is what I have heard some people think of mods. Oh please don't ban me sir.
---
Does the “it was previously a subzone of winterspring” not display? Can’t say I really care but it was a 2 second google search.
---
If that worked there then awesome, it's certainly never been my experience though and I have real doubts about how things would go long term.
---
What's special about Alliance druids? To they benefit extra from some paladin buff, or what's the deal? - A bear druid on horde side is basically a warrior, and we all know what shamans can do to them =)
---
If you die in the tunnel leading out of DM:east, how do you get back to your body? Seems that rez sickness is the only option, making that tunnel griefer paradise.
---
The mods shouldn't be dickish though.
---
The realms you can transfer to are pretty low populated, Blizzard wants to change that so they allow people to transfer there from all non-dead realms.
---
True for the mainhand, for the offhand miss chance is the same as with a 2 hander when you have a HS queued, can just cancel it before your MH swing to not spend the rage but still get the benefit.
---
As a mage, I have no problem making water/food for people. Just be aware that we could all be waiting several minutes though to do so. Buffing everyone, making water 2 at a time, times 10, for every person that needs it, drinking several times throughout. So yeah, several minutes. And once everyone has their stuff, if you all go and immediately pull something when I am oom and drinking to get it back up, I will continue to sit there and drink all of it until I'm ready lol
---
on  wowhead?
---
I do this multiple times a day. You’d be surprised at how often people would be willing to find others. Some refuse but most will perform the summon, at least in my experience. I am level 55 currently. But in all fairness I do set the filter to show the lowest level first and pm anyone above 20.
---
it never takes an hour for me. i make my own groups so its always the first spot
---
I'm just going to say it. #somechanges
---
Dual spec and/or dungeon finder (but no teleporting people into instance) would be amazing QoL updates to WoW Classic.
---
I'm not going to personally attack you, as that's not called for, but this was poor mod work.
---
Interesting, mine are not. Wonder why that is. Maybe I changed it and forgot.
---
Bro I do NOT remember this scene at all? season and episode?
---
75 linen sells to the vendor for 52 silver?
---
Because on my server it is pointless to sell linen as it sells for vendor price.
---
Just a bug with the addon. You can see 18 seconds in the video the cast bar finishes and hes still lobbing the fireball
---
I'm on Westfall, didn't know it was considered elitist. Definitely not earned, most of the people I've seen on it are terrible.
---
I'd rather you moderate all the shitposts tagged as humor than remove genuine questions, whether it can be answered through google or not.
---
Its because otherwise, we get to watch a rogue spending 20 minutes trying to find the perfect opener.
---
&gt; for the offhand miss chance is the same as with a 2 hander when you have a HS queued, can just cancel it before your MH swing to not spend the rage but still get the benefit.
---
This is incredibly unreliable for the average player with average gear on an average connection just fyi
---
I posted a hanzo with fiery enchant for sale in world, guy said “YES HOW MUCH?” Told him 50g he replied “lmao gtfo kid it’s worth 5copper”
---
Even if you give a reasonable price people still over react
---
This is one of those life changing tips that clickbait articles wish they had. I never knew about this either until this 2nd go around with classic. An easy game changer.
---
The realms you can transfer to are pretty much dead or at best very low populated, coz Blizzard fucked up and added them too late. They want to fix this now so they allow you to transfer there from any realm that is not dead itself.
---
Usually you want about the same speed for both.   We dont want to waste extra haste hits on the offhand that does less damage.
---
This should  probably be a simple Sunday question but... as a rogue who likes to keep his lockpicking updated, can I throw away dungeon keys taking up spots in my bags and just lockpick all the dungeon doors?
---
Stop being a mod man
---
If that's what you want, go create modless subs and people can go there instead. If that works for you then awesome, I'm genuinely happy for you.

Sinophobia, love to see it...

Coz the realms you can transfer to are dead. Blizzard wants to bait people into transferring there to make these realms at least somehow lively.
---
I got all the stuff I needed from all three instances in first few hours.
---
I still sell tanking services (as otherwise there's literally no reason for me to be there) but it seems to really offend people.
---
I get it, you want a tank, but if you'd rather spend the next hour spamming, instead of paying me 10g, then so be it.
---
At this point unless it's a full guild group, I'm not tanking that place anymore. And I sat there doing multibox jump runs watching people asking for hours for tanks.
---
Dang I’m sorry about that. I have such bad luck so far with pugs
---
One of the biggest issues that I've seen when playing a warlock was that people would all assume that everyone else was the one making the journey over to help summon. So 20 minutes pass by and you and one other person would be the only people there. Everyone else was just questing or hanging out in town waiting for a summon. So maybe 5 minutes after calling it out again, someone will finally make the journey over. It's both super cool to have utility wise and a major burden. It's like being the only person in a group of friends that doesn't have a 2 person truck/small car so you end up being the one driving everyone all the time.
---
 Healers know what I'm talking about with a wipe happening and most everyone else just says dead waiting for a rez while they make a 10 minute walk. And then if it gets really bad, there are respawns / Pat's somewhat deep into it, so everyone needs to go corpse walk back anyway, taking more time.
---
I’m new to tanking in classic. I actually prefer solo questing to dungeons because I’m sick of people shiting on me for not holding threat. 
---
I’ve found it’s only really easy when there’s no mages. Fuck mages.
---
It’s great for pickpocket runs
---
I like too whip out the 2h whenever possible. going full arms sounds good, i specced into fury to get piercing howl and the extra rage too compensate for the sweeping strikes. Piercing howl seems good for tidiing up messy dungeon runs
---
I already did. As the MOD you are banned from it. BEGONE! Simple powerless peasant.

Did you ever find out? I’m curious as well

The lack of plus to hit really hurts lol I'm thinking I need that natural 9 off of gear.

Anything above 9% is a waste.
---
Damn guy youre rude as shit. Im glad we can rely on you to be an arbiter of justice.
---
What's BC?
---
It is a tank weapon....
---
I was expecting to see one of the pictures a 30 minute flight path away or worse.
---
Let me tell you guys why feral tanks are awesome. They have massive threat. In threat gear they outdo warrior threat by a mile. Yes, their are bosses they cannot and should not tank, yes they require more mana from healers but IMO it all evens out, if not outperforms warriors for a lot of fights. Particularly due to classic not being anything like OG vanilla, we are quicker, better informed players, which makes our dps worlds better than in the past, which means quicker fights. How do you makes those fights even quicker and less risky? Feral Druids, that's how. 
---
TL;DR A well researched feral tank with an MCP, is better than a warrior for a lot of fights in this era.
---
&gt;  that wouldn't impact the "classic experience".  
---
Your post would decimate the entire point of this thread.
---
As funny as this is, the reality is China spanking all these American companies.
---
If you're on a PvP server and the entrance is full of enemy faction, leader can step out first and hit reset macro keybind then run back in immediately without having to wait for the entire party to step out to reset. 
---
This saves a lot of time compared to waiting for someone to run back to BRM from Thorium Point as a ghost.
---
It seems to have been clear that loot rules are MS &gt; OS. Thunderfury is not a viable DPS weapon given threat limitations. The end.
---
Summoning stones are coming in a future phase.
---
What? It’s a tier 3 talent in retribution.
---
It's even easier with wow, they save the screenshots for you.
---
On a pvp server, the area just outside of an instance portal is a warzone. Getting 5 people to zone out, then hitting reset, then they zone in after they see you zone in - you're likely to have half the party dead.
---
If they can zone out and immediately back in, less risk of death.
---
Salt.
---
When i say elitist i mean in the sense of everyone thinks you can ONLY play "the meta". I don't mean elitist in the way they are good players haha
---
I've had groups were we were looking for a tank for like 30-40 min and when a pally tank was willing to go he was met with 'pallys can't tank fuck you' and then we waited another fucking 30 min.
---
??? It’s also a DPS weapon.
---
Getting strong Cedric Diggory vibes from this picture and title...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ig4SUNg1k
---
Yea, it can be really stressful tanking for a group that doesn't target focus, tries to kite mobs that aren't slowed, and drop fear bombs instead of taking one for the team...
---
I'm around 10 days played and my mage is only 46. :)
---
Are you watching the duel tourneys? Mages are getting completely destroyed by priests, warlocks, hunters and even shamans. The only thing Mages can reliably beat is a Warrior. Every other class is a struggle.
---
People care. A lot.
---
You're experience doesn't make mine go away, and vice versa.
---
I've had several groups that we're thankful for my hunter, but just as many outright tell me to fuck off because im not a warrior/rogue/mage
---
and if you're a lock, everyone wants a summon like you can do it on your own
---
Because... you're the tank.
---
Ok this was funny. long time haven seen this clip used.
---
Does [Shadowform](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15473/shadowform) or [Shadow Weaving](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15334/shadow-weaving) affect damage dealt by a [shadow damage wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5247/rod-of-sorrow)? For example will [this fire wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5215/ember-wand) do more or less damage while in shadowform than [my current shadow wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5247/rod-of-sorrow)? It's rated at 2dps higher (33.6 to 31.8) but if I'm getting increased damage from the shadow aspect that's obviously not worth it. I've googled and read multiple forum threads and everyone has conflicting information, some say yes some say no. I've tried just basic wanding with the shadow wand in shadowform and regular and see no difference but there is also RNG with the damage at any rate. I'm just confused and hoping one of you might have an idea. Thanks.
---
Given that multiple DPS used it very successfully in Vanilla. If I’m combat swords? Guess what? Thunderfury is MS for me.
---
This isn’t world of change the loot rules in the run because legendary mats drops.
---
:’) You can downvote it’s all you like. It doesn’t change the fact that I’m not wrong.
---
It is equippable by DPS classes. However, the design of the weapon generates mass amounts of threat which has been an obvious choice and allocation for Tanks since Vanilla.
---
Yes it does DPS.
---
Yes the hunter could hold it.
---
Are those viable options to allow your tank to do his/her job? No.
---
Oh I've been kicked from a group because I didn't have the two other party members near me to summon someone. I got called a, "Useless warlock. Learn to play."
---
Same :/
---
yeah
---
Gah for real though.
---
The main reason 40 is when ele is considered better is because by then you've gotten the talent points to reduce the cast time of lightning bolt.
---
Dude invited me to his group under the premise of doing a series of Scarlet Monastery Graveyard runs. I joined, and summoned him and one other member of the group. Immediately after his summon, he removed me from the group and added me to his ignore list.
---
Do not roll Alliance on Shazzrah, a lot of people already migrating from this server because of Horde and their overpowered race abilities.
---
It would be hard not to get exasperated with the volume with which this happens though.
---
This is it chief
---
This is why people asked for LFG to be put in the game.
---
Holy Paladin:
---
- pick herbs if bored
---
- afk and play peggle
---
- do nothing
---
Amen. At least give the answer before you jerk yourself off.
---
Whatever you want.  Try them all, play what you enjoy.  Priests still use a few skills in pve, but its healing.  Maybe that?
---
I agree with you on that level. I was 60 by the end of week..2-3ish.
---
And I agree with your second point but even if you do try hard and out dps the dumb fury's/mages they still will be classist against you because you aren't one of "them"
---
Portals can be had from Kargath for about 50s (look for recently opened ones).
---
Most raid runs to MC start in Kargath, and it's a reasonable distance from WPL.
---
What was his friends name? I play on Bigg too and would like to put them on ignore
---
Classic
---
If it doesn't break the rules, there's no reason to delete it at all. A post like that either gets 2 replies or dies in new. Neither is a problem and neither requires your intervention. 
---
Having moderated a much bigger sub than this, I'll add that, 
---
&gt;If you have ever moderated a subreddit before you know you do not have the chance to google every thread question that gets removed. If you read the thread topic and it looks like something that can be answered by google that's what I go with.
---
Is just a crappy excuse for drive-by moderation, which is the worst kind of low quality moderation and just annoys users.
---
Were you using gouge? 
---
I've found that gouge was funky with rubberbanding of mobs.
---
I have that only with my friend, who uses the same name ingame as on bnet.  I've wispered other layers and havent seen that.
---
This seemed to blow up. For my part, I could have replied with a better justification. Modding this shit is hard work, and stressful I bet. Thanks for addressing this. Let's all be better people, and have fun with classic!
---
I'm horde on earthfury... Granted I'm a low level but it seems like a balanced population, zones are pleasantly full but not overcrowded, and there's tons of groups in lfg
---
Do ungoro. Do zulfarrak melee cleave, maybe maraudon or sunken temple quest run if you havent already. Horde or alliance? If you are horde and havent done hinterlands yet then head right over there. One of the best questingzones. At 52 you can spam brd for prebis till ur 60.
---
You forgot, inspect rogues in greens wearing maces and level 35 swords and seeing their Hand of Justices you JUST CANT EVER GET TO DROP
---
u got no option. go dps or u just wont get to raid
---
It's also a BIS sword for rogues until the end of TBC almost. 
---
Hunters can equip it, and quite frankly, since it was a pug, I told them they should let hunters roll on it since the bindings say hunter on them as well.
---
Because they think the only way to play is min/max despite the fact back in Vanilla my old guild did several 15 hunter runs just for the fun of it.
---
Gaming today is all about min/maxing to such an extreme if you try to go off the path or be different you get fucking slammed
---
Nah you're just making assumptions. OP left his old realm because of imbalance, and now I'm stuck in the same position he was in at his old realm. I transferred due to queue times. Nothing to do with me bullying anyone.
---
Classic did not allow transfers from pve to pvp, paid or no.
---
Yah, so you never need to wait an hour+ for a tank, which happens pretty freq for other players.
---
That seems oddly specific, but most of the poles in dire Maul are pretty easy for North most pools are two to three mobs things like the dogs and little fellow guards only have about 2,000 HP and don't need to be on me the whole time
---
East of course is just jump runs and there's hardly any trash at all it's just the bosses so it's not really a big issue for that I charge half price and just take the ore
---
West is my least favorite to tank let's have a priest for shackles, the early trees dropping a grow and then people not focusing the proper ghost usually leads to a bad time.
---
I think it's for that reason though that I've made most of my money tanking West's, definitely about 75%
---
Edit; my voice-to-text picks up pull as pool
---
Dick move by him for using you for free summons.
---
Dick move by you for breaking the subreddit rules to start a witch hunt.
---
You two belong together tbh.
---
Shadow weaving is all shadow damage, but I believe shadow form is just your spells. So the wand will be boosted by weaving, at the least.
---
2 levels in 4 days?
---
Are you online fifteen minutes each day?
---
It is not in the first 3 results for me. Don't forget google has this dope page rank algorithm that is tailored to you, so every one has a different first few links if they're signed in. 
---
Also if it's in the first 3, please send it to OP. I've literally seen no one provide him the answer despite multiple people saying how easy it is to find.
---
Just start charging people for summons imo.
---
Warriors have a 0.8 threat multiplayer while in battle and berserker stance. I'm gonna guess Warlocks just have their threat multiplied by 1 instead. It's also an issue in raids. Ragnaros is the only encounter where they can go all out.
---
I prefer druid healers over priests, always know that I am getting healed, with priests you never know if they are afk or just waiting for that inner focus max rank greater heal the amount of pots i've wasted because of this buttclenching playstyle is insane. Also dps tends to play more relaxed/carefull with a druid healer and actually waits for threath making it an overall more relaxing experience.
---
But nothing beats a well played paladin, something super soothing about that constant tsung sound and knowing there is bop available for that eager warlock.
---
My bank alt is a gnome called Karenator. She has a bitchy face, red eyes and a Karen haircut.
---
I would tank if the leveling wasn't so painful.
---
on my server finding groups is not too bad as a healer. but finding tanks is still impossible. I just don’t have a lot of time to wait an hour to find a tank, then wait for everyone to get there, then wipe twice. sux
---
Back in the day, tanks reserved orbs in strat live as their way to farm. Tank content they don't need for gold.
---
I am pretty sure they got same racial abilities on every server but thanks for the warning.
---
It’s a weapon that’s orange quality that’s BiS for every sword carrying class in the game. It’s super rare. It’s a pug.
---
RESERVE THE BINDINGS IF YOU DONT WANT TO ROLL ON THEM VS OTHER PEOPLE.
---
“It’s a tank weapon!!!!!!!” — no, it’s a weapon that’s BiS for all melee that can use swords regardless of spec.
---
As a tank. I love this. All my groups are instant and they are sitting in feralas or dm already
---
Just because it's better for tanking doesn't mean it isn't really good for dps. Melee dps absolutely have a right to roll on it if it wasn't explicitly stated that it would be tank only or reserved.
---
I think dungeons are only worth it to me when I have quest for the dungeon/rest. And blasted lands, burning steps, azshara, Un goro crater. Are some places around your level.
---
Incendius
---
Sooooooo....
---
I paid for a month subscription and started. Honestly, it’s so slow compared to retail that I’m not really going crazy progressing. It’s going pretty damned slow. 
---
But I haven’t made friends or have joined a guild yet. Playing a Orc Warrior on a PVP server. I think if I start up the retail version tho, it would be a whole different situation. 
---
Wish me luck everyone!
---
“Ad free”
---
Edit: autocorrect
---
Is... is that sarcasm? I don't know what to believe anymore.
---
Yes it was lol
---
I did but i actually am about to delete the answer. No respect for people asking for help without research and then starting a witch hunt because theyre told to research.
---
Especially when half the community hits me with an attitude despite providing answers.
---
Feels like a bunch of apes atm and im fed up.
---
Sure dog. You won me over, you're totally right you've definitely played more wow than me. That's obvious by your willingness to play a trashcan spec and urinate on 39 other people.
---
Letting the hunter roll on it is honestly pretty trolly and I can back the idea of not giving it to a hunter even if its a free roll pug.
---
Saying melee shouldn't get it because its specifically a tank weapon is bending the idea of MC&gt;OS pretty far to fit your desires.
---
Yep! I’d be down. Idk about having the group finder teleport you to the dungeon, but there should be an interface that atleast queues you and puts you in a full party of 5 that want to run it. Also adding a feature where you can’t queue for razorfen downs or anything cross continent if you’re not on the continent the dungeon is- to alleviate people having to wait too long for their group to get to the actual dungeon. I joined wow in MOP so as much as I thoroughly enjoyed teleporting to any instance through LFR or LFD- there’s something about classic and having to walk there that adds a really cool element to the game.
---
Try using Questie?
---
You won’t replace Thunderfury as a DPS until late TBC. It was also like that for tanks until the proc was changed.
---
How dare people care about the game!
---
IMO our damage is not comparable. I mean ravage crits are not as big as backstab crits for sure. Having self heals makes us druids fight entirely different from rogues. Vanish is vastly different than running away until combat drops to restealth. Nature's swiftness into healing touch is bonkers in a fight with someone who can't heal. I feel like someone who has played both classes at 60 in PvP would explain this better, but I think when you compare the two there are more things that are different than are similar.
---
Edit: what does farming have to do with PvP?
---
blasted lands
---
Lot of posts about Bread. And we still removed any sitewide bad stuff, else the sub woulda been killed.
---
Yeah it sucks.  
---
When I plan on doing a dungeon, I hearth to a city, stock up on my water, repair my gear, buy pots if I need to, and then I haul my ass to the dungeons entrance.  
---
Also, mother fuckers need to stop trying to get groups for quests they aren't on and trying to get the group to do their thing.   
---
I had 3 jailbreak groups where someone who was not on jailbreak, joined, then 10 minutes into the run, asked us to do the previous quests for them.   
---
Like really bruh? How you going to try and pull that? Have you no shame?
---
It's a game to play for fun so max your fun
---
XD no i switch between toons so i dont get bored x)
---
That's actually a thing depending on the economy. If you can't buy in bulk on the market then the seller can upcharge for selling in bulk. Imagine if alchemists could save up their transmutes to use them all later. If you want 100 transumtes from a guy that's been saving them it'll cost more. You don't really see it actually happen though. The only actual example I can think of would be in the game path of exile.
---
That’s scummy.
---
And yet it gets sales!
---
Ahh, yes, I did completely misread that. Apologies to you, I read that as you being upset at not being able to gank more alliance because they kept leaving your server.
---
My bad
---
Good point about Vanilla. Unless I'm remembering it wrong they did change that at some point though because I believe I made such a switch in Cata or MoP.
---
My guess is that the alliance warriors don't have windfury procs to catch up on DPS. I don't think druids get the benefit of windfury totem, because they use paws not weapons.
---
Sucks. I pretty much quit gaming after wrath so i wasn't too aware of how deeply people and things changed. Whole different world these days.
---
I know this is for Druid but the crux of it is similar to myself on priest. 
---
I was just wondering about downranking when you’re not max level.
---
At level 47 I have 200 healing power, I have been downranking and it seems fine, but I was just wondering if I have too low an amount of healing power for it to be majorly worth it? 
---
Thanks mate.
---
Were you sent from heaven to tell me this?
---
0/33/18 is best dungeon spec imo, high dps and great for tanking, but better hope you dont have to pvp, cause you cant dance.
---
I would if it wasn't for a dungeon that I was meant to be running with them.
---
Hell, I play a mage and constantly get shot down for *free* portals by group members. Like it costs next to nothing, this helps our group get there faster, I don't want a fuckin tip yo.
---
Searing pain is not the issue, i get aggro simply by spamming shadow bolts. Warlocks not having any threatreduction is the villain in this case.
---
Not asking people to go after him. Just letting people know that he's a dick.
---
Would’ve been messed up if that went to a dps. You’re lucky you had a knowledgeable raid leader who knows his shit.
---
Why is the rogue blowing cooldowns off the bat? Thats a rogue...
---
Cant relate, I end up making the groups because it seems on my server no one wants to.
---
For me the raiding stuff is more a matter of time and schedule.  I've got a toddler and I try to help my wife as much as possible, and I don't feel like committing to fixed raid times right now.  The guild I'm in raids, and they're cool about it. They have a special status for casual members who will fill in raid spots when time allows and there's room, and the rest of the time we make good group members for five mans for people who need to farm or who are gearing alts.
---
On Grobbulus there's a group that runs a service called Uber. You just join their channel and ask for a summon. It costs 1g
---
 That's fine on small subs or if you want to be /r/pics 2.0. Easily digested upvote fodder always gets more hits than actual good content. 
---
But even then you'll have to remove the bad stuff or admins will shut you down.
---
I've never seen anyone that afraid
---
I see no links provided for OP but insults, but you may not be the only one who changed it. I def don't think OP handled this correctly, but the "google it, it comes up in the first n links" response without posting a link always annoys me. That's just not the way google works.
---
For most of them, absolutely.
---
I think there are a few 'keys' that are necessary but don't have the option to pick (e.g. the Mara staff or Seal of Acension).
---
But for Scholo/Strath/BRD/SM/Gnomeregan/Dire Maul etc, you're absolutely fine.
---
Probably would be good lol. I'm doing a strange 16/22/13 with blade flurry until I get geared up a little more and hit 60 then I'll switch to seal fate

Lorespinner from a DM quest is very good. Decent raw stats and 3mp5.
---
You still get benefits from hit, but honestly, if your weapon skill is above 310, the weapon skill gear might be better spent on getting additional 1% hit or crit, or even straight attack power. Since, once you are above 310, +5 weapon skill &lt; 1% hit, so you'd rather have a 1% hit item in that slot if that is what you are going for.
---
That makes sense then and that's actually a really cool thing to do for/with your guild. I'm always struggling to get people together for 5 mans so I'm kinda jealous lol.
---
I haven’t tested the rogue/hunter one, but dying still effectively removes their loot contribution from the tribute chest. You may as well kill him for his individual loot at that point.
---
seduce soulfire can literally one shot priest, don't forget that. its not always the fear,dot war
---
Source: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#dodge
---
Not only does it not mention that weapon skill reduces dodge, but it in fact claims the opposite. I think this should be fixed in the guide.
---
I rolled a hunter for the first time ever in my WoW history and I'm loving it. Great for soloing content, great utility for dungeons, good DPS for raids, plus all the fun of kiting stuff to places it shouldn't be and just all around general fuckery.
---
what, it gets replaced quickly for dps. You end up with 1 handers with 50% more dps and triple the stats while leveling.
---
The aoe tps made it invaluable for tanks for a while in TBC.
---
he's talking about the chat channel
---
As a leveling healer I really appreciate Vampiric Embrace though. It saves me mana and makes it easier to handle chain pulls. Is this not the case at endgame?
---
In ZF I was melee cleaving. Which would have given me great Exp/h at around 40k. Except that after every run at least 2 people bailed and it brought me down to 25k exp/h.
---
I play warrior, and the actually answer is exclusively Rush.
---
I'm really glad you replied to this with your point of view. It's so goddamn annoying seeing everyone complain about lack of tanks and then shit on anyone they finally run with that doesn't hold threat of every mob 100% of the time. 
---
Please keep enjoying the game in the manner that you enjoy it. I would encourage you to get more comfortable with tanking and give it another try, it really is a lot of fun when you get it down. Also, being a good tank will result in TONS of people hitting you up to run dungeons 24/7. Itll be great when you get towards the end of the game and are trying to get your best in slot gear.
---
Hard mode: the "ball" is a rogue and hits Banish at random moments for random durations.
---
Oh they do ;-) My favorite tank guy in leveling dungeons is a feral druid. It's far superior to warriors, due to their ability to keep aoe threat. I'm enhancement, and we've been 2-manning a lot of 5-man content.
---
Trolling people's comment history to try and get a rise out of them is really pathetic, get a life dude lol
---
And it prevents a race to the bottom if someone else is in chat selling.
---
I hate when people respond with something like "My addon says its not worth that much" when I post something in trade based off current AH price though. Like yeah maybe 2 days ago the posts were all 10g cheaper but that isn't the case right the fuck now.
---
Here for the lols not HD
---
Awesome thanks
---
Oh god, those fucking horns. It was a nice grind I suppose but god damn those horns drop every 20 mobs or something like that, and most of the spots are typically busy.
---
And as mentioned before i learned to not respect people that start witch hunts.
---
And 99% in this comment section do exactly that instead of helping. So i aint even care what they think, even better if they ignore me in the future. Some poor human beings less to encounter.

Oh, neat! That’s good to know about, thanks for correcting me

I 100% want arena. Its fine if its instanced and you have to run there but 2v2 and 3v3 is so fun

Kargath is best hearth. Because there are constantly mages at all times of the day selling you portals. Way faster than waiting for 5 minutes on a Zep, then running for another 3 minutes to the flightmaster.

Get the Auctioneer addon

This.
---
I mean it still has RP, just not that much compared to an actual RP server, to be fair it's a LOT harder to have open world RP in places like let's say Redridge when you get ganked every 5 seconds...

Ambush directly into evis "one shot" a druid yesterday messing with my boys in badlands...

But I still want to pve lol
---
Alliance Side? Haven't seen that Horde.
---
&lt;Order of Orders&gt;
---
It's on in EU. What a pleasant surprise!
---
Old school runescape I believe
---
Makes sense about getting angry, but just so you know using the search "how to remove server names from chat wow classic" doesn't provide an adequate link on the first 2 pages for me. Apparently google hates me.
---
Dragonfang for instance. Just did census on Alliance side at 4AM on 3 realms - Golemagg, Earthshaker and Dragonfang.   
---
Golemagg - 455 people online   
---
Earthshaker - 162 people online   
---
Dragonfang - 36!! people online with 6 people being at lvl60
---
Damn i wasnt aware of the swing, good point
---
cool story t1 for pvp highwarlord bro
---
Spec heavy frost and farm Eye of Shadows. 250g or so per, I've farmed 27 of them since launch
---
We're an unruly mob of morons who posts idiotic questions and literal photos of screens constantly.  IMHO they are 100% justified in the occasional dickery.
---
The worst is the LFG spam from people who don't even bother cross-posting their pasta into the actual LFG channel. Like...why are you wasting your own time?
---
I saw UBRS Jed+Rend run with MH+OH, Jed trinket and Truestrike reserved. Like what? Also saw tons of Arena+Angerforge runs with HoJ reserve, fun stuff going to Angerforge after arena for a chance at 5g.
---
This, actually, is true. It's awkward though, and implied. Strictly speaking it's better to keep it simple.
---
The leadership set it up like this on purpose so they'd have a bench of people who could potentially fill in, but who also wouldn't demand a permanent spot.  It also helps to have people who happy to do five mans, because it's kind of lonely if most of the guild logs on right before a raid and then logs off right after the raid.  If you're a not so great player with a meme spec, they'll still give you the boot, which is fine with me. I'm casual, but I'm not lazy.
---
finding a guild that aligns with your own goals AND is filled with people you just enjoy hanging out with is quite tricky but super worth it.
---
for you, joining an endgame guild even as a "social" member would probably already make a world of difference!
---
having voice comms during dungeon runs or other shennanigans is a way better experience imo. especially since you are a new player and you still get to ask alot of questions! :)
---
i would politely part ways with your old guild and search for people you actually get to play with! :)
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
The only word in that title that ain't fucking annoying is "to".
---
Not gonna lie, a lot of times the only reason I invite a warlock instead of a mage or rogue is because of the summonings.
---
I RP everywhere I go hoping to run into people willing to reciprocate. I like open world RP. Mostly I get a bunch of confused ooc responses. So far I've only run into one person on a Zeppelin. I'm also playing horde so I'm not sure if that makes a difference.
---
Probably not worth responding, entire thread seems like a troll post at this point lol.
---
I doubt OP ever played a mage, probably got polymorphed once and made this thread.
---
Jokes on you imma mage. Just gotta conjure 100 stacks of water then tp to closest city.
---
When you're in a dungeon you probably wanna wait till the tank gets low before hitting him with a big heal.  Rejuv on other members and start-stop casting your big heals on the tank, canceling your cast if you're gonna be overhealing the tank by too much. 
---
This method allows for good mana efficiency, and mana regen via 5 second rule. 
---
Only remember to keep the tank close to full if theres a chance that you get stunned/silenced, or if the damage the tank is taking is too high. Then downrank keep him topped up, while keeping dots on too
---
I don't get it, was that ironic?
---
60 Mage: I log on, make a stack of water/food and jump right into ZF or go herbing when my brain is fried.
---
No but whirlwind at 36 does
---
Why be an asshole for no reason?Joined a SM GY dungeon group, spent money and time flying to south shore. Only to be kicked with no communication from the party leader. Avoid “Lotorm” on Alliance Kromkrush.
---
I'm leveling pure resto. Is it smart? Heck no but I like the rpg element of a rpgmmo.
---
Highest DPS ever in Classic so far is 1400 DPS (single target). Thats a lot below 2k, counting cleave is a joke.
---
Again "know what they are doing"? Explain or get the fuck out please. There is only so much you can do with sunder armor and heroic strike.
---
I can pull 1k DPS single target and fully world buffed meaning I'm not that far behind the top tier DPS despite 1. Being tauren, 2. Not being bis geared. So give me something factual here and enough with the stacking lies. Thanks.
---
Unless you had viper sting on and not enough mana to dispel.
---
Ok.
---
Turns out you can melee while casting channeled spells! I'll do a full video/article on it later but for now it's a little janky, you can see it in action in the video above. Here's the macro if you'd like to use it yourself:
---
/stopattack
---
/stopcasting [nochanneling:Mind Flay]
---
/startattack
---
/cast [nochanneling:Mind Flay] Mind Flay
---
You can insert your channeled spell of choice instead of "Mind Flay". Oh, and please let me know if you find a better macro.
---
A bank alt with T1 in Classic atm is called a main character..
---
&gt; He goes “guys it’s gonna be 30 minutes we have to do this completely unrelated quest”
---
I hope at that point you simply removed them from the party.  No arguing, just "uninvite".
---
I tanked a lower level dungeon on my tank last night and the priest would only shield me.  Every 15 seconds a shield, the occasional heal.  His enhancement shaman friend had to heal me because I would get low and the priest simply wouldn't heal.  I told them to stop shield because it denies me rage and it's less mana efficient but they just said they were disc and that's what they do.  I was blowing cooldowns, aoe fears, health pots, bandages, and stuff because the priest would just shield.
---
I liked that the shaman helped out with the heals but the shaman's main form of dps was rockbiter and using earth shock on cooldown.  She even opened with earth shocked on the mob on the pull before it reached me.  It was not a fun instance.
---
These retails boys gonna rage when they can’t hop layers 😁
---
And on the flipside people probably layered out to avoid it.
---
I have a soft spot for "blade" myself but I understand that I lack maturity.

---
Looking for an alt that will be high demand in raids after I get to 60 on it. I also wanna go enhancement shaman, I like everything about them but am afraid about ability to get into raids
---
This is the nice thing about being a warlock. As long as 2 other people join me, we'll yank the other 2 there
---
There are definitely raiding guilds. My guild just cleared MC in Wednesday and we did Ony on Thursday. There are plenty of other guilds raiding, so you shouldn't have a hard time finding a pve family.

Murder Hobos need something that will get rid of the evidence.

op is the people we put on ignore
---
you think im walking around with 2 other people 24/7 waiting to summon lazy ass people
---
This made me laugh. Game pretty much gave ya the middle finger.
---
I've found SM / Ruin to make me basically unkillable while being as annoying as possible. I deal 'a death by a thousand DOTs' while having a massively variable and highly dynamic play style that can effectively deal with both ranged and melee enemies. The skill cap seems to be limitless, and I'm just as viable in PvE as I am in PvP.
---
By dps he meant the other players in the party.  He was saying it's frustrating playing with 3 monkies who are not using their spells properly, not ccing where appropriate, breaking cc, pulling threat by attacking too early or the wrong target, running away when they pull threat, and complaining about it the whole time.
---
No too many words. You know what i will ask the gentle mod that also got low key fed up to include some sticky note that helps you guys to google.
---
The most important thing with google search is to only use the bare minimum of words, the ones that matter.
---
Like "remove realmnames chats wow"
---
The hows etc. Are words that will mess up the search.
---
But i provided the answer and still received shit so im sorry to loose my temper but reading the whole comment section just built up that rage. 
---
It was some addon for retail that was in the results. It probably works and in case it doesnt you just put the name of the addon and add "wow classic" into google search.
---
Then youd see if theres one for classic or if theyre working on one. (could also search in curseforge directly) 
---
In case they dont you can still look at the other results which are addons or blogs including addon lists for more detailed chat customization.
---
Its very unlikely that the first part doesnt work and if he googled he atleast couldve told what he googled like you and / or what he found out so far.
---
Its the same procedure as you should follow at work. 
---
Give your best to figure it out on your own. If you did and you couldnt find the exact answer, atleast share all the research youve done so far. 
---
So pretty much like you providing me with the words you used to search. 
---
When i started to work they threw hammers after me if i asked something without researching on my own first and im thankful for it.
---
The impression i got from it was someone not even trying and then starting a witch hunt for not getting his ways + way too many joining the hunt instead of helping.
---
I play warlock and actually enjoy when ppl pm me asking for summon. I like to help. My experiences with other locks have been the same.
---
I don’t see why you are so angry over a one line wisp message ?
---
The worst part is I didn't even get to say goodbye :(
---
"Cashed in my good boy points for chicken tendies, can't let them go to waste."
---
That’s amazing, but how does that work? I imagine he invites you then summons you, but couldn’t people just leave after summon and not pay?
---
You think he shouldn't have messaged the mod about not being allowed to contribute to the sub?
---
Lol. And you were never seen again!
---
Just because you're not involved in it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
---
Azeroth is flat confirmed.
---
"stay away from the summoner"
---
we like our duty
---
Awesome work! I read this a bit hesitantly because I rolled a Tauren warrior this time around. I’ve heard all the pros and cons of each race, and at the time decided Tauren would be my best choice due to the +5% health, and my main goal is tanking. However, since then, I’ve heard so many people say orc’s are undoubtedly the best warriors in all situations due to their+5 hit racial. Add on that I’m a slow leveler (just hit 45), and my guild has already relegated me to dps in raids, I keep having the nagging feeling I made a mistake and shoulda went orc. Am I right to think that your point about 310-315 skill not mattering much makes me feel slightly better about my situation, or would you agree orc is just superior (especially for dual weild fury).
---
I'm a paladin and I gotta say I've had only warlocks and mages steal my mobs.
---
That's what u/amatharra was saying. He started tanking from when classic was launched, and so many people came from anything BUT classic and don't understand how threat works and would make a stink because he "couldn't hold aggro", but was never allowed to establish any. It might be better now, but we are waiting to get to 60 to do tank/healer duo (which is only 4 levels to go so, yeay us!).
---
" You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together."
---
" And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig."
---
Over salted from birth
---
ok so what you're saying is that there are people doing double the DPS of your guildies and their tanks still aren't taking vis'kag.  Explain to me why you think tanks should take Vis'kag?   I already told you I don't tank so I don't know what good tanks do to generate threat, but I do know that the tanks in guilds like APES bipolar Progress etc. are not taking vis'kags and are dealing with literally the highest DPS players in the entire world.  I really don't give a shit about sunder armor or heroic strike, that's not my point.  My 1 and only argument is that giving tanks vis'kag is bad, and if you disagree, so are you.
---
the lashers have such little hp that a fresh level 60 priest can do this with a talent point in holy nova.
---
Not really. That's just the game. Same with other people stealing your devilsaur leather, or filling your bag with 40 happy rocks non stop for hours, or summoning an infernal at the flight master then banishing it for hours shutting down air travel. They're just things that you just have to deal with that suck but that's the game.
---
100% was my first thought as well
---
You can't pass leader to an offline player
---
I don't know but you can find out yourself. What's the coefficient on each rank of regrowth and healing touch ? Based on that coefficient, what's the hpm of each rank of regrowth and healing touch with your current bonus healing values ? Factor in your 10% crit keeping in mind the hot can't crit. Then, compare with values at 60% crit. Is regrowth still lower in hpm than healing touch ? How much lower ? Does it have higher hps, how much higher ? And finally think about the 5 points you're losing, what could you have used them for ? How about if you consider the hot portion will only tick for 30% of its duration, as in you're spamming regrowth and can't afford to let the hot tick ?
---
I would only consider using regrowth over healing touch if its hpm/hps values are similar, without the hot, which is not likely. If they aren't, it'll be better for you to use healing touch first, and then regrowth if and only you need to throw a fast panic heal on someone about to die. If the values are actually better with the hot taken into account, it'd be best to use regrowth by default and then healing touch when the hot is up (and being careful with overhealing). And then it's a matter of deciding whether 5 talent points are worth the increased hpm for you.
---
Edit : haven't healed any raids or end-game dungeons yet, so I don't know if you'll really run into any situation like this (probably not), but the regrowth crit talent could be very useful for maxing out your hps while burning your mana like crazy. I just don't really see when you'd have to do this though : if your hps is challenged, chances are your hpm is going to be even more challenged.

hilarity

shout out for no 8 minute intro , what a gentleman
---
one bite
---
What I've been doing for my warrior alt, I do the normal quests, then when they seem to get to hard, I'll throw on a sword and shield and tank a few dungeons to get a level. You wouldn't believe how much difference in power a level has while questing
---
i play in chinese server i changed the language to EN in config file, so playing the game in english. and everything works fine.
---
i think it is not about the game client or language, it is about the language settings of windows. if you haven't downloaded the said language packs, how you can even use or see them anyway?
---
14 is quick for casual play.
---
/why is warlock
---
And runeblade
---
Speed leveling, not casual leveling.
---
They nerfed demo shout spamming for free ez aoe tanking. It actually requires tab sundering and paying attention now
---
(1) Pick a tree. If you're going for sweeping strikes in Arms, you want to go for Mortal Strike because you need a 31-point talent to get a strong ability for dps/tps. Heroic strike and cleave have the problem that they consume your main hand white hit, starving you of rage.
---
(2) Pretty much never put 12 points in Fury, it's a weird number for that tree. The 6th through 10th talent point spent in fury is not very impactful. Either go deeper into fury (20 or 31), or go light on fury (3-5 for Cruelty). Unfortunately the way you're using piercing howl in dungeons is mostly a bad habit. You should be holding aggro as your main strategy, and either letting dps kite non-elites they've peeled off you or applying hamstring if you're in a very rare situation where that makes the most sense for you to do as the tank.
---
(3) 5% parry is point for point some of the best mitigation available in any tree, and the rest of arms isn't amazing enough to pass on it (in particular, heroic strike isn't used much in dungeons, rend is less useful than sunder armor for tps, and impale spec makes sense only if you're 31 arms or if you have a lot of agi/crit gear), so you'll want to get the parry.
---
(4) On the plus side, your protection spec point spend is very clean, and they are all good choices. Any criticism of them would be mostly opinion and preference. In most cases, shield spec + improved shield block is much better than anticipation. However, if you're not going to be using a shield most of the time, you just might want to skip the shield-based talents.
---
(5) Since you said you like 2h tanking, that means you'll probably want 31 arms and something like a 31/5/15 build, where you might trade off a point or two in cruelty for more protection. To clean up the spec, drop the rest of fury, take up to 3 points out of protection, and fill out arms.
---
(6) Defiance and toughness are some of the best talents in the protection tree, but you can shift 2 points out of toughness and 1 point out of defiance in order to take Last Stand, especially if you PvP. Improved overpower and 3/5 deflection is also an option if you PvP. Take axe or sword spec as appropriate of course.

---
Your alternatives are moving a few points around but staying arms/prot, taking 0 points in protection in order to tank in a dps spec (arms/fury or fury/arms), going for fury/prot, or going deep prot.
---
based moderation, thank you sir for keeping the streets clean
---
Save all "twink" gear until P3. Selling it now will met only a fraction of what it will go for later. The robe though, I'm unsure how good it is for twinks. I'm sure you can find twink guides on wowhead.
---
As a 40 Mage atm, I do want that Robe. Got a couple more Cath runs in me.
---
Summoning stones were one thing, but c'mon bro.. if you want LFG you're in the minority here.
---
What information would an rp profile generally contain?
---
Warriors are great, and quite well designed for both pvp and pve. I think the problem is probably how you’re playing it, but feel free to try something else.
---
I enjoy tanking in WoW. I don't enjoy tanking as a warrior or druid in classic.
---
&gt; Your simple question shouldn't really take up an entire post.
---
Why not?
---
Honestly, why not?
---
For smaller forums in the 00's you could make the case that you're keeping the forum on topic, or even space/hardware issues, but this is 2019. This website is full of all sorts of useless bullshit, and the posts that get seen are the ones that get upvoted and hence must have some kind of value. If they have no value they die in new and you get maybe 10 sets of eyes on your post.
---
Mods on reddit have very little value outside of banning actual toxic vitriolic people; change my mind.
---
Go to the nelf starting zone it's unique that its bottlenecked by the capital so horde being there is probably super rare. Meanwhile horde can easily get to goldshire or kharanos.
---
Sorry but what zone is top right?
---
StaySafe.... is that you?
---
Back in Wrath you could get deathgriped off the boat from the dock and end up on an underground boat in Hillsbrad
---
I’m sure I’ve gotten a couple of “ugh” from people cuz I’m in EPL when I join for DM but there is an easy solution.
---
Gadgetzan is the best place to have your hearth set as a mage (not sure for horde or any other class). You can pretty much get to any notable high lvl dungeon/raid quickly with teles except for diremaul/Onyxia/Silithus(AQ). There is a bank. There is an AH. It’s the best.
---
I don't care if wowhead already had this as a feature or whatever, I want to thank you for doing this.  Love the simple layout and the inclusion of both NA/EU lockouts.  Good work.
---
I appreciate your willingness to test the ban capabilities of a mod who has already displayed questionable amounts of fairness. Shoutouts to future me if I get banned for siding with you.
---
Ahhhh, a shitty mod AND a shitty human being, I see..
---
Well i searched in 2 different languages now. With the exact words and then various other keyword combinations.
---
Each time i found what i was looking for ^^
---
Sometimes it wasnt the exact same. Once it was wowinterface.com
---
Once it was a curseforge addon.
---
I can go and try it on my work computer aswell as on my laptop and the phone of my friend later.
---
He's summoned for 3000 groups in 2 days?
---
There are a lot of people on my server, but it feels dead because no one is talking in general chat anymore. The only chatter I ever see is in trade and lfg. I mean it is cool that people are using those channels for their intended purpose, but trade without the random bullshit is so boring.
---
Dual spec yes - group finder no no no.
---
What is "it"? Enchantrix? It probably just reads the item level and quantity and interpolates results. I am fairly certain you cannot disenchant that 184 times. If it is, it's the games best kept secret gold farm. Don't drop your profession for disenchanting.
---
But this is my thing? Who are you to judge my hobbys.
---
Not funny, because true.
---
"Just handing in quest. Be right there." Watch them on the map fly all over the other continent  before getting on the boat 30 mins later.
---
"Sorry, almost there."
---
15 mins later you're 4-manning the dungeon while they are still on their mount running to the entry.
---
You don't get four attacks from cleave. You get one attack from white  hit, one from ss from the white hit, one from cleave and one from ss from the cleave hit. 
---
The only time you'd ever use cleave is after SS and before WW when sometimes you can spend 15 seconds without getting 5 hits off to use SS.
---
Lmao you seem kinda slow
---
What about the stealth mobs in east... ghosts in west.... beastmaster boss, exploding seeds, patrolling eyeballs.  It's more than just dogs.
---
Girth Quake
---
The 50's suck. Do dungeons if you can.
---
I detach the tab so that it is a separate chat floating above the normal chat. This way I can see all the LFG requests.
---
I personally never know what goes in this sub. I've had posts locked for "low effort" still we see the same dream dust picture weekly, atleast.
---
This is why i dont like rdruids in dngs without a hybrid dps, and stay away from them.
---
I was that warrior. Sometimes I didn't have the gear or the level to tank. What's wrong with dps'ing as a warrior from time to time?
---
Literally everything, age, height, weight, background story, how the character looks including eye color, you can add backgrounds and music
---
Think about MySpace as an addon and that's it lol

---
I am considering joining this guild. Y’all raid?
---
Does anyone know hows the experience gain farming DM lashers and hounds? Do they give the same experience as mobs in that level range? I've heard their drops are not that profitable but I'm a level 58 mage mainly looking for some alternative ways to farm exp to 60, dont have long stretches of time for dungeon runs, so solo instance farming is pretty attractive to me
---
Yeah dick move, but did you communicate at all? I reckon if you join a group and don’t say anything, not even to the effect of “hi” or “omw”, then i’d see your commitment level as tentative, and might replace you if a friend asked to join. I see this all the time, people need to stop being awkward penguins in a video game and just communicate.
---
Honestly PvP servers aren't that different. Most people don't care and just want to level. It only really becomes a thing at 60, and even then it's more of a steamroll type of situation most of the time. The thrill of getting 1v5'd on your way to a dungeon and having to corpse run, or the thrill of 5v1ing a dude trying to walk into a dungeon. Not much of a thrill imo.
---
I genuinely get confused why we seem to get at least one clip of this guy posted here every day. This sub isn’t his target audience.
---
Can be used for soup. Waste not want not.
---
Warlocks are so fucking OP
---
5 leafs in a row :( saved my rolls every time too
---
LMAO what a bitch
---
Thanks for making this I heard books sometimes spawn in abnormal places but that may just be people talking out their butt.
---
I'm happy to make 30 an hour on a mediocre farming main (shaman). Usually make my money mob farming, either for essence or felcloth.
---
A real man would let you drag your balls across his face. You've earned that right.
---
I was there too brother. Did the exact same thing. Today I spent 4 hours doing brd runs. It. Finally. Dropped. My fellow warrior guildie passed it to me. The next run we do it again. It drops for him too. You just gotta keep it at. Hoj exists. It will drop eventually.
---
The only sheild you should be worried about breaking in raids is the engi aoe sheild. This guy is just an ass
---
A few of the ones in West I can't confirm but those should at least be potential spots
---
If you’re in a major city you pay upfront to another one of his alts. Otherwise you pay on arrival and yeah most people just pay it. The guy makes bank
---
The zeppelin ride of their lives
---
It's not entirely unreasonable to get a second shield as a repair backup or to use a different enchant (+7 Stam vs Thorium Shield Spike), but I wouldn't have rolled on it against someone else to do so.
---
Drop skinning. It’s just not as profitable as herbalism at high level. On my server devilsaur leather sells for 3g-8g and is a very contested farm. High level herbs like dream foil gromsblood plaugebloom etc sell for 15-20g a stack and are easy to farm while running around playing
---
I’m sitting here waiting for queue right now.
---
Was this on Fairbanks?
---
I just hit level 50 on my druid, and I was wondering if the level 50 class quests are available right now or are they planned for an upcoming phase? 
---
I'm referring specifically to the "A Better Ingredient" quest that starts at any of the druid trainers.
---
Cheers
---
what a shitty guildleader :(
---
Angle ? You mean just distracting directly towards the other end ? There's not really any angles going on, it's just you want to go left or right. There'd have to be obstacles or something to prevent the rogues from just aiming directly towards the goal, otherwise it just becomes a game of not all distracting the target at once and being able to coordinate to distract in a specific order.
---
farm hundreds of satyrs(if no respec) and lashers ( if respec) for hours, then on raid day youre ready to spam flash heal to pump those meters up.
---
Before the mindless farm youll want a solid base of 10+ bis pieces id say.
---
What game is that?
---
Yeah I was so he would stop chasing me
---
Phalluses is also acceptable. Most words that have the Latin 'i' ending are also correctly pluralized by adding 'es'.
---
Why not make an Orc and walk 2 minutes?
---
There's no point staying. The group is already dwindling, and the players that constantly log in aren't enough to make a full dungeon group. Plus your level ranges are too far apart anyway. Give it a month, and some or all of them will stop logging in too.
---
I mean, friends are great. But it's your time and money, and you can predict with high confidence how things will be in a month. I would definitely move now. Just do it.
---
Are you talking about JimBob-Ragnarok appearing in the basic chat so everyone on the server seems to have the same hyphenated last name?
---
If so you can actually check out something like a complete new UI(such as ElvUI) that is ready packaged to deal with most little nuances.
---
If you’re not respond with what you mean and I’ll try to help you if you don’t already have a fix.
---
As a holy priest:
---
1. Log on and see I have 10 gold
---
2. Run dire maul a few times, get 10 gold, level enchanting some more
---
3. Run out of gold again, bitch to your friends how you can't AoE farm or charge 60g in mats like a tank to run strat live
---
4. Have your level 52 tank guild leader tell you levelling a warrior is hard and that you get "instant dungeon groups" so you shouldnt complain
---
5. Attempt to farm devilsaur only to realize you need to be shadow spec
---
6. Advertise that your providing questing healer assistance/dungeon carries for 20g an hour/per instance and get whispered by people saying your charging too much or should do it for free
---
7. Pug a raid only to find out at the last minute that instead of 4 priests, there are actually 8 attending contrary to what the roster said
---
8. Lose bis priest healer gear to the shadow priest
---
9. Go to bed and regret rolling priest
---
similarly to druid sets.
---
not good at anything, except gold from vendoring
---
Ruffle gang represent.
---
It pains me to play classic without being able to use on others.
---
And also because most are just freaking stupid humans.
---
Name of it, then?
---
&gt; dumbass warriors trying to tank without a shield.
---
Half health in two hits, yikes.
---
Pro tip, go inside the wc instance, thats how i got my mount money is fishing in there
---
You have fun with that.
---
Demo shout does almost nothing in threat. Some but not alot.
---
Try deleting the dog shit mount/gold/ding posts first.
---
yes
---
Its some kind of bug. It comes and goes. 
---
I spent like 3 days off and on about 4 - 6 hours are a time im westfall when i noticed it doing it and was like “...huh thats weird, cant believe i didn’t notice that. Youd think they’d have removed that carryover from retail... guess not”
---
Stopped playing for a couple days, came back on... aaand its just player names now.... okay weird.... 
---
And than suddenly sometimes its like “Pallybob - Incendius”. And than other times it just shows “Pallybob” 
---
Right now i havent seen it bugged for a few days. So i honestly dont know whats causing it. 
---
It never annoyed me enough to find a solution.
---
lol yeah bro I knew you were full of it!
---
stop being lazy and look it up yourself? lmao this was years ago almost 12+ yeas ago
---
Sell!
---
It’s balanced faction wise which is nice and there are some pretty prominent alliance guilds out there they have definitely downed rag already.
---
Locks are making bnk summoning though.
---
I did 10 the other night and got a ton of journeyman backpacks, I think I got 6 or so. Not bad for about 2g worth of maps
---
Yeah!  Arrest them all!
---
Dream within a dream
---
He wanted to fuck you over.

Ima a tank. Tanks don’t walk. Can’t summon? Womp womp. Keep lookin I guess, or lmk when you can ;)

I think he should have read the rules, then read the automods reason for the post removal.
---
according to this, there is a tome that spawns in the library?  Has a ??? in a green box you made.  If so then you can stealth to the library from DM North pretty easily and open door to library.  Any idea where this tome is?
---
With gear and Power Infusion you can handle 2 packs at the same time.
---
Thats where the money begins.
---
This is why you make your rogues pick their intended spec before the items drop. No last min changes just because something cool dropped.
---
nice blog dude
---
What site/app are you using to check the census, I'd like to look at it.
---
I made a /Join Lookingforgroup macro and one for leaving.
---
I click it when I need a group and click leave when I dont need it anymore.
---
I prefer this to having multiple chat tabs.
---
its not that they don't realize people dont know and ask a question, it that they think you are below them for not knowing
---
Yesterday I got a whisper from a tank not in my guild to come DPS. Had to check I wasn't in bizarro world.
---
that's awesome, thank you!
---
As the warlock "need two more to summon" and click please!!!!!!!!!"
---
Glad you won it, ingore that person and I would stay clear of that guild as well. And seeing u want to tank it shouldnt be to hard.
---
This, but with people trying to enter dungeons. "No, no BRD for you tonight buddy. Why not take another lava swim?"
---
Yes, but good luck getting a druid.
---
I had all of my "pre-raid BiS" before I even had 3/8 Wildheart. I've collected the full set since then and it's easily the crowning achievement of my WoW career.
---
Grats on the set!
---
Ahh I get it. When you're done with a quest there's dead mobs on the ground. Is... that the point of the picture?
---
first step is you should unbind the keys that make you turn.  forces you to not do it and its pretty easy to get used to
---
A lot might be exaggerating but implying that it makes little seems wrong,those points in wrath has to do something. And what difference does 1 point of sunder armor make
---
It affects anything running macOS, not just MacBooks. I see this on my well-cooled hackintosh tower with a 980Ti.
---
`/console gxrestart` always fixes it. This is a Blizzard big, not a macOS one.
---
Im an idiot. I logged in after seeing this, targeted an inkeeper and wrote "Trick or Treat!" in chat, expecting it to work.
---
Make a solid estimate of how long it will take to get without buying it. Then make another estimate of how long it will take to make the gold to buy it.
---
Do the shorter of the two, if the times are noticeably different. If they are roughly the same, then pick the one you think will be more fun.
---
Know that gold farming is more of a guaranteed way, where as rare drops could drop the first time or the 1000th time.
---
Well I can't answer for the people who do it now, but the reason I did it? Because I loved gaming. Back then if the community didn't build those places up, they didn't exist. There was no reddit, no Xbox Live or PSN, no publisher run matchmaking servers, none of that. Everything, and I mean *everything*, was created and run by community members. 
---
This "click button get thing" age we live in was a long way away, so if you wanted a community of gamers you had to build one. If you wanted the community to have decent people in it you had to moderate it.
---
Well if I recall correctly when you distract someone they turn and face the center of your distract. So if they are on autorun and you get the angles wrong they miss the goal. Maybe instead of tennis it needs to be more like hockey, with a specific goal you have to get them into.
---
lmao yeah fuck anyone not playing a 13 year old game on max settings amirite guys
---
As a 58 prot paly with some +spelldmg plate and SkullFlame I was getting 400+ dps on those aoe pulls doing BRD Arena-Anger-Golem runs
---
I'm here because of your edit:.
---
Its blasted lands, bro.
---
You sure? It looks like blasted lands
---
For rogues I can recommend buying Krol but as a warrior you can tank and reserve Dals so easily. You just reserve them 1 at a time.
---
If your friends bailed, play what you want. Don't be afraid to reroll if you're not feeling it.
---
Honestly I think the reason so many mods come off as total goons is that moderating a forum for free generally attracts a very specific type of person who's able to powertrip on like the least amount of power possible, so that's pretty much the only people who apply/stick with it
---
Don’t listen to the people who tell you that warrior leveling is painful. Listen to the people who tell you to use a ranged weapon, tank dungeons, do green quests, etc.
---
Also, go with herbalism and alchemy. Healing potions are insanely helpful.
---
My most risqué piece of advice is to go dual wield prot. Dual wield gets you great rage, and prot gives you revenge stuns, concussion blow, and most importantly, Last Stand. At the very least, get Last Stand and then go up the arms or fury tree.
---
Last Stand, healing potions, good gear from dungeons, and fighting green mobs will make warrior leveling fun. It is for me.
---
It's not the DPS, it's the completely broken threat model in classic.  It's terrible, and we have to do a bunch of dumb things to work around it.  This is why tanking drastically changed so much from classic to wrath.   It took blizzard years to finally get it right.  There's *one* viable MT class/spec, that should tell you something about how much Blizz fucked up tanking in vanilla and why they immediately got to fixing that starting in TBC. 
---
Top guilds barely even care about mitigation in their tanks, it's all about threat generation so DPS can open up.   You need good healers for it.
---
I believe that's Blasted Lands, not Outland.
---
Some servers use lfg, some lookingforgroup, and some even use world. Just gotta find the one used the most
---
TLDR people getting triggered because a mod told someone to not be a lazy fuck and either google it and find the answer himself or post the question in the appropriate spot. Bunch of fucking snowflakes in here jesus.

Hmm so start attack then cast spell doesn't work I'm assuming?...

I need to get my hands on a wep that is exactly 3.0 speed but others have said that it doesn't work. It might be technically possible but you need to wait a millisecond or something, but like I said I need to hand-test it myself.
---
I'm using it in classic right now and it works fine. I've heard there are other apps but can't remember the names.
---
You wouldn't saying that to my face so why so aggressive online.
---
&lt;Tunnel Snakes&gt; will always be the best guild name because Tunnel Snakes rule!
---
That's a really bad pet for a hunter by the way. What you need to do is head over to the Barrens, do the quest to get Echeyakee's horn, head to the summoning point, and shove it up your butt.
---
Any drop for a “recipe” like that gives you a cooking recipe reward is going to be miserable.  You can’t expect all of the drops to be quick.  Some are like 10% or less.  A lot of the time you can just “progress” on them a bit by wiping out the spawns and moving on to a diff quest further away.  Then later on the way back do some more.  Especially if you have to wait for spawns. The goretusk liver and gnoll paw quests are seriously 2 of the worst quests in the game.  And the gnoll quest isn’t worth much.
---
With 2 people you will fly through harder quests and “kill this many”.  But you will have to be patient with drop quests.  
---
Unfortunately questing is classic is downright terrible compared to in expansions.  They are all pretty much kill this many, deliver this note, bring me drops, loot this object.  But it’s even worse when you killed 18 things for a kill quest and another different one chains into a drop quest for those same mobs.(happens in duskwood a lot).
---
It gets a lot better when you level up more.  Way more spells and abilities, talents, pvp all that.
---
What's the password to get into that orgy?
---
Sounds like Druid to me. You can be whispered to dungeon as tank or healer. Raid as tank or healer and if you’re in a dope guild, even dps as feral or boomkin. Can be good at pvp in any of those specs and although I haven’t played a lot of Druid, I’m sure farming is easy.
---
Thanks for the recommendation, maybe if I actually get into trading a bit more I will pay for their subscription. But at this point I find it unreasonable to spend money on it.
---
we have the opposite. havnt had an eye yet. we are about to start selling or pugging a hunter for domo just in case a leaf drops lol
---
You mean perhaps a simpler version of the macro? I tried a few variations, the only one that worked every time was that mess of commands in the video. But let me know if you find another one!
---
TIL prot pallies don't exist.

Not in the same capacity as when it was released, they specifically changed the API to limit that addon

&gt;After careful examination, we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.

In which they say they are specifically targeting that addon and others like it. They mention it by name.

You just need to be really fast with your /w when someone looks for a healer.

Any good gold farming spots for a lvl 31 troll shammy with 225 skining. I also have herbalism but it's way under lvld. Thinking about lvling fishing. Currently killing snappers in hillsbrad and skining them for the ah. I'm on bloodsail buccaneers btw.
---
I’m a level 51 mage on a high pop server. Literally never been asked for food or water outside a dungeon. I don’t understand why mages complain about this shit.

Side note: was it possible for him to trade the shield to someone else, in his guild, that was in the 10 man raid?
---
(I read somewhere that loot trading in raids is part of Classic, unlike Vanilla. I honestly don't know the answer, I haven't been in UBRS yet...)

Well a friend of mine had a plumber coming over.

He checks the house and says "Okay ill send over a guy the next week"

Damn I should have rolled a Druid.

😂 so true

How alliance heavy? Like a server in alliance favor? Or do you never want to even see horde again outside of a bg because 6+ alliance are corpse camping them? If it happens to be the latter than heartseeker is for you.
---
I've seen 2 drop. 1 from BRD, lord roccor, and I can't recall the second but I want to say from lbrs/ubrs.
---
He couldn't of traded it I dont think.
---
Tanks doing more damage than the healers? Seems right
---
Because healing 5 mans is easy.   Most healers dps otherwise they get bored.
---
Its an addon.
---
I am not expert in this, but maybe try unequipping it first.
---
Your definition of good is different than other people's definition of good. Why does your opinion matter more than everyone else's?
---
Why are admins policing? The only legit argument I can think of for moderation is to combat bots that abuse an upvote system, but there's no winning that battle. The awkward middle ground of mods fighting bots and shitposts just seems like a giant waste of time. In a world of bots, fully curated, trusted content is what people will eventually gravitate to - not free sites with upvote/downvote buttons or likes/retweets.
---
Yea hes trolling you lol
---
Yeah thats how I made my 1k for epic mount. 45 mins of org begging and boom.
---
That must feel awful. I'm sorry man. I think we all know the dissapointment of staying up a bit later only to not get the drop/reward/quest. Hope your next run nets you that sword.
---
Are you really that stupid? "Hunters take all the loot!" screams a *warrior which class is notorious on classic for ninja'ing everything*
---
What does Blood Fury have to do with gear ?
---
+25% BASE attack power.

+25% of your naked character's attack power.

It's pretty much only affected by the character's level.

---
Yeah we got bad luck. All the reject 'top guilds' seem to be on Westfall and are imposing the cancer meta HARD here
---
Also I forgot to mention that I'm Alliance
---
Last I heard, Incendius is 45/55 or 40/60 A/H. As alliance, I don't really have trouble finding help for pvp.
---
With better gear you get more attack power, therefore making the passive less effective. What are the typical AP numbers on a Naxx rogue?
---
The most enjoyable instances where while leveling ahead of the curve. I distinctly remeber doing gnomeregan with an under leveled group being super fun. That's how it's meant to be played. 
---
Really annoys me when ppl put silly level caps on dungeons. I got rejected from dm as a lvl 17 hunter the other day :S. It took them at least another 20 mins to find another dps even though I was sat there ready!
---
I'm the raid leader for my guild and our roster has 2 feral tank spec druids that primarily cat dps but can switch to bear in a pinch. I don't really understand the stigma, bear druids can get like 13-14k armor already which gives them 71%+ dmg reduction from physical attacks, I even have our most geared druid tank both of the hounds during the golemag fight and he's easier to heal than our previous strat of using our 2 OT near-full might warriors to tank one each. Even on Garr I have him tank 2 of the adds and he barely takes any damage, I love it and constantly turn to him when I need a beefy boi to tank multiple things for a good amount of time. (Sorry to my OTs if they read this, I love you both)
---
I have a near bis 19 rogue and leveling my shaman to 39 to put on all the bis gear I bought already. Most people haven’t made there’s yet, but I wanted it done early.
---
Good news: The active ability on pummeler is 3 time use, losing that mace wasn't really a huge deal.
---
Bad news: That active ability is considered nearly mandatory for bear tanks or feral dps druids in raids. You would need to farm it multiple times per raid to bring along extras.
---
Other news: Be a resto druid in raids and save your sanity.
---
[jannies](https://i.redd.it/xn82ha2hx9i31.jpg)
---
So you don't have any helpful input, just a personal attack and nothing more. Thanks.
---
I hate to break it to you chief but that’s literally the BIS weapon for feral tanks for all of classic. Since you’ve done Gnomer, I hope you got the key so you can go back later when you’re a high level and grind out a bunch of them solo, as you only need it for the on-use effext.
---
Don't worry about it this is really a Max level feral Druid mace.  And you will need a ton of them so just wait till your max level and can solo gnomer.
---
How do you get to BRD?
---
Horde has Kargath as the best. Quick access to BRD, MC, LBRS and mages for ports to OG and UC. DM is the only dungeon it takes long to get to, because you need to fly from OG.

---
I want to import a mining list into Gatherer2. Are there any good ones I can download?
---
Let me add: That mace is the best in slot for feral druid for the entirety of classic.
---
Level 60 Feral druids go to raids using that.
---
They also farm alot of it. You would have like 15 of them in your bag before a raid. I won't tell you why because clearly you need to do your homework about your class.
---
&gt;But nowhere in his main post said he tried googling it.  
---
2019 and you need to mention that you tried googling when asking a question. Are you for fucking real?
---
Honestly the most fucked are warlocks. They spend like at least half an hour farming soulshards.
---
Say what you will about the good old days, at least now we have Tumblr to act as a containment center for creepy weirdos on the internet.
---
They're both right though.
---
My alt server has literally non-stop "LFM ONY/MC PUGS" but my main realm, Westfall, has literally no pugs for anything but like Mara/BRD
---
Probably because trade chat has a lot more visibility than the LFG channel, so posting it in trade chat gets groups faster than the LFG channel.
---
Transferred there from Gehennas the other week and it's been so great. Good server population and have already had some great interactions with random people. Medium on evenings and finally no queues! I can play whenever I want and can take breaks or start to play later in the evening if I so choose. 
---
Much better faction balance as well, Gehennas had started to even out a little I think but it's still quite horde dominated, much more even on Earthshaker I've felt.

As a rogue I got two other rogues to stealth farm Angerforge 5 times every hour, wasn't too hard.  If people want HoJ, they should add in Golem or Fineous or atleast the freakin coffer to make it worthwhile for eveyone.
---
I mean ffs just throw 20 silver in there and call it a day, we don't usually need much, just enough to say "I realize you helped me out, here's some cash because you provided me a service"
---
Curious, where is this at?
---
Ahh that is childrens stuff. I had 3 HoJ drop before my healing trinket from Golem dropped.
---
How?

False, they all feel like a warrior.

This has been the case since actual vanilla.

As a rogue I stealth around caves mine - I stealth around DM - I stealth around and sap alliance then stealth away while they pop some abilities to try and find me.  Best thing about being a rogue though?  Stealth, no one knows your there throw a distract and people know your there but they do not know where you are.  God the life of a rogue is so nice.  Only thing I would want is a rogue with teleport to every major city.
---
I am very rarely in a city for people to annoy me about opening lockboxes.
---
&gt; Idk about having the group finder teleport you to the dungeon, but there should be an interface that atleast queues you and puts you in a full party of 5 that want to run it.

---
They love me cause I’m not a huntard. 
---
Either Create a group in 5-10 minutes or 40 mins looking for a tank
---
Ask in IF to buy mage water for me, my healer and casters.
---
Gets ganged towards an entrance of dungeons because horde has nothing else to do but camp people.
---
Start the dungeon as number one in dsp and loses spot in 5 minutes
---
Pretty much wins all your gears u less you’ve invited rogues and Dps warriors and your own class
---
I might be misunderstanding you but you still need to hit to crit in WoW.
---
It does.
---
I get it man, combat is more damage, as I said in the post. Fortunately for me, I'm not in a hardcore raiding guild, nor does my core group care much what we are running so long as it is completed. So far, no issues. 
---
So, any idea on what gear I should sub in/out to help drive the idea of the talent spec?
---
Probably not, every hunter has it by now.
---
i don't get classic. all they did was take a shitty 15 year old game and make it worse. if it wasn't for streamers...
---
Resto shaman: google ways to make good gold as a healer, look on with envy as my dps friends have already farmed for their epic mount. Show up to raid and mindlessly spam chain heal, use ankh cause i zoned out from boredom and died. Get lots of gear because every other healer is a priest.
---
Yeah I feel you. That's why I didn't roll a tank this time lol.
---
I agree, last time guy said he sells squid stack cheaper than AH. I just bought two stacks for about 1,5-2 gold and ask him for price. He says that it will be 5 g per stack. I tell him that I just bought two stacks for less than 2 gold and he says, well these were undercut and he sells for normal price. Yeah ...
---
Well I'm getting downvoted so I guess we are the minority lol
---
Ligma thralls lmao, gotem
---
Depends on the method:
---
Farming elemental essences in silithus gives you 6-10 essences per hour, one essence is 8-15g (depending on the day/time) in the auctionhouse. You can't sell them immediately and you'll get punished for posting all for them at once, but that method will give you more than 60g/h.
---
Dire Maul solo runs for hunters, 60g/h won't be a big deal, but you need some skill and engineering + preperation to achieve that.
---
Water elementals in felwood gives about 6 essences per hour, they'll raise their value as soon as the first recipes for the new epic belt (cloth) and cloak drops. This place is pretty much overfarmed during the day, but at night, it's a very good spot.
---
Essences of fire in un'goro is also an option...
---
60 gold / hour is possible, just not doable for more than 1 or 2 hours per day, or they'll lose some potential. Dire Maul solo runs are very consistent and can pretty much give you even more per hour.

---
I don't know about other classes, but hunters are able to do every essence farm without downtime. Killing 2 elementals per minute in silithus is easily doable, with tier1 3set even faster.
---
Sell it or use it. It begun on around 600g now they are around 450. Eu server medium population.
---
Yeah and the guy simply added a comment saying whatever item is also good for Warriors. That's in no way elitist. If you think it is, you are way WAY too sensitive and looking for something to be upset by. Dude responding to a 13 year old post is an idiot, but the comment isn't elitist, and OP is just trying to make a controversy from nothing.
---
OOOOF I'm sorry man that's painful.
---
Fuck blizzard
---
I wish I was able to jump down from the cliff looking back :P oh well, looks like I just gotta time my D/C perfectly again!
---
What the fuck is wrong with that youtubers voice?
---
Not if you are a rogue. Being deceitful is your job after all.
---
This can lead you to doing a whole lot of nothing for the time it takes you to form the group. Waiting at a meeting stone LFGing
---
I do the same thing with Mages lol.
---
I'm on herod alliance and it's pretty bad. Probably closer to 30-70 alliance horde after the transfers and asmon rolling horde on here. If you're looking for a balanced pop play on Grobbulus or Faerlina.
---
It's a low pop RP-PVP realm.
---
Well I don't mean group finder that teleports you to the dungeon. Just one that more easily allows you to find a group by having stated roles and dungeon you want to run.
---
If you don't have content enforcement your sub turns into /r/gaming or /r/pics. Cheap easy upvotes vs discussion and analysis. 
---
If you want another karma-farm sub, that's fine. But realise what you're asking for. 
---
And if you don't have mods at all then people post things against the sitewide rules and your sub gets banned.
---
yup i'll update that. i was more going off the blue posts, but didn't realize that the formulas and testing showed otherwise. Still think it is the simplest stat for the attack tables, as you can't ever get rid of dodge. And if you can it is pretty marginal (imo)
---
a bit over 12 days 
---
I did get Fishing and Cooking to 300
---
I have herbalism and skinning so they didn't take time to level. I also spent a solid chunk of time 37 - 40 grinding mobs for mount and just not really levelling. 
---
ps. warrior
---
Oh yeah, my dps is fine, and apparently my healing is too. I thought my healing was subpar but when I healed in raids I kept getting praise for it. And in dungeons I keep topping dps meters or matching mages and warlocks I run with. 
---
Even had a raid boss the other night where I was #10 for the fight, that fucking felt awesome. (Sure, the windfury gods may have favored me a little bit there... but... still)
---
I love /snub, I gotta try that one!
---
You made me chuckle. Well done.
---
Yup that's the name
---
boomer
---
it's so hard to pick a favorite, probably fury because the constant damage and crits just feels sooo good. but I do enjoy controling the fights as prot and find myself nit picking other tanks if im not one. my arms war is gonna be the pvper
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
Was there a dps warrior in there from his guild? He could have been rolling to then give it to him as offspec. 
---
Slimy either way
---
This is pretty much worthless... a lot of others have offered advice so follow that but yeah, this is bad.
---
I feel like that's the new fucking Rick Roll.
---
My advice is this - find a healer you like, and agree on a dungeon you'd both like to do. Then look for players in the level ranges you want, and whisper them with invites, explaining it'll probably be a slow run as you're a newbie tank.
---
Ideally, you want hunters, rogues, ret paladins ... the types who dont get invited into dungeons that much.
---
This way, you dont get angry frustrated DPS who've been in LFG for AN HOUR and just want to RUSH THE DUNGEON.
---
fuck yes brother.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
ooooh
---
so maybe that's why i haven't used it. i thought it was free. sorry.
---
also, you should have an auctioneer addon and do daily (or more) ah scans.
---
Sounds tempting, tho hunter seens so commonly played. I thought hunter falls off big time with T2 release in terms of DPS. (I dont really care, because DPS is just some stupid metric, nobody shoud care about when comparing classes) Thanks for your advice.
---
You're almost 40 so it doesn't really matter now, but you should go for mind flay.
---
Name checks out. Bro he pays them, are you stupid?
---
Depending on Ironfoe and HoJ proc rate, or if you get r14 weps, Ironfoe is BiS until late BWL. 2X Ony axe MIGHT be better if the Ironfoe proc rate is super low and youre an Orc.
---
Come on, put more effort into your bait!
---
It feels so good to stance dance again!
---
That is only good for solo PvEplay, because of the steady flow of kills. You wont get that in PvP.
---
I upvote it. I relate way more to working people who have familys rather than someone who can play wow 8hs a day. So i see these achievements as more interesting than someone who sinks there life into the game.
---
Make a bank alt n sell heavy on up on AH
---
This is honestly why a huge part of me kind of wishes the "no changes" thing wasn't such a massive part of the community. 
---
For the true vanilla experience, it would have been great if none of us knew all these statistics and blizzard was given the freedom to change some things up. Instead, everybody has a hard-set belief on what is best... Even if they are dead wrong, or their idea of what is best was what was best in 1.3, or 1.5, or anything that WASN'T 1.12. 
---
I would much rather have a druid tank that knows what they are doing than another poor warrior. I'd much rather have a boomkin that always comes prepared than a sloppy mage. I would much rather have an enhancement shaman that has perfect totem times and potions ready than a fury warrior that is constantly on their phone. 
---
But people are more focused on what class and spec you are playing than the kind of player you are.
---
lmfaooo spot on
---
It's a fuckin prot tank weapon anyone trying to roll on binding as a dps warr or a rogue or a hunter are fuckin out of their minds
---
That's so selfish and greedy like most people will never see one binding, TF is forever bis for tanking like don't be a self-centered ass hat
---
I'm not a tank btw still pisses me off to see people acting like that
---
Yay Westfall.
---
He *really* wants you to know he's doing a character without showing his face.
---
I've had decent returns from raptors and spiders in northern arathi highlands. And it's also a pretty good zone for herbs.
---
The poor drawing actually added a lot of character to it! Nicely done.
---
FOXYS IS THE TRUE LEADER.  DOWN WITH FOXY
---
The only downside to AR is there is no Lionheart pattern yet. So bring one over and make bank!
---
Thing
---
Those are Vaginae.
---
I just made a new warrior, did some research and came to the conclusion arms is the strongest overall and for newbies. But fury is a really strong pve build. 
---
Since i am on a pve server do you reccomend i go fury instead?
---
I bought krol on my rogue in vanilla, farmed fel cloth from early 50s to afford it. 
---
In classic, just stick with thrash blade imo.
---
I'm confused are you one of the dps upset you didn't get to roll?
---
It’s a lower 50 instance. You can do it at level 50.
---
the baron caller imo
---
I think we’d both be surprised about how many people would join a group, even a PUG if there was an expedited process to forming a group. That’s all I’m saying. I wish groups were easier to form/and that you didn’t have to spam a LFG macro every 2 minutes for an hour before you get any takers - even with myself playing as a dwarf healing priest.
---
Fuuuuuck. I did this just today.
---
I went with Horde Undead and I never roll Horde. Looking at classes, considered rogue but went warrior...again.
---
I've played this class over 4 times to max level.
---
I don't remember any mod brigades, maybe that happened, I dunno.
---
I remember a lot of bread, a lot of random posts, and that the admins specifically made us come back and at least keep removing illegal content or the sub was gonna go poof.
---
Mostly it was business as usual, but it's not quite that simple.
---
He did half the work to get here, he is entitled to roll on it.  Is it a shit thing to do? Yes it is, but I understand why he did it.
---
With the same reasoning, get a shield spike
---
If you look at the table here: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill you can see there is very little difference after 308
---
To use the table: Take the mobs defense, assuming 3 lvls higher = 315, and subtract your weapon skill so 315 - 308 = 7 difference.
---
On the row the table for 7 difference: 5% glancing penalty, and 5.7% miss/hit req. My understanding is miss is rounded up to 6% although that is not mentioned, so could be wrong.
---
Moving to 311 skill, reduces you to 4 difference: 5% glancing penalty, 5.4% miss/hit req - with rounding there is no difference, you still need 6% hit for special attacks to always hit.
---
So 308 is the soft point you want to hit, you wouldn't really see any benefit after that until you get to 315, when you basically only gain 1%. It is much easier to gain 1% hit on gear, than another 7 skill rating
---
Additionally on that same page it references a wowwiki post from 2006 about dodge, and that it is also reduced by 0.1% per point of weapon skill, so adding 3 more would reduce you from 6% dodge to 5.7%
---
Focus on the basics. They're all that favor a warrior early on.
---
You'll have the same experience trying to level a shaman, plus heals.
---
You want to hamstring kite and match swings 1 for 1 as best you can. Melee leeway isn't gonna let this be perfectly efficient but it's what you're aiming for and will reduce damage taken over time.
---
Also, go fury, get piercing howl, it's the only talent that matters until you're level 30.
---
Find your server's sub, it's probably more interesting
---
Hah, I abandoned pally to play warlock.
---
Would it sway you if I said the guy had reserved items aswel.
---
Dungeon farm or straight grinding.  I am making 27k exp per hour just grinding on my 47 Warrior
---
Why would you focus your gear on enhancing a lesser amount of damage (spells) when you can use it to enhance your highest damage output method (physical attacks)? Doesnt make sense to me.
---
Bird is fine for outdoors stuff. Run growl bite and screech. Claw prevents max usage of screech, the soul reason you’re using a bird in the first place. 
---
I preferred to use cats when doing leveling dungeons. Screech has a tendency to pull extra mobs if you arent careful(the scarab room in ZF brings back nightmares).
---
ignore claw, keep screech on auto cast and manually use growl.
---
This is false. You can layer while flagged just fine.
---
Can't kill me if I'm already dead
---
we will let you get to 2% before throwing you a heal if it means we get to stay in the 5 second rule for a fraction longer.
---
sorry bros lmao.
---
Truly, it's no different than the 1.12 client.
---
Fucking lol mate. I once feared a dwarf onder one of the stairs of the boat and he couldn't get out (the stairs that lead to the ship's wheel). I was gonna leave him there but that smartass started attacking other hordies who weren't smart enough to capture the beatuy of what I just accomplished and killed him - enabling him to release outside of his cage.
---
Some people just don't appreciate art the way I do.
---
*Laughs in lock*
---
I'm Alliance as well. Maybe I just haven't been paying a lot of attention and the server might just be a lot emptier.
---
Finally managed to convince my friend(used to play retail a couple of expansions ago) to join me at classic, with his condition being that we roll alliance this time. 
---
Having never played alliance before, is dwarf rogue the way to go or should I roll a gnome rogue?
---
I'm not sure if such extreme manipulation of game mechanics is legal
---
That's outlands, not blasted lands.
---
If youre Ally Benediction hit me up. I have the same feeling but for the Crimson Felt Hat
---
I'm a shaman with grom gol as my hearth. I can get just abt anywhere in no time flat
---
Yes.
---
... damn, didn't mention the healer?
---
I killed a mage 3 times in dustwallow just cause he was aoe farming. Lol
---
It seems you have very little self awareness.
---
I love the dudes who say something like "bro come tank X for us" when I have literally never seen this dude before in my life.
---
A half naked dwarf with resting rape face. Thanks for the Nightmares. -\_-
---
Why are there so many high level horde hanging around the eastern border of wetlands.  At first I thought they were all just travelling through wetlands and loch modan to get to blasted lands but it looks like some of them are hanging around for longer, maybe something at Grim Batol or the path to Grim Batol that is of interest?
---
Can i have ur elvui import?
---
please stop trying to infect this sub with this guy's mediocrity
---
The worst part is when pure dps classes whine about someone wanting to do the same thing they do.
---
Panthers and tigers in stv drop good gray loot
---
Dont pay attention to these whiny shits. You’re right, theyre wrong and I can guarantee most of them havent been in this sub since before the beta. Fuck, ban em all so they can crawl back to r wow.
---
Prot paladins can do crazy damage on trash pulls, yeah. I'm working on getting enough Arcanite for my Lionheart and Force Reactive Disk so I can drop Mining to pick up Engineering. One of those things with a Thorium Shield Spike will help a lot.
---
If I was on this layer I would be inviting ppl like crazy lol
---
And if it sees none, it doesn't adjust. AH scanning addons are great for giving you perspective, especially on relatively common items that shift quickly in large amounts, but there is no such thing as a static value (as can be seen by the fluctuations in market price between servers). Such addons are not the law when it comes to market price and saying "my addon says it's not worth that much" means less than nothing. Either you (and the market in general) are willing to pay (with all the information available to you) or you aren't.
---
WTF I live in maine, I've never seen her name on a sign anywhere.
---
But even in this comparison the tusks are different.
---
How does one learn this power?
---
Vanish. 
---
AOE procs in raids are a nonissue, because you have tanks. They do a lot more TPS than a mere 300 dmg proc every few seconds. AOE procs in dungeons are a nonissue at this item level. In fact you could just let the rogue tank instead.
---
Absolutely no group would pay for a healer. Quite possibly the hardest role to find a group as from my experience. So many heals at 60
---
Stop spreading wrong info,
---
&gt;Regarding PvP, we saw many posts from players wondering if getting invited to a party is a good way to escape from PvP combat. I’m pleased to say there’s actually a separate, longer transfer delay following any PvP combat. We know a lot of world PvP enthusiasts are excited for WoW Classic, and we don’t want the additional layers to feel like they’re robbing you of your kills. When the time comes to withdraw from the fight, you’ll have to escape from your enemies and get to a safe place before you’re able to join your friends on another layer.

Human fury and prot, gnome arms for PvP
---
Bullshit.
---
Grobbulus! RP-PVP for life!
---
I have a scimitar and I never bothered with the macro function, just hotkeys. I believe my thumb pad was assigned alt-1 to alt-= automatically, I don't recall changing it. So keys, shift keys and ctrl keys with my hand, alt keys with mouse, like 40+ effortless binds 👌🏻
---
I set keybinds using bartender and works fine, I use it for mouseover heals and lazy fishing.
---
I'm still waiting for GDKP runs on Firemaw. GDKP is so amazing for all participants, not only those who get gear.
---
- People bid on items that drop
---
- At the end of the raid, the total gold used on bids are evenly distributed to every raid member, except for the player hosting, he gets a bit more.
---
- If you can't afford any gear, you will still possibly earn a lot of gold
---
- If you get any gear, congrats, you still get gold at the end as everyone else
---
Sometimes if some crazy items drop,  and the bids are high, everyone gets a huge chunk out of it.
---
There's also this linear curve of being rewarded. If you can't afford anything yet, do a few more runs - the gold you earn there gives you a bigger chance of buying something the next time.
---
Also BoE and reagents are also bid upon at the end of the run
---
You can solo Bangalash as a hunter. 
---
Kite him to BB, slowly getting him down to nearly halfway down by the time you get there. The reason is he calls adds at 50% so you want the bouncers to take out the adds as well. 
---
I’ve done it at 34 and seen it done as low as 30.
---
I check whether 1 of the 2 randoms in that group picked up herbs. Then i started gathering everything in sight when nobody else did.
---
I mean, not all of us have time to chain-run dungeons. By the time a group gets formed and we get one wing done, I may have to go do some housecleaning or get dinner ready.
---
I think that site uses cookies
---
Nice tips, ty
---
imagine being in a raid group with asmongold and being surprised when something gets ninjalooted
---
Smolderweb is baller. Usually medium or high pop. No layers no queue.
---
Other melee classes have the exact same expectation. If you are a dual wield fury warrior you get 1hs, if you are a 2h fury warrior you get 2h.
---
You can’t break those cuffs...
---
Also that's an awesome price for an amazing mouse, mine cost me like £80!
---
Having carrot on a stick helps with the jump!
---
Yeah I just corrected my mistake I meant to type hot key. I have got key 1-9 set to number pad 1-9. In combat they do not work but out of combat I can use them.
---
Bring him home, thats where he belongs
---
&gt;having my whole rotation on my mouse makes fighting easy.
---
I'd never do that for WoW.
---
Though I did do it exclusively with WildStar because it was a more action focused game where movement was constantly a huge deal.
---
For WoW it's ideal for having a mouseover macro for anything you want plus a few miscellaneous buttons.
---
I never understood why it defaults to redundant action bar buttons. But that's probably because I don't smoke cigarettes and I masturbate with my dominant hand.
---
i bursted my breath out of my nose slightly faster than normal when i read this. this must be a joke.
---
aff warlock never eat or drink and kill everything non stop. they have infinite mana.
---
It depends what I am doing. Rogue here.
---
So right now I made myself list of what to do next:
---
\- Get Fire Resistance gear for MC lava packs pulls to don't die to random Fire Blossom
---
\- Get Nature Resistance gear parts for future AQ40
---
\- Buy every undercut reagent for flasks/potions that I use + consumables, stack those
---
\- Maaaaybe do some North Dire Maul Tribute Runs for double Elvish Tarnished Rings.
---
\- Get myself mats for future Naxxramas gear
---
\- Farm more gold
---
What it involves? Well, as for Fire Resistance gear: getting myself groups for Jed/Rend runs in UBRS. I have a key and usually look for Jed as well so there is that. I've got UBRS key which is good fire res ring, got Onyxia Attunement which is good fire res necklace and reward from Hydraxian Waterlords which is second amazing fire res ring.  From UBRS I want to get cloak nobody really needs from first boss, then leather armor from Solekk or what is he called, boss nobody really does in UBRS, one with whelps.  After that, I will ask my friend Rogue/Druid to help me with getting Coal Mining boots from Guzzler boss in BRD. Afterwards, with full Fire Res gear I will farm Incendious for good wrist procs, monkey preferable.
---
Nature resistance is definitely in Maraudon, at least amazing shoulders. Not sure about rest, I had list somewhere, it's on low prio.
---
Reagents/herbs, I buy only those which are undercut for about 50-70 %. I already stacked enough dreamfoil, elemental earth, water, shadow oils for about 500 greater resistance potions. Got about 300 gromsblood and a lot of stonescale oils which are reagents for Flask of the Titans. I have list of things to check on AH and I do check them every time I am in Ironforge.
---
Elvish Tarnished Rings are better than both Blackstone Ring and Painweaver's Band. These are still upgrades so I might hunt for them after getting my Fire Resistance gear.
---
Materials for Naxxramas require a lot of Cured Rugged Hides which are made using salt mixer or something like that. It's similar to Transmutation when one person can make 1 per 1-3 days (not sure). There are low priority as well but if I see them posted for 10 gold under normal price, be sure I am buying them till I have enough.
---
Blackrock Depths, planned, focused pickpocket runs for average 50 gold an hour. 
---
Other than that, I talk with my guildmates, look up for some stuff, sometimes help people out, sell my lockpick services for 50 s-  1 g per lockbox,  open them for free for lower level characters. Of course I am raiding as well and PvPing when there is time for that. 2 raid nights per week, world PvP everytime I see opportunity to do so. Yesterday we had some World of Roguecraft battle in Blackrock Depths. I was about to restart instance when one of rogues I actually knew from my server was cheap shot by some horde Rogue. I used sprint to come and cheap shot him but before that other rogue from alliance jumped out and cheap shot horde. Then another horde cheap shot him and I cheap shot second horde rogue, getting attacked by third horde rogue in progress. We won that fight but damn, it was epic.
---
No math to back it up, but my instinct tells me the Weapon Expertise. That's 1% less chance to be dodged, 8% less damage penalty from glancing blows, and .5% less chance to miss.
---
I vote this answer wins.
---
Earthfurry
---
Westfall has the classic "DM vs VC" every 5 seconds
---
As a 60 druid I went with the so called "Moonglow" spec. I am focused on improved healing (10%) and reduced mama cost for healing touch (19%) which makes it ideal for raid healing in phase 1 and 2. You can top the charts on healing and have very little over healing. 
---
Then I have balance talents to improve my solo damage, so I am able to do pretty much everything outside of a raid. I can actually do dps in dungeons aswell, not great but enough to matter. 
---
It's slower then fetal or full blown oomkin, but it works fine. It's just mana intensive to dps with Moonglow.
---
Gross, it makes me a gnome?
---
Pro tip: these horns from from any satyrs in Ashenvale. It’s much easier to farm the Xavian ones, or if your level is a bit low the ones up on the plateau north east of Raynewood.
---
I have mine in UC, but im also engineer with a tanaris trinket. it covers most of the places id want to go
---
Either that or the addon peace and quiet
---
yea hes a bitch lol coulda jus told u himself
---
They may also be farming for the crimson whelpling pet.
---
You can dispel his voidwalker shield when he sacrifices it
---
"The duality of mankind"
---
With MS &gt; OS loot rules, you can certainly make an off spec roll if all the tanks have that binding.
---
My bank alt is Jeffbezos
---
Make sure the corsair program for your mouse is set up properly but idk why it's not working
---
I feel you. Thats the reason why i stayed on a server with huge queues. It takes sometimes up to 3-4h to get in (especially on days like Sunday and Saturday at primetime) but i rather have this queue mess right now than a dead realm when aq/naxx comes out. 
---
Im planing to play classic for the long haul and having to deal with queues for the first few months is a sacrifice im willing to take.
---
At least I made an argument. Please fuck off with your useless input.
---
Hmmm ok, never had that issue myself.
---
Sounds like something to do with the game or an add-on being the culprit, not the mouse if it's changing depending on combat.
---
Do you use an action bar addon that's changing bar pages on combat or something? I'd suggest to look at any add-ons you use that affect keybinds or action bars.
---
Never too late to fix that big mistake
---
I’m so sick of people criticizing people’s setups. MAYBE HE CANT FUCKING AFFORD ANYTHING BETTER? It
---
And before people say shit like “oh it’s just a joke relax” did you also make fun of the kids with worn out shoes?
---
My boys are raiding stormwind?
---
Agreed! I am on my way to being a badass undead mage!
---
Nah, we were talking. I was telling them I was on the way. One other member was suggesting a faster route and then bam kicked.
---
So did I.  I'm currently fury.  Eventually I'll leave the dead leveling guild I'm in and join a real guild, and only then will I take up tanking again, and only when the group is majority guildies.
---
Actually just solved it...I’m a absolute idiot. I use numlock to auto run so I had been toggling it on and off out of habit not even realizing.
---
How DARE you leave dwarves out! Stoneform destroys those pesky rogues.
---
Just add it together. There are add-ons for more detailed character stats that do it for you.
---
why do you think they dont get mixed?
---
iirc all will be in one pool
---
This person*
---
Ye please next time check your stuff before with known resources and wikis before publishing.
---
Misinformation spreads out very quickly and if people do not look into the comments further down they dont know something is wrong with your calculations.
---
I mean the overall result will be similar but all information should be previse and  correct for such presentations
---
Also this on Bloodsail
---
Ah lol, glad you fixed it. I put auto run on mousewheel click for ultimate laziness 👍🏻
---
I have considered making a 4th don't encourage me
---
I can't go to an RP server, I'm too twisted... I'll just be constantly ganking and cannibalizing Gnomes.
---
Oh don't worry. It doesn't ever feel "good" until you're 60 in all near BiS
---
It's a joke. There's no reason a warrior needs water.
---
Unfortunately that spot in Dustwallow marsh is very popular because they drop whelplings or whatever. 
---
Also just a heads up to everyone if you’re looking for gold farming guides look for ones that came out a few weeks after classic launched. Otherwise it’s just based off of pservers and a lot of the spots don’t have the same loot table in Classic.
---
Look man, you seem like a good guy.  I totally trust you and if you need anything from me, just ask.  Speaking of which, mind if I use your reddit account to make some posts?
---
TF is not even close to being the best dps weapon.
---
Literal 4D chess move from alliance
---
It's never been a problem for me. When I played retail and would do mythic raiding or arenas, I always found it easiest to have my rotation hotkeyed to my mouse so that I could focus more on aoe and positioning. Raids in classic are simple enough that I can play with one hand and eat food at the same time without losing dps.
---
This video makes me think it is still possible. I still know the set up. Gotta get a friend ready.
---
While the mods a bit turse, the fact this post is still up at least redeems some character points for this mod.
---
A lot of subs will have rules for complaining about mod decisions.
---
Ally
---
About the most RP I see day to day is some people typing with a Jamaican accent for trolls, and maybe more emote usage than normal.
---
you can also mount up and go from the ledge on the left by the root, but that jump also sucks...
---
It's not about the karma, but the lie. How are you, in good conscience, encouraging lies and manipulation?
---
Crit + int
---
Seems very solid for holy paladins
---
Should have mentioned that I was farming that spot whilst in the level range for it which is why I noticed them passing up and down over the space of a few hours.  It was only a few that returned back up which made me question why they were going that way if not to get to Blasted Lands.
---
Then why does almost every big sub have moderation?
---
Does the subreddit have limited space? Is there a cap on how many posts it could have at once?
---
No?
---
Then this isn't "clogging" your subreddit. You're an asshole on a powertrip, get over yourself.
---
It's tanks that's rare. One spec of one class is able to tank, while there's 4 healers. Kind of an imbalance, to say the least.
---
See you in Hot shitpost.
---
I don't know if I'm in the minority here. But God fucking damn group finder is nice. I've spent more time trying to form a group than actually running dungeons. It's really not fun spending an hour forming a group in lfg. Then finally getting a full group and have to wait 30 minutes because the healer is fishing in azshara and has to take their dog out real quick and then make a quick trip to recover the declaration of independence. Everything else is nice about classic, but shit man it does get tedious at 60 because dungeons is where you will spend the majority of your time. Maybe I am just not fit for classic.
---
My server's LookingForGroup channel is a misnomer, it should be LookingForTank.
---
Because there's a megathread that exists to address those one-liner questions, they're all in one place so others can read them and benefit too.  Apart from that, and this is probably most important, simple questions often *don't* get upvoted, so they go unanswered, whereas the response rate on the daily thread is pretty high (I usually comment there a lot during downtime at work).
---
In the spirit of all internet forums or whatever you want to call reddit, posts should actually encourage a discussion.  Something with a direct question, especially one with an easily searchable answer, doesn't foster any discussion.  It just promotes total laziness, and I'm okay with gutting those low-effort posts.  Even memes, as annoying as they are, often create a lot of discussion within those threads.
---
There's simply no value making a thread brings over just asking in the daily thread (or googling it like a grown up).
---
Did Warrior / Shaman duo yesterday, got around 14mins per run (no herbing though so add some time for that if you're herbing).
---
He probably did. Being pvp flagged means the horde/alliance symbol shows next to your portrait. Atleast that's what it meant in 2005. Which is different from having recently been in pvp combat.
---
Well yeah, I meant items that are being sold and bought on daily basics, ingredients / consumables mostly.
---
Well, if the leader goes out and resets, hes dead. Does it really make a difference if you have to wait for him anyways ?
---
Yeah I'm super excited! Halloween is like my favourite time of the year!
---
Until you're dealing with fights that last over 3 minutes with no drink breaks you dont need to respec. Period. 
---
You're a hybrid class with +healing gear right? No need whatsoever until you start doing raids.
---
I was gonna say, I didn't recognize it.
---
Lmao youre a douchebag
---
Omfg you brought back all these memories of my belf one shotting himself fighting warriors lol
---
It doesn't not always.
---
Lollllllll. Wow, tough luck
---
Who cares. Asmon is funny and watching his stream is like watching a drama. Like it or don't.
---
I just assumed the original friend was sticking around.
---
I imagine it's because a lot of players are scared of learning to tank.
---
it is a bullshit move to need a second BiS shield before you got 1. Put him on blast to the guild officers for his bullshit (if you are in the same guild) or put him on ignore if you arent.
---
There's a shitload of guides on youtube, just watch one
---
I dont have the screen realestate to spend on this.
---
Duo'd Warrior &amp; Shaman, 14-16 minutes as tank &amp; spank
---
First guy I had to put on ignore and tossed out of the group was when we were doing Maraudon Princess runs.
---
Dude joins, has no clue whats princess runs are, notices that we won't be doing orange/purple but has need on something in those wings. We tell him that we're not going to do that and he got all passive aggressiv, that he's a teamplayer and he wouldnt mind to do the other wings if he'd be group leader.
---
Went on for 15 minutes before I pulled the plug. He continued to argue with me on /w until I was fed up enough to just put him on ignore.
---
I’m currently a level 34 priest looking to go holy. How can I be the best healer I can be? What are some good resources I can read/watch to learn more about priest healers?
---
That's why i always make groups instead of joining them, if you want to quest and you're not prepared simply don't get into dungeon groups it's as simple as that, there is no "no just wait for me bro its only 30 minutes", the only thing they get is a kick.
---
Even then you should have a repair bot if you're a 300 engi
---
Not a fan of how this was handled or the choices made by mods on this and many other subreddits in general, but this is crap.
---
Moderation is really important to forums like this and these people are volunteers. The issue here is what this specific mod did with his admin permissions NOT the fact that he chose to moderate in the first place. Imagine mocking a volunteer for volunteering.
---
Dps in raids and tank dungeons as your dps spec? The difference in healing a prot tank VS a dps tank in the same gear is barely noticeable
---
He didn't say he did it successfully
---
you post this shit for a rocket league stream and expect views?
---
Tbh, its might just be because this is way worse way of reseting than the ones everyone is using now. /camp + 6th char is so much easier, faster and safer. Nobody goes outside, no need to run back to start etc.
---
They don't if you picked the correct faction.
---
While this is only about one server I did switch to one of the new servers on release day to avoid queues. It never had any queues and barely any lag so it can't have been very busy.
---
It's still usually high pop and goes up to full on prime time.
---
Only reason i rolled Alliance was because all my friends play ally.. :((((((  
---
Miss being Shaman!
---
Warrior on horde: log on.  Get whispered by a stranger or a friend to come tank.  Make money, get gear, make friends.  It's a good life.
---
So i have found out recently, through a post on reddit, that certain in-game items sometimes have unique detailing on their icon. One such post i had found had a picture of a bovine animal embossed upon a container for water. What fun!
---
Was a warrior your first class ever in classic? Your tipps sound like very very slow leveling for me
---
Arms + hit and kite is the way to go
---
That wise man had the secret knowledge of not going OOM in raids.
---
Yeah I'm willing to xfer my 2 60's (well he's only 57 but thats close enough haha) off my realm if that service opens up.
---
Also happy cakeday friend
---
And buy the cheap bullets/arrows
---
Wait, if that is your position, didn't you break the relevance first when you mentioned dps?  I don't really want to die on this hill; I was just mentioning a water consumer was left out of your comment.  OP's joke is about those who get mage water (healers included) and those who don't (tanks, warrior).  Your follow-up joke included everyone but the healer.  I was hoping for something like: "and healers don't deserve water because ...." I worry we lack the cadence to successfully further this convo.
---
I like to have fun lol
---
I've got my run down to:
---
2 pack
---
1 pack
---
2 pack 
---
Check books
---
Herb everything
---
Check for Run Tum tubers
---
If I do all those I'm just under the lockout (just did a round and I was locked out for 1-2 minutes) so it definitely helps to be able to do 2 packs at the same time.
---
**NEED TANK NOW RIGHT NOW GO GO GO!!!!!!!!!!!**
---
A million times in chat
---
Rolled my first alliance since vanilla to play with a friend on that server. That’s good to hear!
---
Owh yeah if you count the blues from the boss too then that is correct. If you do the mechanics you get 4 blues from the chest itself, so 6 in total.
---
Im too poor. But at least i have peggle.
---
No because a warrior can be tank or dps
---
Not first, there is another warri also ms. 😂 but rolled nice
---
Paladins are lame...
---
Also I'm really just hoping for discussion because maybe there are things that aren't so bad that are more fun to play.
---
Fury tanks came out of no where and this game is 15 years old.
---
For the horde!
---
Yeah, 'tagged' was not a parlance I had heard. Flagged also refers to being PvP flagged on a PvP realm in a friendly zone (e.g., alliance in Elwynn).
---
Regarding being in combat: you're still incorrect in that it is not a 10 minute cooldown and your quote doesn't say that either. You can't layer while being in combat, certainly, but the cooldown is definitely not 10 minutes.
---
Not even last night's storm could wake you.

I also dislike layering, but tbh you got what you deserved, when you say cringy shit like that "help with the plague up north" ROFL

thank you

Ah, now I got ya.  The *you* was specific to OP, and not a party member in general.  Though OP specifically is the tank in this case.  Good stuff.

That's not an argument, it's just a personal attack with nothing more to it.

Going around unloading your personal baggage on random internet strangers doesn't make you some kind of hero. It just makes you another asshole.

Me calling someone out for being conceited or being an asshole might make me conceited. That's fine and I'll accept it. But you are just an asshole going around spreading hate without any benefit to anyone.

[Another useless shitpost about useless shitposts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony)
---
Tried in East, can't loot in combat
---
**Irony**
---
Irony (from Ancient Greek  εἰρωνεία eirōneía, meaning 'dissimulation, feigned ignorance'), in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. 
---
Irony can be categorized into different types, including: verbal irony, dramatic irony, and situational irony. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.

You're just straight up trolling now - I said nothing of the sort. Got more?
---
As others said swapping is easy on retail, but another point. The raids are 20 men which requires 2 tanks. Meanwhile the raids are 40 men in classic which still requires 2 tanks. 2 times more tanks needed for raids. Also in classic dungeons mostly drops prebis, but in retail sometimes dungeons drops bis and very high quality gear
---
If there were blood elves, I would've played a blood elf mage.  
---
Gonna have to wait a few years until I can join the 50% blood elf horde I guess. Can't play a roided alien, a cow, or a lanky blue elf. Might make a corpse alt tho.
---
Depends what weapon spec you'd like to use. I know humans have a +swords passive which is great if you want to go swords

When your attacks are parried it resets (or nearly resets) their attack swing delay. Only thing I can think of.

Werewolves and shit. It's sacred.

When it's long past the expected clear time you really can't expect people to stay. You can't blame them for having to go afk at that moment since the instance took much too long.

I pictured NPCs in Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

It's a 1% drop. It takes me like 30 seconds to kill a Initiate and about 45 for a Slayer. If they're up, just ignore the dogs
---
The difference between specs can be huge. There is only a small amount of loot available. Rather bring 1 meta class instead of 2 non meta. So maybe they don’t have to 40 men it but 30 men only, so more loot for the remaining people.
---
They're the only end-game tank in classic.
---
A world isn't a world without citizens of every socio-level status. I like classic more because there's just as much to do at cap as there is leveling.

Just tamed him for testing purposes. No cobra reflexes. Frenzy comes from the BM talent tree and goes down 1,08, but that it is because his attack speed is 1,40. That applies to all pets. Nothing special.

Tanking is a PITA because people expect you to tank like it’s a mythic and then get mad when they don’t let you build agro on 4 mobs.
---
Tank here and I have no idea how all these people get offended for offering your services to tank. I’ve been randomly whispered asking to tank. I politely said I would for a reasonable amount because I don’t need anything there. I get insulted instead of no thanks. People can’t grasp that time is money, and they also don’t think “I can farm much more gold per hour than this guy is asking for an hour of his time”... let alone split between 4 people.

Do you understand that you're a random nobody to me? We could come from completely different demographics where the way I speak is beneficial to me in my environment.

Conceited people showering in their own magnificence.

Mate I did the exact same thing; rolled with my friends on a pve server, got to 60 and everything then I was just thinking to myself “this games shit”. Then my brother said why not roll a pvp server with him and some of his friends, best choice I made tbh made the game fun again (I don’t really like raiding much) with no threat of pvp the game seems pointless and boring. Getting ganked is part of the fun, it’s called World of WARcraft not world of let’s play vs the computer.

Gotta rush that content week one! I'm sure we are glad you didn't join either.

It’s almost better without them because if the group doesn’t have a lock they have no choice. At least they understand walking may happen.
---
With summoning stones there’s a good chance no one besides yourself actually plans on walking. They’ll play silent chicken for 5+ mins before caving and heading out.

You could almost say it takes certain amount of skill or knowledge to be able to tank and hold aggro efficiently. Difference between new player and one who knows what he is doing is massive.
---
There are 3 viable tanks for dungeons and 2 viable tanks for raids.

Gehennas-EU

I have zero problems with dps warriors/druids/priests/shamans. The problem is when a tank is needed an arms warrior can tank np. If my group is looking for dps I don't hesitate inviting a warrior
---
maybe you should join a guild with an active dungeon group routine?
---
(note: this does not mean you have to do dungeons exclusively with your guild, but it means you always have a solids basis and can quickly find those 1-2 extra guests if needed)
---
I will consider, do the alliance fight back or are they passive?

Yeah, we were wiping horde out the front of DM yesterday and had one character hold the second layer, switch is ~a minute after combat ends.
---
There are several guilds farming Ony/Rag, can't comment on openings however.

The server is a solid med pop throughout the entire day until around the hours of 2-3am, which then drops to low. Faction balance is close to 50/50. I have no problems finding dungeons or raids, but I do have a dedicated friend group, so others experience may vary.

Hello everyone, Melee Warlock guide has been improved since last posting. Alot of new things have come up since the first post. Working with various theorycraft discords have discovered Wand rotation and channeled spell rotations. As usual, this guide isn't aimed at Raiding but maybe you can have a bit of fun with this. Thanks all.
---
&gt;game raiding is about topping charts. While I do respectable damage, if we are taking in to account how much damage curses of shadow/elements/recklessness really improve the raids over-all dps, warlocks are shining near the top of the meters. Personally, i would rather just use my CoE, corruption, and spam shadow bolt while making sure my banish targets stay that way until we are ready for them, than all-in dps like some of the other classes. Healthstones, summoning, pets, soulstones, soloing content without any trouble... it's good being a warlock if you can appreciate their versatility as a strength.
---
And here I am trying to hit level 40 on my main...
---
A glitch in the matrix.
---
How badly are the alliance outnumbered?
---
This might be true for dps and healing, but it's not true for tanking!
---
I tanked Uldaman yesterday.  They were a decent group in general - the dps output was good and all 3 seemed to know their classes.  But... they dps'd whatever the hell they wanted, their general threat management was nil and a rogue mob was never once brought back to me.
---
One pull summed it up - 4 targets, marked skull, cross, square and nothing. Square gets sheeped on pull; all 4 targets die within 2 secs of each other!
---
As a tank, this isn't rewarding!
---
I end up with 25-50% of the rage that I should have, so I'm not able to 'push my tanking to the limits'.
---
A lot of that (limited) rage gets wasted having to pick up mobs that are being aggro'd off you.
---
You spend the entire fight waiting for rage and feeling impotent!
---
A good fight from my point of view is a smooth fight.
---
I get what you're saying about the thrill of pulling of something tricky, but good tanking is all about control - grouping up packs of mobs for aoe, turning them away from the dps, pulling more in when possible.  Ultimately enabling the dps to output the most damage - that's what I get a kick out of.
---
Every fight being a needless battle with boneheaded dps about who can put out the most threat- them on 3 separate targets at full ham? Or me on those 3 targets with very limited rage.  That's just frustrating.
---
Sen’jin village is my favorite. Right by the beach.
---
Just wait til the yetis in winterspring lol, they'll make helculars rod look easy.
---
You sound pretty inconsiderate of what other people want. I’d refuse to tank just to spite people like you.
---
That’s efficiency to the finest. Real nicee
---
I upvote this. Also for your name.
---
Do you speak Chinese?
---
8am EST is 8pm in China. I'm sure there's lots of Chinese guilds active at the same time as you.
---
No one is forcing you to group with any of these people. If you don't understand something then ask a question. I do it in world chat all the time

Bro writing VC for deadmines is hard to understand at first but ASK. We will explain it! That’s what I did and I learned over time... WTB/WTS LF LFG etc it’s all easy to learn... it’s a part of the game and it’s not elitist imo, it’s just easier
---
This might not be what you meant but sometimes when there's a healer mob in a pack it's better to wuickly kill it's target before it gets the heal off and the healer mob will then not cast the heal again for a good while yet
---
All foodbuffs are low. But since its the best you can get its still good. And its always gonna be used because of the gearscaling of coming raids.
---
That being said, gathering professions is a HUGE hit and miss on some servers. I see people here on Reddit go "This and such is worth over 70G" or whatever, and when I check my AH there's like 10 up for 4 gold or something.

O R G Y!
---
Highly recommend not going holy until 55+. The instances at your level just aren't difficult enough to justify losing the solo'ing ability of shadow.
---
A few things. 1) don't shield warriors before a pull, as they won't be able to generate rage. 2) not everyone needs to be at 100% all the time. Manage your mana. 3) don't be afraid to use lower ranks of your healing abilities to save mana.
---
¡Holá! 
---
Warriors stance dance. In order to maximize your effectiveness, you'll be switching combat stances and dictating the battle.
---
If that doesn't sound fun, consider another class.
---
Hunter and rogue are good DPS classes, with hunter being easier to level and rogue being generally better late game.
---
exactly my thinking process
---
How about you just put the abreviating in the chat with a ? After it.... You'll get the right answer plus 20 other humorous responses
---
Cleave and WW dont generate much "additional threat" so as a warlock I usually HAVE to stay behind the tank on aoe pulls.
---
Is that the excuse for a prot paladin not keeping aggro?If so that proves my point lmao.
---
Our positions arent all that much different really. 
---
In much the same way you couldn't help but chime in when you saw someone misrepresenting fire spec, I couldn't help but do the same when I saw someone accusing another of doing exactly the same thing they themselves were doing.
---
I wouldn't normally point it out but you seemed pretty reasonable so I thought why not.
---
Just repost the question? If you get no answers its either stupid or hard question and it works like this on every subreddit.
---
I like this better than the original
---
Nobody even used a harsh word, you baby.
---
Never expirienced this. Also.. if you don't know what something means you could just ask.. you know... Like everybody else

Maybe his issue isn’t about wasting time but doing what he enjoys. As a fellow warrior you shouldn’t feed into this bullshit flame.

6-10 per hour essences in Silithus? I killed 500 mobs and got 3 of those and another guy who was there at the same time as me got even less.

My only consistent method so far have been farming elemental fire in arathi where I’ve seen 18-28 drops per hour which is 46-78g per hour if you’re totally alone. Best early morning or nights.
---
Been playing on Thunderfury and there is no lacking in the WPvP. Absolutely entertaining. 
---
Downside is that there is a whole lot of whining no matter what contested you go to there will be players whining when they get killed.
---
This. Moderators have very weird standards.
---
No need for PI build, fully holy can do it just fine with around 6k mana.
---
I don't get it. It must be me that I'm not used to this, but I usually go to the map where the dungeon is and then start to look for groups. I don't want to waste other people's time, specially when they are sitting on the entrance waiting for me.
---
Nevertheless, a 1h dungeon ends up taking you around 1h30min easily.
---
Wtf dude this loot drama title on the thumbnail is hilarious hahaha.
---
This YouTuber is creating his own channel through asmon stream caps. Lolol
---
When I am leveling or dungeon healing with my priest I usually go for the low-fi hiphop beats. Just chilling and not get too anxious about anything. Plus it keeps me cool when the tank is pulling too many mobs.
---
Dude, you're a true MVP! - Thank you!
---
Bro you like the game and you learn how to enjoy it. Abbreviations are there to stay and you should learn them, it’s easy and takes no time! Also you should find a guild for groups. And make friends by asking them what specific abbreviations mean.
---
U r so cheeky
---
I learned of a bovine on a waterskin
---
/join world (HELPFUL)
---
On a pserver I resisted a cleanse and was like. That cant be blizzlike right?
---
fyi warrior is one of the hardest classes to level although its abit easier in classic with dungeon spamming. but if your new to classic probably not recommended.
---
being only level 15 you could always change class/reroll if your not liking warrior
---
Perhaps making your own group? :) grats on lvl 58 though. I can’t seem to stick to one toon lol
---
Best friends
---
No u
---
You can also jump on a torch next to the AH and then through the wall.
---
This hunter feined death until the timer ran out. Then he died for real xD
---
Warlock is probably one of the best classes for farming even multiple mobs though?
---
It wasn't quite obvious enough.
---
As a 60 rogue I found myself get insanely tired of the prebis loot hunt, nobody wanted competition on rolls so either the group leader is a warrior tank who'll never invite you, or the healer makes the call who'll invite 5000 of you if he/she could.
---
Then again, with the amount of warriors/rogues around I was also being unreasonable jaded. Rerolled a warlock alt and having a ton of fun again, saw a lot of the prebis was 58 greens + shadow damage, realised what a pain that was to get and..
---
whoa, don't care at all about prebis anymore. If it shows up, great, otherwise I'm going to enjoy the game. Life is good now. Not 60 on the lock yet though.
---
Go 2h fury for raids and weave slams into your rotation, takes more effort but it is way more fun and you will do more damage without the horrible rage starve you get in MS spec whilst raiding.
---
I am having a great time on thunderfury as well
---
Did you ask? If you're unwilling to make any attempt at trying or put in effort, you won't be rewarded with anything. Nothing is owed to you.
---
OP this is a great meme.
---
Are you horde or alliance?

1,5g per stack? Buy them all and stock up for a good while until the phase comes where the prices will skyrocket (can't remember which phase/ release)! Long term investment guaranteed!
---
So you are on the OCE server?

You kidding? Tanking is super easy in classic...just spam sunders lol
---
Enhancement shaman here. Planning to staying enhancement on 60.
---
Currently my guild started raiding and I'm am officer in the guild. At peak we have 1/4th of the guild online (roughly 100 people online). It's a very active and social guild.
---
My problem is is that I'm still level 53, almost 54. I often find myself stuck with leveling. Feeling slow and not having any quests. I've been playing since the launch, with my fulltime job in between of course. I use questie and got around 10 days playtime.
---
I thought un'goro would give me a boost. But done all quests there and it gave me like halfba level.
---
What am I doing wrong? Whatvcan I do to improve? What are good alternatives to exp gains?
---
I would like to get to 60 asap as I'm free from work the upcoming week and I'd like to join my guild with raiding.
---
You haven't seen elitist until you've tried finding a group as a ret paladin.
---
Start your own group and LFM.  Don't rely on other people to start the group.  Also, as a DPS warrior, you're one of the most common classes, so the problems you are describing come with the class.    
---
So you have three solutions:   
---
1. Start your own groups, grind and get what gear you can on your own.
---
2. Tank
---
3. Reroll
---
Yes I know I was wondering if the experience of rolling horde, is worth missing out on playing on my mains sever and boosting my freinds and my alt. 
---
And yeah pally is alright, but if im ally again i got to be a nelf.
---
Sad truth. I used to tank as a druid, but have gotten tired of fighting with a priest that I want to roll on healing gear(pre-dungeon discussion ofc). Now I just fish until I find a group as a healer, less of a headache.
---
It's beautiful
---
With a good group that's willing to talk to each other, where something goes wrong occasionally because of human error, but we manage to pull through with good teamwork? Yeah, that's lovely.
---
With a bad group where people don't listen, and things go wrong because people stubbornly insist on doing the same stupid thing over and over, then blame the wipes on someone else? No, thanks.
---
Use the power you have as a tank. Either they listen to you or you leave. Think they want to spend 2 hours looking for a new tank? Nah. Even if they do you'll find a new group in 5 minutes.
---
Do it! Do it! Do it! 
---
But seriously do it. Nothing better than being a dwarf warrior.
---
But why is there a daily questions thread? Wouldn't it be better to have a daily screenshot thread instead, where people could post pictures of their lvl 40 mounts and their undead characters doing /sleep in a coffin etc. Is the meme spam really more valuable to the community than encouraging gameplay discussions and questions? 
---
Personally, I have found so many useful addons and learned some nifty tricks just from reading people's questions. Things I did not even know existed and therefore would have never Googled in the first place. That stuff is gold. That stuff should be promoted and not showed aside in a corner to make room for the gimmick posts.
---
Or is there a dedicated and active forum to discuss Classic WoW gameplay related topics, that I should be looking at instead? A place to talk about addons, gear, specs and whatnot?
---
Render scale.
---
This thread is ridiculous, just like the title
---
Thats why my guild went to Firemaw on EU. Lots of people were upset about the ques but now we are on a very high pop server so it worked out.
---
I have a LFG chat with the original LFG, custom LFG and custom world chats are active.
---
I can stay in my main, quiet, window and write in those when I need to find groupmembers, but never look at it. Most QoL in classic. ;)
---
Have you been zone hopping?
---
Do all the races low level zones so that when you get to the main quest lines you outlevel the quests making the mobs a lot easier to kill. Green quests give the same amount of XP as yellow quests.
---
If you do fall behind, spend an hour or 2 grinding yellow/green mobs to level instead of banging your head against orange mobs.
---
Mods are always dicks, why else would they volunteer their time to moderate a forum? They get off on small amounts of power.
---
Thanks, now i have to go and play Morrowind again.

Im personally more positively surprised about constant flow of people in Undercity.

---
Incoherent ramblings.
---
As a fellow warrior I'm not going to give some lazy ass guy a free ride by tanking for him. Just pick up a shield and spam sunders, ain't hard.
---
I haven't confirmed this one yet, Only seen a couple sites list it.
---
This makes me want to play classic, but I already think leveling in retail is dreadful
---
I'd suggest changing guilds if yours is dead or trying to make a group yourself. If you like a player, add them to your friends list for future groups. It's normal that there are going to be reserved items and it is ok (some people don't wanna come if they are not guaranteed the item if it drops).
---
Idk about your experiences but I have not many players that are elitist. Also, if you dont understand it, ask. You clearly made no effort to understand if you are raving in here about it. Google exists too, also, the games popularity rocketed up on the release of DM so I wouldn't say its dying. People just can't play 12 hours a day all the time.
---
Also found one (which is not on your map) in DM:W near the west well where Illyana patrols
---
Lol u mad
---
The difference is that I accept my place in all this. I choose to speak the way I do and I know it contributes to how people see me. 
---
But this is essentially an anonymous thread with people I know nothing about. Facts are all that hold value here. I didnt hop into an argument I have absolutely no stake in just to let someone know that I think how I talk to people is better than how they talk to people. 
---
You don't even know if English is my first language. Consider how much time you're wasting trying to be a hero when people like me literally do not give a fuck what you think. This is purely entertainment. I like to fart words out.
---
I rolled alliance because all my friends were. I got to level 25 and just lost motivation.  After going back to retail for awhile I realized my heart is in the horde and am now leveling a Tauren warrior.
---
i feel like classic is friendly to noobs
---
reddit however may not be the case

I was part of a progress-guild on Hellscream PvE EU back in the days and in my opinion the one major thing people leave out from these "why was ir harder before" discussions is hardware.
---
Throughout the entirity of vanilla I think we never finished a raid without having to replace someone that was disconnected and never got back online due to poor internet-connectivity.
---
My average fps in raids when 40-people were gathered was like... 15? And when shit started flying across the screen during Ragnaros it was like watching a powerpoint at times. I think this impacted performance much more than wonky talent-builds and crappy gear.
---
Modern family
---
I feel you. Im a drood and i play with friends mostly; a holy pally, a lock, and a warrior who usually multiboxes a team of hunters but will come with and bring a hunter to throw a little extra dps. 
---
I want to heal, but since we cant have 2 in strat UD, i go feral to tank our dungeons. Long story short since i cant come near the quality of your story, i finally got my neck from rammstein and chest from baron, after my holy pally friend got both of hers.... as well as 6 bone splitting axes from maleki for the hunters, 4 baron capes for the hunters and the warrior, 3 peacemakers for the hunters because we ran it so much so why not, 2 capes and 2 pairs of healing boots from the rarespawn stonespine, the wand off of skul for the warlock as well as "of shadowwrath" bracers from unforgiven. Not to mention getting several rogues(and myself) mask of unforgiven because we might as well carry people after all of the hunters had 0 loot left to get.
---
My friends make jokes about how theyll never go back, but i cant help but respond when i see "LF tank UD." Its become who i am. The corner right as you go in after the third gate where you can los pull everything, it feels like a childhood home...
---
... "will tank strat UD for all green scourgestones"...
---
The great thing about Phase 1 is that it gives us all time to level alts and new mains without falling far behind.
---
What do you do to make the leveling experience more bearable?
---
I'm only level 11, but spamming sunder armor and rend, I still have to bandage/eat after every one or two mobs
---
I bought mc crafting mats for like 7g piece lol
---
Whenever you get the gear to support it, but don’t go out of your way to get stuff while leveling. At 60 though your pre-raid BIS is sword/OH.
---
Welcome home!
---
Now get down on your knees and suck every last drop of that conjured water until my mana is drained. NOW !
---
Your first post doesn’t mention that you have Summons. On a plus side I’ve played wow dor about 12years now and I honesty thought pst was like “ pst, hey you over there” due to it being a whisper.
---
Everything is different now than before.. There were strategies to follow, and you followed them to boot. There was no BiS list, so beside the hit% cap, to avoid missing abilities it was the wild west.
---
Now we have 15 years of experience and knowledge, while in 2004 we had some other MMO's but nothing the likes of world of warcraft.
---
This is literally the difference (and result) of having hundreds (of millions) of people collaborating to achieve the same goal while using the knowledge we gained in the past.
---
(sidenote - imagine what we could do in RL if you have experience and knowledge of the next 15 years coming up..)
---
I really get the FOMO bad due to dire maul coming out but in the one it won’t matter much.

go fury when you have +10% hit

Meanwhile im still reading the terms and agreement..

How did you guys read throu that so fast? ´Cant wait to start leveling, only 2615pages to go now. I expect to be lvl 2 come xmas.

---
At the very least you have to announce it beforehand. In a 5-man group the healer kind of feels like +healing pieces should go to them, since they clearly are... healing, yes? For many (most) leveling/gearing healers it will be a touchy subject. From a purely logical standpoint you probably can understand why someone might not like the idea of playing in a group where they now have competition on those single pieces they came for and which fit the role they fulfill in the group. Well, at least this is my own reasoning, as a healer. I'd say your best bet is to discuss with the healer which pieces you'd be wanting to roll for (maybe make macros for this or copy+paste from a word doc to avoid writing it every time?) and try to come to an agreement - if you both are reasonable and compromise a bit, it should be doable. But I'm sure not everyone is willing to compromise, at which point they will probably yell a bit at you and leave the group - but since you're signing up as tank you'll probably find another healer in not too long.
---
Alternatively, find an almost-fully-geared guildie healer who just needs 1-2 healing pieces from certain dungeons, run those dungeons with him and grab the other healing pieces that drop.
---
It is easier to just make a macro and hit it every minute or so. Reading the lfg channel gets tiring very fast, with the amount of message in there.
---
Which is why I am using the classiclfg addon, which allows you to specify dungeons you want to run and it filters the lfg channel and puts the results in a readable list. No automatic invites, no class/role filtering and obviously no teleporting, just a chat filter. (I haven't used the create group interface of the addon, can't comment on that).
---
Can someone explain how a layer works? Explain like I'm 5.
---
Engineers can make repair bots.
---
By far the best pet for questing and farming, imo.  Charge gets the pet on your target way more quickly than dash/dive, so the mob stays as far from you as possible, which is of course what you want.  Plus the extra threat from that first attack means the mob is more likely to stay on the pet.
---
An interface setting, which shows the target, of your target.
---
So the top one is the one you've selected, and the bottom one is the one that the selection has selected.
---
Settings &gt; Interface &gt; Combat &gt; Target of Target
---
How do you get more than 5 keys from the mobs that spawn? Could you maybe explain a little more in detail how I could get the same result as you? Thanks in advance!
---
All shammy races have their merit. 
---
Its what makes the choice quite hard actually. You have troll haste, that is BIS for plain pve healing and useful in dps too. You have orc with +axes if you go enhance/grind something with stun resists. Taurens look cute as fuck, have increased HP (can make a difference in later endgame), aoe stun to get a chain lightning or quick heal off.
---
All depends what you like to do and how you play.
---
At level 60 the grind for more levels becomes less painful.
---
You have to spend an insane amount of resources on feint + on CD vanish to keep threat off of you. 
---
Shield slam the 31 deep prot tank ability which is basically another taunt in 5men dungeons generates 250 threat. The proc from Thunderfury generates 193 threat. You are *always* threatcapped and have to spam feint aaaall the time. Both for rogues and DPS warriors thunderfury becomes a liability and it's replaced once OHs with equal DPS occur.
---
The only way to mitigate Thunderfury on a DPS is a thunderfury on a tank, else you will not be happy as a tanking rogue in BWL.
---
Heya. I’ve run at least 8-9 Deadmines with my Rogue and haven’t gotten Cruel Barb. My level is 23.5. Should I try more or can I level without Barb?

Unfortunately the mass alliance transfers killed the horde pop on heartseeker quite literally. I'm talking being ganked 5-6 to one over and over again and having to corpse drag through 40 or so alliance camping brd all day every day. Horde literally cant even play when 90% of the alliance are out for blood after being ganked on their former servers. There are more alliance active on stalagg or any of the other "dead" alliance realms than there are horde playing on heartseeker according to the latest manual census data people gave been putting up. Good luck finding anyone willing to get ganked that many times just to help an alliance player. Level 58 and never going back there. Rolled fresh on a balanced server to get ready for phase 2. I'm sorry I cant help but Hope it works out for you.

Is there a way to catch fish without my right click causing my character to change the direction I'm facing? For instance, I like to aim my camera so it's on the water near the lure to see when a fish is hooked more easily. However, every time I right click to catch the fish, my character turns and does a complete 180.

I have morgraines, it's great in a party with extra buffs but soloing the mobs around STV that are same lvl is very underwhelming. And forget using SS, it makes my mana evaporate.
---
Druid while questing: go feral, tier 1 speed.
---
Dungeons: you can be whatever the group needs, tanking is very easy (swipe swipe swipe).
---
Raids: I've seen druids tank, DPS and heal (admittedly not THAT many, but it'll be your alt)
---
PvP: cat druids are the bane of any caster.
---
Living in Uk so its GMT
---
- Talent trees beeing better at patch 1.12. Not as big of a deal as some people make it sound.
---
- Three are also some items here and there that are better in their 1.12 state i.e warrior gear with more useful stats and less spiri.
---
- Bosses in early vanilla could only have 8 debuffs on them. In classic there are 16 debuff slots. This does not matter at all for less organized pugs and such, but is big deal for min/max players.
---
Overall these things does make MC easier in classic than it was  in early vanilla, but the difference is insignificant. Any group that clears MC now would also clear it if it came in its early vanilla state.
---
Grats!
---
It would have been hilarious if you happened to get that XP when running past Thunder Ridge canyon or something less attractive :)
---
classic isn't dying and you're a ******
---
How fast does the weapon have to be? Faster than a tick of damage of your channeled spell?
---
Whenever it makes sense. It’s tough to gear while leveling with new equipment available all the time. If you come across an awesome 1h or off hand piece, hang onto it and just compare the stats from whatever 2h you have. That’s it!
---
I farmed them for over 6000 rep and calculated a 3.5 drop chance for both, earth and air elementals (which comes close to the numbers on wowhead). I use addons to calculate dropchances, so I see if I am wasting my time
---
There are no real sources except for the statement about P2 being pushed before the end of the year. You probably just read one of the numerous speculation threads.
---
-&gt;Greater blessings
---
This is the preffered method for gearing on OS. I would say get a guild run going if you want to tank but collect healer gear. But yeah you can always tell group before you will be doing this but it is generally considered idk the word for it not blackmail per say but basically flexing your tank high demand for dungeons to force people to also compete for your off spec gear. If you wouldn’t do it in a raid to your own guild healers why do it to randoms?
---
Very true. Only ever had it happen on fangkriss and it was only like 20-30% each time, but a couple wipes and it gets close. At that point though, you have a couple back ups from upgrades.
---
what is the faction imbalance on Heartseeker? feels so skewed towards alliance
---
I’m not gonna lie.. leveling a rogue hurt at times, but there’s other classes that get it much easier! And even with the grind, the sense of achievement made up for it.
---
Was having the same problem. Now I form my own groups and get instances done much faster. DPS join almost instantly, so then it's just a case of finding a tank, which can be expedited if you keep a list of all competent tanks previously found.
---
Either way, I highly recommend forming your own groups when doing instances.
---
This wouldn't work because party members would genuinely expect you to find a leveled mob (not hard at most dungeons tbh) and get shards
---
My friends wanted to roll Alliance because that's what we used to be in vanilla and gnome mages are best mages, but I said I'm going shaman no matter what so if they want to play with me they have to go Horde. None of them wanted to play paladin so they didn't have a good argument, so now we're horde.
---
You know what that expedited process is? Fill your friend list with people you had a good time with. Sure, tanks are still less common, but if you always create a group with good dps and healer, they are more likely to tank for you than for the random they never met in lfg.
---
Had a nice run in with one on Mankrik tonight. Was farming Badland welps for the Fiery Blaze quest. Apparently a Night Elf hunter decided he had dibs on the spawning of welps in the north. He didn't even ask me to leave, he just threw insult after insult at me. Jokes on him tho. I got the drop before he did. Left him to be angry at the world alone.
---
Why is this here...
---
Not close at all, no :)
---
Well... you can also glitch into an early version of hellfire peninsula through deadmines
---
Scepter imo. If your mh is Hammer of Grace then then you will want some stats even if it takes from the overall healing power.
---
Log on.
---
Anyone need a dps?
---
Start a group with 2 other dps.
---
30 minutes later, fuck it, can I find that one good healer who is willing to put up with my bullshit and just let me throw on a shield at times and fury tank in leather and mail.
---
Which at the end is a lot more smoother more often than not (except when its one of our actual raid MT/OTs), since 4 dps means things die incredibly fast, and most of the guild is at least hunting for prebis (so like no warrior looking to dps in valor set say). 
---
I realize that I did my homework and joined one of those hardcore in min maxing and casual in time commitment and bullshit (IE no crazy alt requirements or split runs), so that the players in the guild can do this fairly easily. But every time I pug a healer and fury tank it has been a nightmare of either the DPS peeling threat in my plate gear, or the healer being a ret paladin who don't know how to downrank properly, or bits of both.
---
I know that if I am going to use some of the slack in doing an off role with off role pieces, I need the group make up for it in other ways.
---
You missed out. I classic you can get a instand spell squeezed in right after EL + CL which gives you 100% of the time a CL + Shock crit for 0 mana
---
That is my main hand
---
Let me know when you can sell things from the rooftop of the bank in ironforge.
---
IMO the royal scepter but it kinda depends on what the rest of your gear looks like. I like stats + healing over basically just healing typically.
---
&gt; On run number 29 my lightforge legs dropped. 
---
You gotta pump up those numbers kid. Those are rookie numbers! :P
---
And of course you gotta do the mongolian throat singing while doing it! :P

Hinterlands feels more of Hellfire than anything. Close density of mobs, elites in one area, stealthy wolves, ROBO-CHICKEN QUEST..

It's like they thought that "ok the zones small but we need to fit same amount of mobs in there as any other zone"

Scepter all the way

“Nah making a coffee” or “nope”. Take your pick.

Don’t get me wrong we use summons a lot, but if nobody wants to make the effort they can all just run. Or find another group, whatever.

Nah Paladins are cheesy power metal and you know it!!
---
Get a slow weapon, a swing timer add on and do hamstring kiting.
---
I know the feels. As a mage we are a dime a dozen, and many times our bis gear gets lost to a priest when it's just a minor upgrade to them and their bis is way better for them. They ofc have the right to roll, and win, on items we both need - but as you said, it gets old after a couple days. I think the plus side is you are a tank so you can throw groups together within minutes. Which is a right you've earned, as leveling a tank can be cancerous.
---
Yup.
---
Bootleg boy?
---
Are you lookin to just farm? 5man? Eventual alt raids? PVP?
---
Even if you just pug mc/zg the mage still comes ahead imo. Locks can do good dmg, but each spec has a glaring weakness. 2 involves face tanking or hp dependencies, and sm/ruin is a glass cannon. At least mage has, either fire or frost, has controls/snares.
---
If you just want to farm, mage wins again imo since locks need raid gear to outshine them there.
---
This is just in my experience.
---
It's weird that nobody back them had a problem with that but nowadays everyone whines about items more than ever. It's the same in dungeons and "item xy is reserved" bullshit. I understand you don't give items to classes where it doesn't make any sense. But almost every class has multiple specs and fury warriors are pissed off if they can't their hands on t1 when basically only Ragnaros drops the interesting items for them.
---
Dio or killswitch?
---
You roll on gear for the spec you are currently playing. You may take any offspec gear another main spec player doesnt need. Always ask if anyone needs for main spec before rolling. If you dont than youre the douche and in the wrong. 
---
Just follow these damn rules and youll be fine. Dont get fucking loot hungry for offspec shit, it’s been less than 3 months and this game as a finite end point. We will be running these raids and dungeons for a long time. You will get the shit you wont. 
---
Dont like these rules? Find a group of guildies to run with and express explicitly the items you intend to roll for.

Well it sounds like you are on a low pop server
---
Reading this after getting off run #12 without seeing Robes of the Exalted. Ive already started naming the mobs. Every run I have someone stating that they see the robes all the time.
---
You’re right. I should have specified what my goals are. Mainly it will be pvp and grinding. And I guess mage wins here...
---
Eh if you’re blowing cool downs 1 second into the fight that’s on you.
---
no, it's not even a lot by 2005 standards, let alone with today's network and PC's.
---
*Fuck* Capslock is a good name for a warlock.
---
Same. My best friend is born Paladin and will refuse to play anything else as his main.
---
And I'm here drooling looking at these windfury/sword spec procs on Hamstring Arms streaming. Plus I'd play Shaman as reroll in a heartbeat I loved this class when I've been able to play it in BC as a Draenei.
---
Will probably feel better when I'll be wandering around Azeroth smashing heads with my pocket Paladin as honor releases though.
---
41 max lvl?? What is wrong with you?
---
It doesn't really matter anymore.
---
Web browsers use 100 times as much memory as they did when WoW came out, not even exaggerating.
---
Yeah no. Everybody does work to get every item. That doesn't entitle them to roll on it, that's how need and greed works. I don't go around rolling on +spirit gear as a rogue so I can theoretically improve my health regen inbetween pulls by putting it on quickly.
---
You will have more pvp if you rolled onto a pve server rather than going heartseeker. You will likely never ecen see horde as there are 6-7 alliance corpse camping any horde that try to play. It was 50-50 when it was low-medium pop but horde are probably 5%-10% of the server pop now.
---
Clickers exist :D
---
Yeah, rogue may be a better fit.  Also you could try to find or start a guild.  You can try to make a community of people group and enjoy the game with instead of pugging.
---
Just finished 12th run no robes. Im feeling a bit light headed.....
---
Threat is designed about a single target approach. That means focusing one mob, getting enough threat on a few other mobs to keep them off the healer and crowd control if the packs are to large.
---
You might not like that and there are problems within that approach (higher mitigation leading to less rage for the tank leading to less threat with better gear for example), but it is one of the defining characteristics of vanilla compared to later expansions that were much more aoe focused.
---
meanwhile it took me 49 boosted runs just to see it drop for the first time...
---
The first point is definitely true, but in my mind, since you never are going to get to the point where miss, dodge, and glancing are going to be a huge part, I think thinking of crit and hit the way I describe as maybe a bit easier to visualize. 
---
Your point about the 40% is also true, and I think my wording overall could be better there. I'll see if I can work on making that more clear.
---
Indeed
---
Yeah having spirit is really nice. Though if it's a 50/50 I'll go with the stone cause it looks cooler xD
---
Hungering is a Kel'thuzad weapon. If you get your hands on that you beat the game.
---
Its true. But you have Daily "PLEASE FUCKING ASK HERE"-threads that are supposed to be used for this. In this case it is easily fixable but since he just installs addons without using his brain he can solve this problem himself.
---
You are done with DM, my friend. Move on to other domains. 
---
I recommend taking a look at this [sword progression chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpf7zx/alliance_rogue_sword_progression/) for a quick reference.
---
At your level you need to just head to felwood and grind.  Kill anything that gives exp, not only quest mobs. Grind grind and grind.  Then go to winter spring and kill everything.
---
Around 56 try to spam the efficient brd runs.  Full clear runs suck.
---
Yeah, I think it is Blasted Lands
---
That made me laugh on the train
---
Heart of the wild / NS specced druid.
---
Druid in our guild heals raids and gets nonstop requests to tank ubrs.
---
Ah, in that case...
---
Its a toss up. SL/SL lock is pretty great for pvp even in just dungeon gear, your dmg will suck, but you'll be hard to kill. Mage will depend on how well you can control/kite. Both can be fun, but it comes down to preference.
---
I'd say look some vids of each and see which piques your interest.
---
I thought the ridiculousness of the claim was obvious enough but it's okay.
---
This is why I chose fury/prot. Raid already have enough tanks? That's fine I'll dps. Won't be top dps but I'll be better than expected, and I can still tank dungeons no problem
---
ZF graveyard
---
Here's something that'll blow your mind then:
---
Basi*lisk* - fantasy creature, 6 legged reptile
---
Crocodile - real creature, 4 legged reptile
---
Croco*lisk* - real/fantasy fusion, 6 legged reptile
---
Crocolisks are literally just crocodile basilisks! IT'S IN THE NAME! IT'S RIGHT THERE EXPLAINED TO US AND WE NEVER EVEN NOTICED!
---
This has some interesting implications and raises some questions. Do crocolisks share a common ancestor with basilisks? Are they just a subspecies? Which came first? Would a basidile have 4 legs? Does *lisk* denote 6 legs across the board?
---
I wonder.
---
Number of random invites is funny. Half asleep grinding... "Instance? All ready to go have a warlock to summon you?" Can i just mindlessly auto attack and fish please lol?
---
It is only joke y u haf 2 b mad
---
Nobody cares if you play or not.
---
Priest is simple: Look at healtbars, cast heals. 
---
The End
---
Ignore the spirit because it's useless while in combat unless the 5SR is active and you have innervate*. If you have 5/5 Spiritual Guidance Thaurissan's Royal Scepter (TRS) gives +24.5 healing compared to Brightly Glowing Stone's (BGS) +37 healing.
---
Then it's simply 5 int vs 12.5 healing.
---
BGS beats TRS. 
---

---
I play Alliance on noggenfogger. At lvl 32 i tried questing in Stv. But kept getting corpse camped by multiple 60s and ganked by groups of 3-5 hordes every single time i tried to to anything at all. Even to the point of them running to the spirithealer to keep killing me when I had rezz sicknes. 
---
I 100% understand why people quit.
---
All these abbreviatons are in the WoW manual I'm not even kidding. 
---
See if you can find one at a thrift store. It's a hilariously inaccurate read.
---
Oh please. A loser that can't use the right thread nor post a proper thread whines on you. No, the mod didn't act like an asshole, the whiner that posted this is the asshole. He gives zero shit about rules and then whines about people getting tired of answering his shit.
---
Instead of bitchin about transfers just make a new character on a more balanced server. God forbid if blizzard doesn’t hold your fucking hand about every little thing.
---
Woah
---
As a priest player I absolutely love the complete chaotic nonsense that is healing those 4 mage AoE runs. When everything goes right, I'm basically afk. When it goes even slightly wrong though, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. And it's glorious.
---
There will be &lt;paid thing&gt; when Daddy Activision says there will be, #NoChanges be damned.
---
Now you can do it right. Better stronger more fun!
---
Warriors scale very well with gear - and this goes both ways. If your gear falls behind a bit, you will have a pretty lousy time. Just got a new blue weapon of your own level? Oh boy, enjoy the ride.
---
If this is an alt and you have some extra gold, it might be worth picking up some decent leveling gear to make things smoother. If this is your first character, consider going against the grain of many recommendations and buy a decent (but cheap) weapon from AH now and then if you don't think you have any major upgrades coming your way soon. All gear is important, but the weapon is by far the most important.
---
Not even Adriana?
---
This was the best post I've seen on this sub so far. Well done, and congratulations.
---
Nah man, hunters are the most predictable class. I fuck em up good whenever
---
That's definitely a big overreaction but I've always considered it polite to ask if there's other miners and if so take it tap by tap.
---
&gt;Are you allowed to roll on Robes of the Exalted when joining a dungeon pug as ret paladin?
---
I don't understand this question. Of course i am lol. Except i am in there with guild mates who needs it more. I owe randoms nothing and Paladins need heal gear. In fact i had this robe with my Paladin back then and i played ret mostly. I respecced to heal for pug raids.
---
Head or legs, but otherwise correct.
---
Congrats man!
---
If it is not allowed to say what must be said then this isen't worth anything. Then this should be the place for mindless yeasayers.
---
History shows: those places don't last very long...
---
I mean the characters mind goes to that realm. Imagine being so scared you run terrified in random directions unable to control yourself fleeing from an unseen horror.
---
Warlock is fun :)
---
You need a level 40 talent. There’s no way around that. 
---
Also don’t specc improved cleave.
---
You should probably just do arms with MS and prot points down to last stand/shield wall.
---
I feel your pain, I had it with my Pala in strat for those leggings, 9 runs sofar and no pants but 3 times beastmaster. Then i run it with my hunter and lightforge drops…...
---
Thanks will def give it a try then, duel wielding def  sounds like more fun to try.  
---
Do you mean +10% hit talents or gear? I am lv 15 atm
---
&gt; There's one viable MT class/spec,
---
Complete ignorance right there.
---
Paladins are the best tanks for 5~15 mans, followed by Druids who're also significantly better than Warriors.
---
In raids Warriors and Druids are neck-and-neck and competent guilds keep at least one feral druid in their raid for the added utility, easier gear distribution, and superior threat generation over a warrior taking that same slot.
---
There are bosses where you need a warrior. There are bosses where warriors are better. There are also bosses where Druids are better. Most bosses they're interchangeable. 
---
A guild not running with at the very least a feral druid offtank is unnecessarily handicapping themselves and making gearing up their tanks much harder than it needs to be.
---
I'm taking a different approach. My main is a 46 mage since I have played mage for 3-4 years since 2009.
---
But for some reason I'm really getting a lot of enjoyment out of farming 2H weapons. Seeing your weapon damage sometimes doubling because of a new weapon is simply amazing. I also wanted to level a paladin for the freedom of movement and a shaman for RNG windfury madness.
---
But I'm fully aware that the most viable 2H class will always be the Warrior. So I'm leveling all 3 so I never have regrets of my class choice :p. That way I will have all 3 (pseudo-)warriors. Warrior is the highest right now with level 26, Paladin is 22 and my Shaman is 20.
---
Some resources that might be useful [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-priest-pve-healing) and [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-classic-wow). In addition, check out this [guide](https://classicwow.live/guides/18/the-egregious-guide-to-resto-shaman#launch_pre_raid_bis_phase_1_) for resto shamans - yes, you are a priest, but there are some great general healing things to look up there, and the author (Egregious) goes through them in a very good way. In particular, have a look at the UI/addon section, Miscellaneous, perhaps Keybinds and Consumables. He also discusses downranking when going through the various healing spells, but not sure how translatable those are for priests - I'd still recommend having a downranked version of your major heal that does \~half the healing of your max rank, to use when healing requirements isn't high enough to warrant max rank. That, and the other advice by u/thebruce are all very much on spot. 
---
Keep healing dungeons as you level to get used to the new tools you get as you level up, and make sure to actually replace your new spell ranks on your bars whenever you get new ones - this can be easy to forget, especially if you're half asleep when you level up and choose to go to a city and train before going to sleep.
---
Intentional griefing will result in a temp ban. Throwing happy rocks at a singular player for hours or intentionally blocking a flight master of your own faction is most definitely intentional griefing.
---
Yeah oh yeah I remember this place from vanilla, trying to get [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18727/crimson-felt-hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18727/crimson-felt-hat) for my mage because I still had the ridiculous SM hat at lvl 60. I think I ran it for longer than 2 weeks, like a month maybe, and the few times it dropped someone else got it.
---
I did all sorts of things on my 60 mage in vanilla, played for quite a while, but I never managed to get that damn felt hat.
---
Grats on your drops!
---
You were correct.
---
Druid forms do not benefit from Windfury.
---
They might get the buff, but it will never proc for them.
---
This seems like the same crap we see on every gaming sub about any game.  Game comes out, the  a month later we see threads like this which are basically "hur dur game is dying".
---
&gt; how they always talk in abbreviation seriously Idk 
---
 I belly laughed at this part.  Did you read that aloud when you typed it?  So ridiculous.
---
Vanilla Warlocks are God’s in PvP.
---
there should be no automod removal. automod is the worst thing that's happened to reddit
---
Hell yea brother! Fuck em, for having potato pc and playing the game they love.
---
I low-key enjoy watching the lfm spam, arena runs need healer, anger runs need healer, same guy for hours looking for the healer, because god forbid you add 5 minutes per anger run to kill golem so you don't need to spend hours looking for a healer.
---
I think its because people realize how different things are once you hit 60. You can raid, but unless you have the rain-man level of knowledge all the tryhards have burned into their brains about endgame, you will be kinda lost. What raid drops what, how to get attuned and when, how to play your ideal role for your class and play it well, what to farm, what gear to get, what obscure alch/ench mats are important. The list goes on. Then you just start raidlogging. Then you realize all youre doing is trying to collect a new item in a game with nothing to do so you just move on with your life.
---
Why would you say it's corrupt? 
---
I've interacted with both superfriendly ppl and arrogant assholes grom that guild.
---
Seen em sell druid t2 helm and whatnot, but hey, that's their right
---
Absolutely, I’ve always disliked Orgrimmar, Thunderbluff and the Undercity are far nicer cities than that dustbowl. The whole place is brown, the colour of turd.
---
Complains about abbreviations.  Uses one too  lol
---
Fairbanks. Phase 2 world PvP is gonna be nuts
---
Ok, thx for the information. I thought they only drop in later phases. Lord Roccor at least should be solo farmable.
---
Some mobs have an ability called Thrash which let's them store additonal auto attacks a bit like reckoning charges. Usually they will only do this one at a time so you will get the occasional double attack but if you're kiting them they can store several more attacks and chunk you when you do go back into melee
---
&gt; This is the preffered method for gearing on OS. 
---
Like I said though, I wouldn't really consider resto my "off spec" as that is what I raid with. If anything, feral would be my off spec because I just use it for dungeons and solo'ing. 
---
&gt; If you wouldn’t do it in a raid to your own guild healers why do it to randoms? 
---
Well, passing gear to a guildie would still benefit me by benefiting my guild. Passing it to a random would only benefit them and their guild while hurting me and mine.
---
man, your own attitude is really the problem.
---
&gt; so please consider to change your attitudes
---
Theres 8000 readers here, and lets assume theres a million players in classic wow. How did you ever expect this thread to make ANY difference?
---
suck it up, quit being a noob and get some friends.
---
War Effort will be fun on single faction realms ;)
---
First off, get all the +dagger skill items you can find. I think there are gloves in MC and and belt (?) in Dire maul.  
---
Second you want a really slow dagger for main hand, fast off hand for poisons.  
---
Third your stat distribution is less skewed towards crit and more along AP (you get enough crit from talents), hit% is still important (str and agi almost equal then, crit will still help your white damage and finishers though).
---
But if you want to have more fun, play on a RP server. That envorionment would probably be kinder to you.
---
Private servers had a healthy faction balance because the raids were so hard that being Alliance was a huge benefactor because of Paladins and better pve racials. But Classic raids are so braindead easy that it really doesn’t matter which faction you are so naturally everybody goes horde for the better pvp racials.
---
Armor type only really matters for pvp and tanks. The only differences between leather and mail are the armor value of the item and the classes that can wear them.
---
Had some dude hunters mark a quest mob which I was waiting for with 4 others for a good 15 minutes, and then rage at me cause hunters mark means he had dibs even though I tagged the mob. (And he just showed up, with my group of 5 waiting 15 min..) Wish I screen shotted it.
---
People get so fucking offended if you ask for payment, or even an orb drop or the BoPs. Its hilarious. Left a group because one person wouldn't let me reserve 1st orb. 20 mins later they were still spamming for tank. Wonder if they ever ran it or just fell apart. I can somewhat understand not wanting to pay/etc, but if everyone contributed 2.5s that is pretty small for a long dung if you are going for your pre BiS. Like my repair bills are huge. And now I am completely pre raid BiS. So I have no reason to run any dungeons except for gold. I can garauntee someone is gonna read our posts and get very triggered and start flaming us
---
Fuck Blizzard. Chinese government boot lickers.
---
Hm. TIL.
---
I thought you need to put detect magic to see buffs.
---
Well, then the discussion is over honestly.
---
We just have two different opinions on this matter and will not agree on each others position.
---
For a mage, what is the best stat I should go for?
---
Currently I have the entire Dreamweave set (+spl dmg), but I'm also running mara and got the head gear from princess which has +Int, +stam, etc.
---
I'm assuming for PVE I'm gonna focus all Spell dmg, and for questing and pvp I'm gonna use the other stuff (int and stam).
---
lmao ok guy, solid argument.  "Your a retard so ur wrong" well done.  Even average guilds don't give Vis'kag to tanks, it's not a fucking tank weapon.  If you honestly believe it is then you're just ignorant and don't know how to play this game, sorry.  When the top players in the world(and virtually everyone else) agree on something, it's almost certainly right.   Go ahead and pass on Vis'kag to your tank though lmao, probably wouldn't do much good being equipped by someone like you anyway
---
Fishing is still good no matter what the prices on ah are
---
Luckily i play warrior myself so dps has to deal with me not giving too much fucks about them, especially if they are the classes you mentioned. I make exemptions for Warlocks. They are fucked without me taunting stuff off of them.
---
RPPVP servers are quite balanced historically.
---
Easy to say when most people have work and even getting to 40 is serious investment. (I play since launch and still only at 39 with my warrior, no alts at all...luckily the faction balance is mostly alright on Gandling so I wasn't ganked to the point where I would lose several hours to nothing yet)
---
Hotw is a solid and versitale build but gear intensive, youre pretty much fighting healers, rogues, and tanks for gear.
---
&gt; the lvl 50 class quest for diamond flask
---
Not out until Phase 4.
---
ST is very legit for several other reasons tho.
---
Wow do you mean his statement was not 100% true for all millions of gamers, and not a generalisation? I feel betrayed
---
Druid healers aren't really in demand for raids. They contest with all healing and caster classes for healing/spell damage and nobody really for tier gear. Most raiding guilds have 1,2 druids maybe.
---
Our legs may be stumpy, but they could move Stormwind if the pay was right. I say Stormwind because Ironforge is far too well built to even shake during an earthquake, let alone be moved. 
---
You can kill a dwarf, but you can't beat a dwarf.
---
I agree. Good day sir.
---
We're doing ok actually but thanks for your concern
---
This is from a private server, so the #nochanges doctrine is not applicable in this case.
---
Fishing is a secondary profession, you can pick that up anyways.
---
At least on my server playing during prime time, herbalism seems to be much better to make money right now. The market for ore is kinda saturated due to a lot of people leveling with mining, while there is a constant demand for herbs by all raiding players.
---
But I thought TF is the best weapon ofc?
---
If discussion and analysis doesn't get upvoted, it isn't as valuable as you're making it out to be. That, or you're living in hypothetical fantasyland.
---
Reality? WoW discussion threads would get upvoted without moderation. That's just my guess, but who knows?
---
\&gt;And if you don't have mods at all then people post things against the sitewide rules and your sub gets banned.
---
If reddit has an obligation to keep illegal stuff off their platform to stay in business, why are mods volunteering to work for free? If no mods existed, reddit would have to pay for basic moderation the way other social media platforms do. At that point, it would have value.
---
Those masks have higher texture resolution than actual character models.
---
people dont like it cuz its really boring
---
but pure grinding is superior xp and gold making
---
questing is only better if you follow it precisely and anyway not nearly as good money
---
they probably had a friend/guildmate asking to do the dungeon and decided to kick you out
---
Every time I try this there's like 1-2 other groups spamming for a tank for the exact same dungeon.
---
&gt;I’m trying to farm gold so I can help my friends level??????
---
Okay I can just tell you you can do these bosses also a bit different. I just say sulfuron and line of sight. But again there is no right or wrong :) just watch some streamers at twitch or some YouTube videos.
---
Fishing is a secondary profession so you can have that in addition to two primary’s, I want to say herb will have more life out of it, no matter the phase of raiding people will still be using flasks and pots etc
---
Again, I wouldn't consider resto my "off spec" though. It's what I raid with. Like I said, just because I'm playing a spec in a dungeon doesn't mean it's my main spec.
---
Imagine the frustration as a healer. Rather than enemies dying one at a time, they are kept alive way longer, only to be killed simultaneously like the group was practicing Core Hound killing.
---
So much Mana wasted with all those unnecessary hits on the tank (or tank + others).
---
That is provably false. Source?
---
People do it, I'm not ok with layer exploits but I still would've helped the dude out anyway. They'll all be fucked when layering is gone
---
I got like 20% of a level just by grinding those damn satyrs
---
It's an absolutely horrible PDF to read.
---
The little book on the other hand is fantastic to read, and fits in your pocket.
---
Ik i made it on my phone :/ sorry bout that
---
Pretty sure there’s 3 layers at least on some of the higher pop servers.  Because literally yesterday I was invited to a group, got layered in Ironforge.  Then the grp fell apart 5 min later and I joined another group and got layered again.  But I’m pretty sure it wasn’t the original layer I was in because previously I was in that with a friend of mine (not in grp) and couldn’t see him on the new one even though he said he was on IF bridge on discord.
---
Mages don't drop gold. They will drop honor though in Phase 2 so I suggest waiting until then to farm them.
---
Just imagining the innkeeper seeing the flash of a hearthstone, followed by a troll on his knees with his dead pet in his hands, howling in agony over the loss of his best friend.. He did not make it in time.
---
I just don't understand why they wont just allow the tranfers for the dominant faction on overpopulated realms. Solves two issues instead of one
---
. It is a shame to have such an obvious solution but Blizzard just ignoring it...
---
as a warlock I'm so annoyed by people whispering me out of nowhere, expecting a summon when they don't even have 2 people in my zone to click the portal
---
gtg = we're good to go aka there's two dudes waiting back at the stone while I stand in town.
---
Blizzard encourage it, so i don't see the problem.  I've never needed to do it before though 🤷‍♂️
---
I mean to be honest, Drakkisath is a bitch. I've had several runs where I was able to tank both adds and the boss easily with a few CD, and then sometimes he just faceblasts me with his disorientation while he's getting kited out of the room and I range pull his adds and keeps doing so every time I get out, so all I can do is pray that the DPS warrior finds his shield and taunt button or some mage is good at kiting.
---
I honestly can't speak to which race is better tanking wise. And honestly, when it comes to tanking, the real attack table you should care about is the enemy's against you. 
---
However, the theory, as I understand it, is that when it comes to tanking the name of the game is that. Orcs get a racial which increases dps by a huge amount. For tanks that translates to more threat in between applications of sunder armor, revenge, shield slam, etc. It also means more fury generation, which means you can do even more sunders, and revenges, and shield slams. This means dps can dps harder, sooner, and for longer, without worrying about pulling threat. 
---
That's the theory anyways. However, I wouldn't worry too much about your race. Having the racial or not should not be the difference between MT/OT and dps. Any race can MT as prot warrior given the gear. Really, the only time race should be considered is if you are in a cutting edge progression raiding guild looking to be server/world first clear. Otherwise, classic is very lenient. Not being 100% optimal is not going to make or break the raid. A lot of fights are won/loss off mechanics, not lack of healing, tanking or dps. If you have near half pre-BiS phase 1, you can easily do MC raid content no problem. 
---
This isn't retail. You don't need to have X ilvl with Y race in order to complete a raid. Just be smart, know how your abilities work, how your tables work, and know how to work for the progression of the raid and don't worry so much about your dps/tanking ability during it. If you are clearing through content the game doesn't care by how much.
---
Makes a sign saying Boycott Blizzard in a Blizzard event. Gets banned. Shocker.
---
Your main spec is whatever you are currently playing in the party. If your tanking then tank is your mainspec / resto is offspec. Thats how it is.
---
Unless stated otherwise at the start of the party and everyone agree's obviously, but I would never expect a healer in a party to agree to that..
---
Yep. Imagine when i first rolled warrior and every body was saying they are the top dps at vanilla, I was so happy.
---
Yet here we are, almost 2months later and I finally understood it only applies to HORDE warriors, because of windfury totem
---
Kill me
---
What counters a priest's fear? As a rogue if I can't instakill the priest he immediately fears me. I try to chain stun with cheap shot and so on but a millisecond of not being stunned lets the priest smash fear spell. Is this a matchup I can get good at or is it just a suck it up and roll undead situation?
---
Reminds me of the old YouTube series “Big Crits Reality Show” about a guild in Sen’Jin
---
It's the internet, most people's claims are ridiculous.
---
He probably looked at OPs post history, because that is in fact an answer to his question. Are you trying to be as much of a jerk as the moderator?
---
Now if you could also do the chest spawns for DM North that would be awesome :)
---
the LFG channel is /5
---
He looks like an Arab guy who tried to sell me coke in a hot tub once.... I mean Sunwell dust...
---
I opted for dual Cruel Barbs with my Rogue and didn't replace it till Vanquisher Sword from SM quest, then you get Thrash Blade from Maraudon Quest and Mirahs from Scholo. That was it for me when it comes to swords. I had also green sword pairing with Vanquisher, it was something with very high attack speed like 1.5 or 1.6 and good stats.  If you would be interested I could look for screen somewhere to find what it was. I would do DM unless you don't profit from it at all. I had good gold income at level I went there on and still gained experience from mobs on ship.
---
because it's like 10 times per hour and I just want to fish, I don't have 2 people around to click the portal and I'm sure as hell not searching for people to get your lazy ass somewhere
---
either have 2 people to click the portal or don't bother me
---
I'm sensing a bit of *"I AM THE LAW!"* from this. I can understand the frustration of being ganked and camped for 30 minutes and wanting to get away from that, so let people do what they want to do, it doesn't affect you whatsoever.
---
Free fallin'
---
I joined this group for Scarlet monastery and it disbanded after 40 minutes...... People kept dying in the Western plaguelands trying to get to tirisfal. So after 40 min, our tank who was already there gave up.
---
mage is just better
---
BUT there are a shit ton of them
---
if you want ez raid spots go warlock on alliance
---
Well tbh, I use Prat as a chat adoon, if you got the patience you can configure it to do anything you want. Chat related.
---
For example since I'm 60, I don't want to see people looking for Maraudon, ZF, BRD etc, you can filter out what shows in the chat. I dont care about people selling or crafting etc. My trade/world/lfg channel is super clean with things I only have interested in.
---
That is just one example. But the addon can do many more.
---
It's funny to me, because I always see people saying how important faction balance is, *especially* on pvp servers, and yet any time solutions are brought up the ideas get shot down almost immediately. There are any number of things Blizz could do to balance factions properly, and yet nobody seems to want any of them.
---
They could make free transfers actually favor balance for once. Let alliance from an alliance heavy server move to Herod. Let the horde on Herod move to servers that need them, etc.
---
They could limit character creation (for those who don't have a character there already) for the dominant faction once it reaches a certain threshold, helping to funnel people into the faction that needs it.
---
They could make the queues faction specific if the balance falls too far in one direction, to incentivize moving to/from servers to avoid queues. Like they already do, but tailored to your faction instead of total server population.
---
Or, you know,  they could simply come up with literally anything better than the few ideas I shit out while making waffles at 4am.
---
Yeah, but this gives you an option if you're farming at irregular hours. 2 mins is nothing, just park your alt at an auction house and do you usual buying and selling in this time.
---
She was only in office 2012-2014.
---
Your party obviously does not (and should not have to) care what spec you raid with.  
---
What matters to the party, is the spec you bring to that party, and that's the only gear you roll on.  
---
Its just simple dungeon ethics.
---
You want healing gear, you heal the party.  
---
You want tanking gear, you tank the party.  
---
Or if the healer doesn't need the healing item, you can need it.  
---
Or announce at start that you will be rolling on everything, and give the healer the chance to find another party.
---
Why is it so hard to find groups as heals? I feel like DPS have it even easier
---
Got it last week and finished the quest earlier this week.
---
It's one hell of a staff, I used to go oom pretty fast since the priest BiS gear doesn't have to much MP5 / Spirit on it but with Benediction, you can cast Renew on each and everybody and watch how you rise the top of the healmeter\^\^
---
good idea! it would be perfect for it.
---
And yet in that given moment you arent healing so you arent rolling on healing gear. Simple how that works.

---
You shouldnt have issues with single target threat. Make sure you are in defensive stance and spamming sunders. Also keep weapon skill at/near max.
---
You should be able to tank 3 mobs with proper dps focus so mark the main target, else use cc. Open with battleshout into demo shout, then sunder tab sunder etc.
---
Lastly, use an addon that shows targetoftarget on tooltip. This, together with a @mouseover Taunt macro, should greatly improve your reaction time to loss of aggro.
---
Sometimes you gotta eat the extra hours to have the experience you want. And if world pvp is what OP is after it isn’t like getting to sixty will change anything. You can stab a player to death at level one, you can stab a player to death at level sixty.
---
Rby my friend. You always stand at the same spot in IF
---
I'm not sure why I laughed so hard from this...but thanks for the laugh!
---
Doing BRD, then Strat, Scholo and LBRS made me go from 52 to 60 really fast. Try it.
---
I was on a pvp server, getting constantly ganked by others during level 25+ in ashenvale (groups of ppl 10+ level above me). I thought about my goal in the game and there wasn't any open pvp in that, so why enduring the torture -&gt; Switched to a pve realm
---
After some weeks, 3 friends of mine switched, too, because 50+ was even worse
---
Faction imbalance isn't fun at all, especially for the underdog
---
have you played pvp even once?
---
It is not possible to disenchant them. I'm assuming you have Auctionator installed? It's a bug. Sorry.
---
according to reddit, if you aren't a warrior, a priest or a mage, you'll never find any spot in any raid watsoever.
---
Also, if you play retpala, hunter survival, boomkin and others, you'll never find any group for dungeon at all
---
It's not an outlook, it's a summary of the negative experiences of being a moderator. It's not the *only* aspect to the job, but it's the part that's relevant to the conversation. 
---
And the truth is that most people are just fine. Often appreciative. Issue of course is those aren't the people you need to deal with very often, why would you? That doesn't mean the entire community is like that... but it is a substantial amount of the people you interact with. 
---
&gt; In your own example - would you want to leave your child in a daycare with a person, who sees all children as "self absorbed little shits"? Would you want to face a judge who sees all people as criminals? 
---
This is you taking an analogy too far.. I was making a point, not a direct comparison. 
---
&gt; Same thing with the mods - when you begin hating the people that you are overseeing, when you stop treating them as individuals, when you let your previous negative experiences influence your M.O. in future interactions - it's time to stop, because you are no longer fitted for this task.
---
Who said I hated the people I was overseeing? You're reading a lot about how I acted based off very little information.
---
&gt; Otherwise you're just stroking your ego, saying how shit everybody is, how much you do for them, and how thankless that is.
---
If that's your take away I guess that's nice, it's certainly not what I wrote.
---
Hallows end. Where you can pretend to be a real character when you picked shitty alliance
---
Correct :)
---
Oh fuck off. 
---
They didn't implement layering to allow people to vanish from one version of the world into another. It's purely for load balancing and this sort of shit is not the intended purpose.
---
Get the fuck off YOUR high horse.
---
Yep it looks weird as hell
---
You really dont need +10%. Even without hit fury performs very close to arms, thanks to the new talent trees. Getting 2 to 3% is more than enough to justify the switch.
---
GatherMate is good addon for that.
---
Expecially if you switch which one you play so they get 2 bars rested. Makes the 40-60 push somewhat reasonable
---
Just google it was the incorrect response, but there is a daily questions thread, where short questions should be directed to. No need to be a dick about it but strict content moderation is required on a subreddit, or they will turn into unfun shitshows - we all know at least one subreddit that has lost its way entirely because nobody steers it in a good direction.
---
Lvl 60 prot tank and I’m starting to realize why.
---
1). If you’re a warrior your expected to be prot and to tank. 
---
2) doing anything other than tanking is now laborious since your prot and can’t do damage like you used to(questing, getting to certain dungeons)
---
3) poor as fuck.  I usually make just a few gold for a few hrs of dungeoning after repairs.
---
4) you have to compete against other warriors who are wanting some of the same gear
---
5) tanking is very stressful.  Feels like the responsibility of a good run or a wipe is on you.  You’re also the de facto “leader” and should be marking mobs, organizing pull strategy, and leading the party through these labyrinth dungeon layouts
---
I love tanking but yeah I get it
---
Stop being lazy and level a druid then...
---
Most (All?) Reddit mods are assholes since theyre the only ones dumb enough to do shitty work for free.
---
/r/watchredditdie
---
Just leave your friends behind to go start over with the grind to 60, farming all your gear, getting the gold for epic mount, etc all over again lole
---
It's so simple, why didn't we think of it sooner?!
---
I originally played Alliance and faction changed to play with some friends a few years ago. Feels strange being Alliance again in Classic but fuck Horde cities, all elevators and shit. I had Horde alts during TBC and those elevators killed me so many times because my laptop was a piece of shit.
---
I do kinda regret rolling on a pve server though.
---
Do you want hot-patches? Because this is how you get hot-patches.
---
Auctionator.
---
You may have met me... mon
---
I have a 60 mage. 
---
Pros:
---
Getting groups for dungeons is a breeze. 
---
Questing is easy solo.
---
Creating food/water is insanely convenient.
---
Portals around the world saves SO MUCH time.
---
Warriors/Paladins/Rogues have no chance against you in pvp. 
---
The ability to kill 5+ mobs at the same time consistently.
---
Making money off water/food/portals.
---
Easy gold farming methods at 60 using AoE spec. 
---
Best CC in the game with polymorph 
---
Cons:
---
People are ALWAYS asking you for water/food.
---
Rogues/Fury Warriors/Hunters will out dps you in raids (at least for now).
---
A lot of people play mage so you will be competing for your spot/gear.
---
So. Much. Downtime. Seriously, you will be drinking every pull or every other pull.
---
its because the servers are so massive, that some demons get the same name.
---
spinx gathermate2 data has almost all locations for everything.
---
I miss spell reflect :(
---
was.  GE ruined that ;(
---
I think Strat gates required key.
---
Read this at work, pretty sure my co workers think I'm insane now. 👌👌

Nah it’s not their job to cross check prices for you, if you’re too lazy to check the AH yourself then someone isn’t being an asshole for taking you up on YOUR offer.
---
How are people looking at your spec?  You must have an addon that’s broadcasting your spec like details or something.  Just turn it off if you’re self conscious about it and voila no one can see your spec.
---
Wear healing set, use lvl 1 GHeal, do not hesitate tonput SW Pain and Vampiric Embrace on mobs abd bosses
---
If you mainly want to pvp,  
---
1. Dueling:  
---
* Warlocks specced SL are the best dueling class in the game, they have no hard counter.   
---
* Mages can spec into pom/pyro for cheeky wins, but it's easily counterable with a fire reflector and trinket. With a normal frost control spec, you still get hard countered by warlocks, hunters, shadow priests and shamans, paladins might be a pain in the ass with the constant cleanses too.  
---
2. Battlegrounds :  
---
* Warlocks specced sm/ruin are really bursty, fun in battlegrounds. Or spec shadow mastery and put some points into demo for tankiness and throw dots on everyone. 2 very different playstyles. Your job however is mainly peeling for the flag carrier.  
---
* Mages can spec anything in a bg and still help a ton. All specs are viable, but elementalist is the most fun. Depending on spec, you can both zerg and defend, and you're the 2nd best flag carrier after druids.  
---
3. WPVP:  
---
* Warlocks lack mobility, so they can't disengage fights. They also require A LOT of setup after reviving (summon pet, soulstone/healthstone, buffs), which means you can't revive and fight back, you have to look for safe spots to drink for a minute (not always available). You also might have the wrong pet out for the wrong encounter, but this is easily fixable with some points in demo. All this being said, the tankiness of SL is simply stupid, and lock is great in wpvp just because it's a great class for sustain, similar to druid.  
---
* Mage is great because you can disengage at will, with instant slows, roots, poly and blink, you can disengage, engage and reset any fight you want. It's probably one of the better wpvp classes after rogue.
---
Google blows, I use duckduckgo. Keep "googling" if you want to give those anti democracy asshats more money.
---
Hah, that's the opposite of my groups. I don't need shit from live, but I see groups looking for tank for 30+ min and tell them I'll tank it if I can get all orbs. They almost always say yes.
---
Lol tell me why i should kiss peoples boots for just saying u bad. 
---
To the people here giving constructive criticism on the other hand&lt;3
---
I thought g2g meant we are good to go. As in once we have filled with what ever we are looking for we are good to start. I’ve always seen at the end of each post. “ have lock. Can summon.”.
---
I thought about streaming this but I'm not good at keeping convo alone for 4+ hours lol
---
Molten Giants and Destroyers after Golemagg if I remember well. Firelords after Geddon?
---
exactly. easy to prevent. norm since vanilla wow. every1 still acts surprised if some1 needs on it to steal it...
---
Depends on the content you want to play:
---
They're both good at everything and there are farmspots for both. Both have mechanics which make them very good at farming. The weakness of mage is the high class representation, so you'll gear a bit slower in comparison to warlocks (we for example have 6 mages and 4 warlocks)
---
🦀Jagex won’t respond to this thread🦀
---
Lol so accurate
---
Kinda have to agree. It IS a question that can easily be googled. And the mods response here seems very calm, levelheaded, and honest. If this is what people think is "the most assholish way to respond" then people really need to wake the hell up to reality and stop acting like entitled children. Offense meant.
---
I've had the same lucy
---
My suggestions are:
---
**Druid**: Easy to level solo. You won't have to rely on people that much. Always in demand as a healer in raids. Balance sucks, however.
---
**Shaman**: One of the hardest to level solo. After 40, you can go Elemental and play caster DPS. Elemental is horrible in raids but it's very good in PvP. Restoration is amazing in raids. Respec costs are not fun and you might have to respec a lot. Can mitigate this with Resto/Ele hybrid build, though.
---
That makes no sense?
---
I think mine had a dropdown in the World of Warcraft section - Can't remember though!
---
Those are the biggest pixels i have seen in a while
---
it's not, move on
---
I would lie to you if I said I dont watch some, but, I  enjoy watching him struggle with his guilds and members in it👏👏👏
---
If everyone has Rhokdelar they're not above average anymore ;D
---
I play hunter and while questing I primarily use white damage. To have 0% downtime, and to have mana up in case sudden PVP happens, and to not over-aggro my pet.
---
With Improved Aspect of the Hawk, I have a lot of procs with this weapon. My attackspeed is near 1.0, and can get faster even with other abilities.
---
Sure you burn through ammo a bit faster, but it's not that bad.
---
Most important: It's fun.
---
SL/SL is TBC.
---
Except you make nothing because it's nerfed
---
Can u post slam build spec?
---
Prices will rise once everyone has stopped leveling fishing , you can stock up on the best fish not to mention stocking up seasonal fish and sell them off season.
---
Mage wins by large margin BUT with the overabundance of mages all good spots are heavily contested. Warlock is better at soloing elites because he can take on even the caster elites, with little to no downtime using lifedrain tanking.
---
Both are good in pvp and I'd make the choice based on which one you prefer in pvp over their farming capacity. Because you will be playing pvp more than farming, I'd assume.
---
Think they're worth something, couldn't tell you precisely what though. I am pretty sure I saw one going for c.25g, so unless you're into pets I'd sell it.
---
Never been raged starved as MS, I whirlwind/MS off cooldown. Not sure why people think 2h fury does more dmg than 2h arms. If you dont care about the debuff slot, which his guild clearly doesnt, then arms does flat out more damage. You trade a bit of single target (deathwish) for amazing 2 target dps (sweeping strikes) you trade out flurry for sword spec. Which sword spec being able to crit/proc hoj, etc. Makes it feel really nice. Furthermore MS does just more damage than BT at this point in the game.
---
Love when a Warlock says; “Mage water and food pls”
---
Then doesnt use either all run as he just lifetaps and stays on 40% hp the whole way unless the healer heals him
---
Just switch your region
---
See my other comment. It's not as bad as you think it might be.
---
That doesn't bring us any closer to why 40+ horde (couldn't see levels but all mounted) are going south through the wetlands and why some of them are backtracking.
---
I hear Earthfury is fairly balanced. The only downside from what I hear is that it's a migration server full of people who left high pop realms and a lot of them left because they play mostly during prime time when queues were at the worst. So it's harder to get groups during the day and late at night. But it's also Eastern Time so if you play evenings that won't be a problem.
---
Oof - if only that was an Arcanist helm.
---
I thought he would say "Naturally" ;)
---
i started as bottom in the dps metter while i dot stuff, then i shadow bolt a bit and my curse of agony scales and suddenly i'm 20% ahead of the 2nd guy
---
What am I? A duck?
---
It's also arguably a bug that there's a way to toggle Heroic Strike off.
---
Though Blizzard doesn't think so for the moment...
---
But it's very much a quirk of the modern, much easier, better macro system they're using over the Vanilla system.
---
I don't like it at all.
---
&gt;the stone
---
Waaaaaaaaait a minute...
---
You act like having an leveling a character is the end of the fucking world. And if OPs friends are not down to move, just make an alt to do what you want.
---
They most definitely are assholes. Feel free to disagree with me, but from my experience its one of the worst moderated big subs out there.
---
Yeh was good back in 2006 :)
---
Paladin healers are in demand as well as priests and are pretty damn good. I'm a priest but raid alongside a couple of pally healers.
---
"Classic WoW is dying because people use abbreviations and I'm too salty to learn them."
---
What.
---
Edgelord
---
Dungeons? I've been an hour in LBRS today and already got 20 gold from it. Or I killed a few elementals for a quest and got essences worth 24 gold within 30 minutes. Though it was a bit of luck.
---
Man, I thought me going from DM staff to WW axe and then not going to see an upgrade for c.10/15 levels was slow weapon progression as a warrior. Turns out Rogues have it even worse (although are maybe not quite so reliant on weapon dps).
---
That doesn’t solve his concern though
---
If you are having threat limitations get better tanks
---
Layering was quite simply put the best decision blizzard has made with all of classic so far. Try to convince me otherwise.
---
WotF is sick as hell! Especially on a PvP server. Good to know I'm not screwed!
---
It's still okay on alliance, but there's a much greater reliance on Slam over spamming for WF procs.
---
Plays like a melee hunter, which is.... well, just gross.
---
It’s actually more than 15% threat. In Battle and Berserker stance a warriors threat generation is at 80% of damage done, while in protection its at 130%. So effectively you do 130/80 = 62.5% more threat. And this is before you spec into more threat in prot.
---
You just got feared into Narnia
---
Any good ideas for how to make some gold while levelling blacksmithing? I've recently noticed that I can sell Shining Silver Breastplate for about 2x mats cost on my server, are there any other gems like this?
---
You can get the hypnotic blade and offhand from SM, Blade is obtainable in bib and offhand on graveyard. 
---
I wear the blade still at 60, offhand will be the next one from Mage quest and then the one from Linkens Questchain which is easy to get and Optional BiS. 
---
Sorry for my english, not my native language
---
I've been banned multiple times. I've talked with them, they're reasonable. I've developed close friendships with many of them. They're good people.
---
I have never seen that pun "Stratholme syndrome" and I think it should be a thing, your story being the first case studied.
---
A (preliminar) definition could be: "Compulsive need to redo the same content that burned you out even after having absolutely no reward"  
---
examples:
---
doing Strat baron runs after looting his legs
---
doing Strat baron runs after looting his mount (tell us if you get there)
---
doing alterac after reaching exalted status
---
doing any pvp after reaching rank 14
---
...
---
Got my warlock to lvl 44 but unfortunately i find it boring. Dot the target and then wand it to death or drain life. Id really love to get into classic but i am having hard time. Is any other class bit more engaging in terms of rotation etc?
---
Every time I see someone mention warriors being the only viable tank spec I just shAke my head. Bears are stupid strong in most content—there are a very select few fights where warriors are required for their pure mitigation.
---
I leveled hunter 1-41, rerolled priest then did 1-60 on Noggenfogger Alliance. Not only was it near impossible to find groups at 60, the "PvP" if you can call it that consisted of multiple horde parties picking off lone alliance players. I haven't played on Noggenfogger for 3 weeks but I'm guessing since the realm transfers opened up the horde:alliance ratio is rapidly approaching 4:1 now that pretty much everyone has had a chance to get to the PvP zones and seen how dead alliance is.
---
Currently enjoying life on Firemaw a lot more and my warlock is about to hit 60 in a few hours. Best decision I made was to reroll away from that awful realm.
---
And you feel this way because some people don’t like/understand the appeal of some random internet guy?
---
It’s not about tanking, it’s about NOT waiting two hours.
---
In game, it kinda is. You would use brutality+viskag? over it? realy? Now if you talk about ever, then yeah 2 years from now theres better dps weapons. But you shouldn't use that as a argument point. "You can't have this item because in 3 phases its irrelevant." is a shit argument.
---
It's not that he's listening to idiots in this case. It's that he's listening to the people who are mad about not getting the weapon, making terrible arguments because they're mad.
---
These are people you don't let on a loot council. He doesn't even have a loot council, and yet that's exactly what he's doing anyway.
---
I find it amusing that you throw out numbers someone I saw disproved you on. Also in 5mans/10mans if you wear even semi-plate gear it doesnt matter if you take aggro you can dps to your hearts content and the healer wont have any issue. Furthermore saying "this weapon is soo good for tanks" "but dps arent even allowed to dps with it" is just silly. Rogues have plenty of threat drop mechanics, and play alliance to get salv. EZ pz tanking.
---
Plot twist, accidentally auctioned them for 15 silver each instead of 15g
---
He’s telling you to let it go. 
---
‘If you wish to get the item, you may have to farm for it’ ‘means the drop rate is below 1%.
---
A good hunter is always useful.  Hunters mark and tranquilizing shot is great to have in raids.
---
I mean most of the time that is the case people just skip the comma, especially on eu servers
---
Pve servers are not the answer
---
100% with you, it's way more convenient than to type some 20 digit ts ip or join some discord server
---
discord is fucking annoying anyway and I almost always turn it off when I'm gaming
---
Haha nah I was farming for mats
---
Well you're right, I don't record myself playing so I don't have any "proof" that I can beat mages...
---
Nonetheless, the fact that you don't understand basic pvp mechanics as those I cited above just shows me how bad you're at the game and I won't need video proof to back up this claim.
---
If the game is making you raging so hard that you feel the need to post it on reddit maybe it's time to take a break, sure I'm not 60 yet and far from it tbh but I'm enjoying the game which doesn't seem to be your case.
---
Maybe, just maybe, slow down a bit and have fun while playing? It'll save you from belaboring people.
---
Anyway, have fun and take care.
---
If only any warrior trying to dps didnt get immediately shit on for not tanking.
---
i mean, it is the best and most simple solution, because if you try changing it, suddenly the graphics turn blue and the browser closes, so you try to change that, but suddenly the whole OS is in chinese and looks like win 95.
---
trust me, ive seen some shit. if i dont know the user/pc, reinstall windows is the best tip i can give :D
---
It’s just you.
---
Maybe, but I don’t think this is information they should be giving out.
---
Roll for what you need. It's the exact same arguement of warriors having to tank to get their dps gear. A lot of the times its better/easier to get groups by tanking as a druid.
---
People will be mad that you take their gear no matter what, they just have to deal with it. You dont know how many times I've healed dungeons as a resto druid and had people rage at me for needing an upgrade piece because its cloth and not leather and they wanted it themselves for dps or something.  
---
Healers are not entitled to be the only person getting that piece of gear. Thatd be like a mage and a warlock being in a party and the mage is mad that the warlock is rolling on the same gear as him. Especially in the later dungeons when a lot of gear has +healing and magic damage. Multiple cloth will be rolling against the healer anyways.
---
People may keep getting mad but it's just not your problem. Get the gear you need and try not to worry about anyone getting mad.
---
Not sure why you can't find atlas loot, it's definitely in the app.
---
Even if it's 1%, it's kind of a long shot to farm an item with such a drop rate. I'm kinda jealous people have so much free time...
---
Warriors are so gear dependant its not even funny. If youre all suited up in mail and weapons with greens that are lvl appropriate, you should be easily able to breeze through quests. At least my warrior could.
---
Same thing with dungeons, too much down time running to the instance
---
Think I'm at 750 days? Around 600 are warriors.
---
oh, sorry i didn't saw "on retail". My apologies.
---
As a hunter:
---
* Log in (parked in Dire Maul North), run DM Tribute runs solo making oodles of gold while actually being challenged and engaged with what I'm doing.
---
* Run out of Seaforium Charges and Explosives for DM Tribute runs, go to Maraudon to farm Mithril Deposits so I can make more stuff for Tribute Runs.
---
* (if it's a raid day) Be in Orgrimmar at 7 where a guild regularly activates Onyxia Head buff. Go to AH, buy some high level bullets, turn them into arrows, log off and surf the auction house on my bank character until 7:30 where I log back on my main, HS to Kargath with my guild and then do MC+Ony in 2.5 hours. The whole way through I am being salty that Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer and Fengus' Ferocity only grants melee ap and feel like the neglected child that Blizzard never loved, but at least I will do somewhat acceptable damage before being a tranquilize bitch come mid/end BWL.
---
You’re too lazy to just google one of the many viable builds yet you expect us to hold your hand. Then you cop an attitude when someone politely explains what a dipshit you are. I think classic is probably too hard for you. Try retail it’s actually a neat game. More accessible for children.
---
It originally did, then got removed from the game and re-added once they fixed it.
---
In classic it doesn't even drop yet so there's nothing to confirm.
---
Tanking those groups in scholomance back in vanilla as arms was intense and fun.
---
&gt; But I sure wish the economy was better
---
Economy is shit on all servers, so many people are still leveling both their characters and their gathering proffs so the supply is vastly bigger than demand. It will take easily 3 to 4 months for the prices to rise where people expect them to.
---
Classic has heavy gold sinks and that's where all that income is currently going: spells, recipies etc. Typically your fresh lvl 40 character throws ALL gold on their mount and then struggles to buy all ranks of spells after hitting lvl 60. Only after that does the gold start to pile up. Looking at my servers (Noggenfogger EU) discord statistics where people themselves report when they hit lvl 60, only 30% of the playerbase (that's about 3500 entries currently) has made it to 60, everyone else is still leveling.
---
Give it time.
---
Honestly it might be a problem of the realm you are on.  If there is a severe faction imbalance then leveling becomes a complete grind.  Which server are you on?
---
It can be asked in the result questions megathread or construct a question that exceeds 75 characters.  Asking the question and detailing what steps have been taken in researching the answer themselves would have surpassed the simple threshold of 75 characters.
---
No it doesn't carry the implication, not for one second. What I said is that people who like to inflict pain upon others are sociopaths. PvPing is not inflicting pain on someone, it's playing a game.

Your pvp trinket will counter it. Otherwise you have to chain CC to avoid getting feared.
---
fisting is 300 bucks
---
No, if you really don't have any quests, which is hard to believe but OK, just do 1-2 SM Cath runs to get you to 43-44. That opens up Tanaris, Feralas and some Dustwallow Marsh quests and you're good to go.
---
Horde good Ally bad
---
No real world politics or religion.
---
These topics very rarely end well, so it's best we stop things before they even start.
---
Obviously they wouldn't only allow transfer to one server but multiple. And the target realms should have a faction balance limit and once that is reached the transfer to that server woulf close.
---
Yes, horde is generally the dominant faction but the goal should be to get as close to ~50 % as possible. Even a 60/40 split across most servers would be great.
---
Blizzard basically says screw it and just tries to get any player off the server. I guesd so they can finally remove layering. My server still has queue times of 3 hours at night during the week so they prioritise fixing the layer issue but screw faction balance at the same time.
---
How are they wasting their own time? On most servers trade chat is the most active group forming channel.
---
Not sure but your class pvp trinket *might* break fear and should be out pretty soon if it does.  Other options is to fake out by meleeing at max range and then just before stun wears off running out of melee(fear) range and then back in after he pops it.  This won't work however if they are paying attention and not panicing.
---
Which changes dont you like though, some can be turned off. Also you get elvui reskins which for me work better than the basic elvui.
---
I wish they'd figured out Melee hunters on Vanilla. 
---
There's some Classic+ content for you.
---
What's your end game goal? PvP or PvE. If you're going pve then your rotation will be shadowbolt. That's pretty much it. 
---
If you're going PvP then it's another matter completely. Warlock is super engaging in PvP. Lots of tools, damage etc.
---
If you want to reroll then stay away from hunter and paladin. It's basically autoattack and move on for solo content. 
---
Mage is generally frostbolt spam for single target or blizzard/frost nova/coc for aoe. 
---
Shaman is somewhat engaging with totems and shocks, but you're mainly waiting for WF proccs.
---
Warrior has more engaging gameplay as you need to be paying attention and using your rage effectively to level. But the experience can be painful as you have no survivability other than your armor and one aoe fear.
---
Rogues are also engaging in that you need to be managing your energy and combo points.
---
Druids can do it all and offers lots of tools for different situations, but you're playing a less complex rogue with less dps most of the time.
---
Priests are dull.
---
I could do dungeons if i just wasn't so god damn bored of them, it's the same thing every time. Never liked the concept of dungeons really.
---
I would advise you to use a non-serif text font, it will look a lot cleaner and better.
---
Statistics can be pretty damning. If something has a 3% drop, you'd expect to see it every 33 or so runs, but 5% of people won't see it in under 100 runs.
---
I run it on Linux. Do you need any help?

Retail lvling is dreadful because it's all about the endgame, Classic lvling takes longer but  it's more rewarding. Just give it a go, don't like it? Don't play it

Tank can't hold aggro, need to heal everyone, Mana drains. 50% Mana left after first pack, tank goes immideatly to next pack, dps accidentally pull another pack. I go oom but we survive.

Tell group I'm oom. Tank pulls anyway
---
Say that I need a full manabreak after this pack.
---
Tank don't listen, runs ahead and starts pulling. I'm drinking, he dies 
---
"Wtf healer" he leaves group.
---
Find replacement and everything goes swell.
---
Want to do another run, everyone leaves except one or two dps. Find tank and dps after a while.

And repeat.
---
I too do not wan't to learn the game but rather cry about being left out in reddit.
---
They all are
---
To be clear, I didn't watch the video. But in general his stream feeds on drama. So it makes sense he wants to be in charge of assigning loot. There's always drama.
---
It’s called Atlas loot classic 
---
Make sure you have the drop down in twitch set to your classic folder 
---
That being said I don’t think atlas loot even has the abbreviations
---
u can also try to feign it by running away from the priest after ur CS is about to end
---
Tuk is basicly the same as elv but a lot more basic. And you can turn off the features that you dont like.

You don't. That's why he said also. In case you didn't have a guildie.

Fucking nolifers, I don't even play the virtual game, I derive all my enjoyment from reading the 2004 user manual and just plan how my character would be.

---
Hey! Is it worth the time? I'd love the trinket as a rogue, but don't want to spend all day sneaking around ^^
---
So if the warrior tank rolled on my healer gear it's fair game? Dude doesn't need it but he did half the work to get there. Same thing.
---
Everybody know that paladins listen to Never Gonna Give You Up on repeat.
---
Thing is I don’t think bliz are really incentivised to solve this at all.  What happens if being horde on a server with no alliance bothers you? You find a different server with better balance and reroll there.  This means a gear and money reset and you start from scratch.  This in turn means you play longer with the available content etc etc etc.
---
Hahaha, we both wish. Anyway, as a "classic+" content for hunter, i'd be satisfied with the possibility to use traps while in combat. This alone make the class much more interesting to play and useful.
---
yes but it will (can?) use two resets
---
thats why you dont want to do it if youre already hitting the cap of 5 instances/hour.
---
Bats can learn bite and owls can learn claw. I keep Screen on auto cast and use growl and claw manually.

Hi guys, im level 56 hunter and currently getting blue gear to prepare for raids when i hit 60. I want to get most of the gear from dungeons and leatherworking (devilsaur). But then there are arrows. Do Jagged arrows do the job for raiding or are Thorium arrows must? I am asking because Thoriums are like 2g per stack and I dont think its worth it. Is there simple way to get Thorium arrows or only from AH?
---
druid: reggae

---
If you ask me for water, I'll get you water. I'm not about to piss of the tank.
---
I dont see how that could be practical at maunch when 2000 chars are being created within 5 minutes.
---
Blizzard doesnt want to restrict player freedom. Imagine new players trying to understand why they cant make characters on the same faction as their friends.
---
Considering most pvp realms have more horde players, you're essentially forcing players to play a faction they dont want if you want to force 50%. You'd get full reddit threads where people would ask others to create a lvl 1 toon on ally so thay they could make a horde char. It's not a practical solution at all unfortunately.
---
Faction imbalance sucks but I havent seen any good solution to it.
---
So many China farmers on my server right now.. Used to be really good gold per hour.
---
I wish I could argue this but I have no idea what his stream feeds on because like Shakespeare, it's absolutely fucking unwatchable, but with none of the cultural significance to overcome that.
---
You get better tanks by giving them Thunderfury, obvoiusly.
---
are you serious?? because it sounds ridicolous
---
"I couldn't be arsed to do my job so I just removed a post because I felt like it might be answered by google"

I barely see any memes on this sub. I think you are exaggerating a bit. Also I don't think they are that bad. But maybe I am biased because my meme, which most thought was funny, got removed today.
---
It's not fucked up. It's just lots of people playing and posting on socials when they do. Which wasn't the case back then.
---
You knew about that one or two sulfuras on your server and that's about it.
---
Yeah, players SAY that they want faction balance. Yet, they still have a tendency to join the stronger side and abandon ship if they find themselves on the weaker side as seen here.
---
I agree that you could argue that Blizzard could have restricted our options, but that would overall only mean that half of it was Bliizard's fault while the other half was ours.
---
For a dead pop lol

It's also nice when you want to find a group and can scroll through the last 5 minutes of posts to see if anything fits your needs.

That actually seems about right :) thanks
---
You're missing the whole point which is why I'm calling you retard. 
---
1. Deathbringer is the bis threat weapon for horde unless you have Ironfoe and isn't orc. 
---
2. Vis'kag is a decent enough weapon (any will do that has high DPS. Eshkander's/Periditon Blade are my favorites on non-orc/human.
---
3. I'm saying its a good idea to givd Vis'kag to your tank if your dpsers are already bottlenecked by the threat anyway since it gives 0 DPS to any DPS but increases the tanks threat and thus the entire raids dps.
---
4. You don't play tank, you have no idea how threat generation works and hows its limited. Yet you're discussing a tank/threat loot distribution scenario. 
---
5. Vis'kag is so eady to come by with 12 chances per month for the guild. Its not like its a big deal.
---
&gt;Go ahead and pass on Vis'kag to your tank though lmao, probably wouldn't do much good being equipped by someone like you anyway
---
I don't play DW so I'm passing on it cause I don't need it.
---
You can make Thorium shells with engineering (or ask an engineer/give them materials+tip), and then turn them into arrows through a repeatable quest. As far as if they’re really needed, no idea as I haven’t raided yet either :P but I doubt a small dps difference for you would make or break your group’s run.
---
Seriously? The emote is in the title...
---
Pre pop a restorative potion and hope it cleanses the fear. Otherwise, you just have to deal with it.
---

Compare /r/gaming which allows low effort "Look at the picture, upvote it and move on" posts, vs /r/games which doesn't.

Again, if you want your sub to become just a karma-farm that's fine. But you need to be aware that's all it'll be.
---
looks like a kid. You can tell by the name basically.
---
Threat plates
---
once pvp trinkets are a think the UD ability is a lot weaker. Right now it's a huge advantage because they're the only ones who can break fear. In Phase 2, literally everyone is going to be able to break your first fear. If you like warlock I wouldn't let the UD put you off of it.  
---
Not to mention, if you go druid you're going to have to dead with Orc stun resist, so it's really just pick your poison.
---
I'm not sure how to do that sorry =( but I'm still working on the animations anyway
---
In a pug where it isn’t stated that Hunters take priority on ranged weapons vs melee weapons and vice-versa? I don’t give a shit who rolls as long as at the end of the day they can actually equip the item.
---
You don’t change loot rules and have 20 year arguments and then basically loot the item to yourself or your friend.
---
There are people who have the frostsaber after like 3 weeks and people who have 20 alts. I wouldn't be surprised at all if someone had a toon on every server.
---
In late bc and wotlk times I played on Drak'thul - EU as aliance. Server was massively horde favored. Doing Quel thalas quests was only possible in party of five, in pvp gear and with skype. Wotlk was even worse. Want to do dailies? Better bring half of guild. Want to farm herbs or mine saronite? Well too bad. So stuff was more expensive than on horde side, had to pay hundreds of gold for glyphs. Once there was opportunity to transfer it was nobrainer.
---
The innkeeper being like "please pick that thing up off my mat"
---
People will expect you to roll on gear for your current spec, at least at or near max level (everyone rolls on damage items while leveling). It is fine to take offspec gear if nobody else needs it of course.
---
I am currently in the same situation as you. I leveled as a tank and got pre-raid BiS tanking equipment for most part, but there are still a few upgrades for my healing equipment.
---
So if I run an instance with upgrades for me, I talk to the healer first and specifically name the items I am after. I've had people in random groups passing on gear that would've been an upgrade for them simply because they knew this was the only item I needed from the instance and they were glad to have a well equipped and experienced tank for the run. Most will at least be fine with you rolling against them, if you ask beforehand.
---
After you have gotten their permission to roll, there should be no drama involved. If you do not get it, you can easily find another group.
---
DD has a great community

Just go full Dunkey and kill ‘em in one hit

How is it quicker? You go through twice more zones (6 instead of 3), including two high level ones and a trip through BRM.
---
Grenade didnt need on gloves cause he knew there were other dagger rogues so he gave it to them. Had he needed asmon would say "But you dont have daggers so you wont get it"  
---
Now grenade won the roll for the dagger and asmons logic is "You didnt need on the gloves so you wont get the dagger"
---
Lol, I don't get this. Golem is literally an extra 7 or so minutes. Healers don't need anything from Angerforge.
---
Maybe I'm biased because I'm priest. But so far from what I've seen as a priest healer (mid 30s) when any DPS gets aggro they panic. I can and always will shield them, and I'm sure most classes can take a hit or 2, but everyone seems to panic and RUN AWAY FROM ME AND THE TANK.
---
Yeah lvl37 mage, you didnt pull threat o. Ragnaros, this is just a random elite in SM, you can take a hit or 2 until I get the shield on you.
---
There was a guy named Frenworld which is a reference to a sub banned for anti-semitism. Consistency is not Blizzards forte..

I did this too at first, but having lfg running constantly is nice because you can just scroll through the last few minutes of messages whenever you want a group

It's quite a few, I've done about 25 runs so far today of dme lashers on my mage and I've seen 2 tomes so far

Balance druid is pretty painful to level solo. Feral is just... so... so much better. It's like S tier vs F tier.
---
He said it's *provably* false... As in... you can prove it false.
---
If the warrior has a fury/prot spec (deep prot is not really useful in the current phase let's be honest) there is no way in hell that a druid could generate more threat than the warrior.

Phantom Blade might sell. There are a few blacksmithing items that are required for quests that might sell; low level shoulders and helmets might sell, too. Iron belt buckles are required for some tailoring recipes; they're hit-or-miss, either super expensive on the AH or being sold at-cost.
---
Depending on the prices, you could make some money disenchanting your items and selling the dusts and essences.
---
What are the better methods if you'd be so kind?
---
You can also make a separate lfg tab then pop that out and have two tabs up. One for lfg and the normal one only for whispers guildchat etc.

Then you just minimize the lfg tab when you don't need it.

---
Of course they are, they are the healer!
---
&gt;Thatd be like a mage and a warlock being in a party and the mage is mad that the warlock is rolling on the same gear as him. 
---
Its nothing at all like that. Mage's and warlocks compete for gear, tanks shouldn't be competing with healers for gear.
---
Ive seen some recommendations to level up as dagger rogue. Its not meta but it should be fun. Thank you for your answer

With the Detail addon(it's like recount where it keeps track of dmg/healing/dmg taken etc), if you inspect someone else with the addon as well, it will show their spec on the right side of the character sheet.

It was a feature maintained by Blizzard on the official WoW website. Discontinued in or near TBC much to our chagrin.   Had some other stats I can't recall.
---
This is one reason I actually rolled on the RP-PVP server. There is almost no RP, but there is only one RP-PVP server and I feel like that alone makes it more "stable" with regards to playerbase, people will always want to play on the only one of a kind server type. 
---
I do wonder how many of the people complaining there are no alliance to kill are the ones who spend an hour corpse griefing one alliance player.
---
I do have a rogue so i might give it a try. Thank you for your answer
---
Honestly? shadow priest.   
---
Elemental shaman would be my next bet, but both are pretty painful to level. Elemental also has the problem that if anything is immune to nature damage you're just going to have to skip that quest. It's not a super common immunity, but it does happen, and unlike mages you can't just switch to a different school.

They're a 1-in-1000 drop rate, which makes them rareish, but they're farmable with a bit of dedication. Depends on your server economy and how much someone wants one. Somewhere around 20 to 50g, maybe 100g if someone is really wanting it and there aren't any on the AH at all.
---
I think they're shoulders, he's probably a Druid too

I was pretty sad when I realized we don't have misdirection and that disengage is just a melee aggro decrease rather then a backwards jumping spell

Is.. Is this targeting me? I bought skullflame shield, stockade pauldrons, grand morrison medallion. I spent atleast 600-700 gold on tank items and then the guild forces me to go fury with 3 days to get gear. They wont get to force me all the way tho. Im going fury/prot, I dont care if my dps is abit lower, it was still one of the highest and my gear was shite. Im going to find the best of both worlds with both defense and hit/crit. I wont be fooled like this
---
Molti did ya play on feenix Qiraji by chance?
---
huh....i guess you're right
---
He is also a healer. Anyone with half a brain knows that a druid is going to be healing in raids and that's what everyone is gearing up for. Just like how if a warrior is forced to tank in a raid, he will usually get priority for his dps pieces even tho he's not in there as a dps warrior.
---
I can't say anything about the moonkin hurricane but the hurricane cast by storm elementals works like a debuff thats apllied as long as you stand in the area, so multiple hurricanes don't do anything

Rogues and hunters also have threat dump abilities. I regularly get 1st on multiple bosses in mc as well.

so, back to BRD and pickpocket it is then.. #FML

thanks for the repply though =)

Priest is always going to be in higher demand than druid. Druids aren't bad, but you really only want 1 or 2 of them per raid. Also, a lot of people will turn down druid healers in 5-mans because their only rez is a 30 min CD, which can mean a lot of running. Back in vanilla I kept a lot of elemental shaman and shadow priests on my friends list for that reason.
---
I really WANT to enjoy warrior because of the absolute lack of tanks will make dungeon grindign easier, however its so painful to level it's like pissing razorblades
---
Oh this is great - is there a Halloween event? This is the stuff that makes me feel warm and happy inside.
---
Lmao ur talking like i  am forcing people to comment. People are coming here just writing bad no explanation, that doesnt help anybody now does it? I would have been a dipshit if i took this built blindly when i hit 60. I just want to learn gamemechanics. And what’s the thing with all this retail for children talk lmao. If i can clear clasic dungeons underleveled is ut really hard? Haha
---
I had a good laugh when i saw Darnassus for the first time as an alliance. It was probably made with visuals in mind first and UX last.  You have an entire wing of the city devoted to identical huts all featuring a single weapon vendor. Like, mace guy is neighbors with bow guy and across the way is shield guy..
---
If you know the ins and outs of threat, it's never your fault for not holding threat. I feel like people new to tanks don't understand you won't be able to hold aggro on 100% of the mobs 100% of the time. Mages have survivability talents, if they pull aggro and chose not to use them - it's their fault they're dead - not yours.
---
or go for Blasted lands and kill one of the Servant of X.
---
Getting rid of aggro is not a good gameplay solution to fixing aggro.
---
Meh.  It's pretty obvious most of the playerbase does not consider faction imbalance to be a problem.  Cross realm BGs will mitigate any downside.
---
Why is 12.5 healing better than 5 int? In raw numbers 5 int is half a rank5 heal with the discount talents and the spirit is good for your disc combat regen talent. Scepter is better imo.
---
I can’t there is horde.
---
- can’t you kill them?
---
I can if you guys get here
---
- then summon
---
Horde
---
- can’t you get away and summon from afar?
---
I’ve had conversations like this more times than I care to think about. Some lazy and inconsiderate see a lock in the party and they assume they will get a summon, they don’t even ask.
---
Pro tip: be polite, communicate. If you need or just want a summon be upfront about it. Never ever stay put and just assume it’s the lock’s job to summon you.
---
Pro tip for locks: when dealing with an entitled douche you have several options, and always be polite: 1) no shards sorry, 2) summoning addon broke down on me, need to redo my whole interface 3) a plain and simple “no, just walk like everybody else”
---
Well that comment made no sense.
---
Strafe on Q E. You do not need the backwards movement, ever and you can hold both mouse buttons to move forward. It's typical for good pvpers to play this way.
---
Every level, it gets a bit better. The first 20 levels suck. The better your gear and the more consumables you have, the easier it gets. You should be using a 1hander and shield until around level 15, where 2handers start to outpace 1handers.
---
There are huge power spikes at 30 (whirlwind axe, berserker stance, whirlwind\[the spell\]) and 40 (mortal strike/bloodthirst, plate armor). Before that, it can all feel pretty same-y with spamming sunder and waiting for overpower.
---
Pretty sure the locations in that addon are based on server to server gathering. Wherein, when other aquire a gather from a location, that gets placed into the DB. So you're seeing where they may spawn. As others have collected from that location.
---
Sooo about 10 to 12 very specific and farmed buffs?
---
Offer faction specific transfers only?
---
That's when having a list of good tanks you've played with in the past really shines. Most of my "friends list" consists of tanks I can whisper in a pinch, and it often works. Other people in the group might have similar lists of contacts, so it's always worth asking the group to check.
---
Failing that, you just have to try to promote your run in a way that makes it sound better than the others. If you have a lock, say you can summon. If people are geared, say it's a geared group. Little details like that can make all the difference.
---
Granted, there's no silver bullet for immediately getting a tank, but it's still better the alternative, which is being one of 50 healers all fighting for a single coveted healing spot in a group. I've wasted many hours trying that, but always make my own groups now.
---
I believe it shows you all the Spawn locations of the herbs, bit the herbs themselves.
---
I think it only registers where you picked them. So that for a next time you could look there for herbs. Its not live I guess.
---
I'm on 40+ runs with no drop
---
There's options that are gentle and subtle enough that they won't shock any communities or result in other servers tipping over.
---
For example:
---
- Until it reaches parity, Herod horde experiences light queues even when the server has ample room and they can freely transfer to any alliance-heavy server.
---
- Until it reaches parity, Herod alliance never experience queues even when the server is otherwise full and Alliance are free to transfer there from any server
---
Sure, these solutions won't result in immediate fixes for faction imbalance---But heavy handed quick-fixes are exactly why the issue became as bad as it did as quickly as it did.
---
Is there a way to make elemental shaman work in PvE or should I stick to resto? I kinda dig elemental shamans play style.
---
&gt; You’re also the de facto “leader” and should be marking mobs, organizing pull strategy, and leading the party through these labyrinth dungeon layouts 
---
This speaks to me. These additional tasks are daunting for someone (myself) who's learning and want to do a decent job tanking - in theory, mainly focusing on taking damage and keep everyone alive. Now to also be expected to know which mob needs to die first and mark skull? Which to mark for CC? Charging for rage or pulling for LoS? Are there no adds by the corner I might accidentally pull? Is this the right path...*damnit, rogue! Wait for me to initiate!* 
---
I've been fortunate to have played with helpful groups but the job itself can be insane.
---
I'm someone who didn't have the money before and played on private servers.
---
I wanted to experience WoW again and going official is the best way to enjoy it now that all the discovering factor has been already consumed before.
---
I won't repeat OP's arguments because they're all true, but one thing I want to point out :
---
Reason why I decided to bite into the Classic bait was because of all those great stories about how it reignites the social bonds players had back in the days that were lacking in the later iterations. Tales about how you'd group with people with ease, really play with others and this has been true. Like my first 30 levels in Alliance territories have been nothing but a blast. People to group with everywhere, I wasn't seeing the time pass by.
---
Then came the level 30+ and it became a whole different ball game. Every f\*\*\*ing quest related spot, everywhere there is a mob, there are horde people. And no alliance to find around. The social part of the game is dead for me and beats strong on the other faction.
---
When I'm lucky, they ignore me and let with do my stuff. If I'm very lucky they can even share the spots.
---
I see no purpose, I don't even realy want to fight, this got way too dumb. I am having 0 fun killing a horde because I know how it feels. Besides, the few times I fought back, it felt empty. I killed a guy and then rightfully so got camped by the near horde players. I just lost time, time I could have used to get out of this f\*\*\*ing place to move to an hopefully better questing zone.
---
I sound like a loser and you can tell me that I could have chose a PvE server. It's true, but I don't want to give up either. At this point I'm just waiting to get to the level 60, get into BG with 9 other players and fight fair. I want them to shit their pants when they see my name the same way I've been shitting mine for 12 level so far. Stay strong alliance players, there will be more pride to be taken from every win we got against all odds.
---
Why don't you just ask for help? That's what this community does. Instead of crying to reddit where there are even worse assholes to make you cry.
---
Oh, great... the bag slot eating seasonal shit starts already. It peaks around christmas. "Why is half my bank fillled with christmas crap???"
---
wait why do horde druids have better luck finding groups in the meta? Are paladin healers just too stronku?
---
Horde hunter on kromkrush. Never really had an issue soloing devilsaurs. Been farming then for a while. I've only been ganked while killing one a few times
---
I mostly play with my wife and a friend as a group of three. The friend is a warlock and my wife has a warlock alt. They both have the same voidwalker, and when we were questing in redridge we met another warlock with the exact same voidwalker. "Klathnak"
---
it's already way closer to r/wow than people would like to admit.
---
Otherway around for me 5 priest drops :(
---
I am experiencing a class dilemma again.
---
At launch I started playing on Zandalar-tribe, alliance. Played a rogue until lv.24 and by that point all friends moved to retail except one. We were intrigued by playing Horde as we were both new to WoW and rolled Horde on Razorsedge. I spent 2d playtime leveling my undead warrior to 30 and yesterday that friend told me that he really wants to play his paladin on ZT because he liked that class the most. I really enjoy playing with him as we are really good friends, so I am moving back to ZT.
---
I can't decide between rogue, druid and warrior.
---
I liked warrior because it played as a close range class with a lot of buttons to press (I like action games), cool gear to collect and I could do dps and tanking. However, as my friend plays pally we have gear competition and I kept seeing that warrior require a lot of time and money at lv60 and I will play the game casually (+- 12h per week)
---
I also liked my rogue, I like the whole stealth mechanic and   the amount of buttons I press per second to create combos. I also like the aesthetic of rogues a lot and it has gear collecting, but to a lesser extent than warrior. What makes me doubt about rogue, is that I can only fill a dps role and there is not much variation within the class spec wise. (Maybe I am wrong about this?)
---
So that's why I am also considering Druid. As far as I have heard they play really rotation/button/combo heavy with shapeshifting etc. With Druid I can do dps and tank, maybe even heal but idk if I like that role. However, I really like collecting dope gear and looking sweet but as a druid you are almost always in a animal form and the druid specific gear looks kinda meh.
---
So my question is really, what would be the best class to play for me? Warrior has 2 roles, fits my playstyle but might be too hardcore. Rogue fits my playstyle and I love stealth but it has only dps and no really variation between builds as far as I know. Or a Druid, which allows me to do everything but I look dumb AF.
---
I am leaning towards Rogue&gt;Druid&gt;Warrior depending on if my assumption about not much gameplay style variation within rogue builds being incorrect.
---
WTF man fucking bow whats wrong with you
---
You wont run 10 gnomeregans, outside of quests and the sword there aint much you want and dungeon runs are obnoxious and long.
---
You guys really need to think a bit about your "bis lists" before taking them for granted.
---
PCB was bis before DM, the Satyr bow has the same stat the Xbow from LBRS does (3agi +1hit). If Satyr was bis, the xbow would have been BiS before. It's using an old database and compares it with previous stats of Satyr's (7agi 1hit).
---
PCB is still better.
---
I decided to go with your advice - not the ergonomic stuff, I've had RSI long enough to know of treatment plans - the hunter seems like a good pick for me because it feels like my rogue but at range, the downtime between clicking has helped a lot. Thank you for your response.
---
So many patronizing people on this sub.
---
Biggles is almost even dude
---
No truestrike? Pfff.....;-D
---
I have only ever competed with buffed to the max warriors and rogues with full consumables before classic. It is the only way I know. Are you not going to use consumables to compete? What else you got man?
---
You're a bad man!
---
Seems to be east. Definitely the easiest to do so you can 2-4 man it, plus thorium veins+herbs give decent income, and lashers if you have aoe. You could be doing 5 runs an hour with ease. East has 4 dusty tome spawns but one is far out of the way.
---
50+ still haven't seen it.
---
I believe the 16-slot pumpkin bag replaces the drop of traveler's backpacks during this event.
---
I imagine they will merge some of the dead servers at some point.
---
Shadowform yes, shadow weaving no iirc.
---
This is trash compared to some full UI’s you can download.
---
And like screenshot?
---
Twin spiderman meme moment
---
Then why even say that witchblade is reserved?
---
Yet i do appear here... spooky isnt it ?
---
Other online games have similar requirements in terms of servers, admin etc... and yet do not charge for a subscription.. im sure a company as big and successful as Blizzard could easy cover those costs without blinking an eye...
---
Im not having a go at them... but after watching friends play, look at reviews yada yada yada, I dont see why they charge a subscription for wow and not starcraft, warcraft etc.
---
I will generally move, but a couple of times when I've been going to Strat or whatever, I've seen 3 people in or close to EPL (e.g. flying through Wetlands / Hinterlands) I will ask for a summon.
---
No point in moving if I'm not gonna be the first 3 there with a warlock in the party.
---
Did you find an energy ticker?
---
True men of culture.
---
It ain't much, but its honest work.
---
The addon shows you where you picked a flower or mined some ore. It does NOT show you if it is there or not for you to get again
---
I got tired of being camped every day unless I played at 3am on Herod.
---
I wouldn't trust wand tooltip, it claims to be boosted by spell damage for some reason (though it's a good way to see your spell dmg).
---
It's pretty cool that you can just shit on the mods but then add an /s so they don't know you actually mean it.
---
True, but P2 later on will not include any BG's. Which is kinda sad.  
---
BG's are scheduled for P3 if i recall correctly. And that's like.. months away.
---
Strange move Blizz. Expected at least one BG. Even the Beta had BG's.
---
I’m not even into RP but I ended up on grobbulus. It’s honestly just a PvP realm to me.
---
Every map has a bunch of potential spawn locations for nodes. Important word there; "Potential".  
---
Every map also has a limit to how many nodes can spawn at any one given time. They will randomly at some of the "potential" spawn locations.  
---
When you gather a node with Gathermate2, it will track that location and add it to your local database of spawn locations, so the next time you're gathering you can go to those and see IF nodes have respawned there.  
---
It's purpose is to stop you blindly running around maps hoping to see a node appear.   
---
Instead, you can map out a route that crosses all/most of the "potential" spawns in hopes of finding ACTUAL spawns.  
---
Hope that helps clear it up.
---
You made the mistake of just needing one thing. The game knows. If you are after a certain item, the game moves it's the drop % a decimal left.
---
Do not go in there or anywhere with the idea "I will get this item this run", it wont happen. The game knows. I went to strat living few weeks ago just to get a orb, 4 dropped, i didnt get any - but did get archivists cloak of healing.
---
Absolute legend mate was desperate for something like this!
---
Nope definitely lockpicked.
---
Using addons to show durations, but not telling which on a topic like this is a waste of other people's time. Give us the relevant informations which addons you use for your interface, so we are able to help you...
---
Awesome!
---
You open free migration to higher populated faction, ie if there are fewer alliance players, open it up to horde only.
---
Right now it is open to both, so alliance quits because it is not fun to play and worsens the problem even further.
---
Mine had a dropdown menu where I could either install WoW (the preset option) or change it to WoW Classic. I managed to miss this the first time and downloaded retail, which is 10's of GBs. Classic is much, much smaller and quicker to install.
---
this full UIs are trash. i wanted what made the game enjoyable for me you keyboard warrior.
---
Not sure, have you tried the obvious /wave [@mouseover]?
---
I think most people actually think in terms of tanking, troll is best because of the large value you can get from 'zerking as a tank
---
fuck swipe its shit dps, maul all day
---
The face you make when you see poop bigger than you
---
Try using the unkillable mob in SFK
---
It’s not a bug at all. We’ve always been able to toggle cleave and HS.
---
excuse me! We are very intelligible! It's just nobody is smart enough to understand us.
---
Don't think it works anymore.
---
undead are easy to counter, bait wotf with seduce or fear, then neutralize it with death coil. well, i guess it's a pain before lvl 42 tho...
---
Yeah I feel you man. I’d pay for s transfer too. What I think they will do is merge some realms though, that will help and I think they’ve done it before.
---
Oh stfu crybaby
---
Why are you still replying to this thread? Grow up.
---
I had a couple of tough pugs in Deadmines with my warrior, so i figured maybe it is easier with a bear tank, fewer abilities to keep track of and so on. So my bear alt is now level 12 :)
---
I **really** like this.
---
I don't want a dungeon finder system because it's way too automated and impersonal, but being able to get a neater view of ads is great. This is a perfect example of how a lighter touch quality of life change in the interface rather than a big new thing like the dungeon finder can really make a difference without detracting from the experience.
---
It's ok if other people get aggro.
---
Fury warriors aren't supposed to keep 100% threat on every mob anyways. Just demo shout and sunder shit and 99% of the time it's gonna be good enough.
---
Yeah sure...
---
https://imgur.com/a/RvY16kq
---
and its 11AM
---
Bro I prefaced my first comment with "after waiting for 10 seconds". You just picking a fight for no reason, if cleaving is no problem for you then why are you offended? Shit tanks exists and are just as much a problem as shit dps. Tanks should be building aggro on all targets in a pull, not just the skull marker. The tanks main job is making sure the dps players can do as much dmg as possible, the better the tank, the more damage the other players can dish out=faster dungeons=happier groups.
---
Arena, Angerforge General up to Grim Guzzler / Vault till 55.
---
I leveled my druid to 40 as a healer. Then had to respec and regear to tank because sometimes you just can't find tanks, or people dont want druid healers since their rez is once every 30 mins. I could spend hours in the morning trying to find a group because I was a druid healer. So I respecced to the most needed roll in the game and you better believe that when I get to the dungeons that drop my top 5 healing gear for raids, I will absolutely be rolling on it. Just like how every single other person I play with in brd who rolls on their other specs gear. I dont get how this is so controversial when everyone does it already.
---
I think it's because there are so many new prebis items compared to other classes.
---
Your fights are on warcraftlogs.
---
Well then it seems OP should read the release timetable and adjust their expectations because the whole point of this thread is them expecting something of a phase which isn't even out, and they mistakenly expected it to cater for them when it was never going to do that in the first place.
---
My retail warlock main's imp name was Kuptal. On the first night of Classic, I saw a fellow undead warlock with an imp named Kuptal. He ended up on my ignore list for general chat arguing by the time I went to sleep that night, however. I haven't seen him since the starting area, however.
---
Indeed, we have these amazing feelings when we have our damage visibly increase, it is really great ^^
---
When WDPS starts to scale in later tiers and better raids, Ferals will fall much further. We only have Pummeler to keep us competitive besides some alright statsticks.
---

I find grinding really relaxing
---
do we know if they gonna remove layering at some point?
---
RFD, my bad.
---
the sub would become empty if they removed these pointless, upvote seeker posts, you can't really see anything else
---
What add-on did you get if you don't mind
---
Theres a spawn location in East on the bottom by an elite lasher, but its stealth-able and room to pop out of stealth to loot it when careful.
---
It's just to the left of where it says "Old Ironbark"
---
Its 11AM and there are more than twice as many layered realms as non layered realms
---
I thought it was a silhouette winking
---
You missed a trick by not throwing Kyuss and Monster Magnet in that rotation, bud. Give it a whirl.
---
I have found dungeons to be a pretty decent source of income as a prot warrior even if you aren't reserving anything.  Just can't die.  Sell a few grays/greens/blues are get ~10-30gp a run usually or if you get lucky and get orbs or something else that sells nice even more.  Currently just sitting on a bunch of money while I slowly farm arcane crystals for my engineering shield which will probably empty my pockets.
---
For MC most bosses will die before you've used all of gem, evo, other on use like archmage and then you have mana pot if really needed.
---
Lok'Tar friend. 
---
Always horde (except for a few hours on sundays where I play alliance with some friends and /spit on passerbyes)
---
That said, as a druid pally buffs, fear ward, and infinite mana heal bots would be very nice. Alliance druids definitely have an easier life
---
Why not do dungeons as tank if you can? Healers are quite common as far as I can tell, but tanks are rare enough that I can get paid for doing a dungeon, and still roll on loot that I need outside of tanking. The LFG channels are spamming for tanks constantly, so if the group dont agree on him tanking for heal loot, there's probably 2-4 groups next in line to invite someone to tank for their group.
---
Odd question, but here goes.
---
Ret pala. Judge of Command does more damage to stunned or incapped targets. 
---
If I use HoJ and JoC macro’d to the same global, is the judgment hitting a stunned target and getting the damage increase or is it landing before the HoJ registers on the target cause they are on the same global. 
---
Messing with my mind. I need coffee also.
---
Yeah my server was overloaded once they removed layering. Rip getting any quests done in an efficient manner.
---
And thats what i ways just pointing out. Hes doing great, GJ. But it seems he took offence on that i mentioned it.
---
Ganking people questing is even more enjoyable.
---
I’m also playing alliance on Noggenfogger and the only think holding me back from transferring is the total player count on these realms...
---
Only on mondays.
---
No it's a website called itemization.info
---
In one dimension: peace and quiet.
---
The other dimension: OH SHIT OH FUCK OH SHIT OH FUCK!
---
If your pet is dying all the time in dungeons, screech works :). That's one of the reasons I dropt my owl
---
How are solo DM North Tribute runs going for everyone? How difficult are they and do they seem worth it?
---
Was this at the hyperspawn in westfall? With a full party you can be making over 12k exp per hour per character quite easily. And a decent chunk of gold!
---
It's especially funny given that he argued that "Top guilds barely even care about mitigation in their tanks, it's all about threat generation so DPS can open up." as that's exactly what Bears excel at and what makes them both distinct from and superior to warriors.
---
Their mitigation isn't as superb as Warriors but their standard kit generates so much more threat in both ST and MT it's unreal.
---
Then you add on MCPs and it just becomes disgusting how much better Druids are at ensuring the DPS can go crazy.
---
\*Clever use of game mechanics intensifies\*
---
The logic is that in a theoretically ideal raid, you'd bring no warlocks, one hunter, one druid, one priest, no rogues (unless BWL where you can bring 1 or 2), and then mix the rest from shaman/paladins, warriors, and magi.
---
Luckily, no one is dumb enough to attempt this 'ideal' raid, so we bring all classes for loot diversity and utility.
---
If you state your intentions before the group starts there's nothing to get mad about.
---
Do daggers play very different compared to swords? Or are they very similar?
---
A mace build (with ironfoe for example) is not really a thing right?
---
That's what I'm telling myself. Kinda regret going pve coz I realised recently I'm probably not going to raid very much but hey Ill still have battlegrounds
---
Spot on. Though I'd like to add that humans as inherently selfish creatures only ever act out of selfish reasons. The only difference between this guy and the real good samaritan is that the latter acquires the satisfaction he craves without further need of recognition.
---
Because people in a well populated server dont want to trasnfer to empty servers
---
(Arms) Warrior :
---
Go finish yesterdays quests / fishing / mining...  while looking lfm chat waiting for an announce for a group that needs a last tank a tank for a donjon I want to do (usually around 10 minutes) 
---
Do the donjon.
---
Repair and make room in my bags
---
Repeat
---
Manage inventory, bank inventory, bank alt, cook
---
Log off
---
That's definitely Blasted Lands!
---
Just remove battlegroups, you want to play other faction that's 70/30? That's fine but enjoy your hour long bg queue.
---
I think I might be on the only server/faction that doesn't have a huge shortage of warriors (Skeram Horde).  I don't think I have ever had whispers for group and only on really off-hours will I see a group spamming LFG for 10-15 minutes for a tank.
---
Nope my dude, just ask if they Are ok with it
---
Benediction represent! Can confirm never had a queue but pop is almost always high except in the mornings. Good horde Alli balance too afaik
---
Can a warlock make decent profits by hanging around and selling summons?
---
Well I guess this is one of those situations where repeatedly searching beforehand and trusting what people say doesn't work out at all.  What's the rep dropoff for the higher level quests for Org I can still do?
---
I was healing a dungeon once and the Mage gave me food. I mean, thanks anyway but I don't even carry food when I go questing
---
Take longer breaks, only lvl on rested xp.
---
mace build would probably be okay for pvp (because of the stuns you can get from the mace specialization talent), but not great for pve. it won't do any extra damage for you
---
with daggers, the biggest difference is that you'll be primarily using backstab and ambush in dungeons and raids (and pvp) instead of using sinister strike.
---
How would you know its the most balanced LOOL
---
the jump would make hunters GG imo.
---
Don't be boring.
---
They aren't hard at all, just learning the path sucks and skilling the melee weapon up to 300, too
---
Queues only for one faction. Offer free transfers for that faction to another server where there isn't a queue for them. Some of these servers are 30/70 Ally/horde and Ally still have to wait in a queue.
---
I'm a pocket healer and I'm damn proud of it.
---
I know the feeling man. As a Resto Shammy I've been running Scholo since forever and those shoulders from Jandice just won't drop for me (I really hate that room by now)...
---
I'm also on 7ish runs of Strat UD without Ramstein's neck nor Baron's robes so it's not looking good for that one too.
---
Good thing is that both dungeons are quite good for moneymaking.
---
I think there’s things they could do, I agree.
---
What if they added an XP buff/debuff when servers reached a certain threshold?
---
Ex:   55-45 horde.  Alliance players receive a 50% rested xp buff,  horde gets a 50% debuff.  This would encourage alliance players to stay, create alts, and be active on the server.  Horde might look to create a new class on a different server where they can level faster.
---
If it’s worse, say 60-40 and beyond, 100% rested bonus to the weak faction  and zero to the dominant faction.  They could also just use a flat % buff/debuff, say 5 or 10% etc.  Playere rolling alts or new characters on imbalanced servers would get some sort of warning: “this server is currently significantly imbalanced, and xp buffs and debuffs are in effect.  Leveling characters for alliance will be significantly faster, and leveling characters for horde will take significantly longer.”
---
Just a thought.
---
Some people are lvl 60 with their tier sets you know? People are not gonna delete that just to balance factions by 0.000001%
---
Damn he got you good
---
Can anyone explain what tribute runs are? I see it mentioned a lot and don't know what the deal with it. I only hit max level in TBC back in the day so never got to experience this
---
Yeah I had to go darnassus at level 1 and doing all 246 quests left me at 5.5k/21k in revered. Had to do 300 stacks of cloth after, *and* I'm human
---
I don’t know who you’ve asked, but a quick google search will show you that this is exactly how the rep grinds worked in vanilla and on pservers
---
Doing 1200dps during a 30sec fight isn't nearly comparable to what the C'Thun fight looks like...
---
They have almost 100% uptime on Death Wish and 50% on Recklessness, of course they're gonna do 1200dps.
---
C'thun is a long fight with downtimes and immunes and timings.
---
Realistically, people are doing around 400-500 dps right now. Which is still a LOT more than we were doing in MC (because of optimization and the fact that we're playing on 1.12), but it's not "Fully Naxx geared" DPS.
---
I just started a Mage recently and only hit 15 so far but was noticing how I have to drink SO much. I was hoping it was better at later levels but I guess not. 
---
No wonder they gave us our own food and water.
---
I'm on the opposite end - lost a 99 roll to 100. Damn Mage I was in ST with won all 3 pieces of caster gear that dropped. Everytime he apologised and said he was sorry and felt bad.
---
I wasn't expecting him to pass something he needed at all but don't give me that shit after every roll.
---
Yeah my warrior took like 18 days played to hit 60 it was a fucking nightmare. I made a mage bank alt and leveled so fast to 10 I’m like there’s no way it’s that much easier so I kept playing it and it took me less than 5 actual days to hit 60. I probably spent 5 days played on my warrior in SM from 30-43.
---
I would agree with Toast that it is server dependent.  I personally like having hunters (Horde Skeram).  They do good dmg and I usually don't have to worry about them pulling agro.
---
Thinking of transferring to earthshaker... how is the realm now? Is it active?
---
Because a cat druid flexing to tank with agi/str gear and no threat talent will go wonderfully 😶
---
Also wtf is with everyone flying to feathermoon on alliance side? By the time your flight finishes I'd already be in DM after riding from Thalanaar, and you still need to swim/wait for the boat.
---
His voice
---
If you didnt do ALL starting zone quests before lvl 20 ish, you get severe cut to rep.
---
Bruh, this is how the addon is intended to work. It shows the spawn location of where herbs are, but not every location can have an herb all at once, they jump around the map. If it's on your map and not there to collect, then it just means there wasn't one spawned there at the time, but was previously. Go to the next one, and check. It doesn't show you live herbs, just where they POTENTIALLY can be, helps cut down the time you spend running from place to place where ones don't even spawn. Thats how the addon was intended.
---
Good luck finding rogues that don’t want to Gann each other.
---
First aid 100% yes for any class. Cooking is optional but worth it imo for buff food
---
I said you were pushing good numbers.
---
Really? I'm on EU and think i've only ever seen less then 3 servers at Medium pop in the evening which still wouldn't be classed as "dead" haha.
---
What server were you on? Whats the server balance there
---
So just I have hit lvl 42, using a green gun that dropped in Uldaman. Any upcoming quest lines or dungeons I should be doing to get a better bow/gun?
---
Also still using the 2h axe from RFK, any quest lines give a decent stat stick or Raptor strike nuke?
---
Not anymore managed to run it using lutris. But thanks!
---
Such wildly different experiences.  I have maybe had 5 whispers at 60 about tanking dungeons in the last ~5 weeks or so.
---
Oh man, was this Grobbulus realm by chance?
---
I paid 10g + mats and only because he asked 10g first, I was gonna give him 20g :D
---
Sounds like gehennas. Cant get a group anywhere on alliance there just aren't enough tanks.
---
Also 50 horde at every instance entrance looking for PvP. I'm sure even they would prefer a proper fight rather than the 20vs1 they're limited too.
---
Gnomish engineers get that too, though with 4h cooldown Goblins get faster access to duke hydraxis.
---
Faction specific queues, personally. Seems like the most organic solution to incentivize switching servers.
---
Cleave is an axe coming down and not a parrot
---
So you are walking animated corpse? Urgh, I guess.
---
this 100%. buying a krol blade was the best decision i ever did on my rogue.
---
I to dont know what tribute means! Anyone that can explain?
---
You need destruction talents if you wanna beat people on dmg-meters in dungeons (i assume you're still leveling).
---
This is a decent dps spec from lvl 41 and up: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/3500200512201--50500001
---
It basically plays exactly like SM/Ruin but for lvl 41+. It's also really good in lowbie PvP because of the burst: 1.5 sec immolate, corruption, curse, siphon life, shadowburn, nightfall procs. There arent many in that lvling range who can withstand that kind of dmg. 
---
Cons: You're a glass cannon but you still have 1 voidwalker sacrifice if you're leveling with that pet.
---
That isn't true I'm a holy/Disc priest and I kill stuff quick enough in Un'Goro. Worst part is I have to drink after every 2 kills.
---
We don’t have the exact number and You we’re talking about spreading misinformation? :/
---
ive played horde since the very first time i logged into the game back in vanilla, never changed. I will try an alliance alt for the first time tho :D
---
Doesn’t matter if it’s only one, it should still be consistent don’t you think?
---
You bet your ass I am.
---
I think it’s a good pickup if you’re stressing on the dal rends. The sword smacks.
---
People roll undead rogue for a lot of obvious reasons.
---
But you honestly can't go wrong with Orc either. Rogues hardly have a race you wouldn't want to be for some reason.
---
NE and Troll are probably at the bottom of the list but they both have the highest base Agi on their faction, Trolls get berserking and NEs get improved stealth.
---
You do miss out on capitalizing on axe specialization but there's so much more going on than that but rogues are the class that needs weapon skill the least thanks to Weapon Expertise.
---
That said, at your level you can basically reroll on a whim. If you're gonna, now's the time.
---
IMO Orc and Dwarf rogues are the ballerest anti-rogues for their faction. Fuck up those other rogues with impunity.
---
That rule I apply only in dungen groups. Out in The wild it's survival of the fittest for veins and herbs. Don't get me wrong though, if you kill mobs for veins/chest/skinning the aformentioned thing is all yours.
---
You could have picked female orc, they fit better fpr rogue in my opinion.
---
Don’t do it!
---
On paper that sounds like a good plan.  In practice it doesn't work for me.  While they do not want to spend 2 hours looking for a new group I don't exactly want to spend 15-30mins finding a new dps and waiting for them to make their way to the dungeon we are doing. 
---
And on top of that chances are decent that the next dps we find will do just as bad or worse.
---
Reroll
---
Cant ride a wolf as Tauren. You'll kill the poor thing
---
false,
---
tauren can ride kodos and wolfs, 
---
but for wolf riding they need og rep
---
Do you know of any good classic arms warrior I should look into? I heard about Kungen, is he good?
---
Do you do anything besides play and sleep?
---
At level 17... Yeah, reroll and be glad you thought of it this early :D
---
Quest bow from Mauradon is awesome. It takes 20 mins, If u can get help from 2-3 55+ guildfriends :)
---
I guess. I never have those issues though. Most of the time it's looking for 1-3 dps. Just having people whisper me fills up group pretty fast. :)
---
Damn it I lol'd work, good stuff
---
Hell no...not suffering through that again.
---
Did it on my first time to be an end-game raid tank and never ever doing it again.
---
That's what happens when you roll a rogue
---
Thanks for the map!
---
Bingo
---
orc is superior due to their racials 
---
25% chance to resist stuns is huge in PvP and Blood Fury is amazing for both PvE and PvP and will definitely net you some extra damage. 
---
The only upside to undead rogue is the ability to break fears, charms and sleeps with Will of the Forsaken. Pretty awesome for PvP but that’s it.
---
Honestly tho if you can’t stand to watch your orc rogue then just reroll.. but in terms of better racials, orc definitely wins
---
I tried this but i felt that it was impossible with certain mobs. Do some mobs have higher run speed that make this pointless?
---
Why you laugh on him when he owned you ?
---
Im pretty sure more have died from fall dmg in the zeppelin to undercity
---
I'm at around 220 kills at the moment and got it a few days ago. The proc rate is decent but i use spellpower mace in raids instead :) just gotta keep farming!
---
Ok, please explain!
---
This for sure. Lots of people in BGs back then keyboard turned, clicked, had poorly thought out skill trees, were vastly undergeared, used no macros, etc. It didn't take much to kill the average player
---
Bite all the way. Growl on manual cast, always.
---
Any addons that alert you when a certain mob is nearby? Not just rare spawns..need that devilsaur leather for my set
---
Thanks! Lock sounds so powerful. Only thing I will miss is mobility. Everything else seems pretty awesome!
---
I feel mages are.
---
Is there even a high enough bridge to take dmg from with safe fall?
---
No it’s probably just dead. 
---
Class discords are your best best fit serious discussion.
---
I would like to add that in classic rogues cant use axes so that wont be a reason to roll orc. I agree with all other points you made.
---
Point taken, I've already edited the first post to highlight that the 10 minutes are not an official value but that there is some limit before allowing layerswitching after being engaged in PvP.
---
It is nice having a pet that can run up and growl, and me with distracting shot and disengage and aspect of the monkey. If anything gets aggro'd onto somewhere it shouldn't (e.g. the healer), I can probably take the heat off. It is definitely nice having those sorts of tools available as a hunter. It reminds me of when I played druid years ago where if something crazy happened I could pop out and heal or go bear and tank -- for a little while anyway.
---
Yea the database recorded a spawn there so you know where the spawn is but it might have been picked up by another player already.
---
Listen, I've known you since Classic launched. It's time to give me your account. Don't be a pussy. I rolled a class that can't farm so I'm entitled to your username and password. 
---
Don't be an idiot, dude. Best case scenario you get absolutely scammed and lose everything. Worst case, Blizzard ban you for account sharing.
---
&gt;Otherwise it's very scummy.
---
.......why?
---
Undead Priest for victory!
---
Started on sunday, now already lvl 21 (and I don't really play that much)
---
The amount of low-effort troll posts I've seen recently like this one. Like at least come up with a believable username. Yikes.
---
no,
---
p3 releases WS and AV
---
p4 is Arathi basin
---
Racials are good, but connecting with your character is more important. If you want to go undead, reroll now. Otherwise you’ll go every level regretting your decision.
---
Besides, it’s not like you won’t be able to kick ass as an Undead rogue.
---
Yeah like other said below you missed the mark man.  By dps I meant the actual people not so much how much damage they are doing.  Butt pulls, not interrupting, not caring about their threat, wanting to go ham the whole dungeon and then saying how the tank sucks for not being able to keep aggro.
---
Because you're very cringey, unfunny, and it's hard to watch past even 10 seconds.
---
This. I used Mara bow all the way to 60, fantastic weapon and so easy to get.
---
even in vanilla I've tanked it all as druid, no issues, just needs different tactics/setup than with a warrior MC.
---
This version in classic is much easier, since itemization and stats are already at the prepatch vanilla, minus the raids/PvP gear.
---
Hell Dire maul is out now too, every man and his bear will have an Unyeilding Maul
---
Little bit of both it's back and forth but the horde usually control the mountain.
---
I am lvling my shaman like this. flametongue or frost brand weapon scales off of this as well, and I do frequently throw lightning at stuff.
---
I never wait around LFG. Always be doing something and keep on your server’s lfg channel. Quest, farm, gather, pvp, organize, sell, craft. Keep moving. Eventually, the groups come.
---
70/30 ish
---
Yeah, it's also only a valid concern on the orc side of things, not the rogue side of things. If he's not gonna reroll a warrior it hardly matters.
---
Seen it 7 times in 10 runs ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Orc is the best rogue in PvP because you have a chance to resist stuns as part of your passive, and that is the most overpowered racial in the game for pvp. Pve the best race is troll because of berserk, and beastslayjng could prolly help you out. Neither the best pvp or pve race is undead. Unless you are a world first competitive player (which you clearly aren’t at level 17 this late in) then play what you think looks cool.
---
Grobbulus? Uber isn't one dude, it's a group of friends :)
---
It's probably the same, but I will never weep for Horde :)
---
Use common sense for a second
---
People are dumb. Horde that fly anywhere north of Badlands from STV are extra dumb. There's a zeppelin in Grom'Gol that goes to UC. You can wait for and miss that zeppelin 3 times, take the 4th zep, and still make it to UC faster than someone who took the flightpath there.
---
*Laughs in Stormwind and Ironforge*
---
Satyrs catch me everytome so i stopped tbh
---
Paladin tanks generate a ton of threat. If a rogue pulls threat - this rogue is retarded and/or wants to die.
---
Just shred, ferocious bite, and I think I used one claw.
---
There is no debate that orc is better than undead for pve and PvP. Wotf is nice but stun resist against multiple classes on ally side and additional dps increase cooldown. 
---
But the way your char looks and feels to you is vastly more important. You will be looking at your character for lengthy periods of times. You need to be happy with it :) 
---
Lvl 17 won't take you long either
---
&gt; I disagree that it is the best it is going to get though because I have seen/done it.
---
Every DPS with maybe exception of hunters will get huge upgrades in the future. And mostly, its the way they improve. Not to mention DPS numbers are massively affected by rest of the raid. Have a great dps in raid, you will have better CD uptime and boost your own dps a ton.
---
oh shut the fuck up will ya
---
People who do this are fucking disgusting pieces of trash. Cross-faction alliances should be a bannable offense.
---
Thanks for the great answer! :D I have a two questions:
---
To what degree is respeccing necessary for raid healing? I would'nt mind healing once a while for some gear as a druid but I really prefer a tanking/dps playstyle. 
---
And do you think that playing a rogue burns out/gets boring easily? That's the main thing I am afraid of because they only fit one role. I don't want to be hopping alts like I am now :p
---
I'm a first time wow player myself, no clue which quest this is ;) Do you have a wowhead link?
---
If you've completely run out of yellow/green quests (which again is mathematically impossible but ok), don't want to grind for an hour and in general don't like the idea of dungeons, then I don't know what to tell you. Wow might not be the game for you, idk. There's plenty of RPGs out there that are more streamlined, like retail wow.
---
There are dagger rogues that at least currently get close to combat in dungeons so I think it is not so bad as they say.
---
As a side note, my bro used to play sub rogue in vanilla and wouldn't give it up, but now in classic he is solid combat. But he is bored already.
---
Ah I see now the issue. Yeah the dungeon \*can\* be reset while the rest of the party stays on the spot despite what the system messages print to you. However to reach the new instance, the party members still need to run out but then can immediatly re-enter and are in the new one.
---
Running pre-40 sure is a pain. Skull of impeding doom and 8% run speed on boots helps a ton. And then free 60% mount :)
---
Innkeeper: Did you see a sign outside that said 'dead turtle storage'? No, cos storing dead turtles ain't my fuckin business!
---
Anything else in classic for this holiday event?
---
Maybe you just blacklisted the debuff or something like that
---
Dude week 2 was 1 month ago. You killed Rag 5 times.
---
I think I've seen BRE drop ONCE during Vanilla, and I think we did MC every week until Naxx released.
---
The first horde dungeon is a great starting point to learn tanking and gain some confidence. You can honestly just jump into that instance and you will be fine.
---
From there instances will have a slight learning curve to them in knowing the layout and the fights. You could sit back and just DPS once or twice and get the hang of it. Just pay attention on what is going on and don’t just mindlessly attack the skull target. Typically in every dungeon though, someone in your group will have an understanding o the instance. They can easily guide you on the strategy if they know what they’re doing. 
---
Keeping a good level gap will also be helpful. RFC, the first instance, could be done at level 10-11 if you wanted. But it will be much easier to tank at lvl 14-15 while still being within your range.
---
Uff, that hurts but i appreciate it :)
---
This conversation always end in people disagreeing and then claiming that their opinion represents the majority and that everyone else should abide by it.
---
Wouldn't touch TBC/WotLK with a 5-feet pole personally, their in-game world is smaller, there's flying and instead of multiple endgame threats you basically have only one big bad whereas in Classic you have more variation thematically. Sure those expansions have merits, but they're not for me. Let me have a classic server where to play with likeminded people for the next 10 years and I'm fine with whatever Classic+, TBC etc. shenanigans others do elsewhere.
---
Cataclysm
---
The grinding would be fine if there weren't 5 other people there grinding the same quest, taking hours to finish. If I'm lucky i can kill one mob every other minute, and i need to kill 50-100 to finish the quest.
---
I did try it, didn't like it. I like older WoW more.
---
You suck for doing this
---
Undead Rogues look really cool. I've played one since WoW's release; a lot of people aren't bringing up how useful Cannibalize is while leveling and even PvP once you get Blind and Vanish.
---
Will of the Forsaken is a great ability for PvP and some PvE encounters; if you end up with the trinket that breaks fears you can have two escapes from them.
---
I'd say to make an Undead, but keep the Orc as a bank alt in case you decide to keep the stun resist.
---
Damn it Uther! As your future king, I order you to purge this city!
---
Interested as well, but highly doubt it.
---
Seems to be completely stripped out of the client: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/what-addon-for-focus-replacement/285614/14

How to make gold with Engineering? I have 300 goblin engineering and I love making bombs for wpvp but not sure how to make gold with it. Any ideas?
---
lmahoo
---
Same here, if I woke up realizing I hate my faction or class that's just too bad it's who I am.
---
What makes you think they abuse layers?
---
You bounce between the two camps next to each other by the time you’ve nuked one, the other has respawned
---
I've been seeing that most people like to use Claw, but I'll try this combination out! Been having a hard time casting Growl efficiently while having Claw active.
---
If you are competing you are competing with shit rogues/warrs in a mediocre at best guild.
---
Go ahead and compare yourself to the 99th percentile of warriors on warcraftlogs.
---
I mean, your warriors are underperforming or what? Your doing roughly 69.5% of our top warrior dps at the end of September on those fights. (The last 40 man we did, doing split runs since then). 
---
Not trying to discourage you just saying.
---
For the casual player with only an hour or two a day (which most people are, don't let the loud minority of us no lifers deceive you) it takes 1-2 months to cap. I've experienced vanilla as both intense and casual. You're asking a lot, and you're kinda being a dick about it going by your other comments on the thread.
---
They weren't, sub counts were FAR higher than Classic is now and sharding/layering hadn't become a thing yet.
---
Does being a lower level increase the pull range of mobs?
---
Are you on Hydraxian Waterlords (RP)?
---
At least I've seen the gnome mage "Faucet" on there. :D
---
Too bad it's not a fully fledged city and just a tiny beach tribe thingy with nothing to offer :(
---
Sounds like bad rng or it’s bugged. If it’s bugged open a ticket Reddit can’t exactly help with it
---
Thought this guys was leveling at retail only
---
Lol this is such a toxic neckbeard ass mentality
---
How is Ashbringer doing? It seems quite populated but very quiet at times.
---
Moonkins are so smart that the +20% Intellect talent had to be moved to another talent tree
---
It's a male dwarf mage profile. Yes, dwarfs were able to be a mage in early stages of wow development
---
Yes. The higher level you are (in comparison with the mob), the less aggro range you have.
---
Gnome warrior for PVP
---
Claw is a focus dump ability so your pet will only bite once at the start of a fight if you have both.
---
It is stupid. Potions sure, but healthstones are a warlock spell. They aren't banning priest shields or hunter feign death.
---
i spent all day today running attunes in BRD for my guild, be a tank they said, you would be needed they said  
---
well turns out you are needed to do everyone else content
---
Right click your portrait, reset instances
---
It says (300 tailoring)
---
As a tank (prot warrior ofc) I would say my daily gameplay would go as such:  
---
Log in to find groups for the few last pre raid bis items I need aka the Deathbone Chestplate from Scholomance.
---
Find a group very quickly, usually a guild run too. While I am forming said group I proceed to be bombarded with random whispers from both strangers and friends asking if I would tank dungeon x or y, meanwhile guild chat also has people passive aggressively asking for a tank (with me most likely being 1 of 3 online).
---
I proceed to get my group to and through the dungeon with very little difficulty except for the occassional dps body pull. I also never get the chestplate, rip.
---
I'll pretty much rinse repeat unless its raid night in which case its just running through ony and mc in about 2 hours. I'm very much enjoying raiding and tanking feels much more of a fufilling role than on retail.
---
&gt; start skilling in the blade 
---
You don't. Melee weapon skill serves no purpose for a mage to my knowledge, if need be you should be wanding the mob to death, not meleeing it.
---
If you aren’t on a PVP Server any useable items probably won’t sell all too much until BGs come out. I’ve had mild luck with selling the “Green Lens” on the AH if you can get the mats for cheap.
---
Mages live the Firey/Frozen ones and Priests love the Shadowy/Healy ones
---
You get a low lvl buddy to jebait ppl so they get pvpflagged
---
SilverDragon. AFAIK you can do this
---
multibox bad
---
For raids, our consensus is that pure claw is best. Having two focus spenders is overkill, and you want to conserve as many points as possible to make ur pet actually survive raid encounters. Combine with dash, growl and prowl (mainly for dungeons, but ultimately something you want to drop long term).
---
Only low pop realms got combined...so this doesn't make any sense.
---
High pop realms are still higher population lol...
---
Damn you.. I had just convinced myself to level a warrior next to have a healer and a tank but now you made me want to play warlock again
---
Remains to be seen whether the factions across the servers are just as badly balanced.
---
Tell me more about these waffles.
---
Interesting, I'm only lvl 50 now, but I've had 3 or 4 items that would sell for more than 1g. Last level I earned about 30g which took me 9 hours, so thats 3g and a bit per hour. So I'm looking forward to the gold shower in a few levels.
---
They're much harder than mara runs imho. Also you need engineering for seaforium charges.
---
&gt;Glad you could bake it, Uther.
---
 Watch your tone with me, boy. You may be the waiter, but I'm still your superior as a chef.
---
Paladin! Alliance exclusive, magic options and very versatile still get that melee feel in combat as ret and better sustainability than war or rogue
---
When was classic launched again? Not even 2 months ago. 
---
Sure, if you were going to quit before phase 3 then stay on your side. If you were in for the long run, consider swapping. 
---
The situation will not get better.
---
3k is nothing, i would rather have a queue than beeing on a dead realm, like 99% of the players :D
---
Using Onyxia as an example where people literally autoattack because the only important thing on the fight is threat.
---
Asshat
---
Is this the Blair Witch Project? Dat filming tho
---
😂😂😂
---
Some? Anything besides hunters? Never seen it done by any other class.
---
How do you know about the server balance :)
---
Increases your attack speed by 30% or something.
---
You get three charges per weapon and you need to farm them in Gnomeregan.
---
I played on sylvanas EU (high) and I saw people from other realms, so that's just bs.
---
"why you killing everything, we dint need that pack of mobs" 
---
"Oh sorry, it's my ~~27th~~ first time here, just a little lost, that all"
---
It's slow especially if Observer decides to be a Priest, but otherwise everything seems mostly consistent.
---
I have no idea how to not get randomly Fire Blasted in the first pet pull, though. I'm currently using a speed trinket to get past that which seems to work, but I'd like to not have to rely on a 30min CD or a Swiftness Pot.
---
Your level in relation to the mob's level determines aggro range. Some mobs have larger aggro ranges than others. The size of your hitbox and the mob's hitbox change aggro range slightly as well; a tauren will aggro easier than a gnome.
---
How can you solo-tank Drakk? He has a hard aggro reset that lasts for 6 seconds, right?  
---
I've tried solo-tanking and he always, always conflagrates me and if there's no-one to pick up aggro, it's a wipe. I always either need another tank or a kiting class.
---
&gt;I heard about Kungen, is he good?
---
Debatable. He was mostly knows as a pve main tank, not a pvp player.
---
With herb dme seems good 
---
Then zf gy
---
Fuck so the API has been completely stripped of it. Would of been one of the core QOL changes on my shortlist :/. Soooo helpful.
---
I'd recommend you sell now if you can spend that gold on useful upgrades.
---
Made me laugh alot, Bad luck buddy.
---
Nah, the judge is off gcd. Can definitely be used on the same global.
---
CRZ != combined servers.
---
Combined servers are like my original server, Kirin Tor US, that got combined with Sentinels and Steamwheedle Cartel for being low pop.
---
Everyone should level it even if you have selfheals, first aid that is. I don't know how many times i've been oom on my priest and feared &gt; bandage to live and keep fighting. In general it's worth to keep it approriate to what cloth you get from mobs for those niche situations.
---
The reply isn't cool but why did you create a separate post instead of asking in the pinned questions megathread?
---
I feel the same way about BRD trinket runs. I did like 20 for my Second Wind and another 20 runs for HOJ for my guild rogues.
---
I haven't been in there for over a week and I feel like I should go back. Not because I need anything, it's just.... I should go back this weekend for a couple of more runs. 
---
Jesus what's wrong with us.
---
Yes, sometimes by a long way. At 60, you'll find that you can just walk through lvl 40-50 dungeons without even trying to avoid packs and not pull anything.

Paladin Leveling Question: I want to level as holy Paladin in classic soo that i can run dungeons and learn how to play healing pala properly while leveling. But i heard it's very slow to level as holy and should level as Ret. Is it possible to level as ret (talents) and earn healing gear by the way to heal dungeons while leveling? When should i switch to full healing spec? Thank you verya much for your answers!
---
Stay Warrior and do Dm East Jump Runs
---
Depends of the difference betwern your lvl and the mob lvl, basicly the bigger is your lvl comparated to the mob less pull range the mob will have, and if you have lesser lvl than the mob the mob pull from far.
---
Literally the only consistent way I have seen is making thorium shells and it's not a great amount of profit.
---
If you really want to min/max your rep, the game will have you running around between starter zones doing quests before they go grey like a large scale plate spinning exercise.  I did it once in Vanilla on a new alt.  The challenge is keeping all 3 starter zones in range, plus time, and travel expense.   To some this will seem worth it though because it drastically reduced rep item turn-ins.
---
Welp OP was complaining and instead of joining the qq train I offered the realistic options. Don’t care how popular they are because the dudes basically fucked if he wants to world pvp on that server anyway.
---
Have you tested this in-game? I thought int affecting mana regen came with the 2.4 patch, and in-combat regen and out-of-combat regen came in cata.
---
hi bud. don't worry too much about it. tell people at the start of the dungeon that you're new and to take it easy. go as slow as you need to - you control the pace. 
---
At the same time, your job is to ensure a good pace for the group. You need to be thinking ahead at all times. Pull mobs the second your healer is at enough mana so that he will finish drinking by the time you're losing hp and need a heal. No one wants to wait for you to read a guide for every pull. You should have a general idea of the dungeon - try going through as dps the first time. Don't be afraid to let more experienced dps players guide you through if you're tanking. The worst thing a tank can be is embarrassed of learning.
---
Many bosses are easy, especially before level 50. If you use shield block every time it's up, remember to keep battle shout up, and press your other buttons, you will be fine. There is a learning curve - playing warrior means you signed up for it. There are a lot of resources on the internet that can help you. classic.wowhead has a lot of good beginner resources like this [zul'farrak guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/zulfarrak-classic-dungeon-strategy), but don't take everything as gospel. Sometimes the guides are difficult to understand or even misleading. Asking experienced players - whether in your group or standing in Orgrimmar - is the fastest way to improve.
---
Well I'm definitely gonna roll alts so that's not an issue but yeah the choice has been made. It's like choosing your career at 18, it's too much pressure for the rest of your life!
---
At least it's on the way out.
---
U made the showcase 9 months ago. But how to play actually, where's some game footage?
---
Thaerx or something like that did a great set of dungeon guides on YouTube that might be a good introduction to new dungeons
---
Can confirm. Had a ret paladin in MC run, 10k damage on rag.
---
Wolves are the only other mount they can get on.  They can’t ride UD horses or Raptors.  But I think they can ride Rivendare’s mount.
---
I just healed LBRS last night with an Arms tank. Had to stop and drink every pull but the run was pretty quick
---
It’s a trap, send no reply.

Everytime you see a post claiming about the gold/hr you should halve it for a true evaluation.
---
Furthermore by the time these posts reach the general audience the trend is already on the downward.
---
Why do you think these guys show you this? Because they already made gold from it and is no longer as profitable so they don't care. Nobody will give you their moneymaker for free as long as it works.
---
so much inaccurate information in this guide :)
---
 I expect people interested in PvP will flag themselves for Tarren Mill / Southshore wars?
---
 If you trying to get some ranks I'd imagine your servers discord will be full of people looking for HK organising big battles or looking for death duels ?
---
They have great aoe threat, but single target is hard to scale because they need spell damage.
---
I remember there was some paladin tank that actually made it into the later raids, he was relyong on ectoplasmic distillers from T0.5 questline to generate threat lol.
---
thats it boys, no more abbrevations, we should write a 4 page essay now detailing what and how do we want to do things
---
Basically what happens when the tank or rogue doesn't want any phys dps in the group lol.
---
With the jumpy focus regen bite does sometimes get cast more than once depending on fight length. For max solo dps you might want to use claw+growl, for max threat generation bite+growl is probably better even if some focus ends up unused.
---
When you have all 3 active growl is sometimes delayed for claw/bite so that's an in-between tps/dps solution.
---
I always hated that scene. Hey Arthas, how about explaining your actions to others? How about "Listen up Uther: We've seen this stuff before. Anybody who ate the poisoned grain is gonna turn into an undead, there's absolutely nothing we can do about that, and there's no way to determine who's gonna turn and who's innocent. So please, if you got a better idea, tell me."
---
But I guess he was already being influenced by the Lich King or something.

This sometimes causes the players inside to get disconnected.

You should just step down as a mod if it bothers you that much homie.
---
If you want to see herbs on your map that are actually there, you have to activate herb tracking. This will show a yellow dot if there is something, but it has a limited range.
---
Gathermate will record all picked up flowers so in the future you can see on the map, where flowers might be. It has no way of knowing, if they are actually there. Its basically just a reminder, where you found which flowers.
---
If you want to dps play a real class, the best ferals can’t compete.
---
Devil's advocate time.
---
If you're on a PvE realm and competing for a resource, you can't do much about it.
---
If you're on a 70-30 PvP realm, you have a 30% chance to be able to get rid of your competition.
---
no that's blasted lands
---
When I did UBRS on my priest (shortly after hitting 60) I would spam smites throughout the first half because there is no point in having two healers, and often came out first on damage on Rend. That comes at a cost of my full mana bar, but at least it looks cool.
---
Just ask, "can I roll on X items for offspec?"
---
Specify the items by name if you want to potentially roll on them. Or when you're joining/starting a group, tell them from the jump you're only tanking if you can reserve a certain item. If they don't agree, then that's that. Take it on a group-by-group basis.  Don't expect to reserve the right to roll on all OS and MS gear. There are other people trying to get upgrades and it's rare to be able to have your cake ans eat it too.
---
You are not my king yet, boy. Nor would I obey that command if you were!
---
As someone who leveled two 60s on a PvP server I can tell you that the amount of world pvp that happened during the first month and a half was extremely minimal. Ganks only happened out of pure necessity in order to kill a named mob and even then most people would rather move onto something else than spark a pvp battle and slow down their leveling.
---
Since the PvP system isn't out yet there really isn't any tangible incentive to do world PvP so most people don't even bother atm. Farming gold and items is a far better use of your time until the system comes out and people seem to realize that.
---
I think what you really mean is a mail box of incredible size.
---
As a tank, Hunters always worry me the most when we're starting. There's a big gap between good and bad.
---
Mainly because they have that range limitation. All other ranged DPS aren't happy about a mob being in their face but it doesn't limit their abilities. Constantly having to think 'OK, can the hunter shoot this mob from a sensible location?' can be tiring.
---
I actually really like Hunters using their pet as an off tank. Makes things much easier to manage. BUT, tell your tank that's what you're doing and you're happy with your pet getting hit.
---
If you don't tell me I'll treat your pet like all other dps and try to hold aggro from it. Most of the time I just let a hunter's pet take aggro the hunter will complain so hunter pets just become mini-rogues in my eyes.
---
Warr tank only yo
---
Still id be lying if i said i dont want it on mah rogue
---
no it will only tell you you crit chance from int not your total crit chance (can't speak for melee)
---
This spec is messy. The 2 points in dodge should be in sinister strike energy reduction for when you cant get behind your target, and thats made weirder by taking aggression for 6% increased SS damage, when you havent taken the energy reduction, deliberately avoiding the synergy. On top of that youre sacrificing dagger skill and cooldown reduction for the sake of those points in aggression. Really weird choices, its definitely worse than the spec I linked.
---
&gt;I don’t see why you are so angry over a one line wisp message ?

Sometimes herbs are crazy hard to see anyway.  Sun grass and golden samsam are notoriously hard to see.  Especially with ground clutter and graphics settings cranked up to 10.

---
If after 2 months you're level 40 then bigger picture issues are simply not applicable.
---
&gt; not interrupting,
---
Just wanted to add that in Classic, if you aren't using an Enemy Cast Bar addon (which many people aren't) that is going to be far more difficult to pull off, especially concerning those 1,5 sec cast time spells. But yes, using CS to interrupt a ranged mob in order to pull it to the tank should be doable. 
---
Furthermore, not everyone remembers the important abilities of every single instance/dungeon by heart, at least not yet. Some people might be running that particular instance for the first time in many, many years (or just all together).
---
Other than that I completely agree.
---
Join a guild of friendly people who are more willing to help. It's literally what they are for.
---
In the BC era I ran shadow labs an ignorant amount of times (50+ I lost count) to get a piece of the "bold" set on my tank.  Gave up eventually and ended up with a purple from one of the raids.  After I was totally epic'd out I decided to help a friend one day and tank shadow labs...wouldnt you know it, my piece dropped.  I rolled need :P
---
Where were you that you thought you were in your territory and yet attacked? Also, your PVP flag will linger for 5 minutes after leaving a PVP zone, so take that into account.
---
The general idea is that these zones are usually filled with lower level characters, so it eliminates griefing of new players.
---
Reroll before it's too late.
---
Aggro range is HUGE. Trash generally causes more wipes/deaths than bosses. Treat every trash pack seriously, pull it back and use banish to CC if you get extra rock elementals. 
---
Surgers: Raid stacks on top of them
---
Giants: Separate them a bit
---
Fire Elementals: Kill Lava Spawns immediately
---
Dogs: Face away, can blind people in front so have your OT stay behind it and get ready to taunt and move on top of you if you get blinded
---
Packs after Garr: Banish the two rock elementals. Kill the smallest fire elemental first. Face the bigger fire elemental away.
---
By the fact that every zone has at least 20 horde to 1 alliance. Struggle to get dungeon groups cos there are no thanks and every dungeon has 50+ horde outside.
---
if you play horde you're part of the problem! all server queues should be for horde players only until the issues correct themselves
---
they are on separate tiers, so you should take divine strenght and then imp sor.
---
but to answer your question, probably imp sor will grant you more dmg at low lvl than divine strenght, because you do not have that much strenght.
---
If you're in your own territory Horde cannot attack you unless you have pvp turned off. Either you have pvp turned on or you're not in Alliance territory whenever this has happened.
---
Cause you play on a pvp server and it is a contested area?
---
not that i know of
---
Seriously. Using abbreviations has nothing to do elitism and everything to do with knowing how to help yourself, which is apparently a rare skill to have.
---
why 6 for undead?
---
Exactly why I endure the queues on my server. Basically I knew that I would have to pay a price no matter what I do. If I stay I'll have to pay the price of dealing with the queues. If I take the free transfer I'll have to pay for another transfer when the tourists leave. It's a bitch to have to deal with queues especially during the weekend but I think it was the right call.
---
loot will also reflect PLAYER level when in range

Protip: People are lazy so instead of typing LFG do an LFM and start the group yourself, much faster. But still, it takes time, haha
---
&gt;Men who behave like boys . Physically weak.
---
:'D
---
Shields do indeed break faster than other gear. Is it a reason to roll on it over a tank that doesn't have it yet? Probably not, but you can't expect everyone to give care about other players.
---
Imagine being triggered by roleplaying in a roleplaying game
---
Yeah I was able to do this too but he only has a splash screen looking option for installing classic and no drop down menu at all.
---
I get exactly what you're saying bro. The main problem is that guides like this rarely exist for any game, and, when they do, the author could always just be wrong about things - factually, or for the skill level we play at vs his, or for our playstyles, etc. There are too many variables, even if you had the best druid ever personally coaching you. It's like having someone describe to you how to ride a bike - you just have to try it for a few days.
---
The best way to actually learn what I think you want - to be good at pvp and understand matchups - is to duel people outside of ironforge/org in a controlled environment and write down what happened / video the duels and watch them over / talk it over with a friend - however you learn the best. You need experience to build a understanding of how the classes interact. Watching videos and reading guides is not going to help you more than putting 50 hours into dueling will when you're new to everything. You have to have a decent grasp and say to yourself "Look, here is a hunter - he is going to run away and kite me. He will use feign death to trap me and reset the fight if I get close. He has a hamstring and his pet could have a stun if he's specced for it - if he is specced for that, he will have these weaknesses. These are things I am thinking about." Once you're able to think about these things consciously, you can watch pvp videos and try to appreciate what experienced players do. Until that point, though, I would just duel people a ton and be fine with losing a lot. :) Losing is learning
---
Good luck buddy :)
---
I love it!!!
---
Well done, you clearly have a talent!!
---
This is from my experience on PvP realms, no idea if you're on a PvE realm or what difference that would do. 
---
If it's Horde territory they either have to have PvP flagged on or attack your first for you to be able to touch them, the reverse is true if they go to Elvynn forest or other Alliance territories. In contested territory it's anybody's game. If you have been attacked by Horde in Alliance territory you must either have attacked someone within the last 5 minutes or come to the Ally territory from a contested zone within the past 5 minutes.
---
Roll female orc
---
I strongly suggest a carrion bird or owl for levelling. Dps is near or even as cats but it has a aoe screech ability that will generate more threat. Use the screech and claw, it also has dive which is same thing as cat dash.
---
Possibly using Reshade. Makes the game look great.
---
In territory controlled by a faction., their PvP is by default turned off.  It is only on automatically in contested areas.  This is to stop high levels from ganking very low level enemies.
---
As a human, warrior, rogue and ret paladin get proficiency from using swords/maces, and holy paladin and priest benefit from extra spirit.

world can hold X thousand people.    Let's say it's 5000.    20,000 people want to play on a server.  So they make 4 layers of 5000 people each.  You only see people / enemies on your layer.   You can switch layers by joining another person in a group (/invite name) who is on another layer.  That is what happened to the guy in this video.
---
After some time , the 20,000 people decrease and only 10,000 remain.  So the amount of layers gets decreased as well , from 4 to 2.  Eventually the plan is that every server only has 1 layer.
---
i have noticed that sometimes on my mage i can auto attack while casting frostbolt
---
&gt;You are not my king yet, boy. Nor would I obey that command if you were!
---
 Then I must consider this an act of treason.
---
That was last boss though.
---
What specific zone do you mean when you say "my territory"? Because both redridge and duskwood are, for some reason, considered contested zones, not alliance zones.
---
I did the same. I managed to reach lvl 42 before being so fed up, I rerolled the other faction. Good luck!
---
My logs are posted above, you are welcome to peruse them at your leisure. 
---
Also look at my threat! I am sacrificing energy to use cower. Everyone else has room to work with. What is with all the hostility in this thread?
---
It’s still phase 1.  A lot of people don’t care to pvp because without honor it’s just a nuisance to them.  Myself, I enjoy it, but I can’t speak for anyone else.  I understand not wanting to pvp and just get shit done while you can but a pvp server is a pvp server in the end lol
---
If you're feral:
---
Basically most matchups you aim to outlast. Use Cat Form extremely sparingly, since it will lose toe-to-toe with most, if not all, melee classes.
---
Use your various CC abilities to control the fight (seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how few people use Bash as a way to get off roots and then heal up, for example).
---
Bear Form is your friend, and Maul does *really* surprising amounts of damage. In my cat form (generic DPS prebis-ish gear), Maul easily crits for upwards of 1k on clothies, and ~900 on leather classes. You wanna stick close and duke it out, use Feral Charge to interrupt if you feel like you need it, or as a way to root someone prior to rooting them to selfheal.
---
Don't be afraid to Innervate early. As a feral, especially without Natural Shapeshifter, you'll spend *a lot* of mana shifting. Innervate restores about 70% of my mana pool. Use it early and use it often. Don't be afraid to Moonfire either. Just pressing it once does respectable damage and is somewhat mana efficient. Same with Insect Swarm, if you're specced into it.
---
And lastly, be aware of your matchups. Warlocks and Spriests are unwinnable. Don't even bother unless they're sitting, on half health and you're already prowled in Cat Form behind them ready to dump a 2k Ravage in there.
---
Warriors, Shaman, Mages and Hunters are pretty doable. Paladins too, unless they're clever about their healing. Mages and warriors are especially easy, unless they get a really strong opener into you. Rogues are kind of a coin flip. If they get a good cheap shot-&gt;kidney shot into you while you're in cat or humanoid farm, you're likely dead or starting the fight at dangerously low hp. If you get the opener or start the duel/fight in Bear Form, it's very strongly favored towards you.
---
I know this isn't exactly what you asked for, but I hope it's somewhat helpful. :)
---
Ah, yes.  
---
*the retarded #nochanges camp is in confusion*
---
Agree I play on a 60/40 server, and I can't wait to shit on the horde with my guild when phase 2 comes where moste ppl are going after rank 10+  world PvP will be great :)
---
Same here.im lucky if i can do 1 dungeon every few days....i lvl solo 99% of the time
---
Do you know a way I can get to stv? Do I need to take a boat to booty bay and walk there
---
Horde will still have longer queues since they're more played across all realms combined.
---
It seems I have triggered a bunch of rogues and warriors. What is with all the hostility? I thought the internet liked cats?
---
Warriors can equip Choker of the Firelord
---
Tanking is a group effort, if everyone does stupid things, you don't have a chance. That you don't have a lot of abilities at your level doesn't help. Plus mobs don't hurt all that much, so dps don't get easily discouraged from "tanking" their own mob.
---
From the perspective as a healer, yes it gets better, but only a bit. Some people will learn how to play effectively and what their class can do to help in a group and you want to remember those. But wow isn't hard enough to prevent idiots from leveling up, so they will never go away.

I got to 46 on a human warrior on skeram before getting fed up and rolling a tauren warr. Felt at home. Got to 27 before just xferring my human to Heartseeker because I dont have the time to throw the 4 extra days /played out I have on the human but oh well...
---
We don’t want to play with “ doctor disrespect fan” anyways lmfaoooo
---
Until there’s not a mage there.
---
LAMO
---
Or better yet, dumping your 53 warrior and starting over on a different class!
---
I was doing backtracking in Wetlands at 40+, to level my herbalism.  
---
At 120-160 it's either Wetlands or STV, and many people prefer Wetlands over Vietnam.
---
Mind tap talisman, meeeeeh. Good for some healers... As a priest I prefer second wind/briarwood reed + Royal seal :) Its all bout dat +healing. Most bosses in MC go down in under 2 minutes, going OOM is not a real big issue yet IMO :)
---
Druids will always be stepping on someone's toes. If they are main spec tank they have to roll against rogues and hunters, if they are main spec healer they roll against  priests warlocks paladins and mages. The only person who wont care is a DPS warrior.
---
You should state your intentions at the start of the dungeon and only roll need on the one spec sure - but it isn't up to your party to decide what spec you get to roll on. If they don't like it they can find another group.
---
Well then some people can enjoy sitting in org wanking over their bis while they wait for cross realm bg’s before they get to enjoy pvp
---
As the poet Jagger once said you can’t always get what you want
---
Yeah, no, you really don't use searing pain in your typical Lock builds.  "Threat works normal" is a problem when every other dps class has ways to reduce their threat...Locks don't.
---
Take the zeppelin from Durotar to GromGol camp.
---
I am having this problem as well but reversed. Everyone of my friends are horde and I have never enjoyed playing horde.

Are there newer ones too? Last I heard Blizzard limited the gathering of these infos.
---
3k is ~3 hours. I am against realm transfers in any case but if Blizzard is doing them  (which they are)  then they should take faction balance into consideration.
---
TREASON?! Have you lost your mind /u/Babojeb?
---
Great advice. There are so many people just waiting for someone looking for more because then they don't have to find people themselves.
---
I was guilty of this. Needed to do UBRS and there was no groups for a while, then I saw someone who also wrote LFG UBRS and just invited him and put LFM UBRS in the channel. Instantly got 6 whispers.
---
I heard only spellbinders drop crusader isn't it a long shot?
---
Aye, getting some initial threat on the primary target and then focusing on the others, while the DPS will likely pull aggro on the first mob at around 75% HP, they should be able to kill it quickly if they are focus-firing the target. Granted, the whole focus-firing thing doesn't happen much, but when you are with a good group that approach works wonders. Especially with multiple ranged DPS that can actively finish the mob off before it reaches them.
---
Yes it's classed as defense pet just like a bear. It has a negative modifier to damage. Cats are classed as offense pets and have a positive damage modifier. Classic petopia is a great resource for hunters it'll show those exact modifiers, abilities on tame, attack speeds, etc.
---
I also think that it's because the more experience wow players know that it's better to be on a server with a queue than to be on a potentially dead server as well. Hence the discrepancy in raiding guilds. I don't know the exact numbers but it feels like we have atleast 20+ raiding guilds that clear MC every week on Gehennas horde (excluding pugs).
---
Most people aren't even 60 yet, so yeah raiding guilds right now will be hard to find.
---
No
---
Looking good.
---
On my server all the min-max elitist are flaming people wearing it because it’s a “shitty tanking weapon”.
---
Who cares, it looks awesome as hell!
---
My wife farms herbs. I keep trying to tell her to ditch Herbalism and just focus on Cooking.
---
I had this feeling too while leveling my warr at 35-45 lvls... What i did was to farm my professions for a change of pace. Also leveled first aid, cooking and fishing. Do some dungeons for quests. Do the WW Axe chain myself. Just chill and not stress about exp/hour and doing evrything the most optimised way possible.  
---
You should try to change your mindset to just enjoy the game at your current level. If you only have the level 60 in mind and it covers evrything else then you just wont enjoy playing/feel burned out. I've got rid of the must-be-lvl60 mindset and just acually have fun with dungeons, new zones and fancy quest chains with cool lore. Im lvl 55 warr now and having a blast since i just finished ungoro and felwood quests and did ST dungeon in meantime. Just now setting my foot in BRD which is also awesome.  All this comes from a person who leveled 30+ chars to max levels thru all the expansions... a totaly different way to play since most of the other characters i played were crazy rushes to max lvl. Almost got the feeling like im playing wow for the first time  
---
Tldr. just change the mindset to enjoy the journey and level 60 will just come by itself sooner or later. You might be even sad that it came so fast.
---
Too many undead rogues anyway. Stick with orc!
---
lol,  on my mage a couple of times of ported to UC, then ported me and 2 group mates to TB to fly to mojache in just this kind of circumstance
---
As alliance: go south from duskwood.
---
As horde: go on the zeppelin to grom gol in front of og (the left one if you are approaching the tower). Or fly to ratched and take the boat to booty bay. In fact, do both and get both flight points, you'll have to move around a lot and this will help.
---
r/Perfectlycutgifs
---
finding groups always depends on your class, you can only put so many rogues / hunters into a single group. If you're a tank you can build a group for anything instantly as always, healers have to get creative due to healing competition from hybrid specs at 60 and dps always have to hope to get into something.
---
Just join a guild to avoid all this hassle, and at that point the question 'so no trouble finding groups?' becomes meaningless.
---
Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI8FzDYk2ro
---
It's also nice that you can get items that other classes won't want. All dual wielders try to get as much +hit as they can while you will only want a few +hit and a lot of stats.
---
What a throwback. Now i have to watch his McDonald's video
---
The other day, we were in UBRS. A enhancement shaman said she would heal but roll on melee dps items. Raids said "sure". The guy indeed had the melee crit trinket from Rend quest and it was eveident that she was wearing random +int items. Well, she fuckin rolled on Reed (he happen to have him without trying to find him) and won it over myself and a mage.
---
The worst part is that the melees just said "come on, this guys is healing us, it is ok to have it".

Not enough points by lv 60 to get SL/SL. For that, you need a level cap increase.
---
It is the lvl ...and you really can't tank in WC  if party dont bother and want only to rush a 2hr istance in 1hr. 
---
WC is better if you have a druid tank.
---
Again, there are games twice as old as this with a fraction of the budget that don't contain such mistake
---
There were/are addons which count all players over /who and building a database (just your own faction).
---
You could load those files up and if there were enough people of both factions of one realm loading databases up, you could get a good overlook over the server balance
---
i got 2 in 2 runs last night ... :/
---
I'm with you, had a Shadow Priest heal me through Razorfen Downs the other night, in Shadow stance.
---
Our hunter used a gorilla to off tank and everything worked out.  I had to throw some Flash of Lights every now and then, but it was more fun than the standard groups.
---
thanks i'll look that up
---
Just imagine night elf archers taking shots at your wyvern while you flap in to a hot lz.
---
This kills the mana
---
What server are you on? I am on bloodfang, one of the servers you can transfer to, and it’s absolutely fucking alive! And even bloodfang “only” has medium/high pop depending on time of the day. So where the hell are you playing?
---
I went to UBRS where the leader said that everything under 2g50s will be disenchanted. He rolled need on everything, luckily my rolls were higher on Eye of Rend and the Beast wrist.
---
Exactly, problem with claw is your pet will never have focus for an eventual growl. From my experience Bite ends up providing higher dps anyway.
---
I found it funny
---
Barrens is Horde Territory. They dont get flagged for PVP there unless they want to. 
---
Automatic PVP flaging only happens in Enemy or Contested Territory.
---
&gt; There is no need to clog up the subreddit with a simple question when we have the resource for it to be answered in another thread.

---
You can still do cloth turn-ins. Switching over from the beginning and doing all the quests along the way. For another faction (except forsaken) will get you intonrevered before cloth turn-ins though. Still no way around them you just have to do a few more.
---
Ha, exactly the vibe I was getting. 'Wtf lady I held the door open for you and you didn't have the decency to give me a blowjob as a thanks?!'
---
This should be higher. If you're having this issue its probably distance related. If the melee is closer to the boss than the tank, sometimes the swing will still go for the melee instead. Melee should attack at max range and the tanks should be as close as possible whilst tanking for sure.
---
Don t you guys have phones...?
---
I can’t remember specifically, but I coulda swore Blink’s icon was one of those brought over from Warcraft 3
---
Imp Seal of Righteousness. Unless you go ret and get Seal of Command, SoR is your go to, and even the full 10% strength from Divine Strength is minor. At lvl 60 with blue gear, you'll have between 200-300 strength, so that's 20-30 str from the talent, so 40-60 AP. Not bad, but that's at 60.
---
Or heal spec priests, so slow without spirit tap.
---
It’s dumb how much downvotes you got. I found it worth a chuckle as I too have not seen those names
---
So what, at least it was worth farming then, if you used it for 6 weeks.
---
I would feel much worse replacing everything in 1-2 raids  after farming it for days/weeks
---
This made me chuckle.
---
are you seriously evaluating if a server is 'dead' by comparing population numbers at 4 AM on an EU server?
---
Your early kit isn't very good for maintaining threat on multiple targets. Shouts and a lot of tabbing and sundering is probably your best bet.
---
However, healer should not be able to pull aggro off you after the first 5-10 sec of a fight - if that happens you likely forgot to sunder a target or something.
---
It's a different story if the healer blasts out one of several big heals / spam heals the first few seconds of a pull - that is dangerous and should be avoided. However, it sometimes happens to save a trigger-happy DPS, then it's a choice between spamhealing that target and risking overaggroing or letting the DPS die. That's bound to get messy, with you and healer having to try and keep the ship from sinking and hoping the other DPS are smart enough to focus down priority targets and providing some supplementary CC.
---
It does get better at higher level though, around 50 most groups will have to be more coordinated. But there's a lot of fucking around in low level dungeons in PUGs - try to make guild runs instead.
---
Just gonna copy paste my response from above
---
&gt;I also think that it's because the more experienced wow players know that it's better to be on a server with a queue than to be on a potentially dead server as well. Hence the discrepancy in raiding guilds between high pop servers. I don't know the exact numbers but it feels like we have atleast 20+ raiding guilds that clear MC every week on Gehennas horde (excluding pugs).
---
Isn't focus target removed in classic? What addons adds it back?
---
Great stuff. Some of the text could be reduced, like in the 2nd last panel for instance even just *What's that?* could be enough as the reader sees what's going on through the images.
---
Glad I could make it, Uther.
---
Even if shields would break easily, why the fuck would you take a BIG upgrade from someone else only to get your 2nd one. I would avoid this person.
---
Well its hard to win when you cant play your charecter in a long stun. You Will see in the tournament how it goes.

You missed out fishing. I got 10g/stack on nightfin soup this raid reset.

If a mage is in my dungeon group and he refuses to give me any water, I'll refuse to drink any of my water. Have fun waiting 2-5+ minutes after each pull for me to regen some of my mana.

Countering spell by resist!
---
I dunno, if you have a problem getting butthurt from meanies on the internet you could, you know, not be a moderator? That's the reason why I refuse officer positions in guilds. I'd rather be a prole who gets a few purples every now and then than the guy who has to manage the seething mass in a guild or raid environment.  The headaches come with the power over other people within your community. If you didn't have that power nobody would care about what you do. So give it up if you don't want the consequences

On Nethergarde Keep EU I never experienced queues (started playing 2 days after launch) but the server often says it's "Full" in the evening. I see plenty of people online. Lots of them in cities.

1. Its reddit

2. Nobody cares that you topped subpar rogues and warriors

I praise the earthmother every day that the Orks of Orgrimmar have some bigger wolfes hidden away for my fat cow's ass. Totally worth the 16000 reputation in runecloth.

I left my shaman on Shazzrah decked out with t2 + pieces of t1 because I want real wpvp instead of faction inbalanced wpvp. I know shazzrah is not one of the worse offenders (I think wowhead predicted it to be 65/35) but it really matters to me. So now I am leveling a dwarf hunter on Mograine where it's closer to 50/50. Currently lvl 39 and having a blast with balanced wpvp.

---
But when you’ve got people running out of your view as your casting your healing, them aggro’ing more enemies when you’re low on mana and then blaming you for not healing them. 
---
It’s not as easy to heal as you think it is.
---
*Fortunate Son plays in background...*
---
They are good, but not "you **must** have this pet" good. Personally I can't stand the flapping.
---
If you do get one, you'll have to go to Westfall to get the first rank of Screech at level 16/17. Greater Fleshrippers are the only mob in the game to have it.
---
5 man content is alot about communication whether you like it or not.
---
If the dungeon is easy or everybody automatically focuses the right target then no problem, however in 70% of pugs this is not the case.
---
/say + caps lock in mid fight is highly ineffective for example.
---
I suggest using a macro like this:
---
/emote wants to kill t%
---
/run SetRaidTarget("target",8)
---
This will set a skull above your targets head and gently give people a reminder in the chat box also. 
---
I found my runs are often nice and smooth when I use this on the bigger pulls or if we accsidentally pull additional adds.
---
Just the pick me up I needed. Thanks.
---
Just a reminder that by cataclysm.. orcs with flamethrowers is canon.
---
I've watched Staysafe do his Maura farms on stream and he's never had the dagger drop. He's upwards of 300 Princess kills so far.
---
I'm just going to assume it's a very rare drop.
---
Double-right-click if there's a custom right-click menu on the vid.
---
you are of course right, but so is he. its the only real solution. blizzard cant make peopel transfer ( and why would you if you have the advantage and why would you transfer to a server were you dont?)  all these ideas about faction specific  queues would be hated and turned against the second blizz implemented them and peopel started to have to wait in hour long plus queues again. 
---
to put it simply, the reason blizz doesnt do anything is because there isnt anything they can do.  this is a player created problem therefore its the players that have to fix it.
---

If you repeat the same joke 5 times in a row people stop laughing. Everyone and their mother has seen this by now. Invest some effort into coming up with your own stuff, this karma whoring is just sad right now.
---
So you took WoW models and put them on map then could walk on it? Okay I guess.
---
Backwards may be limited in use but I'd definitely is useful, though admittedly not as much on rogue as say a caster who might want to stutter step between casts, but I'd still want the option, useful for dropping off some ledges and such still.
---
Most ele shaman are fine tanking a single mob, and generally understand that if they pulled using an unnecessary earth shock, that's what they are going to do now.
---
\#NotAllTanks  
---
I have been tanking ever since Vanilla and I wanna call the Healer 'Mommy.' :'c
---
&gt; Mage wins by large margin 
---
What? They are middle of the pack in pvp, below lock, priest and arguable rogue/druid.
---
Someone isn't getting leader of the pack. ;) Its fun to roflstomp "real classes" in pvp too. Warriors go down easy and rogues sure do hate faerie fire when their vanish fails.
---
I tested it with that weapon. Just equipping it when I wear my 2H makes me equip that 1H in the off hand. So that's why the macro failed: it first placed that weapon in the OH and then immediately replaced it with my shield.
---
Nah, it's mages. While hunters still roll on everything (I recently had a hunter roll with me on a shield because he thought he might be able to equip it), the reputation of being bad players and causing wipes because of mindless AoE has been passed on to mages.
---
Avoid party whit multiple war  is stupid , war dps is best dps in game .
---
We all go for need and prey .
---
Come to Mograine, its pretty balanced here with a healthy community and good world PvP scene.
---
Slight horde favouritism, but no more than the 5-10% you suggest.
---
*I'm in this photo and I dont like it*
---
Nah, get a crawler just outside Org on the east coast for claw rank 2, then get the Savannah Huntress in the barrens at 11 or 12..... maybe pick up the snapjaw at 15 for bite, otherwise stick to the Huntress for general leveling until stranglethorn where you can replace it with a cat with dash.
---
Closest I’ve seen so far is my guildy’s imp.  Mine is Aztik and his is Aztuk
---
Priest. Before DM - look for scholo groups, visit STV arena every 3 hours, look for scholo groups, duel outside IF, camp tidal charm for a couple hours. This week - spam DM until I fall asleep.
---
Same reason I imagine it costs so much to fly to Darkshire compared to Sentinel Hill from Stormwind, not even the gryphons want to go there so you gotta sweeten the deal
---
Sounds like you are better off without that person :)
---
If I’m tanking I just don’t group with other warriors, simple as that.
---
To me, it peaks at the int buff part. Love the punch line.
---
Books that spawn on the floor
---
They are lootable and can contain either junk or a valuable class book
---
You're using the MANUAL???? I'M imagining what the game would be like if I ever saw it.
---
Oh hey it's me, except when I leave the office I have to keep working from home.  One monitor wow, one monitor work.
---
I'm surprised it's that bad in the alliance side, I'm playing horde on noggenfogger and I'm getting ganked by alliance and getting into fight constantly. Some days they camp BRD or MC like crazy
---
My phone background is the Horde symbol. I've had a few people notice it so far
---
30s was honestly the hardest part of the grind for me. You dont have a lot of good quest zones, so spamming SM or grinding mobs is your main xp.
---
 The map opens up after 40, and from there it's not too far to ZF (Best leveling dungeon along the way imo). Once you get to 52 for BRD you can pretty reliably just dungeon grind and get end game prebis gear
---
Not like sanctuary is much more impactful.
---
An offensive crit holy shock is good too.
---
Can confirm. Got devilsaur set, replaced with MC gloves and pants in 1 day. Felt bad
---
Can't agree more - some preraid gear is bis till aq40
---
On the other hand, 3 months doing Eternal Palace and have not got yet bis/correct AZ traits...

Yeah man I’m prot as well which is even worse :( combined we could make it happen? Haha
---
The pool by Quel Danil lodge in Hinterlands is good for Nightfins, as is the river in Camp Mojache in Feralas
---
What the fuck is this comment? Was that really necessary?
---
Good on you kitty friend! 
---
As a rogue im happy ur showing us up on the metres make us work harder.
---
11mp5 is the equivalent of  117 spirit for a priest whilst casting, which you're doing practically the whole time (which you should be unless your raid raid has too many healers), you might as well ignore the stat altogether if you'd take a bit of spell power over that.
---
All this is true for a guild run.
---
This was with PUGs if im correct? And no rules stated at start that tank have prio if bindings drop.
---
Then why on earth does this rogue need to give a single fuck about their tank? Its not his guild. He benefits nothing from this.
---
You do realise some ppl don't sit here 24/7 and don't see all the shit posted?
---
This thread is so triggered that you are doing well as kitty.
---
Bad. Yeah you should definitely stop being a mod and go get an actual job if you're gonna do BS like this. How dare you remove a genuine question instead of all the other BS that gets posted.
---
Same. I once complained about a guy I met ingame who was an absolute dick, in the comments of a post and got permabanned for "harassing people"...? Like what
---
I've never seen it before so it's new to me.
---
Most people that already own a gaming desktop don't get laptops for the purpose of gaming. It's likely a school/ work/ spare/ old machine that's not exactly owned with max graphics gaming in mind.

The awkward moment when the poster writes some cringe fanfiction about being outnumbered when his pop is 48/52
---
Nah it's not just for guild runs lmao
---
Flagging yourself allows opposite faction players to attack you not the other way. Of course when they do, they'll have flagged themselves and therefore u can attack them back. If a player on PVE server doesn't want to do world pvp, nobody can force them to.
---
A lot of them are the same though
---
Are you trying to gank lowbies in the barrens?
---
Quests around that level literally give rewards with something like 1,5 - 3,5g *each* (at least if you factor in vendoring rewards). 
---
But of course it depends on how much gold you are spending on other things and how many of your skills you buy on levelup for example. I'm at ~620g on my Mage at lvl 54½ (and no I'm not AoE farming). I do have Mining, but then again, I also have Engineering taking up some cash. Arcane Crystals selling for 35g - 40g really helps though :)
---
The reason why you get an owl aside from it’s amour/dps/ hp strats are screech and claw. 
---
If you’re horde just tame a bat or cairron bird with screech. Teach bite to bat. And if you really want an owl get one at lvl 48 in felwood.
---
You basically fly to undercity, walk outside catch a Zeppelin, walk to the flight trainer, fly to Feralas then walk to Dire Maul.
---
Server isnt dead for horde but its extremely unbalanced.
---
It's a good joke, but FYI the reason why quests have such low droprates is because they're mostly designed as a grinding guide. Since grinding is an integral part of questing in WoW, these "collect X" quests are made so that you have a background goal while killing dozens of X mob. 
---
Don't stop drawing though, awesome you're doing these.
---

This subreddit is pure garbage.
---
If that is what he meant it makes more sense.
---
Classic sure needs more mages.  
---
A small detail. The background isn't according to the Inn at the Crossroads. It looks more like an Alliance-Themed inn :o
---
Hillsbrad
---
The trick is to party with warriors who already have the gear you need.
---
This is how you make an SM Armory party where it's very likely to be 3+ Warriors/Paladins.
---
I had very good luck even in an all mail/plate party not competing on any individual item with more than one or maybe two people.
---
Of course we were all lowkey there for Scarlet and none of it ever dropped...
---
I did that when I fought 2 ogres in Feralas for chest and herb and guy comes up to loot the chest. I insta vanish and let him deal with mobs instead taking the prize. Sorry boy, not today.
---
Purely for balance reasons. What comparable zones would the Horde get? Only one I can think of where there’s no major Alliance quest hub is Swamp of Sorrows, but that wouldn’t make sense geographically
---
Work - Play - Sleep - &gt; Repeat
---
Laintime was good for the standards back then
---
Bøizzard probably attempts this to avoid servers to go completely dead
---
Don't worry. Pvp will find you.
---
This and that Firemaw is feels like 70% horde and 30% Ally. Cannot quest because of high levels or packs, literally packs/parties of horde everywhere. I also agree that Rogue isn't the easiest class to get into Duegon groups in but I still manage to get into quite a few.
---
IF you're at the level to do ZF, Defo get the mallet and spam that you have it. I always get groups now :)
---
Aye anyone asking to buy water from my Mage when they are grouped with me gets a "Hell no, it's free"! Must be alot of greedy Mage bastards around to give us such a bad name.
---
I agree it's the age old if everyone explained there actions we wouldn't be in this mess story telling. However, as a paladin Arthas should not have gone straight to purge the place!!1!!1!
---
It was a walled city they could have blockaded the city, the wizards of dalaran where trying to find a cure. I don't think it would of worked but neither did purge the city plan
---
Roger that I will work on that!
---
Traveling from objects and all the quest takes a lot of time,
---
Economy vs first class.
---
So basically, always take +12.5 healing over any amount of int?
---
&gt; can't loot in combat
---
Was it always like that? Thats a bummer for my warrior
---
At the very least fly to GG and take the zepp to UC. Some people really have a hard time thinking creatively.
---
I've had a few people get upset with me for not being able to port them to Stonard.
---
atlasloot has an map background with relevent points marked
---
"I'm going to skip this quest" XD!!
---
The artwork looks great and I really like what you're doing. Like others have said, make it punchier and it will hook more people. It's something I'm working on with my writing.
---
Nobody reads chatbox man. They're gonna shoot the one with the most HP because muh fat dps. Recount is the only addon dps use.
---
Mhhh didn't even see that. Might want to check this ingame, wowhead only shows what it can gather from the client itself.  
---
So it might be that some of the displayed values are wrong. Yet the point stands, Attackpower in Classic doesn't necessarily imply melee and ranged.
---
It’s the beginning of his descent into “madness”. It seems now, that the lich king may have had Azeroths world soul’s best interest in mind. His goal is to unite the world in death and he needed arthas to complete that goal.
---
I've always been a horde player, and I've always played on PVP servers. Some friends of mine from a classic EverQuest server wanted to roll Alliance PVP and they were the only people I knew who were playing, so I rolled Alliance. Got to 45 and they had all quit playing. A different group of friends decided they wanted to stay playing, but they don't like PVP. So I rerolled Horde on a Normal server. I've basically rolled two characters that aren't exactly what I want to play. Hoping this second group actually sticks out out and flagging myself PVP will satisfy me until BG's.
---
&gt;neither did purge the city plan
---
the purge the city plan worked. The bodies were later reanimated by Kel'Thuzad, it wasn't the plague that got them.
---
Agreed
---
Get a mage friend to sheep him! It's so easy that way :-)
---
36 is high enough for stv?
---
He said pvp AND grinding. Those fields combined, mage wins, is what I meant.
---
Shiiiiiiet
---
Zhevra Hooves are always the goal. Just wait for them to reach shimmering flats haha. But great explanation!
---
the usual 30/21 heart of the wild + natures swiftness build is mostly a pvp hybrid build. I'm sure you can get away with it in mc and ony (and of course normal dungeons) but for raiding higher tiers or if your gear is lacking somewhat, people usually go moonglow or deep resto with zero points in feral.
---
Stonetalon and Ashenvale are probably the places you would find same level Horde/Alliance between level 20 and 30.
---
Hillsbrad has some issues where Horde goes there earlier than alliance. (The Yeti cave is a popular PvP spot around level 30)
---
STV is the main place to go for level 30-40 PvP since horde and alliance get many of the same quests.
---
Where is the results? On a website?
---
my blood boils at this
---
Can someone edit it with the shooting star music?!
---
That is a screenshot from cata, not vanilla.
---
Not an all too bad decision during downtime for some added damage, but make sure Shamans don't use Rockbiter weapon - it increases their threat generated by attacks by a shitton. They should use Flametongue, or later, Windfury.
---
Afaik, forces an ilegible name on your character, typically just a mish-mash of letters and numbers, which forces you to rename.
---
Yeah in cata.
---
I got a doozie for you then, chcek this out: Do you know why the chicken crossed the road?
---
tO gEt To ThE oThEr SiDe! Har har har
---
THANK YOU! Exactly what I’ve been looking for!
---
Not sure why this is a surprise to anyone. Exact same thing happened from launch in retail, which is how we got to the 90/10 or worse faction balance on all the PvP servers there today. In reality all server are PvE servers and always have been, except for like one or two RP-PvP realms that miraculous maintain something approaching a decent balance, probably because people care less about the PvP and more about everything else. Every PvP realm is going to wind up like this tilted to one faction or the other. It's inevitable. The only "solution" they have --- or ever had --- is cross-realm BGs.
---
Would have left.
---
Cant even back up your own false point.
---
You absolute madman xD
---
Ashenvale and Stonetalon Mountains see a reasonable number of Horde because the Barrens feeds into them.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills gets fed from Silverpine Forest so you'll see Horde there too.
---
shift wheel or ctrl wheel (the latter in my case)
---
Seems a bit strange Yeh you were asking a question about WoW classic on the classic subreddit if you can't ask here where can you ask? OH RIGHT GOOGLE
---
You sound personally attacked because someone liked a joke.
---
I don't know all the inns in the game, but there could be some inns that horde has that looks like that, idk. 
---
The humans could maybe be deserters or spies, idk, maybe something for future comics? Could be a story-arc.

Oh yeah! Well I'm a Airline pilot in the day and teach University classes at night, with 4 extended families I see every other day AND I just scraped into 5.5bars of level 2. Did I mention I've got 69copper.
---
Not much but I'm super proud and deserve way more validation than this no-lifer OP.

---
The above is a possible spec if you have a Warrior tank.  I prefer my [2h Holy](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503022521051--5520030122/0BCEGJmHKPq2ABhJffKfC) spec, it's PvP oriented, but works well in dungeons too.
---
You could probably make one macro that doea both
---
zandalar tribe it says that the server is med pop but trust me it feels dead I dunno why blizzard keeps saying that it's med.
---
Helcular's Rod in Hillsbrad was my worst. One item, grinded an entire level of Yetis before it dropped.
---
Lock phase 1 gear is pretty bad for pvp, so many boe green bis of shadow wrath pieces with no stam/int and t1 is a joke but gives you pvp stats, but you should still win every 1v1 if you’re pvp spec.  Even in my pve gear/spec with only 2700 hp I can blow up most classes without even having a void out to sac.  If you do lose the initial fight you should have a ss up to pop back to full hp/mana to finish them off.
---
Warlocks have so much utility.  Fear, death coil, howl of terror, banish, summons, healthstones, soulstone, pets, dots, big damage spells, self heals.  If you go engineering you gain even more utility
---
I was an unbeliever. I thought that arms could compete with fury if I had a sick 2H (OEB as well) and crap gear otherwise. But I'm over 20% crit, and flurry uptime is getting up there, and it's just too good for rage generation.
---
I have seen the light.
---
i knew these responses, but these are the same people I played back from tbc till cata and Im bad at making new friends, too old for that. :)
---
I want to add on to what the other user said. To, me you’re not coming off as sincere. You seem to be a caricature of what you think a gamer is. 
---
Go back to basics, be yourself, if people like you then you’ll slowly build an audience. If you love making videos, keep going. Don’t just do it for the watches, that never works.
---
I play on Incendius and it's basically packed 24/7.
---
I also have a desktop lol. An "insecure laptop owner" lmao. You are a joke. 
---
Btw, desktop PCs are cheaper than comparable laptops. Not sure what makes it hard to own a PC
---
What is this monstrosity?
---
My dude. After dungeon is cleared everyone just leaves. The mage did right in asking for it to be made before the end.. but wrong in tping. Shouldve kicked him after that
---
Could always pass it off as the Brill inn
---
Thank you
---
wat
---
Try doing it as alliance on a pvp server

---
The one who posted is actually the seller in this case. I would guess sock wrote WTB.
---
I woke up 5 AM, I work till 2 PM. I go to home, prepare meal, login while doing so, I eat while playing WoW, wash dishes / do push ups / use dumbbells while flying / waiting for party members. When I think I did what wanted to achieve today in WoW and it's training day, I go to workout. Back, shower, dinner, quick 5x BRD short pickpocket runs for lockouts and go to sleep :D
---
Boars mate, they're fierce but it gets the work done quick
---
I don't understand why everyone saying it, I hate tanking in non prot, tanking is already suffering, but when you don't have 12 rage sunders, extra stun, revenge stuns, last stand and bonus threat it's just hell. (fury/prot without anger management is by far feel the worst)
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info😉
---
Congratulations for missing my point entirely.
---
I think it's not the case that there are too many healers. There are simply no tanks. As a DPS I love about waiting one hour. I spend several afternoons fishing and logged out 3 hours later because there was no Tank for any 60s dungeon.
---
The AOE thing is why i changed from full prot to fury prot. Its a lot easier to hold aggro with 2x 1h and just change to shield if you encounter hard hitting mobs.
---
Obligatory 'But...exp waste though.'
---
I am on my feet all day working on machinery so getting to sit at my computer at night is all I have to look forward to.
---
I'm a programmer that utilizes my graphics card for CUDA development. I also use it for gaming. So yeah it works as my work laptop. As well as a gaming laptop. 
---
A desktop and a laptop serve different purposes. But saying "most" desktop owners dont own a powerful laptop is gatekeeping in its own right.
---
I’m almost constantly in combat this way too :)
---
It's just a human. Nothing out of the ordinary
---
This entire arthas must be purged
---
Not gonna lie, I don't mess with warlocks unless you let me use a restorative potion lol.
---
I played ret until level 54 and healed most of my dungeons. The only thing you need to heal in dungeon is a healing set. Mostly +intell and +healing (or +spell even) if you can. It got hard at temple of hakkar (lvl51)
---
My advice would be that the higher level you are, the more you rely on having a good tank.
---
Go in groups where the tank is at least the level required for the dun.
---
Please don't stay in ranged zone. Seal of wisdom plus jugement help you restore mana on packs and is important. You can even stun in melee range to make the pack smoother. You also learn which ability hit melee and you gain awareness.
---
Invite a friend to a group, promote them to leader. /Logout in the instance, tell your friend to reset all instances while you're logged. Wait 10 seconds. Log back in. You're now at the beginning of the instance and it's reset.
---
I think this might work, thanks :D
---
Imagine not just living in your parents attic until you’re 25 mooching off of them and living rent free so you can play classic all day and carry livestreamers through content.
---
What are you saying
---
so basically youre just questing along? i dont get it
---
For Hunter, whats a good way to know if crit % on an item outweighs agility on another item? Obviously crit % is in effect a DPS increase but I don't know how to quantify it against the clearer DPS increase agility gives. 
---
Example I have is 2% crit no agility vs 23 agility no crit.
---
Yeah, but isn't this is about 2 warriors and a druid looking for tanks for a 5 man dungeon?
---
&gt; DM is the only dungeon it takes long to get to, because you need to fly from OG.
---
Can't you just get a portal to TB instead?
---
Didn't know it works when pollied. Thanks
---
Ughhh
---
Nah, it's just a trope to use the classic rock-paper-scissor format
---
Except we're getting living-dead-void in retail
---
I agree. It would probably be the same with me if I was a warrior. But I just wanted to see the general consensus. I mean, if I’m tanking in fury because everyone and their mother needs a tank these days. There’s honestly no reason that you shouldn’t be able to do the same. Why do we need to compete for gear when we’re a hot commodity at the moment? We could start our own independent runs and not compete for gear in the same run. Even as a feral, one of my 14 slot bags is full of int spirit gear. Just in case. I’m pretty sure most warriors will carry at LEAST a shield right? Maybe some tanking trinkets?
---
Interesting point but if you want to duel then OG isn’t far away.
---
or make a /target macro for all the different types of Devilsaurs and spam it when running through Un'goro.
---
I'm duo labeling with a tank as a priest. Soon as 1st dps gets to instance we just begin. I dont mind waiting if they dont mind missing a boss or 2.
---
Yeah, true.
---
I stay 8 hours in front of a screen at work, come home, eat, play wow for 5 hours. Go to bed. Wake up, eat..
---
But the cycle is not neverending, it only happens when my girlfriend is not at my place. Then, I cook for her for 40min-1h, we eat, I play for 30-40 mins, we watch anime, snuggle, go to bed.
---
But, if I were alone, yeah, that would be my rythm, but I would not be smiling, like the gentleman in the image is.
---
It was in WC3
---
Be happy, don't regret it.
---
Is the exp gained from discovering places enough to lvl to 60? I don’t think “walking” is going to be enough.
---
Holy...dude. 11? You’re just getting started, my friend! *laughs maniacally* Just getting started...
---
I know every pat, every movement. I’m a fury tank, I’ve solo-tanked full runs. I know when the assassins will jump at one of my backline, I know the exact spot where and when I will get hit on the bridge while pulling the first group in the General’s room. I’ve survived multiple huntard pet dungeon pulls into Rend’a arena with 85% of the damage tanked.
---
Welcome to Upper Black Rock Spire. Did you bring your key?
---
Im not really seeing much butthurt.  Just people being realistic.  I do see a very defensive cat though
---
Nice macro you got there, mind if I borrow it?
---
Just be sappy then!
---
Can people please stop using "low key" to discribre everything it's such a overused expression. I am not mad I am just asking:)
---
Looks like a Dwarf, Gnome and Human did the Fusion dance.
---
here you go you lazy sack of shit [https://youtu.be/PAtX3OEFoRc?t=550](https://youtu.be/PAtX3OEFoRc?t=550) and some more for you since your so fucking lazy theres NO proof that this was ever determined to be the cause of loot thus making it a myth and false stop being so lazy and actually google shit for once in your life. here I got a google for you :how to not be lazy 101. cheers lazy potato muncher
---
I skipped that zone. It was so too crowded :/
---
big true
---
With good gear holy shock heals the same as a rank 1 flash of light for 10-15 times the mana cost.
---
If you use this ability in raids you are bad.
---
Lol your comments are a string of reading into shit that isn't there. Take 20 minutes, go outside or something, then come read your replies here and try to find some sense in them.
---
Are there any such pets which hold aggro to the point that you pretty much can't pull it off them? If not, which pet holds aggro the best?
---
I left Skeram due to the overwhelming horde pop. They're opening transfers to my current server, which actually seems to have a decent balance. I actually see other Alliance out in the wild.
---
I also have a hunch that that's about to be fucking destroyed.
---
Haven't see it yet, I'm sorry you're being offended by reddit... smh
---
There is always a mage. Literally. I've had not a single time where there was no mage. Be it 7pm 11pm 3am or 5am. There is always a mage.
---
That would require big brain from my part
---
They already knew all of that from the mission before this event in WC3. They all knew the grain was tainted and causing the scourge.
---
Or you just love the power?
---
08.00 UK is 24.00 west coast USA, perhaps try and find a late night guild on one of the western servers in the US? Alternatively Australian servers where 8.00 uk time is 18.00 Australian time.
---
yeah i noticed this the first time while i farmed mara.  
---
Everytime i fight tinker my shield only protects the first mindflay :-/
---
I pugged Mara last night with a pally healer.  I am happy for them to roll on my gear, they are just so confidence inspiring as a tank.

Thousand needles is good at this too

Nobody's able to log in at the moment.

I can't login either stuck logging in game server and get d/c .

Same on gehennas
---
As an alliance on Herod I agree we need more alliance to purge the horde filth. But when you are always outnumbered it gets tiring and when I am going to an instance I’d rather not waste my time dying constantly and just spend it inside the instance dying over and over rather than to pvp.
---
Then Im not alone
---
Same here mate, EU - Golemagg
---
same here (EU), stuck at "logging into game server"
---
Probably a common question, but as a 60 Holy Priest (300 Tailor/Ench) what are my best options for goldmaking now that DM:E lashers have been nerfed? Was sort of relying on that!
---
Is it worth levelling fishing as effectively a gathering profession? Finding a tailoring niche? Hawking enchants in Trade? Spamming dungeons with AoE groups for DEs and drops?
---
Look, I love kitty Druid as much as anyone, but this is a dumb attention seeking post. The logs speak for themselves. 
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs com.com/zone/statistics/1001#dataset=90
---
The best Druids are doing about 65% of the DPs of the best Rogues on Onyxia. These numbers are lower in MC. 
---
Raid how you want, you do you, but don’t pretend cat Druids are good in the raid meta. They are and always will be sub par.
---
What is it
---
Yup getting the same error!
---
Same thing happened to razorgore a week ago. Might get automatically fixed in 10-20 minutes.
---
As someone who played wow for 3 years from BC to LK, the hunter icon doesn't look like a bow. It looks like a staff.
---
It's all about communication with your group. If you are laying out basic instructions but people still aren't listening, it doesn't matter what you do. If you mark skull as the first to kill yet before you get more than one sunder off the rogue/mage pops all their cooldowns to top the meter, just move on to X and keep aggro on that. Taunt the skull off if it's still in melee range when it's off cooldown but otherwise just leave it for whoever pulled it. The problem you need to manage is keeping them off of your healer.
---
That doesn't mean you should leave the DPS to die if they pull aggro, the balance is knowing when it's an accident compared to incompetence. If they are doing it consistently then it's not on you, it's on them.
---
Just keep grinding away, it gets better when you have more tools later on but depending on the group you are screwed if it's bad no matter the level. Oh and stick with a shield. You might do more damage with a 2h but you hit slower, generally have less rage and each hit you take will be significantly harder for your healer to deal with.
---
You rolled horde on herod because you wanted a server with zero risk of dying in PvP. That’s a PvE server.
---
hf having 6k mana with a holy build.
---
Warriors are awful at leveling. Druids are pretty good.
---
Cool beans.

---
None of the other responses here really adressed this. Undeads aren't immune to fear. Will of the forsaken breaks charm, fear and sleep and gives immunity for 5 seconds and is on a 2 minute cooldown.
---
I played an undead warrior back in vanilla and sure it really helps against warlocks, but you can reapply it after it breaks. Warlocks also have a huge health pool and are harder to burst down. If you go warlock you will be one of the best PvP classes overall.
---
Warlocks are also really good for levelling as you said. Can be somewhat boring though as you just send your pet, use dots and drain life/wand.
---
Profession-wise mining goes well with engineering. It's also a good money maker if you spend time mining as so many people are going engineering this time round.
---
Personally I hate mining nodes or picking flowers so I'd go skinning to make money as you can do that on the go.
---
Cheers, appreciate the feedback :) ironically though, that is me, the most sincere version of me possible

Can people stop using smiley faces at the end of their sentences. It's not punctuation. I'm not mad just like to complain about trivial things for no reason.

Warlocks can tank dungeons. It has its limitations but it works.

Just got a spare hour to do some leveling after some days off. FML
---
[Icy Veins] (https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pve-stat-priority) has some stat priorities, where you basically compare them to attack power.
---
If we go by their calcs, then 2% crit is ~64 AP, and 23 agility is 
---
~57,5 AP. So the crit wins out. This assumes you have 5/5 Mortal Shots.
---
I have 5.8k mana, and barely finish off 1 pack with power infusion, before I run oom. Don't think it's quite as easy as you imply. I would suggest 6k mana, and power infusion.
---
Again, where do you get these assumptions?
---
Yeah,  makes sense. Everything just seems to sound a lot better in my head than in practice :)
---
I'm having the same issue. Unfortunate.
---
You sound like you never experienced people repeating the same crap over and over.
---
same here, cant log in, EU Stonespine

I feel ya, its a moment of pleasure when one aint able to play for long

Literally every single pvp server is horde dominated.  I doubt queues will be that great for them.

This exactly. Don't delete this level 17 though. Keep him as a bag mule and profession slave!
---
I feel like having a penalty of any kind wouldn't be well received by many people at all. Outright punishing people because they happened to end up on the larger side is a bit harsh IMO.
---
That said, I could definitely get behind a gradual buff of some sort for the smaller side. Nothing game breaking, and nothing that the larger side would miss by not having it, but also something big enough to help offset the time lost from a greater amount of time lost due to imbalanced pvp.
---
group with guildmates and friends only, its like people lose 30iq when in pug groups.
---
Curse of Shadows buffs Arcane, so its a smidge better than Nature (counter-balanced by the fact that Moonkin can't match Elemental's fundamental dps).
---
In theory, Elemental Devastation builds are the best dps offered to Shaman. However, those are tanking builds - and it's unlikely your guild is going to have Elemental/Enhancement hybrids tanking your raids even if you can solve all the other issues.
---
cringe comment
---
The hell is he tanking in a raid that would cause his non-engi shield to break first? Is he just tanking entire MC packs by himself? Blacklist that chode.
---
Didn't know you could do this! Thanks
---
I guess login server issue
---
Unless your Undead, then you can for a while, you'll be ok.
---
I made other experiences. One goes orange two go violett your tank used the portal and you wonder if maybe you should go back to Zul Farrak.
---
Comma in the wrong spot bro
---
The question is: do you want to level up fast or slow and grab some money on the way?
---
If you are fine wih mob grinding then go to Alterac and kill the Syndicate mobs. They are  lvl 34-40 and might just be the thing you are searching for.
---
They should drop silk cloth and this might just be the thing for you if you are saving money for your mount.
---
However: If you are not in a rush I never recommend questing. Don't do it at all cause questing will give you some nice extra money if you hit 60.
---
If you want to level up fast due questing skipping that extra money Stranglethorn is the place to go.
---
We all walk to quest locations. Is this a pacifist run? No combat? I doubt it’s possible, but I would love to see someone try.
---
strat live every. damn. time.

Can people stop? I'm not mad, I just like to complain about people doing the thing.
---
I guess you'll have lots of fun standing around in org showing off your tier sets for the next 4 months and fighting your own faction for nodes in the world.  Will be a great experience for you until P3.

They can layer away while you're attacking them it happens all the time.

---
&gt; We have a particularly skilled resto druid in our guild who tanks dungeons all the time in resto spec.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; He just has a feral gear swap and it's totally fine. That's just my experience though.
---
the boys over on the [Off-Meta](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) discord have actually been able to OT a few raid bosses in MC in resto caster druid from.
---
Gnomes can fit in all sorts of nooks and crannies!
---
DT wasn't massively horde favored, never felt like it as ally. That is, until free transfers a month after WotLK release. Most people at that time left due to stability issues, which were ironically fixed soon after.
---
It was a shitshow after the transfers though. As a casual guild we went from being mid-tier barely clearing to suddenly being Ally first on the server (for a few days) by barely clearing Naxx 25.
---
I quit soon after for IRL reason but its interesting to see how bad it eventually went.
---
It's a nice one. But not a new one. Seen it posted a couple of times before.
---
 dungeons  ??? impossible man.
---
Shamans are good though.
---
We're too late. These people have all been infected. They may look fine now, but it's a matter of time before they turn into the Arthas.

True. Aesthetics do play a huge part in the game. The way some people put it “hey man, if I’m going to be staring at my characters ass all day, might as well make it a hot NELF chick‘s ass.” It honestly sounds like a joke, but it has way more merit than I ever gave it credit for.
---
As someone from an RP server, it's pretty easy to fit in as a non-RPer. Just follow two simple rules:
---
A. Have a non-stupid name
---
B. Don't intrude on people RPing with emotes and spam and spell effects, etc.
---
So long as you're not actively trying to ruin RP for those who want it, you're set. The only people who have problems with non-annoying non-RPers are the kinda people even other RPers hate.
---
Let’s say your on a 70% horde server, on average when out in the world they’ll be 7 horde to every 3 alliance.
---
If you’re alliance: you’re questing and horde decide to attack you, your questing is over, there’s not enough alliance around to help you, and if you fight back you’ll be ambushed and outnumbered by the horde for the next hour. Eventually you’ll give up attacking horde for fun because it’ll only cripple your questing experience for the next hour.  
---
Now imagine this happening in every area of the game, for the next 2 years. 
---
If you’re horde: you’re out questing and alliance decide to attack you, a simple /1 “alliance attacking, need help” will be enough for you and your faction to gank the alliance and let you continue questing. Eventually the alliance will give up attacking you as it will only make things worse for themselves. Your questing experience is mildly inconvenienced, and you’re allowed to continue playing the game. 
---
Going back to your question “I never understand why people want to play the dominant faction on a skewed server”. This is why. There is no benefit or bonus for going the weaker faction, people enjoy an even fight in world pvp, nobody likes being outnumbered, camped, and ganked in PvP, which is what you’re asking for if you go the 30% alliance.
---
I have a question about this. Is there no '1 mana pot per fight' restriction in classic? I have not been able to find this information surprisingly.
---
fuck him
---
I'm on the 40% side and i kill probably 3-4 for every death i get in pvp. Buy a few grenades, get a few pvp trinkets and you're gonna win every duel. Spec SL and people will need to 2v1 you to even have a chance.

---
You’re right. The ones in the south are around level 49-50 and the ones in the north are 54 ish. I did the first quest to kill them in the south and then was going to grind them but it was much too busy to get any decent xp per hour. 
---
Then I went to the north to pick the next quest up but they were too high level for now.
---
Stack high INT gear and enchants. You'll be able to out mana everything.
---
Most I’ve encountered are unfortunately...  I can’t stand talking to people who beat a bad lock in a duel/wpvp who then wanna argue how easy it to beat a lock, when any decent lock should win EVERY 1v1 vs any class

Nope cooldowns aren't locked in combat, mana pots have 2 minute cooldown so if the fight is longer than 2 minutes you can drink more than 1 pot
---
Yeah, that sums it up.
---
can a warrior beat a mage  if they use potions?
---
Same here
---
I’m having the same issues. Tried both manual log in and through BNet, neither work
---
Venoxis EU also down - same issue -_-
---
And it's nearly pointless on huntards bc we have feign death
---
DM is a minimal upgrade. It helps a few classes like locks/pallys with mounts or mages with water, but the gear drops are pretty poop
---
the amount of threat generated is directly linked to damage, and indirectly to speed.
---
damage: cats and raptors both have +10% DPS compared to all other pets, meaning they have around +10% more threat than every other pet. Adding in abilities like Claw/Bite, this goes up to even more
---
attack speed: attack speed doesn't increase the DPS or threat directly, but rather allows for a more frequent amount of crits. If you are a Beast Mastery hunter, this scales even better with Ferocity and Frenzy talents, as they increase the critical chance of your pet and allow crits to increase damage speed (without lowering base attack damage)
---
if you want the best pet for this without much hassle, go to Winterspring at 60 and tame a Frostsaber, as it has a 1.5 attack speed. Brokentooth is 50% faster, at 1.0 attack speed but levelling it/capturing it/the increase in threat are not worth it
---
Exactly the same issue with me
---
Been farming them for awhile, no drops.  You get 2 in like 4 minutes. RNGwhy?
---
I loved questing as a shadow priest. They peak at 31 with Vampiric Embrace (self heal from damage dealt). Then at 40 you get Shadow Form which is just a flat damage increases and less physical damage taken.
---
One thing i noticed when questing was that you do it better solo then in a group of 2/3. Spirit tap is such a big thing to keep you going from target to target. Mostly efficiant i found it was to just do solo mob focus and you should be able to sustain a decent pace.
---
I didnt know this when leveling but in the discipline tree there's "Wand Specilization" which is a huge thing especially early on. Might be worth to spec that and take a respec at 40 for Shadow Form :)
---
I mostly healed dungeons and for the most part it was fine.
---
Now at 60 I'm pretty much a Warlock healer and buffer in raids with improved Vampiric embrace &amp; Shadow Weaving.
---
Can very much recommend
---
Should have it done over the weekend!
---
Same :(
---
Heroic strike removes your chance to generate rage on that attack which is why it's weak. Mortal strike means your auto attacks are still generating rage. It also grants an extra chance to proc overpower.
---
I think it's a login issue only, not a specific server.
---
Holy moly. That's some luck right there.
---
Same. :(
---
they are aware:  [https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU\_EN/status/1185161105351565313](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1185161105351565313)
---
Been there done that.
---
sad panda :(
---
According to the [Realm Status page ](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-eu) you‘re all lying. (/s, can’t login either.)
---
If me and another party member are in DM waiting for the rest of the group, I'd gladly pay a warlock to summon the rest for us.
---
same for me!
---
And then BC rolls around
---
Yeah I'm just using my laptop a lot right now since Classic WoW is one of the few current games it runs beautifully.
---
That actually wasnt them. Source, I play this server with these dipshits and I'm in the discord and their leaders and players are still in it.
---
Even if that's the case, you're wasting your time and mine by not just saying the price. It's absolutely retarded to give relative pricing and there's a good reason there isn't a store on Earth that won't list their prices.
---
How is healing not meaningful? How is higher chance to resist 2 big pvp classes not meaningful?  The longer breath under water is called underwater breathing. As far as I know cannabilize works anywhere and isnt niche at all due to that.
---
I've always mained locks cause that's the first class I've rolled on vanilla. They're great levelers, do decent in dungeons, do decent in raids, do awesome in PvP.
---
Also, some of their gear pieces are WAY less contested than mage ones. I did an MC pug yesterday and came out with 3 pieces of Felheart cause we were only 3 locks. Sure, Felheart is bad in raids, but it's a good PvP set and 2 of the pieces were an upgrade. 
---
Coming out with multiple tier pieces on a mage probably would never happen, yesterday the raid had 10 or 11 mages.
---
It's because of this I'm having a hard time enjoying playing with friends. We meet up in super obscure places because it usually takes about 20 minutes for us to jump back to the same layer even if we disband and join again. It's really just destroying my guilds game experience. We formed a group to raid and when we got to SW half of us layered out.
---
Sometimes on our way to a dungeon we layer out if one of us gets attacked by an Alliance a d we can't save our teammate. Why is this still happening?
---
I still dont get it. I'm on a 40% server on the 40% side and my questing and levelling is great. Zero issues. I gank people all day long too.
---
I think it's a matter of perspective. If getting killed while questing actually upsets you then yea it might suck. To me that's why i play on a PvP server, i don't mind it at all, it just starts a quest for revenge on my part.
---
People dont camp you. That's happened to me maybe like twice. Doesn't seem like a problem at all. Of course this is just my experience, maybe it's different for you.
---
Not true; I joined a day 2 realm that is still layered.
---
I was gonna say the same thing. They got shit ton of useless info on the blizzard app and homepage. But what’s needed they do not.
---
You can solve it.  You just need to open servers with incentives to roll on whichever faction is smaller and not bigger.  And pull out bigger guns; eventually block people from rolling on the larger faction unless a friend gives them a pass to enter.
---
It will ruffle some feathers but Blizzard should be willing to weather some initial outrage for long term health of a game.
---
“Flight paths will be allowed once I’ve discovered them,” seems like a total cop-out to the cause.
---
You can purchase the book that gives the quest for the item, yes.
---
How many reruns of this do I need to do until I have my BiS for my retirement though?
---
Why do people do that sad sit up sit down shit.
---
Monkeynews . Watch his yt Videos he is by far one of the better warrior players
---
Who said anything about paying? You round robin the orbs...
---
Don't worry about your spec at all. I healed as Retri till lvl 52, I think. I wouldn't switch to Holy until 58 but I knew I will almost exclusively run dungeons from 52 because I had friends helping me out.
---
+5 weapon skill reduces glancing blow penalty from 35% to 15%, not 30% to 20%.
---
Is that drakestone of shadow power and the +21 shadow power bracers from Lord Incendius?   
---
Feels weird that you're willing to go through all that farming but aren't willing to buy upgrades from the AH.
---
Not a hunter main but from what i gathered from a friend playing one, he got recommended a bor pet with charge, which gives extra time for mobe to reach you. Interested in the "proper" answer aswell, to share with my friend.
---
Huh guess it was obvious with dire maul. I mean we had queus at weekends even before its release.
---
We get it; you secretly hunger to eat the faces of the recently deceased. Make the switch and "Beware the living"!
---
Did the entirety of IF die out?
---
its the "human" inn, meaning that its the one undead also use but the undead version is just more run down. the orc ones are just big open room huts with a table in the middle normally
---
Lmfao perfect
---
Same for me, EU Region. Dragons Call Server
---
horde are the monkeys. The whole idea of horde is to be the a brute. I mean sure go for it but imo you have a problem when you favor such a playstyle of running around in low populated alliance regions and killing low level players when there is no reason or reward for doing so.
---
He never claimed that PVE servers are the answer for everyone but it was for him.
---
Go with guild mates?
---
The pumpkin bag? Isn't that only in TBC?
---
Thanks for that! Glad theyre looking in to it
---
CMON I NEED TO FARM. SATYRS DONT KILL THEMSELVES
---
Do you have a good video to share?
---
Well tbf on current content you should use flash heal, which explain why people with nice logs run +int enchant, atleast before new dm ones. atm spirit is garbage.
---
In Hindsight I agree. Currently level 4 so i've removed the use of them.
---
Same problem and same server xd
---
 Yes
---
The amount of people that answer questions on there is slim and an actual post gets more attention.
---
Also there still is no answer to his question.
---
I can't even login on Retail, so it not limited to Classic
---
I feel like you discribed this sub, but instead of cosplay its shit like
---
&gt; People killing rag and here i am getting level 2
---
That's just a lie though. If you outgear others sure but you're not gonna outdps non-hybrids who are putting the same amount of effort as you.
---
Blizz kinda overdid it with the hybrid tax when it comes to anything but healing.
---
Same issue for me
---
Nethergarde Keep, WOW51900102
---
I've layered mid fight. That's weird
---
same
---
Damn  the saltiness of transfering server is so hard.
---
This server is balanced. It's good. I just want to let people know that who want to switch. Really don't understand the unmature responses.. But guess those people will just stay in the queues.
---
Same  here man.
---
ddoser getting his revenge monkaW
---
Same on Dreadmist EU
---
For a sec I thought getting out at 2 PM would a short workday for most but it's still a full 8 hours if you start at 6 AM. I work too much.
---
More doesn't translate to better. Raids have always been a strong point of development. It's everything else that has suffered.
---
That was a quick delete. Now I'm genuinely curious why.
---
308 reduces glancing blow penalty to the minimum of 5%, and reduces hit cap from 6% to 5.5%, which there isn't any half-hit gear, so that doesn't matter. So theoretically you only need 308, but the problem is there's really no better place to put that point. It's tied with one point in improved Evis, the only place you can really put that point (poisons are negated on Rag).
---
Yeh ddos attacks on blizzard will be a common thing now problem due to Hong Kong things
---
Looking for pvp on a pve server 🤔
---
You continue pveing
---
Thank you sir!
---
Humans have good racials for melee and gnomes are good for casters. 
---
I personally play a night elf but y'know
---
Yup :(
---
Nobody can. Already a thread about it under new

---
According to the discord faction role selection, if that metric means is any indication, Blaumeux is about 45% Alliance 55% Horde.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
With FAP yeah, but a mage can just polymorph and wait for potion to run out.
---
Basically how mage vs warrior duels work from what I've seen: warrior charges, mage nova/blink, warrior escape artist/intercept. Mage goes for poly, warrior tries to pummel it. If the poly goes off (or mage fakes it), mage resets and it's over for the warrior because no charge and no escape artist. If poly is interrupted, mage blocks and warrior has very little time after block to finish off the mage or else it's nova into poly.
---
so you won the war. congrats horde
---
I did this on my private Server with 13. But  good work 👍
---
&gt; picture of someone screaming AAAAAAA before rolling
---
Between shit like this, another example is that thex bullshit, i feel like the mods are to blame. They even changed the name that appears in the browser tap to display this AAA BS
---
bro there is no honor yet. you will be camped by ganksquads everywhere you go I promise :/
---
same, Golemagg EU
---
devistate made warrior tanking so easy to be honest when I was still playing back in warlords  I quit playing my warrior and started  playing my warlock alt as my main because tanking had become a bit boring to me. I never lost threat and the dungeons weren't that interesting. Cata was balanced poorly but I appreciated that they made an effort with the dungeons at least.
---
Back when classic was vanilla (2004) Kungen was an alright player, with lots of knowledge in a good guild. Now he's an average player in a sea of insanely good players. If you want PvP tips dont look at Kungen. Monkeynews is your best bet, one of the best PvP warriors in classic imo.
---
They are working on it apparently
---
Go play your furry in retail
---
Because there isn’t an honor system a ton of people just left each other alone.  Killing each other was just annoying and time wasting with no reward
---
This is the story of my life...   
---
40 mage
---
40 shaman
---
20 priest 
---
21 warrior 
---
20 hunter 
---
If i can tell you anything, pick the class with the fantasy you identify most with. 
---
I really just love running around windfury blasting people and I love shaman lore and the idea of being a master of the elements.   
---
Each class has power spikes at certain levels and sometimes waiting on that new kickass ability is just boring enough to push you towards an alt.  
---
Keep in mind, we may be 2 months in but were only 1/5 phases, all the gear your friends are getting now will be irrelevent in a few months,  I would say play whatever you feel most connected to,  and if you love your alts play them!
---
If I worked all day sitting in an office/cubicle I would go insane.
---
Start deleting the shitty comic/fanart threads, then. At least threads like this are informative.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Imressive
---
same Gehennas-EU
---
9% yellow attacks 11% main hand white attacks and 27% for offhand white attacks IIRC, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Well if you prefer your game to be a list of chores to do each day instead of, you know, being a fun world in which you can do what you like and create your own fun, godspeed and have fun on retail.
---
I spent 3 hours yesterday just going around the world, helping lowbies with ganker horde, having all sorts of PvP wars/ encounters spanning different zones, made some new friends along the way etc. I can't get this experience on retail.
---
 [https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU\_EN/status/1185161105351565313](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1185161105351565313)   
---
They are "working" on it...
---
Oh god, the realisation.
---
Imagine how bad it will be in P2. I honestly stopped playing, because nuking the 30% remaining alliance for three months will turn every single PvP server into a PvE one. My only goal was to PvP, main wPvP. As it stands this is a pipedream on my server (Venoxis - german) as you never get a fair fight against the alliance. Fight for 20seconds tops and you have 5-15 horde players pile ontop of the alliance player you tried to PvP fair and square.
---
&gt; bring out new content like bgs arena and raids
---
They are doing that, other than arena? Yeah it's pretty sparse right now though.
---
Thanks for the replies guys, i forgot to sort by new indeed, multiple posts on login issues already in EU
---
Always had this issue on Pservers.  But i found it hard to commit since it could go away any second - nature of pservers.  
---
My friends kept grilling me that im going to reroll 20 times etc during Classic.  
---
Funny enough i hit 60 like 12 days after launch and havent made an alt since. (Main resto shaman). 
---
Just pick one that thematically appeals the most to you.   Aswell as a role you like and perhaps what is needed.  My closes friends are warrior, lock and mage.  Naturally i enjoy support, so i went with Shaman.  It was also my main the past 2 expansions - it was holy pala prior to that since Tbc.  
---
So pick a role/theme/lore reason you like and just build on that.  
---
Dont fall prey to the ”grass is greener” feeling. It comes and goes - just focus on yours.
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/blizzardcseu_en
---
This is awesome. I’ll get this now.
---
I can totally relate to this except I create 3d all day so I can play 3d all night!
---
But what bridge do you stand on to brag?
---
Is there math on why it is like this, or is it just based on your experience?
---
Source?
---
I've found finishing (stonescale eels etc.) Is significantly worse profit than on  private servers. Something you can do is find a tank and dps friend and do DME jump runs; have someone with enchanting, someone with herb and someone with mining and you can make upwards of 40g an hour.
---
I was gonna laugh but then I remembered I'm still lvl 57 and started on day 1.
---
I'm praying AV is in on time for Christmas. Knockback with hardpacked snowball on the bridge and propelling AFK people from the tunnel to the road so that they can be farmed by the horde was my favourite time of year...
---
Oh.. damn I can't change it now
---
Take that back
---
That's what he should be doing when not healing. Unless the mobs are cleaving I guess. I'm a priest, and am constantly wanting while I am not healing. Heck, most of the thought process I have while healing is whether or not I should flick on shadow form and VE heal a pull, or if it really needs a dedicated healer. Having an extra dps reduces quite a bit of damage, cuz stuff dies 20% faster.
---
Changed to title to let people know how it is. Instead of forcing players to come here... Because people are mad being positive about a server.
---
Raids were a very different beast in Vanilla, the first few bosses in MC are just tank &amp; spank. They tried to make things more interesting from there on.
---
Strangely enough, mention anywhere on classicwow subreddit that druids can’t tank and you get ripped to shreds by little bear claws. Mention it on the official wow forums and you start a debate. Know your audience I guess.
---
The "humor" and fanart comics are the real spam.
---
My tip would be: just find something that you are comfortable with and try to build muscle memory! 
---
I'm using the following setup and it works great for me (I'm mainly Feral Tank):
---
**UI SETUP / ADDONS**
---
I am using **REDTUZKUI CLASSIC** (Mod based on ElvUI), which I really like, because it is kind of minimalistic and well designed. Not much stuff there that takes attention from you (e.g. have set it up, so that it only shows my own buffs/debuffs on party/target). 
---
I have extended this UI with a **DruidManaBar** Addon, which I think is obligatory and probably the only Addon you really need as a Druid. Besides that I can totally recommend a wardrobe addon like **ItemRack,** which lets u change to different outfits, depending on your form or state.  I of course use also other addons, but they are not really thaaaat necessary to perform well. But a Manabar and Wardrobe Addon are mandatory I would say.
---
The Main Actionbar of RedtuzkUI is setup the way, that it switches abilities depending on your Form. But the Hotkeys and Binds stay the same. So e.g. my lower left mouse btn always has the main attack ability in every form. This helps to build muscle memory a lot and makes you think less in combat.
---
These are the Keybinds I use (and have gotten very comfortable with):
---
**MOUSEBINDS**
---
||Default / Castform|Bearform|Catform|
---
|UPPER LEFT SIDE BTN|Moonfire (Highest Rank)|Swipe|Ferocious Bite|
---
|SHIFT + UPPER LEFT SIDE BTN|Moonfire (Lowest Rank)|||
---
|LOWER LEFT SIDE BTN|Wrath|Maul|Claw|
---
|SHIFT + LOWER LEFT SIDE BTN|Fairy Fire|Fairy Fire (Feral)|Fairy Fire (Feral)|
---
|MIDDLE MOUSE BTN|(Cancel Form and go) Mount|
---
|SHIFT + MIDDLE MOUSE BTN|(Cancel Form and go) Travel or Aquatic Form|
---
**KEYBOARD**
---
|F1|Mark of the Wild|
---
|SHIFT + F1|Gift of the Wild|
---
|F2|Thorns|
---
|1-8|Rebirth, Hurricane, Hibernate, Starfire, Soothe Animal, Cower, Frenzied Regeneration, Barkskin|
---
(1-8 are Skills you should not use that often)
---
|V|(Cancel Form and go)  Bearform|

|SHIFT + V|(Cancel Form and go)  Catform|
---
|CTRL + V|Cancel any Form|
---
||Default / Castform|Bearform|Catform|Cat Stealthed|

---
|F|Healing Touch|Bash|Rake|Pounce|
---
|G|Remove Curse/Abolish Poison (Macro)|Demoralizing Roar|Prowl||
---
|SHIFT + G||Challenging Roar|Dash||
---
Hope that helps a bit and gives some inspiration ;-)
---
Heh, nice try!
---
Killswitch!
---
Playing wow in general solo is not fun at all
---
Playing duo fucking epic
---
Playing with 2 morons new to the game hell
---
Horde heavy, but the Alliance still has Stonetalon Peak, which is more than the Horde has in Redridge or Duskwood
---
I think the words you were looking for were "I'm sorry."
---
You've been a mod here for 9 days and already have a bad attitude?
---
If you want to help the community enjoy the game and to help users to have a positive experience here, you have to set the tone, be the good example.
---
As someone who put in a mod application, this is a pretty disappointing response.
---
Fucking glad in not you
---
Ah yes cuz a fully twinked out char with enchants isn’t with PvP in mind isnt op.
---
Does it hurt you like it hurts me when I hear of duel spec?
---
Just over a week and a half.  I had another rogue that was dedicated to helping me get mine.  He got his on our 15th run and since we were 2 manning it, we thought it would only be another 15 mins or so.  Man were we wrong.  I gotta give him kudos for sticking it out so long after he already got his, though.  He's a super awesome dude.  We threw in a UBRS here and there, since one time on a saturday we did 50 runs in a row and finally needed a break.  You can only say "It's going to drop this time, for sure" so many times before your soul starts to whither and die. lol.  We were rewarded by getting him his dal rends MH after 2 additional runs, as well.
---
Uther: Have the sickly and dying tied up. Not everyone might infected - I know Tricia there can't have gluten. Ban all forms of travel in and out of the city. Send word to Azeroth Health Organization of this threat and have all doctors and wizards research for a cu

Arthas: **DEAAATHHH!!!**
---
Purely a feels before reals statement.
---
Levelling as a holy priest, that's called masochism isn't it? Anyways, at 22 you can find pvp in Hillsbrad as others have said, but most likely, you'll be outlevelled here. Try Ashenvale instead.
---
I have First aid maxed as holy pala. When you run out of mana you can heal people with bandages and allow 5 seconds rule to kick in. You can't heal tank this way obviously.
---
oke ty for your farewell letter, goodbye
---
on a side note, how is your ad rep? do you have shoulder/pants enchant yet? can you douse runes, have you killed raggy and ony? maxxed out your professions? wpvp while grinding ores/herbs/cloth? are you riding another factions mount or do you even have a epic riding mount? how are your enchants? are you exalted with the pirates yet so whole bb hates you? you stacked on tubbers yet , nades etc for p3 yet? learned to speedrun instances yet? helped your m8 who's struggeling to get 60? 
---
i dunno just some suggestions... but again ty for your farewell letter, we will miss you
---
Haha i just started this quest last night on my Horde server. I was wondering if I just was having bad luck.
---
SWORDS &gt; AGI
---
I agree, great comic, work on the words
---
I haven't touched a single setting in the debuffs/buffs before the ElvUI decided to no longer show my pet's debuff(s), restored everything to default just to be double sure.
---
Submitted the potential bug to ElvUI forums.
---
I would love to see more complex/difficult raid and dungeon content like retail has but everything else can piss off.
---
40% isn’t as drastic, on average, for every 6 horde, there’s 4 alliance. Near alliance questing zones you’ll have an even amount of more alliance players. One faction will have 1.5 times more players. 
---
When you get as low as 30% split then one faction has over double the amount as the other faction (2.3x the amount)
---
At 20% split one faction has 4x the amount as the other. 
---
The servers with 20-30% faction imbalance will be the main issues. I believe the Westfall server is 90% alliance. 
---
Don’t quote me on anything I’ve said though, I’m luckily in one of the most evenly split servers in classic (Mograine-EU), so I’m mostly speaking from what I’ve heard from other people.
---
The dungeons should require to kill all mobs before letting kill you bosses, that would stop the try hard skippers.
---
Did they say they wouldn't roll on caster items?
---
Laughs in exalted
---
9 or 10% is enough for raids. If your human 6 or 7% with swords is good. Rogues have it easy with a 5% hit in talent points so they can go 12%+. I would recommend getting 9% hit then stacking crit + ap.
---
Humanoid and undead which are alot of mobs + anyone in pvp. Yea it is a small chance doesnt mean it aint meaningful. Just saying something aint meaningful doesnt make it so. Orc is better but saying undead only is wotf is dumb when cannabilize is one of the more useful racials. I like the im gonna post saying something is useless when it aint then stomp out xD
---
[Classic-warrior](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#officially-confirmed-by-blizzard) github is an excellent source to look up this info.
---
I can spam stealth if its on a different click also then I dont have to worry about fumbling anything that uses ctrl, alt or shft + mb4
---
So the fact that you rushed through levelling (the whole point of vanilla) and now complain that there is a limited amount of stuff to do at endgame (a fairly universally acknowledged fact) is a surprise how?

Some [~~#~~**WoW**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WoW?src=hash) [~~#~~**WoWClassic**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WoWClassic?src=hash)📷 players may be experiencing latency or disconnections. We are investigating this now.
---
what can i say except... you're welcome
---
I am you.
---
53 hunter, 28 warrior, 22 warlock, 21 shaman, 12 priest, 11 rogue, 10 mage :p.
---
Again, I too fun them fun, and love to jump back and forth.  While my urge is to keep doing this, and clearly I am... what I try to motivate myself with is that my 50+ character makes gold so much faster (even by just questing), so if I play her (female troll of course) more, I'll be able to lavish my leveling alts with some gear and 40 mounts, making the alt leveling even more fun.
---
As for missing out... if your friends are raiding right now, then I agree you might want to push to raid content with them.  But if you just want to see content regardless of who you see it with, then I wouldn't worry too much. I think there will be people running them for a while (though I might be wrong).
---
So fun. Too fun.  Maybe I need a druid...
---
can you list you mana gear if it's that good please. I have to admit thant seeing i'm at 4700 mana or so with normal gear I didn't even bother looking for a mana set as it seemed unfeasible. But yeah I guess some good int pieces must exist.
---
Jump runs (DM:east boss rush) seem to be the best option now. It's possible with 2 man but quite hard unless you find a really good warrior. Ideally you want to have mining+herb+enchanting and try to get them to split rewards 50/50 because a good chunk will come from arcane crystals.
---
Felcloth gloves are insanely profitable right now if you can find buyers, but the price should drop very very soon. You need to farm demonic runes for them, 6 per craft.
---
Rather they should've prevented creation of horde/alliance characters if it skewed too heavily towards one side
---
fear has glitched me under the map at least 3 times now. 2 of the times they feared me into the "whirl" of a dungeon entrance and it just threw me under the map, and had to hearth everytime..idk just seems like fear is all kinds of fucked up
---
wait i answered without realizing, but there is no healing to int ratio in classic. Basically it's just that mana is better than mana regen at this point. And 9healing is king.
---
Ill try and post a list when i get back from work.
---
Think about it for a moment.
---
If you're on a PvE realm, the amount of people competing against you, that you can attack, is 0%.
---
If you're on a 70-30 realm, the amount, given that the overall population is representative of the population you're competing in, is 30%.
---
not a fan of the mods of this subreddit. its not just you, bud.
---
they think the pvp racials will be a crutch
---
There are non adult players?
---
Farm Cairne Bloodhoof in Thunder bluff as Alliance.
---
Yeah it's not so bad actually, the amount of time to do those quests ( even at 60 ) is basically the same amount of time it'll take me to farm the gold cost of the runecloth.
---
I knew it from the begining. The massive « horde &gt;50% of the population on pvp server » 
---
Everyone knows that people are rolling horde when you like pvp... but pvp, like tango, takes 2 to dance.
---
Personally, knowing this, I chose alliance to be able to have plenty of BGs without having to wait. 
---
You can still reroll alliance ;)
---
Retail is like path of exile. I enjoy seeing all the people around me, but I actually play it like a single player game. I wouldn't realize if my group members in the dungeon are bots.
---
The whole point of vanilla isn't leveling, though :)
---
This ^
---
They dropped an epic with sinew in its name for me, my bank account is pretty sure
---
Its a personal opinion but 4 pane webcomics works best when you observe mostly, rather than read a lot of text.
---
If you going for a short and simple comic that promotes a laugh at the end then you need to cut the words down significally, like the 3rd pane should just be like "What's that over there?" and bam you move on to the punchline. 
---
In this comic case you already guessed the outcome by pane 2 so reading so much extra just deflates the laugh imo at the end.
---
This is an example of what im talking about keeping it short and simple: https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/byqb5r/oc_life_is_like_roasting_a_marshmallow/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
Notice how quickly one goes through each pane, you dont get time to think of the punchline and it just works much better.
---
Otherwise, loving the art and premise, there is so many funny situations to make from Wow Classic, would love to see more.
---
login screen
---
Thank you everyone for your help. Now i know that it's no problem to spec in Ret and heal 5 man dungeons. I installed a gear manager addon and will collect a heal set to switch to when healing dungeons.  :) Regarding the level to fully switch to holy i think i will just look whats fine for me but i heard, like some of you already said, that it is no problem until 50 and a bit above.
---
There are Addons like MiksScrollingCombatText that announce sword spec procs.
---
Agreed, also the meme that horde racials are better for pvp, the faction draws wannabe pvp heroes who in reality are just bad and grab any advantage they can
---
Classic is an MMO. Retail is an RPG.
---
This seems like the kind of dwarf that'd offer to wash it for you...
---
Got it on my first run lol
---
fix the fucking game already REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Idk why anyone would transfer when the most popular servers already start feeling little dead if you like to play off-peak hours. Also leveling alt and I rarely see groups forming for elites in general unlike on first char.
---
I assume you are referring to Illidan. I never saw illidan as evil. I always saw that he was trying to stop the burning legion and while some “good characters” framed that as his own selfishness, I actually always believed he was a chaotic good character. 
---
I also believe they are trying to make some evil characters more than just two dimensional villains but yes some of the retcons have been pretty bad.
---
If only I could go back home after work with a /stuck command
---
If you're horde then duskwood is pretty good but it takes some effort to get there.
---
Pve server
---
Pvp
---
Lmao
---
Know how to request it?
---
Weird, druids are my favorite classes to group with, usually better tanks than warriors and know their class well. Only downside is if there isn't anothet class that can res in the party.
---
If you’re looking for a solo leveling power house... it’s hunter hands down.... no class in the game can compete with its effectiveness in leveling...
---
Ware and pally go arms/ret and tank like that...just have a shield for pally, warr can 2 hand tank until like 50 
---
Shaman and Druid are pretty good in between... good damage lots of utility also ghost wolf and travel form
---
Mhmm i don't even start looking til am at the instance
---
&gt;:(
---
yep they are fixing it, read the log next to the login error ingame lol
---
NEETS BTFO
---
Why would you tame it? There are many raptors that have the same model.
---
I'm pretty much looking for the same. Currently on Ashbringer leveling  while waiting to see what direction my guild takes.
---
I'm basically looking for a guild that will go with the shaman tank, let the hunter try to prove his pet can do it, let subpar dps get chances to improve and most of all willing to teach and learn eachother.
---
that isnt engi hat
---
nor is it vectus neck
---
those arnt sublime bracers
---
nor ar those hand of power
---
those arnt malaki's footwraps
---
and thats just your thrall trinket not burst of knowledge
---
so no ... no alt for you yet
---
Growl + bite for world content
---
Claw for dungeons and raiding
---
Claw+bite isnt great, but offers a more bursty opener. The difference just isnt significant enough though. You could also manipulate claw casts in a way that allows your pet to use bite whenever its available, resulting in slightly higher dps, but this isnt ever going to be worth the trouble so forget about it
---
Look at the github for most information but short version:
---
300 weapon skill: 9% yellowcap, 27% white hits
---
305 weaponskill(or above) 6% yellow cap, 24% yellow hit.
---
Don't worry about hitting the yellow cap at all, once you are yellowcapped you can start treating hit like any other stat, 1%hit should be quite worse than 1% crit. Also if you learn the new heroic strike trick you only ever need yellow cap. More info on the warrior discord:  [https://discordapp.com/invite/RbCZJtw](https://discordapp.com/invite/RbCZJtw)
---
both
---
That feels like a lot of micromanagement especially if you're already doing melee weaving!
---
&gt; It's not unusual to get a followup message 24-48 hours later.
---
Very unusual, speaking anecdotally.  After more than a dozen times it's never happened.
---
I play hunter and just have a threat meter active 100% of the time.
---
I often end up using my own target macros in groups because people don't target healers &amp; casters 1st for some reason.
---
I started playing originally in TBC though when group CC in dungeons was a must.
---
Didn't the Launcher say something about LoginServer maintenance today.
---
I seem to recall seeing that yesterday. 
---
I remember wondering about it since it said maintenance, and you would not be able to log in, but you would not be disconnected if you were already logged in.
---
what do you play the most
---
You still sound like a dick with this
---
I saw a homeless person (Bags, the whole 9 yards) playing WoW on the wifi in Union Square. Priorities.
---
I posted a lfg tonight....tank lfg ubrs and within seconds had like 10 whispers. Made me laugh. But, I will say leveling a warrior was pretty terrible. I made the switch to prot around 55 and those last levels were brutal.
---
I guess.
---
Queue same faction battlegrounds.
---
Problem solved!
---
An addon won’t mean shit for showing locations if you aren’t at the appropriate lockpicking level, just like gatherer giving you dreamfoil locations doesn’t help if your herbalism is 125.  Every set of lockpicking boxes for leveling is concentrated in a small area, so stop being lazy, ask a rogue trainer, and go level it.
---
Classic isn't for everyone, thanks for giving it a try.
---
As a mage I actually feel unstoppable in PvP whilst there's no PvP trinkets. 
---
I do envy warlocks though, they are tankier and have multiple ways to PvP where as mage I feel like I have a set rotation and yu gi oh trap cards when certain things happen 
---
E.g.
---
Blind happens, I block.
---
If that is what you want then classic is not for you. Just go play retail why even bother??
---
Have I?
---
Nice account name
---
You wanna pvp? gurubashi arena!
---
Pretty good!
---
I agree with you. OP has a point, a little chaos makes things interesting, but, constantly running around trying to taunt back 3 different mobs while ragestarved cause the mage decided to cast blizzard before my charge had even landed, and doesn't listen when you tell them to focus single target and skull first... But this is a sign of bad communication, either they're not listening to you, or you're not talking to them about how stuff should be done. As long as the communication goes well, most people can be thaught to do their job properly.
---
Sure, so what's the drop rate?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=17780    (1%)
---
or
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blade_of_Eternal_Darkness    (0.1%)
---
I'll whip out the calculator.
---
Mobs are literal interactive lootboxes...
---
7 weeks to 60 is not rushing, for fuck's sake.
---
It's the fucking highest resolution I have ever seen in my life, good catch bro!
---
New to YouTube. If ya dig WoW Classic and other videogames, stop by :) Constructive criticism is always welcome!
---
Don't xfer he is tricking you to go to dead server
---
Imo get the epic mount now cause it's a ROI in a way, faster farming and whatnot.
---
If you're actually planning on maining the warrior then do that instead though.
---
Were you loyle to your capo?
---
Couple things here:
---
1. How do I keep from going insane farming Blue Dragon Sinew. I know about the AV one but I just want to have the best possible one for my hunter.
---
2. What is a good gold farm for me? I'm not to keen on soloing instances, so like a mindless mob kill would be fine by me
---
Jokes on u I do landscaping and construction for a living :(
---
I play Skeram so it’s still busy as hell.
---
Why would people be against those ideas?! ugh.
---
Then blizzard and ea and capcom every other aaa game dev needs to be much more evil and greedy to be more hated and get more money
---
I’m not him, but yeah I’m revered AD, but my Libram enchant, got my darn mount, fully pre-BiS and enchanted, have enough consumes for 6 raids, got the best speed clear times in the game, and have a second full pre BiS alt.
---
Classic is way easier than retail for hardcore gamers atleast.
---
 
---
I seem to recall seeing that yesterday.
---
Any chance you could enlighten me on the heroic strike mechanic? I've heard that while it's charging, all your off-hands get 100% hit rating. If you could direct me somewhere possibly where I could read more on this?
---
Some faction changes were disabled by now. Imagine being stuck now on a server without queues and 20/80 alliance/horde and phase 2 world PvP looming.
---
This right here is stuff why people will quit.
---
Not even a good RPG at that.
---
Gz for finishing university!
---
SL Locks.
---
It's very basic data, everyone should be able to access it. But I guess it's probably a secret so P servers can't copy them.
---
Same here.
---
Excellent guide! Heres an upvote!
---
for dual wielding shields, obviously!
---
 I read these sorts of posts often and just laugh. Everytime it's:
---
"Ehermagad Classic Suuuuckkksss and its gonna be DeD in a wreeek. U R all so meeeeeeen to meeeee!!!!" 
---
I am convinced that these people are current BFA players and are just jealous that retail sucks and that they wasted their time convincing themselves it was worth playing for the last 3 years. Also for someone who is adamant about communicating properly, your posting was woefully composed and very inarticulate.
---
Why would it be nerfed?
---
Anything with Screech. The debuff component has a noticeable threat generation, to the point where the Owl will hold aggro without Growl if I don't crit.
---
thank you 😀
---
This is so true haha

---
Retail is nowhere near classic, I'd rather mindlessly grind mobs in Classic for 10 hours a day
---
Im on my feet 10 hours a day running back and forth through the kitchen trying to make food for hundreds of people so I can sit and play for 1 or 2 hours a day.
---
Mods keep removing my shitpost I'm getting mad
---
Oh right, I see now how you meant it, I looked at it from an overall standpoint.
---
Another bonus is that you even have it easier to sell your stuff, since 70% are potential buyers. 
---
The only problem is if the imbalance keeps increasing you'll end up on a shitty realm if you value any hostile interaction at all. Once the balance drops below a certain point there is no realistic return possible anymore. :/
---
1.5s GCD Holy Shock vs 1.5s cast time FoL. If your tank so low you’re considering holy shock, you should just lay on hands and make a real attempt to save them instead. Either way you’re low in mana and you can pot a a major mana pot to get back in the fight.
---
I think let's discuss about "Meta". There is a Meta.
---
Is it faster if you kill bosses with "Meta methods"? Yes. A little bit. But not much. Every stupid discussion about any loot will last longer than the time you win from this.
---
For whom is the "Meta"? It is for high organized guilds that want to rush through the content.
---
They are like a ballet. They are boring cause everybody knows this stuff from an old game.
---
The purpose of Classic is to do exactly what you do: seek new interesting ways beside the Meta that are fun and harder to execute than the Meta.
---
Anybody talking about a "Meta" on a game that is so old misses the point of a "Meta".  A Meta is helping you to go where no one has gone before. A Meta is pointless if it is an old game.
---
A Meta is nothing that is fun or interesting or even nessecary in Classic.
---
Classic is about playing for fun. You can't have fun when you play the same old boring "Meta" that will never change.
---
Beside that you will not have that feeling until you hit Naxx in the coming content. Cause the Loot you gez from MC and BWL do not support you in your feral gameplay.
---
You will be wanted for you buff. Some people do have a problem with that. I say those should reroll Druid if they think that is so easy.
---
undead have 6 base crit.
---
So you play a healer at work then?
---
Are you horde on Westfall? I'm Ally and I feel like LFG is decently active... We're also frequently listed as full so ???
---
Is that like a personal attack or something
---
Become BFF with every tank on the server helps aswell.
---
Once you're using Aimed Shot, what would you say is the absolute fastest weapon speed you should use?
---
Personally, I draw the line at 2.6 weapon speed. Anything faster is going to have to have a significant DPS increase to be able to realise an actual DPS increase.
---
And additonally, PVE realms with potentially more Alliance chars have less people queue for BGs there because they simply attract people utterly disinterested in any PVP what so ever, so it's actually a double whammy in imbalance regarding BG queues. It was this way in Vanilla, it's going to be the same way in classic.
---
But same like complaining about the lack of tanks, instead of actually playing one, people rather complain and expects that someone magically fixes the problem for them. Good luck, maybe after 15 years it works... ?
---
Similar thing was happening in retail as of at least Legion. The zep to UC was always super glitchy and sometimes would drop you in Stonetalon after the loading screen.
---
I noticed I lean to my left when I sit down. My posture sucks :(
---
Toy planes
---
Also mages are blessed with the most mind-numbingly "complex" single target dps rotation. Whether or not you consider this a pro or con is left up to interpretation.
---
I can’t get any blues and this guy was double Barb and Defias set. :( 
---
Alright, I’ll give DM a couple more runs!
---
On my ass all day curing computer viruses, still glad to sit my ass in another chair 2-4 hours to play wow at night.
---
Of paper?
---
I'd buy it, besides abilities and professions there aren't a ton of things you can spend that money on anyways.
---
Just wait a bit longer (hopefully) the remastered will be out by then
---
You're a legend mate. 
---
So let's say in a raid environment: BT / WW on cd. Use that Heroic Strike macro, then BT / WW again once off CD. Rinse and repeat? Should I throw in the occassional actual Heroic Strike to rage dump or prefer Hamstring for a windfury / HoJ procc?
---
That hardly seems like a good reason for people to migrate to Earthshaker, though.
---
What do you write? And thank you. I am a "writer" myself and it is a new experience to mix it with drawing. Guess it's a "less is more" situation :D
---
If bis drops for any of my specs I'm rolling idc lol.
---
Thanks for the tip! I am using a blur snowball and it doesn’t seem like they are a directional microphone unfortunately, I think my quick fix for the time being will be to use my old non-mechanical keyboard. It is significantly less loud.
---
Haha when I saw the title I knew it was gonna be filled with angry positivist clinging to their “universal truth”. Keep on raking m8! You’re doing great !
---
Because you're an idiot and probably trolling.
---
Nope, it won't do anything your free one does.
---
Shazzara =(
---
Dire maul release = more players
---
It's not based on whether people think I can tank or not, barely anyone has any qualms with 5-mans.
---
It's that the ratio of tanks required in raids is so low that many guilds don't feel the need to have one, or the one feral slot in their guild is taken. I simply can't find a guild with tank spot open. That's true for warriors as well, as literally any guild I've seen recruiting warriors wants fury.
---
I just hit 49 last night so right in the same boat.  I can't imagine you are having trouble finding groups unless you are refusing to tank.
---
These kind of things are kind hypocritical to be honest. Most of the people complaining about it, would not care a single fuck about China if that situation with Blizzard would not have happened.
---
This post speaks to me and my organization.
---
Are you and adult who is leveling slowly due to the crushing weight on responsibility? Did you make a great decision and roll Horde on Bigglesworth? &lt;Adults With Jobs&gt; is now hiring! Check out adultswithjobs.com for more information!
---
With your dtrst ud example it's probably faster 4manning than bringing a lvl 56 because you can skip so many packs, not because it's hard.
---
People say that now.  I think most will give up relatively quickly.  There's a couple major problems.  Most people are wearing glass cannon gear with no stamina. Really squishy.  Another problem is that most people just give up when you engage them.  Some will even stand there waiting to die.  Now is the time you need to learn how to play your character in pvp.  You're not going to just magically be good at it when phase 2 gets here.
---
No, there is 0 point while you're leveling. If you don't need to spend 90+ gold, why would you?
---
Thread reminds me why I never want to be a mod.
---
Good to know!
---
It might not be flat out, but it's still relatively quick.
---
If you're getting to 60 in less than 10 days /played, you're almost certainly going for speed to some extent. And even less than 12-14 days played means that you are focused on getting to 60, rather than enjoying the journey.  Take your time, level professions as you go, smell the flowers...
---
It's perfectly possible to fit that much /played into 7 weeks, but 40 hours a week (consistently; week in, week out) is more than average.  I'd also assume that OP has not only just hit 60 - there is some content to do at max after all.
---
No one wants to tell others how to play.  It just surprises me when players are all focused on getting 60 and then realise there's not a huge amount to do there - this is common knowledge!
---
And nice use of language by the way.
---
Nice! Thank you
---
Yes.. I was very confused. I guess it was my second offense. I had a monk named Getfistedbro that was forced to rename, but like monks use their fists to attack so I don't understand...
---
Working as intended.
---
I'm hoping that will enhance the LAN experience of the game. We always have trouble setting up the current version.
---
Love it.
---
&gt;workout
---
*Laughs in overactive metabolism*
---
People don't want faction balance, they want to be on the winning side but with enough people to gank.
---
Except maybe not frighten the neighbors.
---
Yup. I once worked a construction job and every day I was jealous of the people who could go to and from work clean as a whistle. Now I've got that and I love it. I can also have a fresh cup of coffee in a mug (not a to-go cup) right next to me, I can get up anytime I want to stretch or run to the bathroom, I can make a quick call to my bank or wherever. I love having an office job.
---
Thanks for the tip! 😀
---
What is a pug?
---
Definitely toy kind, might as well be paper, super thin aluminum. 777 and 777x
---
Show is only 39 minutes long. We know what you do with that extra minute you devil you!
---
Rank 4 heal &gt; flash heal. 
---
It heals more than a flash heal at nearly half the MP and scales really well with +healing.
---
What I feel is missing in these guides all the time is the reg-efficiency.
---
Thing is that it may appear more mana-efficient at first glance if you use the most mana-effienct rank.
---
But you are constantly casting and never get out of the 5-second-rule.
---
If you look over the potential healing over a longer time-frame, let's say 5 minutes, then the most efficient way of healing would be to burst out your best HPS-heal and, then regenerate your mana back and then do it again.
---
Of course you have to adapt to the situation and as a single healer in a dungeon you can't do that. But if you could coordinate that in a raid, you could generate more healing with fewer healers if they take shifts with healing and regging.
---
Fair enough, I'll keep that in mind!
---
High level raids in retail are very complex.
---
You're the kind of guy that got bullied in school and now feels the need to pass it on to everyone else in order to not feel small, aren't you?
---
Just apologize for being a dick.
---
2.6 sounds reasonable to me.
---
That's a bit of an exceptional situation though, as most times the raid's shadow priest position is one that's fought over.
---
There’s got to be some other Arthas
---
There was a guild on my server "JFK was AFK"  that got flagged.  They are now "We got banned" so I assume the GL has the option to pick a new name.
---
Oh crap, was at work and forgot to dank. 
---
Ahem:
---
      Lord Uther, by my right of succession and sovereignity of my crown, I hereby relieve you from your command and suspend your paladins from service.
---
I heart aboud this 2 weeks ago.. after playing for 15 years.
---
If you have a pc job this rly must be bad.. For your back for example.
---
Nice man, you really are crazy. I salute you.
---
It's cheap enough to be worth it, if you don't have 100g you'll get it in no time doin dungeons and quests.
---
im horde yes
---
\&gt;   really expect me to google this shit? because you are too lazy. 
---
Doesn't want to do a simple google search. Calls others lazy. \*Slowclap\*
---
None of this really appeals to retail's audience tbh.
---
Well the other nice thing is, it’s going to boost the player base a bit. Original and remastered are going to be cross compatible for pvp
---
A Pickup Group
---
Because you can count the times you had to run for 28s or longer between level 40-60 on both your hands, right?
---
You know, some people propably has your job as a hobby. :)
---
The real  solution is to give real incentives. Look at the every man for himself racial that humans got and how this tipped arena participation HEAVILY into alliance favor. No sane, serious PvPer could give up the 15-25%ish damage boost the trinket gave when it procced.
---
You dont have to give ingame incentives, but if alliance logs in instantly and horde players have to wait 2 1/2 hours in queue, because the queues are seperated between factions, a lot of folks will consider switching or transferring onto an alliance heavy server like Heartseeker very fast!
---
TBC is much more better than your retail and classic combined
---
Y'know, except when he's a raid boss for the second expac and evil as *shit*.
---
Alliance have the lowest population since the lauch day in 2004 and you as a intelectual wanting a bloodbath pvp experience choose the horde side ? Why didn´t you choose Alliance them? if you and other thousands more pvp whiners had chosen to play in the lowest pop things would be more balanced and you would have you bloodbath, or would have to play smart to not get ganked by 10 and never get to lvl up.  
---
Horde players crying about pvp situation is just retard.
---
It says in the post that one of the group greeded, so they all agreed in chat to also greed so the first guy could still get it, at which point the ninja needed it.
---
Same, work was kinda slow today, so they asked who wanted to volunteer for some time-off. Oh, well, I guess the dawn is pretty to look at.
---
The vast majority don't know they're 'ruining the game', they login and create a character on the faction they prefer. Only a small subset of players actively research faction balances before picking a server.
---
That is indeed an ability name, good job
---
I'm still confused why they would care even after that thing with Blizzard DID happen. Who the heck cares about some guy who plays a card game?
---
&gt; You could also manipulate claw casts in a way that allows your pet to use bite whenever its available, resulting in slightly higher dps, but this isnt ever going to be worth the trouble so forget about it
---
You can just macro it to and ability that you use on a regular basis like arcane shot. That way you still get a few claws in without any extra effort.
---
There are those who do it because it makes them feel powerful and others because they want to help build solid communities.
---
I would argue that it was.
---
Is the argument that Classic is better than retail based off better raids?
---
Don't kink shame!
---
Aahhhh, thank you.
---
Damn it, Arthas. As your future Arthas, I order you to purge this Arthas.
---
Exactly, directional microphones. I'm not into Youtube nor streaming so I did not have the term of those in mind.   
---
But overall not bad, I did not watch it entirely for this same reason. For some reason I do not like the loud noises of mechanical keyboards, I always ask my friend on discord to adjust his mic so I don't have to constantly hear his keyboard when he is typing to people lol.
---
Its shows the possible spawm locations. Also turn on your "Find Herbs".
---
I wish I had a sit down job, gah damn my back hurts
---
That’s not tr... I mean .. it’s not like ..that?!
---
no one watches these videos. please dont
---
Everytime I've tried to make a group (still around level 20 on all my characters), once I find a tank or healer to join up, the rest of the group forms easily. 
---
But, I agree. I always start my own groups.... Don't have much luck responding to LFG posts in chat.
---
Feels good to play on EU Mograine, almost 50:50
---
Being alliance does kinda feelsbad but noticed alliance usually wins in a fair fight. I'm including slightly outnumbered as fair in this instance. Looking forward to instant BG qs. Also plenty of horde to come out of stealth on.
---
As a level 44 mage who gets mocked as people ride by, I say no.  
---
Give me some gold so I can get my wheels!
---
For a real challenge do it as alliance, otherwise i dont see the challgenge here
---
Yeah they are, and more people should be on them as opposed to feeling obligated to play pvp.
---
I honestly have been finding it pleasant. I work at a solid job that pays me well, has good, flexible hours, and forces me to play slow enough that I'm still enjoying myself, feeling interested to get home and put in a couple hours, and not getting burnt out. Being an adult can be pretty awesome.
---
Should’ve rolled PvP server!!!
---
Hi China, is that you?
---
Totally agree. And hey thanks! Appreciate the criticism.

Where do you guys find these shit players? Honestly I’ve been grinding Strat live and now DM for more hours than most and I never once get the kind of player that not only routinely doesn’t get how to wait for LoS but also flames? I’m having a hard time believing your experience is dominated by these kinds of people. Every now and then we get a guy who does bad damage or doesn’t play the class all that well but never to the degree that I question if they’re actually a human. And you should easily have many people friended that you’ve successfully grouped with before that you don’t need to pug all 4 spots. Idk how to say this without sounding rude but if you’re smelling shit everywhere you walk, maybe check your own shoes.
---
Windfury definitely is more fun, but rockbiter is more reliable ... And outside of raids, even in dungeons its better dps I have found some really good tanks mean you can use it and the difference is night and day, you become a monster of a dps that no other class can come close to catching up to on the charts until end game. 
---
Except for longer boss fights, now that I have much more solid crit stats.
---
For paladin's what?
---
She ain't the one fam.
---
I remember seeing the server data from like a month ago and it was like 55% Horde. Feels about right.
---
Zandalar Tribe isnt a low pop server. And has never been

Looking for help with Luna Unit Frames.
---
How can I get it to show debuffs on the unit frame, or have the frame highlighted so I know there is something I can debuff.  Right ow buffs/debuffs are appearing behind the frame which is worthless and I can't figure out how to make it look right.  Otherwise it's my favorite unit frame addon by far.
---
Amazingly the games raids (especially early) weren't designed for 1.12 talent and itemization on top of 15 years of testing/theory crafting
---
I'm alliance on Herod. Everyone qqs in general chat in every zone about how horde outnumber us and blah blah. Ive seen alliance camp instance portals just as much as I've seen horde do it. At launch there was undeniably more horde than alliance. And I expect there still is. But I don't ever feel like we are oppressed. Or can't play. I farmed thorium for days and I run into more alliance competition than horde. Devilsaur seems the same. 
---
Tldr servers fine. No complaints from me. I'll fight you guys 2v1 all day. More honor for me when phase 2 drops. And when bgs come out I'll insta queue while you wait for it. Ezpz.
---
I am 42 and still havent bought my mount yet, I dont have the money amd I dont wont to grind for it.I will send the mount gold to my 24 rogue alt, when I get the money, to make travel easier for that char. I dont think I do long travels to feel the need for 20% more speed, travel form is fine.
---
That’s actually great progress
---
That's an advantage to you ;) it is tiring to be forced to do sporty things, if you want to enjoy something else. I rly need to find a job where I'm not sitting all the time haha
---
Whenever I do manage to get an invite into someone else's group, I often find myself in a double hunter situation.
---
With alot of practice and engineering yes
---
i have to upvote this guys. Readers, don't be afraid. Hunter leveling is quite easy and can be done with pretty much every pet. Take the one that you like the most, don't force yourself to take a "better" one that you can't stand.
---
Google is very useful to learn the basics of your class. Google that shit. The community made so many guides for new players but you can't be bothered to help yourself.
---
Too bad man, my guild is pretty laid back :(
---
Tailors, what's the best item to make for the purpose of disenchanting at max level?
---
Because they don't want to PvP. Isn't that obvious by now. They just want to say they are on a PVP server for some reason. It's like a bragging chip.
---
Also more and more people have been coming over, so the server never felt like it was dead or dying. Honestly just feels like it's growing every day.
---
Break up with her
---
Thanks man. I mean there is more gear in bwl than people think. 
---
- Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark, 
---
- Prestor's Talisman of Connivery, 
---
- Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads (if you can make up the hit somewhere else which brings me to...), 
---
- Boots of the Shadowflame (Which are bis for bear tank so it is multi-purpose, 
---
- Circle of Applied Force, 
---
- Drake Fang Talisman(Everyone would be mad if a feral got it though even though it is a bis bear tank trinket and bear tanks are great for threat fights like Broodlord), 
---
- Cloak of  Draconic Might, and 
---
- Draconic Maul.
---
That is 8 pieces of gear. Basically the same as a tier set. MC yea you basically have wristguards of stability and band of accuria.
---
you also have repair bots. tank with a broken shield is a perfectly good reason to drop a bot, especially since it's been a couple wipes. they aren't that expensive.
---
What’s the pvp set for holy priests that I can wear on my way to dungeons?
---
Well the Unyeilding Maul for Druids is *pretty* good. Beats paying 450G for a Warden Staff.
---
I leveled in Desolace when I hit 30 and went to STV when I was 35. Most horde ignored me - which was strange because as a warrior I'm kind of easy pickings in wPvP.
---
Fact
---
It's Skinner boxes all the way down. Don't let an echo chamber tell you what to like, but also try to at least be conscious of the psychological sway both games use.
---
Care to give us some reasons for these "should never" statements?
---
yea nah fuck that. enjoy anterior pelvic tilt, forward head posture, and a lifetime of other posture problems. not to mention the general health problems; lack of exercise, non-existent cardio, no strength. oh and also don't forget the social implications. online social activity is a supplement to real life, not a substitute - it will ruin your mental health.
---
Just remember to "walk" and not "run" 1-60
---
You open lockboxes &lt;3
---
1. That's not well known by most players in general, just hardcore players.
---
2. Players choose factions for a multitude of reasons.
---
3. If your logic is that it's well known that horde would be overpopulated on PVP servers and that would make people roll Alliance instead, then wouldn't that cause Alliance to be the overpopulated faction?
---
Just spam shield bash to trick them you're prot.

---
Nobody care.
---
What is the add on that shows the numbers on you as you take damage?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I did Ony and MC 2 days after hitting 60. Its not about how much time you spend so much as it is finding the right guild or group to run with.
---
I spend all day at work so I can come home, eat a meal and then want bed immediately afterwards.
---
&gt; sit in cities queuing for BGs. 
---
nope, you'll be in Alterac mountain for AV, Arathi hightlands for Arathi and so on, you'll have plenty of time for fishing
---
Diremaul east west and north are all considered the same dungeon as far as "resets" go. You're guarenteed to get one book in 1 of the 3 per reset. Which side it spawns on is completely random. the best way to farm these is to check east + north and if you don't find any check west before reseting.
---
yes but that is because horde have less quests than alliance
---
It's really, really hard to hold aggro at your level without your DPS being super helpful. You just don't take or deal enough damage to get much rage, so holding aggro is a disaster. Your DPS need to wait for 2 sunders, but they never do.
---
It gets easier as you level though, as dungeon mobs start to hit harder later on, and your gear improves so you hit harder too (warriors are *incredibly* gear dependent). I'd say keep it up because tanking is such a fun and rewarding play style. 
---
I'm currently almost lvl 50 and it's much smoother now than it was before/at 30s. And in actual Vanilla I tanked everything up to mid-Naxx, so I know what I'm doing (or should do!).
---
You actually got lan working?! My friends and I could never find each others games as of late.
---
In what fucking fairy land do you live you retard, you don't need roll on shit you don't actually need and a second shield you clearly don't fucking need. Can you even read? How am I trolling by stating the actual, widely accepted, GM enforced rules of this fucking game? Lay off the dope man, you're reading the wrong post
---
Wait that’s my move
---
Aren't you the guy who said WoW needed a Battle Royale mode because you watched Ninja stream?
---
C'mon, like I'm going to consider your opinion valid after a suggestion like that lmao
---
Aaaaand now your dmg is still bad.
---
Anything that requires other people is going to be easier to get groups if there is a higher population. It’s why vanilla was harder to get groups for in general because the population per server was much smaller. 
---
That being said if you play on an imbalanced server your best bet is to either join a guild or start making friends around your level you can whisper for groups.
---
I've leveled my horde hunter without going to SM. Also, your class is much more critical than fraction. AOE casters, tanks &amp; healers are minority in LFG queues.
---
Hey but you can chain it with divine favor. Spam your Holy Shock cooldown as your max rank Holy Light goes off. Double crit, double refund. Pretty useful in 5 mans, I'm at +530 healing and a Holy shock is good for 900 healing as a crit. Does kinda suck that it's main use is chained to a 2 minute cooldown though.
---
sure, but it has shit hps and unless you're still progressing MC in greens you don't have time to run out of mana. Atm flash heal will net you better logs.
---
Extra Spirit is pretty much useless for Holy Paladins.
---
It's a calling
---
Irl complex? :)
---
I'm also pretty certain disengage is just a placebo, since I've never had a mob go back to my pet after I use it.
---
I’ve never looked at those threads. I know I’m not speaking for everyone but the majority of people on reddit won’t come across those threads unless they intentionally go out of their way. This significantly reduces the pool of people who can answer the question. 
---
It’s the reason mods over at r/hearthstone never made a megathread about the hong kong incident, because it would kill the discussion and stop the support. Not to mention I would rather see these discussions among the other shitposts that this sub seems to have become.
---
That’s why I’m only level 33 :’)

When you see the fixed theat abilities section you get a better understanding how revenge outlines all other instants and how heroic strike might be our best theat generator

&lt;The Undying Greed&gt;
---
Probably somewhere in Azeroth lol
---
No, 12 days /played is not rushing,  but I would argue that even that duration is only possible by being focused on getting to 60, rather than enjoying the journey.  Not to the exclusion of all else perhaps, but still...
---
And 12 days /played in 7 weeks (or less if you haven't just dinged)?
---
That's not totally unusual (this is wow after all), but it's still averaging 41 hours a week, which isn't bad.  Did you take time off at launch? That's just another form of 'rushing'.
---
Now, don't get me wrong, anyone can play the game how they want.  I just get surprised when people get to 60 and realise there's not a huge amount to do!
---
When I ding 60, I suspect I'll have 1-3 weeks of stuff to do and then it's focusing on my alts!
---
I remember questing here for my warlock dreadsteed, the Blizzard went and gave it out to every lock.
---
I hope China nukes Hong Kong
---
Yep, what this guy says.  IMO 40/60 is still bad.  30/70 is downright nightmare.   The population is both doubled in size and has the 30/70 ratio.   
---
Just to add on to Chrop's point.  There is also so many people that it's wave after wave of horde.  For fun, we waited for UBRS lockout to finish.  So we pvped during that time.  It was great fun, but we eventually were just overran.  Wave after wave after wave.  We had real issues with mana with no time to rest.
---
Doesn’t sound challenging so much as mind numbingly boring, although I suppose that’s a challenge in its own right.
---
I had such a blast playing a hunter on private server. I’m so disappointed by the state of the class in Classic... I originally planned to main hunter, went shaman instead and absolutely trashed every hunter I came across so far. I’m still hesitating to roll one as my main alt but that would be mostly for pvp so it seems like a pretty bad idea right now.
---
Skeram isn’t a streamer server.
---
Not sure why you are confused. I’m not going to play retail when 1% of the content is all I can stomach. 
---
If they brought retail complexity over only it would be a nice fit. 
---
I haven’t found anyone in Classic that thinks end game raids are difficult at all. 40man raids are being done with half the men. I’m hoping Naxx changes it back to a struggle to clear a raid.
---
Balance in Classic was garbage. Just look at mages they deal top single and aoe dps, are ranged, have utility and bring bread and water. But whatever that's how it was back then.
---
I really hope TBC will come, too. It was my favorite version of wow. It had the classic feeling, was still slow but had challenging bosses and far better balance.
---
For phase 1 and 2 it's the focus. Theres intentionally a limited end game, which opens up substantially in the later phases (as more people will be 60)
---
&gt;a small opportunity
---
I see what you did here.
---
You can be a dps warrior and find a raiding guild. We have 3-4 in my guild, and they do really good dps. Just keep an offtanking set with you because some bosses may require you to pick up an add
---
What was your guild? I transfered in cata. Maybe I am misremembering but wotlk was really shit
---
I used to think that too. Only worked field work for like a decade (on-site landscape consultation/design and then b2b sales). Then I realized that it's not so bad being in an office.
---
I guess it really depends on where you work, but I'm a data analyst for a major financial firm and honestly this job is pretty awesome. I get paid way more than I ever made doing any 'field' job I ever had, I can come in whenever, work my 8 hours, and head home. 
---
I basically chill all day poking around in databases, listening to podcasts, music, or even watching netflix and, as long as stuff is getting done, no one gives a shit about what I'm doing during any specific minute. If I get bored/distracted, I can go for a walk, fuck around on reddit for a bit (like rn), or get a co-worker and go down to the recreation area to play ping pong, pool, foosball, etc.
---
Lol you bitches , this mod did work. Google the fucking question- it’s a billion year old game. The answer is out there. This subreddit is seriously gonna rot
---
2d girls or gtfo
---
You should add "We only have one layer now and you guys hate layering right!"  
---
Honestly anyone that would move to a dead server at this point is nuts. Only going to get worse from here mate
---
I find them useful as a targeting tool. Target nearest, target last. I don't click with the middle mouse button really, I have buttons 4 and 5 for that.
---
Arms tanking is fine, you just need a few macros that allow stance dancing with fewer button presses.  I can't imagine doing it as fury and giving up TM/AM.
---
Just pop over to Berserker Stance and hit Berserker Rage whenever you can, Blood Rage whenever you can... I usually have plenty of rage and agro.
---
Also make sure you keep your weapon up to date, because a blue 1h near your level does a lot more threat than an out-dated green.  I'm of the opinion that a harder hitting weapon can take the place of bonus threat talents for a long time, and don't seem to have been proven wrong yet.
---
The stuns I feel aren't necessary, especially proc stuns that you have no control over.  Concussive blow would be nice sometimes but if you just don't pull more than you can handle, you should be fine w/o it.
---
xD
---
That’s a very hard question to answer as it depends almost entirely on if you’ll be raiding with a guild and how demanding that guild is of your time. You can also join PuG raids that won’t be as consistent but require no real commitment other than the raid itself and running dungeons for your pre-raid BiS.
---
This exactly. Play the card game and keep politics out of it.
---
I'm also excited! being able to find groups to fight back will be awesome!   
---
Sadly, the horde will do the same...  Although it will be much great honor/hr for alliance then horde.  We shall see.
---
"...killed onyxia and need to head off..."
---
No pun intended, eh?
---
Sunder should always be used over Heroic Strike. HS is a rage-dump ability that shouldn't be part of a warrior's normal rotation until late-game when you are drowning in Rage. Main reason being that every HS replaces an auto-attack, so you're not only spending rage you also aren't generating it from a white hit either.
---
I would refuse to tank properly until the mage gives me an int buff. ME STUPID ME WALK INTO WALL.
---
Yeah. Especially since its Aspect of the cheeta that gives the speed boost ;)
---
Kinda true tbh, most under 16 or w/e prob stick to retail
---
I think druids have the easiest life doing solo content.
---
This is not true though. Most servers weren't horde dominated in vanilla.
---
My GM said I need to "get attuned" before going on raids. Do they mean get pre bis gear or do they mean something else?
---
I feel this.
---
I work retail so Murlocs become the idiotic customer who spent a good 15 minutes of their day spouting rubbish about something I have no control over.
---
I hear them Murglegrble and then I shoot them.
---
It's kind of therapeutic in its own way.
---
Russian players hate playing horde from what I've heard. Something about being a bunch of racists that can't handle not being humans.
---
Honestly worrying about people pulling aggro in sub-40 instances is overworking it.
---
Reddit is perfect for spreading false info about a game to make sure people get the impression it dying. 
---
Dreadmist eu is packed imo. No queues tho. Cant speak for other servers.  
---
Love classic.
---
Hunters don't really suffer the same penalties as casters and melee with level difference. as you don't have glancing blows, parry or dodge. Sadly not many people know this.
---
 /mooooo
---
Man up and say the truth, if you did not warn your guild at least be truthful to say that you were chilling with friends.
---
You're right, it's more of an "all chat"
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
Not entirely true. Normal mounts are summoned half a second faster and don't cost mana.
---
Personally, I feel those differences are negligible though.
---
This is why it should be a bannable offense, especially if evidence can be collected and presented.
---
Make up a huge elaborate story about how your mom burnt the lasagna and you went on a rampage destroying everything in the house
---
Depends on where you go. My experience was utter garbage. Once I got out of friendly leveling zones it was a slog with getting ganked by roving bands of 5+ lv horde. Now as I level my warrior there are tons of high level characters who just gank lowbies cause they have nothing better to do. It sucks.
---
I work night shift so i sit in front of a computer all night so i can aford to sit in front of a computer all day.
---
Reporting for duty!
---
Dude, same. I used to be slammed with 70 hour weeks and as-you're-walking-out-the-door-shouts demanding you show up at 6 am tomorrow despite it being a Saturday, a boss who I got into screaming matches with on the daily, barely any time for lunch, shafted out of breaks constantly, etc.
---
HR stepped in after a couple years and decided I needed to join the office crew instead. Went to a comfy desk job, a boss that is kind and understanding, an hour every day for lunch so I can even get my errands done, I'm only scheduled forty hours a week, and I actually get time now to take my kid to the park on Saturdays. Made a world of difference and I am grateful for it every day.
---
Not having a desk or a room for you alone to make a "battlestation" made me buy a laptop, so I can play in the kitchen while others watch TV..
---
I feel you man. I've had it since I was 50. On a straight fight I'm only slightly behind our guy with dual gutgore rippers(I guess we don't care about debuff slots *shrug*) and I just know upgrading my dumb sword would make all the difference.
---
retail numbers are nosediving so they kill the classic servers for a while to see if they can get people to at least log in to retail for a bit so they can show the shareholders that the login numbers are steady for another month.
---
What's sleep

Dr. Cokeface has a nice ring to it

Do you have to give an excuse? Can't you just say something important came up?

better dps than enhancement if you can keep your mana up
---
Jeez, Think the responses of people here really says something about the community on this reddit.
---
It has already started. Go trick-or-treating at the innkeepers.
---
That's the spec I'm thinking of using
---
Only swapping a few 
---
(1% 2h damage for 1% parry)
---
Undead rogues because cannibalize is great way to taunt alliance players
---
People don't realize the need for moderation was artificially created by asinine rules.
---
I think there's a 0/31/20 spec that's viable.
---
Aye I actually have 4 different tabs running (and a separate combat log if the situation calls for it), but I'm usually only looking at the normal one. I've got one for /World, one for Lookingforgroup, one for whispers and the standard one (without World or LFG). Really makes it easier to track conversations over /w if you are in a channel like what happens in a capitol city during primetime.
---
The craziest thing to me is that many Horde players still rabidly kill Alliance despite the imbalance. Something about the Horde makes people stupidly fanatical, and it shows in game and irl at stuff like Blizzcon
---
I wholehearted agree with this, I play alliance on herod and the horde are actually complete pussies until they outnumber you. I almost never get attacked and when I do, it's one guy that has the balls and then 2 other horde that weren't going to attack actually turn to kill me so it instantly becomes 2 pussies vs 1 guy that don't fight and then the 3rd crazy guy comes in and it's 3v1. Alliance herod life...
---
LOVED IT :)
---
Centaur bracers are far worse.  Next one should be him with a half Centaur baby or something
---
but thats the point of screech and succubbus
---
\*laughs in Mugger's belt and Hide of the Wild recipe\*
---
what's an earlock?
---
This one seems angry.
---
It definitely takes practice to get right. It’s strong but mistakes are punishing.
---
Yeah I always feel bad for all of the DPS warriors who message me.  I mean, I really feel for those guys never getting invited to groups.
---
There is a slight difference between the free mount and regular ones:
---
Free mount us summoned in 3 seconds whereas the normal ones are summoned in 2.5.
---
Free mounts don't take up a bag slot but cost mana and trigger the 5 second rule.
---
Personally, I use the free ones.  The pros imo outweigh the cons.
---
I have an entire defense set I just slap on with a shield to tank dungeons but I’m fury dps for raids
---
Most dungeon loot can be traded to another eligible looter within a 2 hour period. Possible ubrs is different?
---
And zg tiger!
---
damn. as far as I have noticed, Golemagg has maybe 1k queues with &lt;30 minute waits and ONLY evenings, like past 7pm, it might be skewed this week for the release of DM tho, who knows what'll be in two three weeks from now.
---
The problem is I'm a druid :(
---
Try both up to like level 15 and see what's grabbing you more. Personally I've always leaned towards Warlocks over Mages as at least you have pets to factor in, and more chaotic CC which is more fun than Frost Nova or sheep. YMMV.
---
Absolutely. I think I spent probably an hour this morning just idle in Orgrimmar handing out water/food to anyone who asked. All it costs me is time, which I have plenty of. Tips are great, sure, but I'm just glad to be helping out my servers community.
---
&gt; Nut up and delete your Horde characters and reroll Alliance.
---
Or like a sane person that doesn't want to level for a zillion more hours, regear, etc, quit classic wow and go play something where factions aren't a disaster, like most people will do.
---
Another alternative would to provide incentives for players who join the other faction, Say if theres a severe imbalance and you join the imbalanced party. Perhaps you get free gold at lvl 20, or some xp buff, or something to encourage players to choose the other.  It will deffo reduce subs, if people cant play because of it, people will just choose another game. I mean why play a 10+year old game when you can play something else.
---
\&gt;It would be super discouraging
---
But that is still less disc
---
Id just asume he was just memeing, even counting it will drop is silly.
---
he's more referring to the fact that the bird's WINGS flapping around is getting in the way of Targeting, not the SOUND of the flapping.
---
On all 6 of your alts......here comes the self-imposed seasonal event grind
---
I’ll fix that thanks.
---
I've found a heap of new data, no it's all wrong. Everything. I am going to be making a revision today with the importance of rear attacking highlighted further.
---
Stop keep the Druid pop low!! But seriously I love my druid
---
Ah just need something to focus on. Whether that's levelling all classes / one class on all races (as some madlad is doing with Warriors, the most boring class in wow to me), there's mount collection, transmog, pets, raid/dungeon achi's, the list goes on, which I can see is the problem, but the solution is to take one, and run with it.
---
i.e for me atm, I'm trying to get to grips with healing on my monk again, having not done so since WoD really. And from today getting that sodding HH mount!
---
Say you were playing retail
---
IM SO FRIKIN EXCITED!
---
I'm 58 now, but I've got 8% hit without talents.  In that DM tribute run I referenced there was a 60 hunter with 4 pieces of T1 and I kept with him on the damage meter (granted he probably was mailing it in...)
---
Great :D
---
&gt;That's even worse. Imagine trying to invite a friend to play with you. "Sorry Jeff you have to wait 2 weeks to play with me because there are too many horde". It would be super discouraging.
---
Thats still less discouraging than 10 hour queues or not being able to play because some fools ruin the server for everyone else.
---
Well you’re basically fucked, missed a raid and didn’t say anything? Enjoy being blacklisted for life /s.
---
But really, tell them you hung out with some friends, I’m sure they wouldn’t care.
---
Nah. Need to do attunement to the core and the onyxia. Not sure what the latter is called but these let you enter the instances.
---
This is my life, first warrior was an orc male. Got to level 14-15 and realised I preferred the female model. Glad to know I’m not the only picky fucker out there.
---
That's right, but Sunder Armor reduces the enemies armor and any non magical class will benefit from it dealing more damage while still holding the aggro. That's more important than having 5k aggro to the next in team with 2k but no reduced armor.
---
I don't think so. A majority of the playerbase isn't at 60 yet. Only those private server peeps, NEETs and the work from home crew are.
---
I think your server lacks tryhard guilds. On my server the eels sell for over 10g a stack.
---
I guess people can find fun anywhere.  Moonkin dps is literally one button.  Class fantasy and trying to be different it what I think it is mostly.
---
im playing patchwerk eu horde side. is it really that bad horde favorised?
---
raid loot can, not dungeon
---
Meh I use mousewheel down for aspect of cheetah, ctrl + mousewheel down aspect of hawk

Just holy nova grind dire maul east or maraudon princess runs pretty solid gold per hour and can easily be done with a heal speced priest with 6k+ mana
---
I wonder how viable it would be to be a ret healer, use a 2hand dps weapon and auto attack boss with dps seal, but other than that you are geared mostly to heal and save your Mana for healing as needed. So by bring this to a raid you get a off-healer that can step back and main heal if needed or both throw decent damage and decent healing out.
---
Probably a stupid idea but if it's true you only need 13 points in holy to raid heal, assuming I was putting a raid together, I think it would nice knowing I had a guy that was in there who could do some of both. Would make it less impactful if a healer gets killed.
---
you need some energy or enthusiasm.
---
Blame the highest ranking rogue in the guild.... everything is always the rogues fault!
---
Oh fuck what's going on? Was going to run errands then hit that gold grind.

Ummm how about the truth?

It's just a \_game\_ after all. You are supposed to play it for fun and when you can. If more important things come up they will always &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  video games.

If that's not good enough then maybe getting kicked out of that guild is a blessing in disguise.
---
AV isn't until phase 3.
---
31/5/15 is probably the best jack-of-all-trades spec for warriors. You can PvP, solo play, raid DPS, dungeon tank and raid offtank. Obviously it also has its weaknesses, mainly the fact that MS is not well received in a lot of raids due to occupying a debuff slot. And obviously you're not as good at anything as a warrior with a dedicated spec. There are also some decent Fury/Prot specs, which kinda work if you do PvE only. Kungen has "invented" some Arms/Prot hybrid without MS that he thinks is the greatest of all time, but I'm not sold on that one. 
---
You can absolutely tank every dungeon at 60 in a full DPS spec as well. It's just a bit more stressful, at least for me. With a bit of gear, it's going to be a breeze though.

I'm sorry raid leader, I tried my best to make it tonight but Soros funded a protest that blocked the free way on my way home from work! I managed to get past the picket line after running a few over. But by the time I got home I got stuck in a login queue

all of them, enjoy
---
Prior to phase 2
---
&lt;K o K&gt;, we were just a bunch of casuals and suddenly were were one of the top on Ally side.
---
&gt; Let alliance from an alliance heavy server move to Herod. Let the horde on Herod move to servers that need them, etc.
---
Problem: There is no alliance heavy server
---
&gt;They could limit character creation (for those who don't have a character there already) for the dominant faction once it reaches a certain threshold, helping to funnel people into the faction that needs it.
---
This is what needed to be done
---
It’s awful for alliance because they all keep leaving lol. That’s the problem with trying to incentivize players to go to another server, you create a worse situation potentially on the original server.
---
These events bring a little fun change to the surroundings, but it's a shame that you don't gain much from them. Most have seasonal food thats the same as regular food (minus valentine's), and the only thing to really earn usually are dresses and maybe a pet. Fun distraction, but I like when they tweaked them in TBC when they included bosses, and items that were more useful.
---
it's incredible that 15 years later, there's no way to force faction balance on a game centered around faction vs faction pvp
---
Joke is on the over populated faction who is  excessively ganking lowbies forcing the numbers to only get worse. We'll have the last laugh when PvP queues come into play.
---
Flash heal gets you better logs because your heals connect before others, not because the heals were not covered.
---
It’s padding your logs with no benefit to the raid and using your MP twice as quickly in the process.  If anyone actually cared about healing logs, you can always just stand in lava for a full fight just healing yourself.
---
Imprisoned for ten....thousand.....years.....
---
Banished from my oown homeland....
---
Attunement is just a fancy word for completing quests and becoming eligible to enter the raid.
---
&gt;There are more alliance players than horde across all realms on Classic.
---
Not according to census  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#eu-realms](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#eu-realms)
---
You need to complete some quest chains in order to be able to enter the raids. Wowhead just released a tracker that could be helpful for you, it tracks the attunements to the raids plus some other things like keys to certain dungeons.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295674/wow-classic-attunement-tracker-track-your-endgame-quest-chain-progress
---
I'm alliance on earthshaker, the reddit definition of "dead server" is kinda odd. Earthshaker is a highly populated server by vanilla standards.
---
Can confirm. I’m an arms warrior and will only tank with a few warriors I am friendly with. I am a hypocrite though, if someone needs 1dps I’ll ask to come along.
---
Yikes imagine defending internet janitors 😂
---
You can definitely tank dungeons as raid fury spec. You just just need a dedicated tanking set which will naturally occur if you tank. You can even dual wield tank with your tanking gear set on with some +hit % pieces so you maintain high threat per second. Armor/stam to soak damage, parry % (kinda rare), and 20 Agi = 1% crit and 1% dodge.
---
Bald female orc is your solution.
---
I prefer classic over retail every day of the freaking week.  I like the fact that nothing is handed to me on a plate.  I like the fact that I have to consider my capabilities whenever I decide to push myself hard.  I like having reputations not being stuck behind a time gate.  I like the fact I feel more freedom to spec and play as I choose.  I like the fact it's rough around the edges.
---
Overall horde players on PvP realms was roughly 57% on the first big census. Mostly everyone would be happy if each server was roughly that ratio. 
---
So why are some servers 70% horde? Why are a couple 70% Ally? The answer is 0 planning and 0 fixes from blizz. Why not have a queue system where minority faction gets priority? Why not offer free transfers to avoid queues but only for the dominate faction? Blizz has the exact numbers, and they have tools to help balance them.
---
There **are** ways to keep it better balanced, but they aren't concerned enough to do anything. Until players make enough noise about it, they will continue to not be concerned.
---
Well, u technically can solo it , but its hard as fuck to pull off.
---
U have time time when the disorient is going to go off and sw taunt the disorient, and have good enough dps to kill him by the second cast.
---
well go make the same and fight a Skull enemy my dude :) gear is not all lol :D
---
The issue isn't just faction balance, but having large servers to begin with.  No one is going to transfer to a ghost town when they are on a well populated server.  Blizzard has also shown they absolutely refuse to simply merger server fully because "People don't want to lose their names."
---
People in general want to be on larger servers with a larger horde and alliance population.  The problem is blizzard doesn't like allowing transfers onto those servers because it further kills the small servers.  Until blizzard simply admits they have to close servers and funnel people into bigger servers, this problem will persist.
---
Way to prove them wrong by circumventing the van just to whine some more. See you never, I guess.
---
This is pretty much every dungeon group
---
I’m not so much looking to fight as I am trying to not die
---
Your doing something wrong then. This literally works 100% of the time. You just cast em CL and while The CL castbar is loading you spam the shock you want.
---
Is Gnomeregen actually awful or did I get a bad group?
---
Not really.  Take a zepplin to Grom'gol then run up the road.  You'll die to alliance and mobs in equal measure.  Death run or spirit res at the northern graveyard and just keep heading north.  You'll hit duskwood really quickly.
---
Roooooxxxxaaaa-
---
Naxx was weird. I dont even remember name of the guild I was in at that time (it disbanded halfway through ulduar) but we had like zero tanking drops for two ids and our tanks just werent able to stay alive at patchwerk. Then like 5 people left the guild because of sapphiron trinket drama. And I heard more guilds had similar problems with attendance, getting raid team together after some migrated away and people quiting/leveling the new op as fck hero class. It got better at toc/icc season tho. We stabilised some community, 10man raiding guilds doing 25mans together. Good times.
---
Giant beaver? Sounds like your moms in ungoro
---
i lol'd
---
All I see here is you being a douche and the mods doing their jobs properly. You're probably the kind of person who doesn't wash the ass in the shower and then tells people shut the fuck up when they ask what stinks.
---
Hunters don't use attack table at all, they have separate rolls for miss and crit.
---
Text Message Breakup.  Even (and especially) if she's standing right there with you.
---
Yeah that's straight up wrong but I'll leave you to think what you please.
---
Yeah on Skeram since the start of October I have seen maybe 2-3 alliance in the 20-50 quest zones, it's actually insane.
---
At this point I would xfer off Skeram if they offered Horde xfer only to high-alliance servers. 
---
Thank god BGs are cross realm at least.
---
Actually it is pretty well known that PvP servers as a whole have a horde bias, and PvE servers have an alliance bias. At-least that was the case when WoWHead did it's last census several weeks ago. That data also matches up with retail WoW as long as we have been census tracking.
---
&gt; everything is reserved except for plate
---
Does this really happen on your realm? That's, like, insane.
---
I never had a problem with this quest. Have you tried getting 4 Intact Makrura Eyes tho? I literally spent 45 minutes doing that quest.
---
My issue is that my friends with tons more time than me keep server hopping, burning their way to 60, and doing it again. 
---
Meanwhile, I get two hours a day to play, separated by a 10 hour work shift (so once at 3 am and once at 3 pm), and can only get to level 20-ish on whatever server they land on next.
---
So I've got an Undead Rogue at 23 and Troll Shaman at 19 on Ashkandi (PvE), a 13 Dwarf Hunter on Pagle (PvE), a 19 Night Elf Warrior on Myzrael (PvE), and finally landed on Kromcrush (a PvP server) where I'm just parking myself with my 21 Human Priest.
---
I'm on my fifth character under 30 and I'm tired of moving. I didn't *want* to end up on a PvP server (especially one so apparently lopsided in faction), but I'm going to make the best of it.
---
&gt; Alliance are so terrified that they never engage unless the odds are so massively in their favor that it's outright impossible for them to lose
---
Not Herod but a PVP player. But right now pvp doesnt make sense. you get nothing from it. Most funny words that i've heard for PVP in phase 1
---
"There is no honor in PVP" which is funny cause it's true. No honor system = no pvp, at least for me.
---
Pvp. I dont get why people play this game on pve. For me it's the difference between using VR goggles that simulate a roller coaster, or actually going on that roller coaster at six flags.
---
Yea.. you may have an annoying 1 or 2 hour wait to ride it.. but to actually go on it in RL, feel the wind, the drop in your stomach, the hairs sticking up on the back of your neck as the coaster ticks up slowly to the big drop, the people all around you screaming... that's what a pvp server is like. 
---
OP, right now you're playing wow in the matrix. Break free. Go PvP. 
---
GL.
---
Is there any way to modify the in-game language? Like is there a language file I can go and replace words or terms in, or maybe an addon that let's you change what something says? My goal is to change "mana" to "Jesus Juice".
---
Both owl and cat are legit as fuck and arguably top-tier. The two fastest hunters to 60 used each of those.
---
The ghost cat from Darkshore looks cool as fuck but sadly it is garbage statwise.
---
They’re useless 1v1
---
Guess you mean the necrphile set:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=122/necropile-raiment
---
guess just Alliance and Horde love each other so much idk :D
---
For me screech was the only focus dump, around the same damage as claw plus a nice threat and debuff. That threat helped me a lot before intimidation/feign death and the attack damage debuff makes the owl more tanky than a cat -&gt; little less down time probably. Only reason I changed to a cat because I accidently found Broken Tooth at level37 (and maybe because screech sound is a little annoying after a while).
---
Yeah it's alright when they show up, but also neither here nor there as I only need one or 2 pieces from dungeons anymore.
---
I read this in Rorschach’s voice
---
So you're upset at Blizzard for not feeding you bodies to kill?  Horde has systemic advantages to PvP and, surprise!  These advantages got arbitraged to the point where people got sick of lopsided/bad experiences.
---
If you can't contemplate how a PvE server is fun, then you simply have no imagination.  Let me guess:  You were the type of kid who when building a Lego set would only follow the directions, finish, and then give up and watch TV?  There are tons of ways to have fun in WoW without having the fun/unexpected things be spoonfed to you.
---
&gt; and most of the classic wow tryhards all want to play horde for some reason.
---
It's not a huge difference but Horde Racials are almost all directed towards PvP while Alliance racials almost all go towards PvE encounters. 
---
Horde sim a bit better because of this so the tryhards feel like they need to capitalize on every single little advantage they can get.
---
Thanks
---
It's a personal challenge, that's kinda the point. It's not meant to make you want to do it too.
---
I'll have to check this

&gt; DM buffs because those buffs don't apply to your class anyway
---
I was never into DM much when I was an awful hunter in Vanilla. Does the attack power buff from tribute not buff our ranged AP?
---
&gt; But still no one tanks. For whatever reason.
---
I'm betting that a lot of them are simply here to be PvP gods.
---
yeah here's the github link
---

---
Percentages are funky. A change from 50-50 to 60-40 is a much smaller change than 60-40 to 70-30. Think of 3 vs 2 fights compared to 4 vs 2 fights. 70-30 is worse than 4 vs 2 ratio in every fight.
---
Its extremely usefull in pvp against other healing classes just go HoJ&gt;Judge righteous&gt;Divine favor Holy shock&gt;Hammer of wrath is a great finisher. It's usefull for group pvp too, if you have a warrior with you just dump it into an ice barrier or PW:shield to help your warrior friend build rage. And i use it a lot while tanking 5 mans.
---
Holy paladins are extremely flexible and holy shock adds a lot of that.
---
No the lich king has no control over Arthas until he picks up Frostmourne.
---
I was actually able to get it to work with the Imp phase shifted, first time I've ever been able to solo her!
---
I forgot about that, but at least while levelling they're not locked into a tanking spec :)
---
That's what I thought, seems to me that I get more than one bite per fight. Will try different methods to compare, but as I'm not really into all those damage/aggrometers extensions it'll be more based on a feeling than actual data.
---
I can hear these lines and I haven’t played that game in 10 years
---
Bad group, you want to be close within 2-3 levels of the last boss though and be prepared for random pulls (they aren't really random, but they can feel like it). It is a long dungeon and if nobody has been there before it can be daunting.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I will at 60, after I change profession to engineering.
---
&gt; The only problem is if the imbalance keeps increasing you'll end up on a shitty realm if you value any hostile interaction at all.
---
For the record, I'm playing devil's advocate still, especially with the next statement.
---
For the players that are treating the server as a "PvE+" server, even 95-5 still provides some benefit. Sure, now we're down to almost nothing, but it also can never get worse than a PvE realm, so there's no problem for this type of player.
---
Ok
---
no, not really. the guys gonna be posting and streaming it so its clearly meant to have an audience. and this audience member just happens to think it sounds dumb as fuck
---
it only takes me a few minutes to form groups. im pretty good at it
---
Personally, they should at least restrict them to be only PvP or only PvE servers. At no point should players from a PvP server play against players on PvE servers in BGs.
---
Nope, neither does Ony buff, or Jujus. If hunters didn't have TSA I bet those wouldn't apply too.
---
Yes, you're wrong concerning white attacks. When you dual wield it's a flat hit penalty that applies to both weapons.
---
Yup. Since census stopped working weeks ago we can only wait and guess. My guess was and is that Horde is more motivated to pvp which leads them to queue much more than Alliance. With a balance of 50-50 this causes Horde to have longer queue times.
---
Yeah, they never give int buff to warriors then wonder why they pull like idiots.
---
Complains about alliance being cowards when multiple horde groups run around ganking single allliance quester and corpse camping. It’s like a fisherman who over fishes and then complains there’s nothing to fish and all the fish he finds run away and hides
---
You can't meaningfully interact with the other faction, if you have a server that's 100% your faction that's twice as many people you can play with versus a balanced server.
---
Well, I'm thinking that what I wrote is quite relevant to the conversation as well. The OP asked a question, that is quite far from the worst of what gets through this reddit without a hitch. If the post was removed because it's too short - just calmly point to the rule. If the mod was trying to judge the "worthiness" of the question - well, first of all, that is not something that he should be doing, and second - he was flat out wrong, because the question is poignant and I've seen this problem numerous times, it just didn't bother me much. So the mod instinctual first response, without really looking into the problem, or into the person asking - was a negative and out-of-place "google it", which means that this is his basic M.O., influenced by the many past negative experiences. I don't think it was like that on his first day as a mod, at least I hope so - he probably was trying to be helpful and nice back then. So what happened is a clear example of professional deformation - the subject I wrote about.
---
And again, I'm not saying you're wrong in your descriptions of life as a mod - as a GM I can relate pretty well, but I'm constantly forcing myself to step out of my head-space and judge the situation objectively. Because yes, when 90% of your time is spent dealing with something negative or solving problems, it's very hard to not jump to conclusions, seeing every new interaction as "oh god, another one". I've had many situations where I snapped at somebody who didn't deserve it, or when I saw negativity or instigation in an innocent question, just because I've spent the past week dealing with these issues, and hence - that's where my head is at the moment. You have to be honest with yourself to understand the reasons for your mistakes, if you wish to do good. Otherwise you risk becoming an asshole, without even noticing.
---
As for the analogy with the daycare - no, I did not take it too far - I've just shown that it's not the children that are the problem in your analogy - it's the caretaker and his attitude.
---
Mate, I'm not trying to attack you personally, not saying that this is how you acted - just talking about what you wrote. You already said that you're no longer a mod, so none of this really applies to you anymore. Peace, love &amp; understanding.
---
It can be terrible, I spent 4 hours one sunday doing it with 3 different groups as in previous 2 groups the tanks kept pulling stupid amounts of mobs.
---
Imo wait until you're over leveled and return there with a better/higher leveled group
---
you sold 10 shirts at 9g each?!
---
Shut up shithead, why would you fuck with people who have more power and resources than you. You're just puffing your chest, pulling the dogs tail and acting shocked when it turns around to bite you. 
---
The world is a mystery for some.
---
&gt;'m also a little skeptical that the population difference is as large or will be as meaningful as you expect. If you look at WCL, there are actually more Alliance registered guilds with Rag kills than Horde (28-27). When it's time for pvp to matter, there will probably be more speed bumps playing horde, but the population of living, breathing humans will probably not be all that different.
---
I play Horde on Herod. I never kill questing Alliance players unless they initiate the combat or if they have killed me before. I also usually only fight in a group to defend another Horde getting ganked or if both factions have multiple players fighting. I know how shitty it is getting ganked when you are just questing and I even help out Alliance players when I can.
---
what makes you think that? how can i be slow if im always the first person to the dungeon?
---
Someone posted a speed comparison a while back.  It takes around 20 seconds to catch travel form with a mount because of the cast time.
---
Alright this got me good.
---
Not on PvP servers. The best data we have shows PvP server at 57/43 H/A. Ally are severally underrepresented on PvP servers.

Please read the data you quote and check the qualifiers in the statement you are reacting to (Most pvp servers)
---
It’s been several weeks of MC. On my server I know at least 8+ people that have the enchant and half of them don’t even charge for it. I just tip 5G usually.
---
Not calling ye stupid or anything but I'm surprised how many people didn't know this
---
This is awesome and quite unique. Well done! 
---
It drives me crazy when I start messing around with my UI. I’ve wasted hours trying to get set up with a clean and functional layout. It’s a bit of trial and error with add ons and sometimes you have to settle for something less than satisfactory because it doesn’t break what you’ve already got going. My latest mission has been getting an enemy cast bar. I had to bail on SUF and jumped over to Z Perl. Will I ever be satisfied? Probably not.
---
Do me a favor and /who 60 Druid and tell me how many people are online right now
---
That's a pretty good showing of how dead the server is.
---
post an imgur link, I'll wait.
---
You can take dungs for money
---
There is no general answer. It is not something I'd expect to happen in my guild, at worst I'd lose my raid spot. Guilds that are very quick to invite members without knowing anything about them might also be quicker to throw them out I guess. So maybe that is the case here?
---
In any case you were not booted for a single wipe. If the reason was your performance rather than some drama we do not know about, you likely did vastly lower damage (in case you are a damage dealer) than your peers or something along those lines and not only during this run.
---
If you also happened to join a progress oriented guild they may have realized you wouldn't be able to keep up. We don't have enough information to know what happened. But you probably wouldn't want to be in a guild that removes you in the way it did.
---
That can’t be true with bop, heals, cleanse, freedom, LoH. 
---
I’ve personally had a few 1v1 and I do well.
---
They’ll probably never do this. Imagine a new player trying to play with their friends and being unable to due to faction cap.
---
I wanna know the original title now
---
To be fair, it's pointless to hang around Feralas for an hour+ while you get your group together, unless you are fishing or looking for Rexxar or something else related to that area and every other high level questing zone/instance is MILES AWAY.
---
That's kinda the point of classic wow....
---
Or just boot them if they're dumb enough to think you need to be prot to tank a mara run.
---
If pugs are waiting on prot tanks they will release BC before they find one.
---
I’m alliance on Kromcrush. STV and Tanaris feel like horde starting zones lol.
---
Is spellweavers turban (UBRS) in the game yet or will it be released in a later phase?
---
Its awful now. Took me so many tries to get the escort quest in Ungoro done.
---
Yes but who is the lich king? It’s definitely not just Nerzhul or arthas or bolvar or a combination of them all. It’s something to do with Yogg Saron but we don’t actually know what yet or the Lich King could be a servant of the Death character that has been teased. I think that something new that Arthas would take all of these steps and engineered a plan to get him to ice crown. Culling included, they were all tests and parts of the plan.
---
If you start working on BiS items and attunements prior to 60, you should be ok to join a raid right away.
---
The hard part will be finding a raid group with an empty spot.
---
First time making a 10 hour loot video on WoW, so I know I can improve for future ones. Feel free to let me know what you think, and what you'd like to see improved. Timestamps are in the description for anyone who is just looking for snippets :)
---
Did you clear heroic in WotLK and Catacylsm? No? Thought so.
---
Classic raid difficulty is on LFR level.
---
Still loving and playing classic tho.
---
Spec into scattershot so that you can reset the fight. Other than that and dropping traps, yea they're pretty bad at world pvp.
---
Ive made like 2k gold from fishing since i hit 60.
---
Although most of my gold came from fishing elemental water in bay of storms.
---
The past two weeks, competition has become insanely high tho and I see people basically camping each spawn point all the time now. Mostly due to larger demand from Dire Maul crafting recipe.
---
I also made quite a bit of gold from selling squid the first week. Prices have dropped to like 6g a stack now in my server for squid so 100% not worth it.
---
Since I'm a mage, most of my time is spent now in ZF/Dire Maul aoe farming gold but while im at work, since I need to be able to AFK at a moments notice, I still manage to fish for about an hour or two and grab like 3-4 Essences of Water a day with minimal effort.
---
I'm 100% for this solution. They can implement this any time and it would instantly show results.
---
Thank you. I know about a few of those guys and some have had interesting points, but a lot (and I mean *a lot*) of those videos tend to consist of "Here's this rogue who we're about to absolutely demonish lol noob".  
---
Though I admit that some of the maybe very good points simply go over my head!
---
Prob should have played alliance it sounds like since you’re a big bad dude
---
Myth. 1 to low 40s is about the same as the rest of the way to 60. Rest xp is so much "more" higher up too.
---
Yeah thats a tank weapon, generates a ton of threat and really only viable for rogues in pvp. MS would e tank, would be ninja if tank won not from guild and they gave it to guildie anyways.
---
Zug zug
---
If I remember correctly level 44 or 47 is the “halfway” point to 60 so it’s pretty close to accurate.
---
The bonus tip looks rather gray moral area "to get a group start one, find a healer then dump a responsibility of getting a tank to him". Ouch.
---
Thanks. Valuable tips!

Well during most of vanilla, Scatter/Freezing Trap/Wyvern Sting were on their own separate DR schools but from patch 1.10 to 1.12 they shared the same DR school for some reason. I believe it was a bug although don't quote me on it. Anyway, Blizzard kept it in for Classic but the private servers hunters played with the old DR (as it was for most of vanilla and also in TBC) for all those years. So in Classic, Scatter Shot shares a DR with Freezing Trap, as well as Wyvern Sting if i'm not mistaking. So that's a "nerf" to the Hunter's baseline toolkit, but it's also a nerf to your overall pvp potential because if I'm not mistaking, that means your Scatter Shot or Freezing Trap will also DR with stuffs like Goblin Rocket Helmet (incap like Scatter) or Magic Dust (Sleep like Wyvern Sting).

&gt; Problem: There is no alliance heavy server

What guild goals do you guys have after clearing content? Im looking to motivate players after content is cleared. Thinking of something like: Clear Onyxia 2x 20M / Clear MC in less than 1:30h / Conquer opposing faction city / Create a guild duel tourney / Honor Release World event. Any suggestions?
---
Sems to be the new way of moneygain for blizz
---
People talk a big game about how crucial faction balance is until you float the idea that maybe having comically overtuned PvP racials stacked on one side might possibly have something to do with it. 
---
Everyone wants balanced factions, but most people aren't willing to give up anything to get it. This is the price of no changes.
---
Might nog be exactly what I asked for, but very informative nonetheless! Thank you very much.
---
More do yes. More time no depends on your play style but not really
---
Can a lvl 32 warrior and 38 priest kill the boss for whirldwind axe
---
I've only died when I get ganked by high level people or 2/3v1s. Usually requires a health potion especially if they ambushed me but I just chuck everything I can at them and make sure to hit them with a wing clip and get out of melee range fast. Feign Death is also good to give you a second usually and maybe a trap down if your pet isn't aggro'd. 
---
Use every trick you've got and hope for some nice crits. That being said maybe I've just come up against bad players and you've had people with 10+ years in that class take you On!
---
I think the sidebar has a class specific discord’s that’s going to be your best source for detailed information.
---
The correct answer has been given already, however in the future: if someone says something to you that you don't understand, ask THEM to clarify. Don't wait, take a guess, and then ask random, unrelated 3rd parties for their opinions.
---
But muh peasants
---
I've worked it out!
---
This dude regards "dead server" to mean "not full of unemployed NEETs who are online in the middle of the day".
---
I don't know if ES is or is not dead but man, your metrics are lame.
---
Or DM was released early as a middleground. When EU servers were released DM was already in the game. DM was also originally intended to be released earlier than it was.
---
Hooray.
---
Best city in the game
---
You want to stack int/stam, necropile set from scholomance is a great place to get started.
---
That won't help if you get 3v1'd though - you either use potions to go through, or you will die no matter how much stats you have. So unless you're actually planning to duel someone on your way, I'd say it's not worth bothering, especially since those sets take up precious space.
---
Lmaoo
---
This made me laugh. Im not a hunter player but cmon this is not worht it, kek.
---
Man I've done that before.  Hastily abandoned a pet when I spotted Broken Tooth in the wild with no competition.  If you want it you have to do what you have to do.
---
“It is simple. As I have said the Kirin Tor is already prepared to place the villages under strict quarantine”
---
The king said no tho. :/
---
It's still better than ending the fight with 3k mana.
---
Yes but u will die at the end.
---
Not many calling for LFG, more like calling for more courtesy &amp; considerations from other players.
---
Because it's possible you won't be able to find a group for a significant amount of time?
---
Nearish? Sure. Waiting at the entrance for 45 minutes before finding a group that still has to travel? No fucking thank you.
---
...and that's how you manipulate the market :)
---
I deleted my alliance toon and rerolled horde on the same server
---
Brokentooth is the best for PVP due to the quick attack times interrupting casters. Don't think it matters in raids
---
This entire Arthas* must be purged.
---
Dw fury warrior
---
-log on

-get invited to guild run before I remember where I logged off

-accept invite and go to random dungeon

-its ok I enjoy tanking too
---
-3 hours later I'm kinda bored of tanking because it's stressful
---
-join a pug as a dps because I've been tanking all day and I'd like a break
---
-get laughed at or made fun of at least once for 'wanting to dps as a warrior and not tank'
---
-finish run with pug consistently top damage
---
-wish the leather or mail bis piece until PVP gear or PVP gear dropped because mc has like 6 upgrades total and you don't use tier
---
-Guild bear tank who doesn't log on until late gets on and we do runs together

---
That’s a really good explanation. Thank you for typing this out!
---
What I want to know is if you are using Chinese language pack “饿哦首中文” what does it look like when the enemy faction types ”我首中文”
---
Stratholm is legit the best place to farm runecloth for those looking for other faction mounts.
---
Every UD/Scarlet strath run I walk away with at least 3 stacks of runecloth.
---
Only 58 so far, but I feel like I stand a decent chance against other classes. Some are just annoying to deal with like druids that never stay CCed and good mages that stay in the dead zone constantly. 
---
It's a lot higher skill ceiling than most other classes.
---
I played warrior in vanilla and it's a lot more facerolling across the keyboard than hunter. Charge in and hope for crits, get CCed, intercept and hope for crits.
---
We have so many tools at our disposal and it requires timing and understanding of other classes to be effective. But when it works it's just amazing.
---
I know this feeling and as a warlock I for sure know nobody will move and just ask for port.
---
RIGHT ?!
---
Wait... which one is the short n ugly??
---
[Let me pull on yo dick a little while; I heard about that big ol' dick you got](https://youtu.be/kK-bnMiE49c?t=134)
---
Once you’re able to get Transendance it gets even better. Back in Vanilla I use to love my priest as much as I loved my lock that I Mained while we were pushing Naxx40 and dealing with C’Thun.
---
Wow never thought of this that’s hilarious.
---
It's when you see someone with guage earrings, and you run up and put a padlock through them, lock it, and run away. An earlock.
---
you complain about an issue while being a part of the problem.  
---
is this post satire?
---
It's more like delegation.  If you're in a group of 4 ready to go, just need a tank, everyone should be doing whatever they can do pull the group together.  There's nothing morally gray about that.
---
I have 1 level 60 main and 1 low-teens alt that I want to play more but can't find the time to, because there's shit needs doing on my 60.
---
Why the blueberry, though?
---
Depends on your goals. You'll be able to step into most raids and kill a boss or two with minimal time investment by simply joining a random group.
---
If you want to clear each raid you are well-advised to join a guild and the time investments a guild expects from you varies greatly. The lower end is probably around 3-4 hours a week after you farmed some decent gear from dungeons, but many will require more and sometimes a lot more than that.
---
Yea I’ll just wait til every mob is 50% health to dps since paladins have such great single target threat. Feint sucks, vanish is a 5min cd, idk what you expect lol.
---
Something something cats can do dps too
---
Not many, but that's the point.
---
If the overall balance across all pvp servers is 60/40 h/a, then I'm not sure what people think will be solved by transfers.
---
In either case, I said "less dominated". The comparative is important there. Maybe they transfer, as horde, from a 70/30 server to a 60/40 server.
---
Whats the suggested path for picking up pets long term (horde)?
---
I'm thinking about starting a hunter alt and have no particular preference for pet looks but just want to have the most useful pets without having to go back and tame some some low level pet and level it up once i get to 60.  My current thought is at 10 I grab any disposable pet, probably a boar or lion in barrens when I get there.  At mid 20s I get the worg in SFK which is one I'll keep forever and can drop my temporary pet.  At 37 I need to try and get broken tooth.  This leaves me one free stable spot to simply use to temp tame stuff for learning skills purposes and then way down the road I fill that final spot with the ZG wind serpent. 
---
Are these the staple 3 pets to have?  Wind serpent seems good even before ZG for leveling but it seems like it would mean missing out on SFK worg or broken tooth or else tying up that 3rd stable spot you need for learning abilities.
---
I play a 60 shaman without a mount. Ghost wolf is such a nice speed increase that I just didn't really feel like I needed a regular mount. Yes, guildies with mounts will leave me behind, but its only really been an issue in REALLY large zones.
---
I'm 60 gold away from 900, I'll probably be the second person in my guild with an epic mount.
---
Also, minor proofreading as well: 
---
\*hoof, not hoove
---
\*its, not it's 
---
Just in the fourth panel alone there are a couple.
---
Yup. There's not much to it other than some fun disguise wands and candy, but it's nice anyway.
---
Blizz didn't really start to flesh out the holiday events until TBC, though the Winter Veil holiday in December has a few quests.
---
It's that demon cursed orc blood man.
---
He very may well have just alt-f4'd
---
Yeah, and most Alliance play on PvE servers. Horde are the dominant faction on PvP servers. This is a well known fact.
---
[This data](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) from wowhead shows that on PvP servers in US realms, the ratio is 43% Alliance to 57% Horde. EU realms are similar, 45% Alliance to 55% Horde. The data here is a month old, so it's probably not exactly the same as what we have today, but it is highly unlikely that there would be such a massive jump in Alliance players on PvP realms in the last month to skew the numbers in favor of the Alliance, especially with Alliance players leaving because of Horde ganking.
---
You should probably get your facts straight before you insult someone.
---
Make some sort of "invite a friend" system, then. It can be solved.
---
The key to winning warrior vs mage is to abuse line of sight.
---
Hide behind something, and force them to get close. From there, it is just a matter of pummeling the right spells, landing a hamstring, and hoping you have enough damage to kill quickly.
---
Orcs doing the same thing in ogrimmar don't they?
---
The only use for BrokenTooth is caster pushback in PvP.
---
Just an idea, but what if there were a “white flag/surrender” option to escape corpse campers? Like you could have the ability to unflag yourself for 5 or 10 minutes, but maybe you lose some gold or take some durability damage? It would also have to be on a longer cooldown, maybe 2h.
---
If you tank raid bosses you will have enough rage for anything
---
Dead mines; there is a bird and cat drop.
---
Ele is probally better past like 40 or whenever you get the reduced cast time talents but before that this is what I've always found best. Try it for yourself  :)
---
Runecloth shoulders should be the best option. Check the material vs essence/dust prices and if it's not breaking even, then you can't make profit from disenchanting.
---
I'd say 45-60 takes longer than 1-45 for sure.  Later 50's seems to be going by pretty fast though.
---
I layered while in an Ice block about to die
---
I was in MC as soon as I hit 58. If you’re pugging it you’ll probably only get invited as resto however you might get brought as feral dps or moonkin if you have a lax leader.
---
The essence of good comedy is show, don't tell.
---
Use less words, and try not to over explain the joke! Last panel would be a lot funnier with maybe just "I think I'll skip this quest..." And one, or no, lines from the guy who's gone crazy. The crazy is already heavily implied from what we see (a pile of corpses, a man covered in blood) so we get the joke without needing it explained.
---
I've always hated the Chinese govt, for what it's worth.
---
Don't you know that all your expectations were wrong? Great writing right?!
---
&gt; Alliance from Venoxis here
---
I am also Alliance from Venoxis. And based on my anecdotal evidence I think 6:4 is still the norm. Sometimes you see horde ganking alliance and sometimes you see alliance ganking horde.
---
What I see far more often - in grp chat, general chat, even in guild chat of my leveling guild - are people whining about too many horde and making people want to switch to PvE servers because of it.
---
There will be two reasons for shrinking alliance player population: alarmist people who make leveling players reconsider switching and horde ganking.
---
yep thats what im doing currently
---
A little Penicillin will take care of it .
---
Maybe you have a solution to a similar issue I had last night:
---
I got my ony buff, then flew to felwood and got my songflower buff, went down to Dustwallow and logged off until raid time. Logged back in and saw a raid of alliance outside the entrance. Popped an invisibility potion and ran in... but you can't zone into a raid instance without being in a raid. Invis ran out and I got deleted along with my world buffs.
---
Any way to make a raid for myself to avoid that? Obviously I should wait longer for a raid invite next time but... very frustrating.
---
I'm lvl 52 and still using a staff. Got the 1% spell crit sword from Maraudon but I dont have an offhand yet! Using the staff from ZF atm.
---
Can get you some proof when I next raid which is sunday.
---
Here's my gear for reference.

319  SW:P Ticks

308 Mind Flay Ticks

1020~ Mind Blast Non Crits

SW:P Ticks every 3 Seconds so 319/3 = 106.3333333333333 DPS
---
Mind Flay = 308 DPS

Mind Blast is a 1.5 second cast so 680~ DPS for its execution time which is 1/3 of my damage rotation

Ignoring Devo Plague start is

For a total of 11156 over 24 seconds or 464.83dps.

10% hit from talents, 1% from gear gives me a 6% chance to miss

464.83 * 0.94 = 436.16dps

This assumes Mindblast never crits, and the only debuff on the target is shadow weaving.

So without Improved Shadow Bolt, Curse of Shadows, Consumables.

---
Reported.
---
the talent available have nothing to do with Mc-ony being tank-and-spank.
---
keep in mind this is compared to BFA bosses where we have 3 pages overlapping mechanic per phase in a 4-phase encounter...
---
Yea I’m aware other classes can use these items. Just listing things that support feral spec. Idk why a rogue would get the shoulders for pvp over a feral for main spec but w/e. Wouldn’t they want their t2 shoulders anyways? Also what other class would use the maul anyways? A ret pally?
---
Those were 2 different situations. At the start you won't have enough crit to be crit capped so you can't let all HS go through and therefore extra hit is helpful. Later one you'll be crit capped and you'll want to get more hit to push your crit cap further or you'll lose dps.
---
Hey Blizzard, I need to work for 2 hours until I get home. Gf is out of town and I got the flat for myself. Don‘t you dare to ruin my evening!!
---
(Pls pls pls 😢)
---
Boar all the way ! Their charge causes their next auto-attack to deal increased damage which helps a lot with threat. Also they eat absolutely any kind of food.
---
A caveat for the hardcore player: summoning Felsteed costs 100 mana to summon
---
There was no way to screen the healthy ones. Given more time - the time it would take to do so - they would have been infected. It was the only option.
---
Why? Those people have nothing else to do with their time.
---
Yeah just ask any innkeeper
---
Warrior questions 
---
I’m looking to tank and do some damage. Everyone told me prot is pointless so I went arms
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdhbo
---
Where do I go next now after sweeping strikes?I don’t see many more useful talents and mortal strike will require a lot of talent commitments
---
Also how do I effectively swap between 2H and sword/shield? I see many people say to do this as tank
---
After 6 eye drops in a row, our hunters still cry in a corner.
---
What a fun and interactive video. Solid Job Fella!
---
To stop playing!  Not me, but that's what many players are going to do in phase 2.
---
Don't do this to me - Matt Daemon
---
I played warlock in vanilla and thought I was the shit.  I play a warlock now and sometimes wish I was a mage.
---
Mages just have so many little things going for them.  Food water and teleports may seem insignificant but they will save you TONS of time waiting for boats and flights.  It can also make you a good chunk of change.  I have spent at least 50g by my estimate on various mage services.
---
Sure, warlocks have summons and soulstones, and healthstones... but I would take mage perks any day.
---
Mages also have superior AoE.  Frost nova is a game changer.  Arcane explosion is instant cast.  Blizzard has a slow.
---
Warlocks two versions of AoE are both channeled making you immobile and are subject to being interrupted.
---
Mages have polymorph which is a great form of cc that works in almost all dungeons.
---
Warlocks get banish which is less useful as there are fewer elementals than humanoids/beasts.
---
Mages get 5%hit from talents.  Warlocks only get this for affliction spells (no good in pve).
---
With all this being said, I wouldn't give up my warlock for anything.  Warlock suits my personal playstyle.  They are fun to pvp with.  They do respectable dps once they get some hit gear.  There are fewer of us than there are mages so gear comes a bit more quickly.
---
TLDR:  Roll a boomkin.
---
Smite spec is best spec
---
Because horde has always fostered a sense of horde pride from day 1.   
---
Alliance is incredibly generic and had to steal the “for the alliance” slogan.  
---
I played alliance from vanilla until early wotlk when I wanted to change things up so I went orc DK. It was like a whole different world, the sense of being horde actually felt like you were part of something.  
---
Alliance never really made me feel like I was part of the alliance or anything.  
---
It’s hard to explain tbh, but people are proud to be horde.  
---
I don’t blame the players, it feels like Blizzard just never made Alliance as enjoyable from my perspective.  
---
They always just kind of existed. Maybe it’s because I’ve been horde for too long, but the entire game feels horde driven. Alliance has never had leaders that let them shine or given the alliance any purpose. Varian came to late, tyrande was non-existent as far as I remember. Magni didn’t do anything.  
---
I dunno, it just seems like alliance never had anything to pull players in like Thrall or Sylvanis. All the cool Alliance heroes became villains by the end of Warcraft 3.
---
Love the metaphor. I’m sold, I want to ride the rollercoaster!
---
Very true on vanilla. Completely false in pvp. Paladins were the laughing stock of arenas, to the point it was easier to go retribution (which no, it wasn't a good spec at the time) than holy. 
---
I remember boosting people to 2k on my druid in 2v2 and when we saw a paladin on the other team we knew it was a free win.
---
He made a horde character on Herod.  I proceeded to never play on it.  I mean the server was probably going to be horde sided either way but that just made it happen faster.
---
A little bizarre questions. After all of classics is released... 
---
Are they going to start with TBC? 
---
Or 
---
Create NEW content?
---
Tauren is a lot of fun. Giant cow man enveloped by lightning and wind when Windfury procs, and a massive axe with lightning spewing from it hacking away at the target. 
---
Orc is arguably better for racials, and fem orc animations are excellent. Male orc casting animations make you feel like Thrall. But there's a lot to be said for Tauren.
---
Now that you get 30% stun resist but there are no more alliance to stun you anyway. What do you choose?
---
Seriously, I love the horde but I rerolled as an alliance just to challenge myself. If you are good enough, the racial doesn't matter much.
---
You keep saying that but you don’t have the critical thinking skills to figure out the allies have the advantage on pve realms. You really think they mostly picked pve realms because they love bgs but hate wpvp?
---
&gt;couldn't of traded it
---
Man that last sentence could have used a few more commas and a few less ands.
---
I mean the more determined campers would just follow you until you got flagged again.
---
Are you the blatant idiot? This is someone not even telling you /their/ price, which this whole thread is about
---
L2Read you absolute doofus
---
My server has...almost no economy at present. Pretty much nothing costs more than a hundred gold, and very few can muster that. Population bubble is only now in the 40s, so that might change, but right now, BOEs can be had for a song. Twink gear especially, given that arenas ain't out yet.
---
It seems exactly like they’re doing that in retail though.
---
I mean there's no reason not to...you should honestly just do p1 in cat form unless you're really underhealing it or doing it with 15-20 people.
---
What about these pumpkin bags!?
---
I'm actually leveling a druid alt for the reasons that you mentioned
---
Love those peeps that race fast af to cap and scream bored, lmao. It's like going to a party and you always get that idiot(s) whom rapidly inhale alcohol then are puking and passed within an hour, and you're like the night is young, its only midnight, much time left to enjoy.
---
Brutal
---
Thank you and I am kinda sorry for that. I need to find someone who is able to proofread them if mistakes like that slip in.
---
I'm using Puggle addon and forwarding /4 into separate tab.  
---
This way I don't see all this spam, and Puggle show me filtered LFG requests, separated into dungeons/levels/etc.
---
In current level 40, been running SM as a Pally tank/heals since 34.
---
In my past 5 runs, I've had: 1 Hunter and 1 Warrior who needed everything, even after being told not to / 2 Warriors who charged into packs as soon as I took proximity aggro to LoS pull, even after repeatedly being told to wait / 3 Mages and 1 Lock that began Blizzard/Rain of Firing before Consecration went up, even after being repeatedly told to wait / 1 Rogue, 1 Paladin and 1 Warrior who refused to attack marked targets, even after repeatedly being told to.
---
Out if 15 DPS, 11 were not very pleasant to group with. I always ask as nicely as possible the first time, and then literally beg then the second. Still doesn't work a lot of the time. I'm wondering if most of them didn't speak English as a primary language or something.
---
I'm thinking that it's because everyone who has a 60 already is running DM, so my not-much-time-to-play-slow-leveling ass is stuck with people who don't know what they're doing.
---
I think it's kinda nice not to have to play the game. I raidlog 2 hours per week, the rest of the time I can spend playing other games.
---
Great question. I wonder if this can be done by keybinding right click to target AND a nifty macro at the same time? I'll be trying this when i get home.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Communicate.
---
Still one pool. Each boss you kill = less items in the tribute from that pool.
---
What UI is that?
---
This is not Xpearl is it?
---
because a guildie can fuck it up
---
Memed rerolling to it as Horde
---
Is the drop rate really this bad? I still have to do this quest. 😅
---
After gathering the feathers from the harpies in mulgore I was hoping it could only go uphill ...
---
It's fairly efficient. Particularly with buffs. The cost difference between, say, a +12 and a +10 sta food buff can be several times as much, and honestly, for most people, 2 sta is pretty marginal. You can easily get away without it.
---
You replied to the wrong guy, idiot.
---
Yeah lol true but I was trying not to come off as a complete noob so I'd be more likely to join them on raids.
---
Do they forget that the zombies had wallets and purses in their past lives...
---
Ripe for the taking!
---
So they think they do, but they don't?
---
That wasn’t my experience. I battled it out for a solid weekend in Southshore and managed to get 4 yeti furs in two days.
---
Don't blame Asmon for playing around for 1 day FFS. If you need a big baddy, you can blame Goon Squad. Your welcome Goons, I know that this made you hard. But seriously, the faction imbalance was way way way out of whack before he trolled.
---
Great decision!
---
To me you're making an argument as to why he should be able to roll on healing gear. It is a pug, if you want guaranteed loot then do guild runs. The reason most people do dungeons is to get their pre-BiS to be able to raid, not gear up for more dungeons. 
---
I agree that he should talk to the healer first and if there is a particular item the healer really needs then I would pass. But expecting random strangers to run you through dungeons and not need on gear they need is naive.
---
Yeah, people would cry about not being able to make a character on their friend's realm.  The worst that happens on a 70/30 realm is that you don't get to corpse camp as many people because they swapped servers.
---
The frame borders should glow when there's an applicable debuff.
---
this shit was terrifying lol
---
Pretty much. Your best bet is keeping your revenge as a side taunt for when mobs start agroing, you never want to not be auto attacking, especially at that level.
---
Jaina was there when they discovered it but it was only Arthas and his men that defended those never ending wave of undead. By this point, he probably lost plenty of men to a swarms of recently killed and reanimated alliance citizens. I’m thinking at this point Arthas was just in kill mode but a little bit of conversation could have helped but it’s possible their fallout still would have ended up at the point of Uther being suspended and Jaine leaving him.
---
Why would they have become infected?  You immediately destroy the grain, divide the people by asking who’s had it.  Understand a portion will lie, so you maintain a police force to watch, and then after a time you have no one else turning you dissolve the police force.
---
The layout is weird and hard to figure out sometimes, and it's super easy to accidentally pull mobs in a lot of places. The theme also feels a bit cobbled together with the troggs, gnomes, oozes and dwarves all running around in there completely disconnected from eachother. Imo gnomeregan is a fairly boring dungeon with a confusing layout that feels slow even with a good group.
---
Not to mention you need partner servers in the same or similar region. A player will almost never transfer from a US East server to a Brazil or Oceanic server.
---
I don't think you can bind right click to just that, since it has multiple issues in wow
---
I didn't abandon my owl. There was no other hunter in Badlands at the time, so I ran back to Loch Modan stable master. Then I realised that I forgot about possible horde hunters and had a "relaxing" run back to Badlands.
---
natures swiftness is actually very easy to pass up. when im healing, ive never had someone die because i needed an instant heal. the only time people die is when i run out of mana. i dont think having an instant heal every 3 minutes will make any difference
---
but leader of the pack does make a big difference. since crit is the best way to generate rage, getting 3% crit is pretty good. alot of people are obsessed with devilsaur gear giving 1% crit. so imagine a talent that gives 3% to your whole group for free
---
You know some people like to enjoy the game and not get to 60 as fast as possible?
---
I know :( I'm just pretending none of this happened, go about your business
---
Badlands have those fucking rock elementals that 10 other players try to kill for that quest.
---
Tanaris has ranged DPS killing you from the roof of the arena.
---
''post masturbatory sense''
---
Gentleman's way of saying post nut clarity
---
Again. How do you prove it? They would specifically have to say in game "Hey, I'm collaborating with horde on discord to kill the other alliance guys."
---
Any "hints" and stuff like that is not evidence. Like the "mafia approved devilsaur set". They can easily say it's just a joke.
---
Is this some sort of Halloween costume or just photoshopped?
---
Ty. Why do you say that?
---
Free transfers messed up my server balance. NA East Incendius. A lot of Alliance transferred off and now it favor heavily horde but no more queue so theres that.
---
If you are insistent on BiS enchants, that's true. 
---
However, the vast majority of enchants can be had extremely cheaply or free from people skilling up. Really no reason to leave your stuff unenchanted when the main cost is 30 sec in ironforge or stormwind.
---
Retail had it, has it even. Just not as common now
---
Last I've seen it was already 42/58. It only gets worse once the PvP phase without BGs come out.
---
&gt; People play horde to have an easier time in PVP and the ideal ratio is something like 60/40 or 65/35 in favour of Horde.
---
That's a lot of assumptions there, calm down buddy, okay?
---
I picked Horde because I like how they look, and I like eating people after I kill them.  No reason beyond that.
---
Not a bizarre question, but it is a question that has been asked over a hundred times on this sub and nobody has an answer.
---
49 is the best bracket for warriors but you really should go Mortal Strike. Grab Kang to go with it and you're golden.
---
The way I understand it that hit cap is the minimum and you want to keep it. You’ll want to start gathering crit gear where you can.
---
I look at it this way. I’m at my hit cap and if acquiring a raid upgrade or seeking out additional AP/crit I have some hit items in mind I could get to replace other items to retain hit. 
---
Here’s an example: I am about to finish my Lionheart giving me 2% hit where I don’t have hit currently. With my battleborne arm braces (1%hit 1%crit no other stats) I will be 1% over my hit cap. I will replace those at that time with the bracers off Timmy from strat (1%crit with str and stam) giving me an increase to AP) 
---
Down the road I know I can simply go get satyrs bow for 1% hit to make up for another item slot increasing my AP/crit.
---
My English was crubling under the great strain! ; P
---
Cower is beyond worthless. Just toggle Growl off and you’ll be fine in dungeons. 
---
I’d use Bite+Growl if you need Growl, and Claw only if you don’t need Growl.
---
This is exactly right of course. My spreadsheet isn't meant to be a guide, just information to help make informed decisions. In fact, the main reason I build it was to think critically myself rather than follow the general advice of just spam HT4. I did want to point out on the sheet that HT3 and HT4 are good reference points to compare to though.
---
My guild did ony splits yesterday, two groups of 20, so your point about having some healers rest and some heal is spot on, but a pretty advanced strategy. The second best strategy would be for your healers to all use maximum mana efficiency heals, but the best strategy is for some of your healers to output whatever is necessary to allow some of the healers to regen.
---
Unfortunately, we don't have a recent example to draw behavioral examples from, since the concept of a realm is almost irrelevant now on retail.
---
Is this right: rules weren’t changed, but people interpreted this weapon as their main spec when the loot master thought it was main spec tank only?
---
&gt; I’ve been 60 on Herod since the second week and in my opinion the balance doesn’t seem to be getting worse; actually seems to be getting better.
---
You obviously haven't been paying attention.  Go to the Blackrock Spire instance entrance any time of the day and you'll see 20-30 horde killing any alliance trying to get in.
---
So is it just 3 quests then? 2 in SS and one in SW (for ally)?
---
Honestly, there is no reason Illidan should have ever survived the beatdown at the Frozen Throne. He should have died and been reincarnated to serve the Lich King. They just wanted him to be that familiar face that everyone loved.
---
&gt; You can have 4k queues and "low" pop servers at the same hour right now.
---
When I log in at evening, there's 2-3 Full server, 6-8 High servers, 4-6 Medium and 1-3 Low.  
---
Are you sure that "most servers are dead"?)
---
Like others said, the idea is simple - more bosses you kill, less loot. All bosses left alive nets 3 blues and a handful of greens, couldn’t tell you how many you get with any bosses killed as we never do that. The loot table is the same regardless of which boss you kill.
---
I have a 26 pure prot war. I only take him into dungeons. 
---
I would suggest getting a dagger for quick rage building. 
---
Also, be in control of marking a skull Target and ensure people hit that until it's dead then mark another skull. Be on top of this and the aggro will stay on you. This ensures people aren't building hate on the off targets like morons and gets everybody on the same page. I even tell people to stop and if they ignore me I tell them I'm no longer taunting their random threat bc they're not actually a party member if they're just doing their own thing. I've not had anybody leave or kick me :) 
---
Also, little tricks like realizing demo vs battle cries. Battle gives the exact same threat but can't be resisted :) 
---
Don't worry a damn bit about doing DPS. Altho I spend a lot on gear, even when I'm just wondering and shouting I don't tend to leave the top 2 DPS spots. DPS doesn't make you a good player, no matter how much the teenagers yell. 
---
Most importantly, try to be about 1-2 levels above the suggested level for a dungeon. I tried SFK at 22 and I couldn't hold aggro. Too many misses, parries, etc. 2 levels later I couldn't lose threat lol.
---
In hindsight Arthas was kinda right to purge the city, the problem is really that Uther abandoned Arthas and allowed him to go to Northrend alone to face Mal Ganis

From what I've seen most of the people here take pictures of their screens and don't bind abilities so take all the pvp commentary with a grain of salt
---
If Janine’s leaving wasn’t going to wake up Arthas from his blood rage, nothing would.
---
And having played the mission, definitely lost a lot of guys.
---
Ironically, NOT having cross-server BGs would fix this problem. The worse your faction ratio, the lower your queues ... they could then get people to switch servers.
---
Nor did Griffith.

---
Like the other responses have implied. . .
---
In a lot of cases (especially with T1 raid gear) your blues will be better then purples. In most cases there is a trade, the purple is better at everything but 1 thing. If that 1 thing is your hit cap, then you don't use it, save it for when you can make up the hit cap elsewhere.
---
While I agree with most of your point, right now you just get mocked if you /1 need help, allies here.
---
"Lol why would I help, no honor yet."
---
"^x1000"
---
I remember being frustrated by this.  There are certain positions hunters just simply cannot get out of easily at all and without help are almost certain death.
---
- Slowed in melee against a melee class.  To get away, you need to have laid down freezing or frost trap before battle, and have root proc.  Improved wing clip proc. Deterrance long enough  for the slow to expire.  Basically, you need luck, and need it right when the melee gets on you
---
-You and your pet Frost nova'd in the deadzone.  Youre done.
---
-Dotted and feared
---
............
---
The only way to win in world pvp is to do enough damage before getting in one of those death situations.  Because theres no recovery.  You need to do everything you can to keep max distance.
---
If they get the jump on you, recovery is difficult/impossible.   
---
Duels are slightly better because youll be fine.  BGs are fine because mail gives healers a bit more time, and youll always have a ranged target  you can hit.
---
Things got better with TBC to escape melee.
---
Hey look, this joke again about servers. Great content!
---
Never played a warrior so I have no input as to the talents, but for swapping gear you can make a macro something like 
---
&gt; /equip \[noequipped:shields\] 1h\_Weapon; 2h\_Weapon   
---
&gt;/equip \[noequipped:shields\] Shield 
---
just replace "1h\_weapon", "2h\_weapon", and "Shield" with the actual names of your weapons and shield. With this macro you should be able to swap back and forth with just one click.
---
Allegedly the issue has been resolved, haven't tried yet, just saw it on their Twatter.
---
I rolled horde only because I was considering a shaman as an alt but not considering paladin.  Aside from that, I'd much rather be alliance as I like their towns more.  At this point one of the biggest hurdles I have with the idea of going alliance is that low level zones are really starting to feel dead already.   I've got a 23 warrior alt right now and have barely seen anyone else out leveling.  I also leveled a hunter to 7 and never saw a single other person in the starting area/razor hill.   It's pretty crazy.  As a more casual player/slow leveler, that has me worried that I'd always be so far behind the crowd that I'd eventually never be able to find a group for anything on my way to 60.  
---
Also, there's no good way (that I know of) to even figure out a reasonable server to switch to help keep a good balance.
---
Best comment :D
---
There are enough tertiary pieces that add hit that you shouldn't worry. Keep collecting gear. Get stuff like Blackcrow/Satyr Bow and Blackstone/Tarnished Elven Ring that are replaced by stuff that also gives hit. As a rogue, getting full T1+T2 pants/helm, I really only lose 4% hit, and will still be at 7%, higher than I actually technically need.
---
This is real life advice. Communication is key for success in every aspect of your day to day life. If you don't understand, ask immediately. The longer you wait, the worse it will get.
---
I neeeeeeeeeed then I fucking love pumpkins
---
At 50+ you have more zones to run, more things to do, more buttons to press.  
---
So while it may take longer time, it's also less "noticeable".
---
So he's a 40 elite...you're going to have a hard time doing much damage to him. Are you on a larger server? If you ask someone in trade chat for help I'm sure a kind soul would lend you a few minutes!
---
They're figuring it out, give them time, and feedback.  They probably have stats on everything and will balance everything out in due time.
---
I play Alliance on Kromcrush and I think it still feels pretty balanced. I see tons of Alliance in contested zones and I never really have any trouble getting quests done. I tend to only play during peak hours though, between 6:30 and 10:00 pm, so maybe that's why.
---
I agree on the transfers though, I don't understand why they offered transfers for Kromcrush when there were no queues.
---
that's nuts!
---
2 months in we're still talking as if it's rushing?
---
I think Druids and Priest can do it too, but I’m not 100% certain
---
/4 LFG Scholo/strath (any)/LBRS/UBRS/DM:T (have frost oil and 300 LP)
---
Every day. Literally haven't ran UBRS or LBRS yet. Wait half an hour spamming every minute or so.
---
Then, i get into a scholo group. "can we do jandice? I really need mira's and we have 2 physical dps." No answer. The tank doesn't clear the mobs, so i guess the answer is no. Everyone in the group has the kill jandice quest. Cry inside.
---
I don't disagree, but I think they jumped the shark with him being so self sacrificing in Legion.  My impression from him in up until WoW was that he sought power but he was in generally good.
---
Imagine if everyone did this, would be rather hilarious.
---
It's pretty bad on skeram too.  When they offered server transfers a ton of alliance guilds fled the server.
---
When the wpvp phase gets released the alliance players 50-59 will not be able to step foot in the world and the level 60s will be camped for hours

That is a link to an elitist jerks article about classic hunter weapons and dps rankings. It’s mostly raiding weapons/pvp weapons, but it should give you a good idea.

To answer your question you’ll see there are some weapons on the list that are well below 2.6 speed.

I've been that person many times and I'm sorry.

Slows down the raid.

A note on the 2nd panel, why do the guy's eyes turn from eyes to dots? And as other's have said, third text box could go and not be missed, generally wordy but a start
---
For rogue, when a target is about to die and you spent all combo points on it, do you let the auto attacks kill it and save the energy so as to not waste the combo point or do you ss?
---
Doesn't SW:P do extra aggro?
---
His comment made me curious so I went and watched it ^^
---
Not incorrect but inaccurate
---
1/ "the recipe for the leggings is worth at least 100g".well that's Server dependent. Goes from 25-50 on mine
---
Incorrect afaik
---
1/ "you need to do yeti quests". Didn't do them, but am a Tribal LW
---
2/ 'glove recipe is on an 8h timer'. I've bought 2 within 40min. But also didn't find them within 40min another time. Not sure how it works, but Def not 8h.
---
3/ "they spawn at the squares" they don't. the OP of the map already wrote they spawn where the letter marks the trail
---
4/ respawn times are incorrect and also provided by OP of the map
---
General
---
1/ Calls people rats etc. who will loot your stuff. But the other faction is fair game.. No understanding that either case its another human sitting behind another PC no one one should have to deal with that. Claims ethics but only uses them when they are useful to himself, by educating people to not steal his shit.
---
2/ is annoid at people dropping the price. That's a free market. That's how it's supposed to work. Having a mafia/monopol that forces high prices is unethical. Of course it's great for him if prices are high, but more people are turning 60 every day, more people have the ressources to farm, more people have the LW skill. It makes sense the price drops.
---
Yes, you are correct. Correct odds are 0.024%
---
Wait that's gay
---
6 of the top 10 ranked guilds on warcraftlogs on Skeram are alliance.
---
Great prompt buddy, you did good.
---
What server you play on?
---
&gt;The last time he listened to “Good” characters, he was locked up for thousands of years.
---
Wait what?  I thought the whole reason for his imprisonment was that he *didn't* listen to the Good characters and he created a new Well of Eternity (which the BL wanted to use to enter Azeroth) because he didn't want to give up its powers?
---
Should also see the Wickerman event outside UC for a world buff.
---
Easiest way - buy in Darnassus. There's vendor that sell two or three kittens.  
---
Or get them from Dead Mines, last 3 bosses.  
---
Or there's quest chain in The Hinterlands\Feralas\Tanaris, that give you egg of faery dragon as a reward.
---
"tho"

Hunter: log on, go to DM and hope to get into a group.
---
Don't get into a group so try to do DM Tribute solo. Die a couple of times, but eventually get it. Free gold.
---
Warrior tanks have 3  taunts, pallies have 0... It's almost like you need to adapt how you play to your group composition.

If I recall pve servers won't be battle grouped with PvP ones
---
You can FD/Trap to reset fights with Melee...

Why does it matter dwarf vs troll?

Ranged weapons don’t glancing blow
---
We don't know.  The first option people have generally called TBC Classic.  The second option people have been calling Classic Plus.  The third option is to do neither, and just let Classic be Classic.  
---
The developers did an interview with a podcast right before release, and they said they hadn't made any decisions yet, but were open to both option 1 and 2.
---
Exactly right. What may be a surprise is that regrowth is actually a very good emergency heal, and a large reason for it is the 2 second cast time versus 3+ second of a high rank healing touch. Even if the hot part of the heal ends up wasted, often times that loss of efficiency will be worth keeping someone alive.
---
Scourge freaks.
---
Imagine my reaction when I saw the auctions actually sell. Even with that price.
---
Kek exactly.
---
I don't think I've ever lacked the rage for a maul, swipe to dump rage all day long.  Unless I'm trying to avoid a close cc'd target.
---
hey, NOT TRUE. I had some sweet 20 min during my lunch break and was not able to go and kill 2 STV goblins with my warr :'(( feelsbadman
---
I believe 43 is halfway, and 52 is 3/4.
---
Moonkin doesn't really run out of mana in raids if you're using consumables. Mana can become a problem if the fights are really long i guess, but you can just downrank then.
---
Engaging someone actively questing in PvP at this point in Classic is almost always out of a desire to grief, IMO.
---
I sold some of them on AH when I first started my character. Now (laziness) I just sell them to vendors or give them to guild mates who want them for alts.
---
You really aren't missing out, it's not that big of a deal as people make it.
---
Now do a video of some of the other dragons that can't be done 10 man.
---
In most cases you get attacked by more than 1 at once. Pvp gear will probably not save you. Maybe if you're really good at pvp, but otherwise it probably won't make a big difference.
---
It’s a nice third comic!
---
For your next comic, try using images to properly model the character proportions and background assets. Like with Clyde’s body parts and the strange bones he’s standing upon
---
Exactly what I was thinking.  I have a 47 Hunter that I'm banking a little rested while I wait for a buddy and leveling my 2 other alts while I wait (24 Priest and 10 rogue).  Keeps things fresh as well.  Then I bank some rested on the alts for a couple days while I go ham on the Hunter again.
---
If it’s got above average stats I spend a few mins in trade chat advertising. If I don’t get any bites I vendor it.
---
Yup, having some problems with battle.net, and getting constant disconnects or can't connect at all.
---
Using vpn helps so far.
---
darkshore is the best zone for 10-20. you can get 10 full levels if you clear the whole zone
---
westfall totally sucks so i dont know why everybody favors it. you go there at 10 and theres maybe 2 quests you can do before things start outleveling you. so you have to leave and come back later. and there arent even that many quests there anyway. not nearly enough to get you 10-20. also, the specific quests in westfall are super lamesauce. like running around looking for oat spawns that are extremely rare and highly contested. or collecting bird and boar meat with no good place to farm them. the defias messenger quest you have to try and tag first. or the defias escort you have to wait and try to grab. its just overall a terrible zone. i dont know why its so popular
---
loch modan has a better low level experience. theres a good handful of quests you can do from like 10-15, but you will run out before hitting 20
---
so overall, darkshore is far and away the best 10-20 zone
---
Nerf orcs racial to 10% and there will be plenty of Alliance

Are they going to fix Hints of a New Plague in Arathi?

I took about 7 days played to get to 50, and dinged 60 with 10 days 15 hours.  I ran tons of dungeons and did about 1.5 levels of grinding for Robe of the Archmage mats instead of questing.
---
&gt; Typically your fresh lvl 40 character throws ALL gold on their mount and then struggles to buy all ranks of spells after hitting lvl 60.
---
And here I am at level 54 and swimming in my 620 gold pieces. Ah, a miners privilege I guess.
---
how the heck is 12 day played rushed...
---
the mages did it in 3 day.
---
the hardcore did it in 4-5 day.
---
my priest did it in 6 days.

how the heck is 12 days anything other than smelling flower at every turn and questing in the most inefficient possible way?
---
You can also whisper tanks and healers and just use global LFG to fill dps.  Then also add people to your friends list
---
That's how we did it in the first few weeks.  Pretty sure all the fast levelers had each other on their friends list.
---
Personally I never start or join a group that doesn't have a tank already in the mix and I certainly never spam "LFG UBRS DPS".  When looking to get a group going I always start by asking guild and then whispering people. 
---
This is the social aspect.  Not spamming "DPS LFG SM"
---
This sounds dumb and made up but it’s real. Go to Westfall to the farm with all the harvesters (it’s on the map with a name, but I forget it). Go up to a chicken and make a macro for /chicken and spam it at the chicken. It takes around 100x I think. The chicken will get a ? over its head for a quest to give it food. Go to the farmer at the farm, buy feed, turn it in to the chicken. The chicken will spawn and egg that you click and it’ll grant you a prairie chicken.
---
I use a cat with growl and bite on autocast and I occasionally manually cast claw, he rarely drops aggro and when he does I cast the stun (intimidate) which also causes a large amount of threat. Cats have the highest dps because of the 10% damage modifier and the ability to use both bite and claw. Birds and bats can cause a greater amount of immediate threat due to screech and boars due to charge but you wont have aggro problems using a cat.
---
He hit you with that Scarecrow gas.

Mages are the new huntards in Classic thank God.  We're finally free

Awesome! thanks!

I completely feel like Horde players are generic BLOOD AND THUNDER as an excuse to murder absolutely everything they see, it's typical beastial tribes minus forsaken grouping together and pretty heavily about war
---
Always been proud to be Alliance, even when all my friends were pushing hard to play Horde this time around I told them to go ahead if they want, I'm playing my night elf warrior
---
There's pride in both factions, Horde are just more obnoxiously loud about it
---
I used a cat 10-60 and there were quite a few times where I wished I had an Owl instead of a Cat for the higher threat generation. Screech is ridiculously good.

The quest ones get vendored for sure.  I have disenchanting on my alt, so I send the BoE’s there.

Reading this post and the comments gave me a massive dose of deja vu.

Don't know if a person has ever sounded as condescending and ignorant at the same time.
---
EDIT: And I don' t mean you, PoachTWC.
---
Is is 100% true. The other time is farming Mats or making some gold through trade as you wait to do a Dungeon.
---
I think it's mostly younger children coming from a retail era, on retail the tank is basically always rewarded what was personal loot and cue up bonuses.
---
And if a low number of Tanks are chewing then tanks get additional rewards when they are even more highly sought-after. None of this exists in vanilla and I think for good reason, however that also means that change that don't need anything specific from the dungeon have absolutely no reason to go again. 
---
This is actually the first server I've played on where I've tanked but on all of my past private servers I've always paid for, or let them Reserve all the drops of the Run that no one else needs.

It's actually beneficial, because then you get an over-geared tank that just crushes the place

thanks for the feedback &amp; taking the time to clear up the inconsistencies, the prices are definitely server-dependent and it does seem I messed up the respawn times. again thank you for not being a dick about it, I didn't know that the OP of the map made a post as I found it on google images, I'll have to make a comment on the video and pin it soon

that odd moment when someone says PvP being about skill, and not about gear, is a bad thing...

It's correct, and it has been proven right every time subs made a "no rules" day. If anything, the no rule days were always better than other days.
---
What's wrong with it?  I completed the quest just fine.
---
I hit 40 last night with 32g so I'm desperate to grab some extra gold. I won't hold my breath but if it manages to make me anything at all I'll be grateful!
---
I've never understood this myth. It will not take you longer unless you're putzing around (which is fine by the way, it's a great game to putz around in). The raw experience needed is almost as much, but the time investment is not. You get more for quests, have way more zones opened up to you, and the 50+ dungeons have a stupid amount of quests in them that reward a lot of exp. I play pretty casually, 2-3 hours a day, 5ish days a week, and that was enough for me to get 50-60 in a week. I play Priest by the way.
---
It’s definitely getting there, man. I see it in the towns all the time.
---
There's no reason to "save" energy. If there are targets still alive and nearby, use the points to refresh your Slice and Dice. If there are no other targets near by, Eviscerate the thing.

When I attempt to equip a shield to bash the ability has a short timer. It's usually too long to utilize when a mob begins casting.  So, to add to your question could a macro address that?

How common are healers on Benediction, Alliance side? I have a 59 dwarf priest on a pve server but am considering making another one on Benediction. Healers seem to be over populated on my server though :(
---
Thats what happens when you blow through leveling with only MC/Ony released and no pvp implemented yet
---
Some people are solely focused on gold per hour and actually like helping people when they can.. I have a high level lock and dont mind at all when people ask for summons. Sometimes I'm not in the mood or I'm about to get off but theres nothing wrong with asking someone politely for a summons.
---
This will equip your 1H and Shield if you have no shield equiped. Then cast shield bash.
---
In combat swapping weapons triggers the global cooldown. Each button press can only trigger the GCD once, so you'll need to hit this button twice to actually get the Shield Bash off.

If two of the sources pulled data out of their ass, that doesn't invalidate the third source that based their data on statistics collected in-game.
---
The stats were collected around the clock, so it doesn't matter at what times people play as long as they play at all. /who can be split up by player class, race, level, zone, first letter of their name.
---
It is not too late to re-roll. Just pick another PvP server where the Alliance is outnumbered and you will get all the PvP you can handle.
---
And so shall it be
---
Well, this time around most players are coming in with the game 'solved', and people are going to roll orc and undead if they want to pvp.

Last DM I was in the healer died and all 3 dps whipped out jumper cables. Everyone really should be an engineer in classic.

Ah, i thought the same, and found a discussion some time ago as to why he was wrong. The only reason he shouldn't have done why he did was because he was a paladin, and he should have looked for alternatives to killing people. He also allowed rage/vengeance to take over, which is another thing paladins should not allow.
---
From my understanding, had he not been a paladin, it would have been fine by others
---
you heart will tell when you should stop as my aunt said
---
I love how OP makes these ridiculous posts and then doesn’t reply to a single comment because they are all bashing the idea.
---
Look at his post history about bringing a battle royals to WoW because of Ninja. Lmfao.
---
The "my girlfriend made me this Chromie plushie" threads are inevitable.
---
Must be catch up gear, thanks for the reply!
---
Im actually the opposite. Played horde throughout every foray into retail, but this time Im giving alliance a solid shot. 
---
Im only level 50 but... It feels like a new game. It's wonderful to experience these questlines for the first time and see the world through a different lens.
---
nice. that's my guild there.  they felt like doing something after ony, i wasnt there cuz i wanted to run keys in retail.
---
Less than 2 months eh?
---
Both, questing is a grind
---
That's because changing weapons whilst in combat triggers the 1sec global cooldown.
---
So when you switch weapons you need to wait a bit before you can cast. If the mob is casting something with a short cast time then you'll probably miss the window to shield bash most of the time. But for longer cast time spells, there's plenty of time to switch and shield bash.
---
Wow what's wrong with you, don't you know that this subreddit is exclusively for memes, streamers, and arguing?
---
Talking about the game itself is forbidden. I learned that lesson a long time ago. Asking questions outside of one specific thread will get you downvoted and banned! I hope you learned your lesson criminal scum.
---
All these poor lads afking in cities could basically be afking with a fishing pole and making money
---
Classic advice is make sure your using a slow enough weapon so your not clipping your autoattacks with aimed shot. Played Hunter in TBC and that was the best advice I ever got.
---
Blizzard should allow you to go to a demon trainer and pay 1g to get a new random name assigned.
---
Do whatever makes you feel happy tbh!
---
If you don’t like an orc using daggers use swords, they’re best for levelling and could look better! Although pvp wise you’d want daggers but that wouldn’t matter until 60 really
---
Orcs are super good pvp for their stun resist (25% base and I believe against other players they get another 5% for 30% I could be mistaken though) blood fury is super good for the damage boost too just keep in mind the 50% healing reduce debuff though
---
17 isn’t high tbh so a reroll wouldn’t matter just transfer all good and bags to your new character once made, good luck with whatever choice you make!
---
This is behavior inspired by Retail and LFG lmao... This is why I've been telling everyone since LFG was RELEASED that it was a stupid feature and ruined the game.
---
Bank alts HATE HIM!
---
I don't think it's "the more experienced wow players", but rather the wow players that have a specific goal in mind, namely to get to 60 ASAP and enter a raiding guild. 
---
I know plenty of people that would easily classify as "the more experienced wow players" that don't have that as a goal, for various reasons (like having done all the content previously). Not everyone has the patience/time for multiple-hour queues on weekdays, nor do they have the possibility of logging in while at work. Oh yeah, I'm one of the latter mentioned myself, having done it all I have no rush to get to 60 and farm MC for months
---
Good news I mained druid tank during bc and wrath. I have a little lvl 16 druid and a 56 rogue. Druids have a more versatile kit obviously but honestly I have never found a class that is as fun as rogues or hunters. I like tanking in endgame which is why I suffer through leveling druids but rogue is hands down the most fun you can have and your kit will let you survive most pvp encounters if you prepare properly. (make sure you farm the kurzen medicine men, have free action potions, thistle tea, blinding powder, vanishing powder, crippling poison on at all times and probably mind numbing poison for offhand. A properly prepared rogue is unbeatable...however being properly prepared is a huge time investment. I spend time every week farming up wipper root tubers, and jungle remedies. My bags are always full of stuff to handle pvp (I'm also an engineer which as a rogue I highly recommend if for no other reason than you can survive fights that wipe the rest of the group and jumper cables can save a run from disbanding). The best news though is you don't have to settle on a main. If you like leveling dont worry about your main just play whatever feels fun today.
---
I'm guessing this has to do with layering....
---
You can heal on a pally without any points in holy, that's one of the benefits. Now the issue with your proposal is that you need a deep investment in ret to get Vengeance, it's the big talent you need to begin to deal decent dmg (for ret that is), and you need the dps gear to maintain Vengeance since it's triggered on crit.
---
If you're more focused with being a support than a dps, I recommend spell damage and healing gear (t2 from ony, rag and eventually bwl is especially good for this role) and enough Int to have a good mana pool. With this you'd be able to to contribute to dps when not needed for dispells or healing while still being able to cover when called upon.
---
Your damage won't be as good as a ret with crit and melee stats (spell ret doesn't work at least at the moment) but you contribute to damage and healing as a whole as well as extra blessings and pally cooldowns. Having 5-6+ paladins in raid is good, but honestly not all of them need to be holy, especially with disc/holy priests and resto druids being in raid.
---
The only time this might become an issue is by naxx unless you meet the minimum dps necessary, or are just assigned to heal by that point (possibly until you CAN meet minimum dps).
---
Hope this helps and good luck out there :)
---
I play on Netherwind hordeside, I never see my server mentioned in this discussions.
---
I believe we're currently medium population and almost 50/50 horde vs alliance.
---
I've yet to have a bad run in with another player. The whole community is great and everyone is helpful.
---
Idk why I never see the sever mentioned, I love it and honestly don't have a bad thing to say.
---
Look up the honor system and do some reading. There are several different mechanics that factor into ranking up and you’re unlikely to get a comprehensive answer here.
---
I have tried shaman, got one to 28\~or around there, the mana management was my turn off with it
---
That's how it was in vanilla though.
---
Crossroads inn?  Looks more like Goldshire
---
If I remember you can only go up so many ranks per week.
---
This or essences in silithus. I you go frostbite spec you can also do eye of shadow off elites in dark whisper gorge
---
You can get a flimsy mask cosmetic for the opposing faction during Halloween.
---
Oh hey I see myself right when you zone in LOL! We thought you just logged in and ate it but this is hilarious.
---
Good to see you on wow, but I miss them dota digests :(
---
&gt;Then again, Alliance here can't pvp for shit, cause they are so used to having massive numbers advantage that when they find themselves on equal footing they get almost always pwnd.
---
FTFY
---
Been using the mara bow for the better part of 10 levels and have not been able to replace it.
---
What the fuck does this comment have to do with anything? Go cry somewhere else.
---
Fishing for me was real good yesterday. I only fish when the opportunity arises and I just ran into one pool after another it seemed.
---
&gt; It only gets worse once the PvP phase without BGs come out.
---
Yeah, introducing the PvP System without at least one Battleground was doable when WoW fist hit. But doing it now will definitely have negative consequences on server populations.
---
There was something going on with the saronite in northrend though and blizzard have recently said that they cut some of that content or at least didn’t fully explore some of the things they hinted at. They have also said that the frozen throne is a link between our world and the shadowlands. The next expansion will hopefully explore of of this.
---
Asking the important questions.
---
I striked that part out and put an asterisk edit in. So the correction is in there.
---
That afk druid in the background is a man of culture...anyone seen Stalker by Tarkovsky? Great film
---
I feel like the only option Blizzard has at this point to try to mend the situation would be to give the majority sided faction (horde on almost all PvP servers) free faction transfers, sadly I don’t see Blizzard ever offering that option though. I believe it’s too late for any other options that I’ve seen suggested. You’re not able to just give horde the choice to transfer off server because there are no alliance sided PvP servers for them to move to, the imbalance would stay.
---
Tank you say?
---
Litteraly my character:

Unlike what some others said, hunters are great world pvpers! It’s one of the few classes that can pull off 2v1’s or fights against higher levels. If you wanna pick up some tips search up the hunter captain on youtube, he has a short guide that goes over some matchups and builds.
---
Now im no pro, but there are some things you need to do as a hunter to be successful. You need to have some points in marksman for the additional attack range for starters, as you abuse this against pretty much all classes. You wanna use aspect of the cheetah to stay at max range, there is a sweet spot there where you outrange casters/melee and can dps freely. Use your feign/trap when people close distance and take your time to get back to range, you can aimed/multi out of the trap for big dmg. Also use your viper sting regularly against mana users, you can sometimes oom a caster at a range with this before committing to the kill. Lastly, pick up engi. Engi will give you tools like nades, nets, and other utilities that can fill the holes in your kit.
---
Troll is the best race for horde tanks.
---
Played a hunter extensively and now I’m trying a rogue. I have a good understanding of how and why to use a weapon swing timer in order to minimize the clipping of auto shot, but I can’t make sense of how it works for rogues with two separate swing timers. Someone please give me a well-rounded explanation and how-to for having the most efficient leveling rotation. Thanks!
---
Always wished I could summon without the need of others.  Id happily help players out if I could quickly toss a summon, but unless you have a group ready with clickers or I'm in a busy hub, chances are I'm not spending 10 minutes to save you 10 minutes as a regular occurrence.
---
&gt; pummel
---
Lord have sweet mercy on my soul.... I totally forgot about this...
---
Sorry I'm level 37.5 and I think I can get it at 38?
---
Thanks for giving me hope!
---
Dope, is it a limited use item or a permanent one?
---
Because your fellow Competitors for r14 are grinding as hell aswell :)
---
This was me as a tank in BC.  I'd pull everything down to the last brothel lady in Black Temple.
---
Your own fault in the end. First off, it was no secret the Horde was going to be overpopulated on PvP servers. Serious PvPers would have gone Alliance, but the truth is, you guys like to LARP as PvPers, but you just want to steamroll and dominate. All your bullshit about "I chose a PvP server for the social aspects" kind of falls flat. You weren't ever looking for a fair fight.
---
Not to mention, even after knowingly choosing the zerg faction, you guys chose to make life a living hell for any Alliance player on that server.  They would try to do a quest and 5 of you would descend upon them. And not just once. You'd camp them, spit on them, laugh, take screenshots, brag about how great you were at PvP in discord. 
---
Time to pay the piper. Your server doesn't get a phase 2. It's the toll for leveling on EZmode for the past 2 months. 
---
This is not Blizzard's fault. It's Horde players fault.
---
Healer here. I think paladins are the easiest to heal and they hold threat like no ones business.
---
Just find anyone fighting anything and shoot it. My buddy went from 0 to 200 bow skill last night just autoing shit while I did aoe pulls
---
Not OP, but pummel isn't available until 38, also, shield bash has a slightly longer lockout, but that rarely matters.
---
Why is someone uploading this instead of keeping it secret? :D
---
My VERY first character was an alliance mage. Eventually learned the way and went horde, never looked back.
---
HES BACK
---
thats fucking rude bro - more rude than what OP did
---
Are you talking duels or world pvp?  
---
In a duel it's still going to be incredibly hard.  In world pvp, sure, it's helpful, but it's not the key to winning.  The key is use the terrain and the mobs to limit the mage's mobility.  They want to kite you.  If you can fight in an area that restricts their movement, you can stay closer and have more opportunities to get em.  
---
I've lost twice to a warrior.  Once was in the yeti cave in Ferelas, and once was by the chain to BRD/UBRS.  The first I couldn't get away without running into a wall or a mob, the second the warrior used the rocks to LOS.
---
YOU BASTARRRRRD!!!
---
Can't argue with that. Though it can hardly be relied upon.
---
Yeah, Mana management is a thing for every class and is a huge aspect of Classic, unless your Mage.  
---
That's why Boomkins aren't really a thing for endgame raiding. Super strong aspect, but you'll go oom in seconds.  
---
You might be better of playing Rogue as it's just something you don't have to worry about, and the class is far simpler so you might get more enjoyment out of it, it just lacks different playstyles.
---
Horde on Kromcrush, and it feels pretty balanced to me.  I always feel like there are alliance everywhere, it is anecdotal for sure, but I feel like if anything it is 35/65 H/A.  Krom feels pretty balanced to me.
---
I really hope they let census+ run again, then we can know for sure.
---
No worries you too!
---
Some stuff like the spawn time and recipes are also really difficult to judge. The only input I have from experience is that the spawn time for NW seems to be also incorrect in the other reddit post.
---
This morning it appeared to be 10-15min, indicating the spawn window might be 4min as for the other locations.

He can’t die. He is too fel corrupted because he consumed the skull of guldan.
---
It is possible for a disc priest to do it, but even one fear from princess ruins the fight &amp; makes it heavily unlikely you’ll down her! I find it to optimized for Dwarf priest due to fear ward.
---
Priest should find a tank, and run Start live. Assuming the Tank and yourself don’t need any loot, just make a group and run them through asking for the orbs. 
---
People can hate all they want for reserving orbs, but the reality is as a priest or a warrior you can’t AoE grind mobs, and make good money. Also mages want the neck piece from the last boss, rogues want the tier shoulders, and shamans want boots or bracers from Timmy.
---
My tank and I usually get a group in 5-10mins, and finish a run in 30mins, netting us around 40-60g a run purely off orbs. Factor in greens, vendor trash and DE’ing greed rolls.
---
This particular question doesn't actually have a current answer from Google. There's enough to show that it should be possible but the only relevant thing is from 2012 and it's an addon that no longer works. Most questions *are* googleable, but that's only because they've been asked and answered somewhere like this.
---
His entire shtick was sacrifice though, he sacrificed everything he had to get the power he needed to bring an end to the burning legion, he might be the best example of chaotic good in WoW.
---
If I remember correctly, Tauren Rogue was the rarest race/class combo according to the latest census sites. But really anything that's Tauren, Dwarf, or Gnome has a high chance of being rare except for Gnome mages.
---
If you want to be a thing to kill you go alliance
---
If a druid doesn't have a set of tank or healing gear ready to go they have made that decision.  Besides, the threat talent is the same talent that improves stealth, having no stamina as a melee (since you're arguing cat) is stupid in general.  A cat druid can tank 5mans with no serious issues.  They're only missing thick hide, feral charge, and primal fury.  That's no worse than an arms or fury warrior tanking with a shield that's ten levels old.
---
This helps me a lot, i think i like the convenience of the druid, but the possibilities of a rogue legitimately seem "fun." And yeah i would just like to settle on a main for time purposes and my sanity LOL. 
---
Thanks so much!!
---
Its not so much that its bad but to an elitist anything that is not best in slot or bis adjacent is garbage and you are a terrible player for using it.  Never mind that you can do all current content in green gear.  If you don’t play “optimally” you should uninstall the game, sell your house, go off grid somewhere in Montana, and suboptimally hunt squirrels from your cave (a REAL off gridder would have a treehouse, you absolute piece of trash).
---
I'm very grateful than Ashbringer seems balanced.
---
correct.
---
And most Horde I come by we just jump and be on our way.
---
I'm pretty sure Troll is considered the best Warrior class for PvE, so definitely don't think that's the rarest.
---
If you all have different schedules you aren’t raiding together anyway so just reroll.
---
better than standing there doing nothing for an hour
---
A lot of Alliance got killed in STV once and decided it was a Horde-dominated server. Never mind that Horde have an extra flight path and base in STV, and that layering can make things seem off. These kids ran away with their tail between their legs at the first site of conflict.
---
Or get falsely banned for suspicious activity related to RMT.
---
Changing your weapon triggers the GCD (a 1.5s period where you can't use abilities). Same for changing stances. Nothing you can do to get around that.
---
&gt;so walling off the city would of done nothing.
---
Forsaken are people too - we could have freed them from Lick Kings grasp and let them decide what they want

Even then, lasher loot table isn’t the same as Pservers. So it isn’t worth doing! Orbs are the move for healers.
---
Check out https://sixtyupgrades.com/.

You can choose your character race/class/level and then pick which stats matter to you (I'm positive there's a preset for Fury warriors). Then you can see a ranked list of what the best items are for each slot and where they come from.
---
That should give you a good idea on what kind of upgrades are available.
---
Idk man warrior leveling is tough.
---
Maybe if he had some mage food.
---
Plus, we all know the real hero is Donovan.
---
&gt;It also doesn't help that the instant I set foot inside of Redridge for the first time, I was greeted by four level 40+ (all mounted) Horde guys who felt no compunction about stomping my level 18 ass into the dirt on their way to STV (presumably). 
---
This is why you can't find a low level group, everyone rushed to 60 to avoid this.
---
At 56 you can probably BRD up to Seven and Dire Maul East. Once you hit 57 you should be able to do the entirety of BRD. At 58 pretty much any dungeon is doable.
---
If it took them six weeks to get 60 and their tier sets, they can probably do it again pretty quickly. Clearly real life isn't getting in the way.
---
and warlocks. I'm a Gnome warlock and have seen loads on my server
---
Rogue. Stab stuff, pick some locks.
---
Nah, most people just want to talk a big game about how great they are at pvp, then roll horde so they're never actually challenged
---
I know this is a couple days old, but if you look at DPS charts, they do marginally less than a warlock. Definitely not warrior or rogue dps though. They are significantly cheaper to gear and much more flexible though which is nice.
---
We needed everything except Druid for healers. We also had some pretty bad healing problems the first week, both with bad healers and not very many of them. I don't remember off the top of my head our split between Priests/Paladins for healers, but we definitely needed both even as recently as a week ago. 
---
Kinda depends on the day/dungeon. Lately I've been running either DM, Strath UD, or Scholo. For something like UBRS they'd only be there for Jed, but ironically I always find healers for UBRS even if it's not a Jed run.
---
If it was it would have been 1000 hours of Strat haha
---
Did you not read what I said or something?  That whole self sacrificing aspect was thrown in our faces in Legion, it basically felt like a retcon because it was so blatant.
---
It didn't feel at all consistent with the personality he showed in W3.
---
Wowhead has a guide specifically for paladin tanks that might be worth a look for you: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/lights-bulwark-protection-paladin-tanking

Oh yeah.

Here’s the specs for it.

Not really cheap though bought it on sale over a year ago.
---
Hm, I've always emptied them before replacing them.
---
Gonna try this. Thanks! I wouldn't be surprised if people did not know this, because it's not intuitive at all (and imo, it shouldn't be)
---
Sorry for your troubles. Two days ago I got a Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape and Baron's Runeblade in one run.
---
I might make a post about it.
---
Maybe you see everything a little from an alliance perspective and left out the Horde perspective ;)
---
Finished this quest-line month ago. Did they broke something?
---
Its treason then.
---
When I google it, the first page of results are all old and the solutions in them don't work anymore. Did you examine the results google gave you or just assumed that they answered the question?
---
&gt; Blizzard seriously dropped the ball 
---
No need for the rest of that sentence.
---
PvP makes sense if you end fun.
---
Damage isn't high because you end up #2-3 on threat meter just blasting starfire and have to stop.
---
What makes you think gaming and games would be different without moderation? If you simply called the latter gamesdiscussion and never moderated it, the sub would likely look very similar to games. Your example is really easy to poke holes in.
---
Ah, I don't really play Horde so did not know the fine details there.
---
Typical anger/golem run: run to arena without killing anything, do arena. Run to anger, killing only two packs on the way. Kill two golems in golemlord room, kill boss, reset. That's ~4 packs in a 15 minute run, hardly worthwhile for XP grind. A 53 will at the very least mean killing the pack to the left of the entrance to machine room, and probably more especially if you rely on mindsoothe.
---
When you say country I think you mean administration or government. Also, do you believe the United States commits human rights violations as well or is it only those damn Chinese?
---
is there anything else to do except for talking to the inn keepers ?
---
Idk man, Ashkandi was released after the fact and i dont think it ever had a queue.  
---
Its very far from a hardcore server (slower pace in general), but its nowhere even remotely close to dead.
---
Slipperyjim is a Path of Exile legend who is known for EXCESSIVE 'testing' of drop rates and loot results and such.. like to a point that no normal human would ever reach. But it's awesome to see the amount of stuff he gets
---
I'd suggest a class change then sir because as far as I know there is no way to disable a single sound effect.
---
As a boo kin I’ve had very few mana issues and I’ve been competing with the rdps. Not always a show stopper but totes can. And in pvp. Don’t even.
---
I think 2018?
---
Not sure, here’s the mode though on newegg.
---
I got it over a year ago. Recently a couple of months swapped out the HDD for a SSD.
---
&gt; Tauren Rogue was the rarest race/class combo according to the latest census sites
---
Not so much rare as non-existent, I'd say.
---
Warrior: ride around EPL farming thorium and herbs while saying no to tanking requests because I have all of my dungeon gear
---
If you are a more experienced wow player, chances are you have played on a dead server in retail, or at least heard about it.
---
And if you know anything about dead servers, you know to avoid them like the plague.
---
If you tip 1g for water, aren't you better off just buying it from a vendor? That way it doesn't disappear if you log out for a while/dc
---
Surprisingly, I don't see as many Gnome warlocks as I thought I would, but that may just be anecdotal on my part.
---
It's as much the DPS as is you trying to hold aggro. You can mark skull and hope the DPS will actually kill it first. Runs go soo much better when they do. They generally dont heh.
---
Dont get discouraged, you will get groups that actually focus the skull when you mark it, those runs are just amazing!
---
Ps. Shaman healers for some reason at that level still use rockbieter and earthshock to dps... both abilities with MASSIVE threat...
---
Yeah, personally I think the daily question thread shouldn't exist. The stuff posted there is as relevant as it gets to this subreddit, and plenty of questions go unanswered because people usually only browse it when they DONT know something
---
It also has the crappy side effect of ironically making information harder to find in the long run - Google will almost never pull up the daily question thread when you search for something, so it makes it even more necessary for people to ask questions because they can't find the info from a quick Google search. 
---
It makes content that's actually relevant less visible, and let's the subreddit get crowded with memes.
---
I think it should be replaced with a daily screenshot thread and a daily meme thread. If they really really want to have a daily question thread, it should be changed to a "basic" question thread to filter out stuff like "where do I buy my mount" and still let people ask their more complex or specific questions to a broader auidence
---
The whole point was why does it matter, why don't you chill out and give OP what he asked about rather than a feels tangent.
---
What? How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way to grind rep without wasting everyone's time.
---
I can't count
---
But I love poetry
---
Thanks for providing a platform for me to express my creativity
---
Another line because haikus have 3 lines
---
In enjoyed every bits of this story. Nice !
---
Server first?
---
Are hunters the new druids?
---
In every raid I've seen, I've never seen more than 3 hunters and this isn't even in full raids or raids that are min/maxing.
---
Anyone seen similar? :)
---
For Warrior, I use a lot of maros that include a direct stance activation with a skill such as charge, calling it charge.
---
\#showtooltip charge  
---
/cast Battle Stance  
---
/cast Charge  
---
It will immediatly cast charge. One more for Shield wall that will immediatly activate shield wall, without the need to switch stance first and equip my shield:
---
\#showtooltip Shield Wall  
---
/equip Marbled Buckler  
---
/equip Torturing Poker  
---
/cast Defensive Stance  
---
/cast Shield Wall
---
This is an instant cast for shield wall, but it takes away some necessary steps to get there (defensive stance and shield equipment)
---
... Well that explains it. Thanks.
---
No, stay on Herod and don't contribute to destroying faction balance on other servers.
---
Faction change.
---
Undersell -&gt; overdeliver.
---
I have had a lot of success over the years by starting a conversation with the admission that I'm completely out of my element, and then people are pleasantly surprised when it turns out that I actually know what I'm talking about.
---
This has the added bonus that people will be careful not to talk down to you, as they aren't sure whether you are actually out of your element or just being modest.
---
bah humbug!

I have the 12mb ram version,  must be why mine is all red. Thanks.

---
Dude, if the Horde sim like 0.1% better in PvP that's more than enough for the tryhards and nolifers to latch on to that.
---
Also I think most of the big name PvP guys where Horde back in the day, so when people look up what faction to join they often see Horde is 'better' so it's a self fulfilling type thing.
---
That being said, I find my horde buddies are always ready for PvP, hell I run around with scroll buffs and spare potions when I'm in dangerous PvP zones like STV and I constantly see Ally engage PvP with literally no extra buffs applied. 
---
Like a full set of scrolls can make up a couple of levels in PvP and I rarely ever see them on alliance I fight.
---
I dunno how much of it is just an optics thing too, like the Horde look like warmongers, they alliance look like righteous Fantasy based characters. When you play horde you just want to naturally fight people more I guess.
---
It sure is! Get some good thwacks in! Hopefully some rares drop for you.
---
You are gonna hate me now but just got a second one.. lol [https://imgur.com/hzIsGlC](https://imgur.com/hzIsGlC)

In my experience nobody cares about spec for UBRS. Fury and arms went totally fine

Redbull?

The main point is that this shouldn't be spread as a common way of transportation. I don't mind helping people either, but with limited playtime I don't want to spend my evenings to be a meeting stone for summons (or be spammed) if this way of transport was about to catch up.
---
I thought the fused wiring via target dummies was bugged to a 0% drop rate?
---
So wait. How do I hide realm names in chat?
---
Only old versions but it doesn't work either, I guess it's not compatible with the modern BFA systems.  I know that there's a fan base that's tweaking Necrolysis to work in Classic WoW with a moderate degree of success though, so if it works for them it ought to work for us too.
---
*Laughs in level 60 warrior*
---
More than likely yes. Generally use max rank holy shield and consecration at the start of a pull. Then use rank 1 of both to maintain threat during the rest of the pull.
---
&gt;then farm you at graveyard for 20 kills each
---
Ah, I see you remember what vanilla was actually like.

Wow that sounds like a great design change.

That bow honestly isn't too bad. The blue crossbows from Strat UD and LBRS will be a definite upgrade but that's not gimping your dps too badly.

If possible can you colour code the ones you can obtain as a non stealth class like warrior of my if anyone can list them

Why the fuck would you reveal this?  You're stealing business from yourself!
---
Suppose Blizzard were to release the phases at an accelerated pace, what would you do once you've cleared AQ and Naxx? You wouldn't be able to just ask for more content, you'd move on to something else. I've been able to no-life this game since its release, and I'm still finding myself overwhelmed with things to do.
---
People need to slow the fuck down and enjoy Classic for what it is.
---
 its chinas fault
---
Thanks all, priest is specced holy. If I start cyclonian and fail do I have to farm mats again?
---
not the case whatsoever lol. Don't mind not being top of the charts, i just can see why druids are forced to go healing route and I'm not necessarily sure i want to heal. Appreciate the ignorance though!
---
There's a giant pumpkin in the throne room above Undercity.  It's kinda cool.
---
They could help by making cinematics where alliance are actually cool.  A single cinematic where a paladin goes full zealot and purges a bunch of undead while shouting cool shit would help.
---
Lol “I’m concerned about my health”, then stop farming the instance. Regardless if it’s a 1% or 0.1% drop chance, blizzard isn’t making you do anything.
---
I definitely get the vibe you’re resenting the drop rate and you’re so feed up you’re comparing it to loot boxes, and sever gambling. Which it clearly isn’t.
---
Lul
---
That's the crux of it. These guys are the problem, but want other people to be the solution.
---
You can tank pretty much everything but raids with 0 points in prot.
---
Ms&gt;os is an absolutely garbage standard.  If something can be used by your class, and is an upgrade for what you currently have, you should be able to roll.  Again this ms&gt;os is garabage
---
People switch specs all the time. Many classes can be some sort of hybrid spec to do whatever they need
---
Pigeon holing people into a specific spec so that they can roll on specific loot is exactly the reason you have no tanks.
---
No body wants to run as a tank if they cant roll on dps gear...and most people want dps gear it's way more useful (farming/pve  dps/pvp).  Tanking gear is good for one thing, tanking...but tanking is extremely limited and cant do much else outside of instances.
---
Outside of gearing up tanks and healers for 40 man's there's no reason for ms&gt;os.  The only justification I've seen is that were supposed to care that someone is taking the time to get their dps gear, that they're putting a lot of time and energy into getting dps shit so were supposed to give a shit and, as a tank, not roll on anything but tank gear.... habana fuck that I don't give a shit how much time and energy you've invested into getting dps shit.  Just like I'm sure you don't give a shit about me.  
---
I rolled warrior so I could dps or tank on demand, I shouldnt be limited on what gear I can roll on simply because I'm tanking this particular run and Visa versa simply to cater to you and have to give a shit about the effort you've put into getting dps gear
---
I fucking put groups together and tank them, have to deal with getting all the blame when shit is rough, dealing with the stress of having to learn instances and learn pulls inside out over the course of many runs just so you can slip in as a dps  mash a few buttons barely knowing anything about the instance and take all the shit I want?  Nah fuck that, everyone who can use it can roll in my opinion.  The way I look at it I'm allowing the dps to roll on my loot.
---
Whoops, you not wrong. Tauren Rogue would definitely be among the rarest, let me know if you see one. Meant Troll, but was thinking about Tauren and mistyped. Maybe I just want to be a Tauren Rogue?
---
A mage friend of mine needed the hat from Barthilas. It has a 17-18% drop rate, can't take that long, 4 hours later we are 11 runs in no hat. We call it a night. Next day, another 5 runs, no hat. Over the next 2 weeks 20 more runs, no hat. Then on run 37, the hat drops, it takes us 5 seconds to even realize it dropped, by now we had assumed it didn't exist. Screams erupt, but a journey was over, by now I knew every pack and patrol by heart, I knew where to LoS, which mob to charge and which to shield bash. I had looted and used 150 holy waters and used at least twice as many oils of immolation. In the end we got from main entrance to Barthilas in sub 15 minutes. Now 2 weeks have gone and no hat runs, yet I still close my eyes and see myself pulling packs in stratholme.
---
Congratulations on your legs, but stratholme will never leave you, and you will never be able to leave stratholme.

Skullflame - Ally guild
---
Nice work, I'd love to see a guide like this on dual wielding and weapon speed.
---
So that I can pull multiple mobs comfortably
---
I’m Alliance on Herod and a member of one of the most recognized guilds on the server. We planned a PvP event against a horde guild on our server the other week and contacted every other Alliance guild leader on the server in advance asking if they would join us for the fight because we’d be outnumbered. Not a single member of any guild joined us and we ended up with a single raid group vs multiple Horde raids. Alliance pride is a joke.
---
Orcs limit you to axes, I don't like that restriction. But orcs are good at pvp, and also good at dps (where they can use their attack power boost racial that reduces healing received). 
---
What I would say is that if you're at level 45, you're not doing cutting edge low-gear progression raids, so your race choice is far less important than having everybody else in the raid a) using appropriate consumables b) having farmed all the pre-raid bis gear for their char and c) being good at playing their character.
---
I wouldn't sweat your choice of tauren.
---
PVP of course.
---
I understand I can’t have it both ways, but.....
---
I’m trying to find a spec at lvl 60 where I can viably heal a 5 man dungeon (Strat/Scholo/BRD/DM, etc.) with a pug but also DPS if needed (don’t need to top the meters) for the same dungeons.  I don’t have a steady MC group so would like the flexibility to heal or DPS while I get my pre raid BIS and go full resto.   It feels like I should DPS with elemental spec because of gear synergies (int/spirit) with resto.
---
Does the 30/0/21 hybrid spec achieve that or will I not be able heal 5mans well enough?
---
It's a tough conversation to have, and for a lot of people (especially in a new guild) it's just easier to cut someone loose than to try to hold their hand and make them a better player.  I'm not defending it, just explaining it.  If you're considered a "trial" player in a guild that is looking to flesh out a raid team, you're probably not going to be getting lessons on how to play better from your guild, you're just going to get dropped.
---
He must have been talking to a warrior.
---
Am I missing out on stats by not equipping a bow/ crossbow/ or gun and using daggers instead?  Do the stat increases still exist when it isn't being used?
---
i felt this on a spiritual level
---
Bad macro you're gonna accidentally cancel your iceblock.  Bind cancel to something else like poly
---
Please don't complain if you're server becomes imbalanced.
---
I thought layering was removed?
---
Because it came out later in Vanilla as well
---
Kind of joking, just trying to keep it lighthearted in here.
---
18 strat UD runs still no crossbow, I got my Rhok'delar before that damn crossbow dropped lol.

A few guilds on Alliance side Deviate Delight have had this as well. It's just the Horde on DD that struggle.
---
TRP even lets you do atribute/trait spectrums, like generous/selfish, chaotic/lawful etc - you put in a quantity from 1-20. Great for a quick personality “sketch” for your character.
---
I'm pretty sure the difference is bigger. +5 wep skill makes glancing blows hit 85% instead of 65%. Huge
---
'changing things wont change things!'
---
They're limited my mob level. Your level has no bearing on it, aside from making them harder to kill if you're too low.
---
From my experience the only way a Paladin did good dps was to have him in the melee dps group and give them windfury totem and even then the dps warriors and enhanche shamans would beat them, simply because they never had an instant attack. Crusader strike was implemented in BC which made the class so much better.
---
I wouldnt go through the trouble even for 5-8g tbh. Unless I was in IF or SW or some other crowded place.
---
LOL. One clue might have been that CURRENT retail servers are massively imbalanced in favor of the Horde. That all private servers were dominated by Horde. That Horde has traditionally been the bigger faction for at least the past 10 years.
---
"Literally impossible". 
---
"Alliance are the problem because they didn't like dying 5-1 every time they did a quest". You are the problem, kiddo.  Enjoy phase 2.

What I like about this post is that your drop chance is more than 1% higher than atlas. This has encouraged me.

I'd like to know more. Can you make a collage with the first linen cloth bandage made and first auction won as well?
---
That’s the FUN PART!!
---
You can do that already.
---
There are multiple equivalent ways of thinking about these tables. For example, the spell one where you talk about it being done on a 2 roll system, could identically be thought of as a single roll, where the table is filled first with miss chance, and then of the remaining positions in the table put crit% of them as crits and the rest as normal hits. This works because multiplication is commutative. The only difference is conceptual.
---
Yes, you want a ranged weapon with best stats possible.
---
Lots of non elite mobs come from the hall you just cleared.
---
Someone call me out if I’m wrong, but I believe level 40+ mobs have chances of dropping epics. However, not all mobs have epics on their loot table. Your level doesn’t play into loot drops, each type of mob has their own loot table.
---
?
---
 My experience as a vanilla raid maintank:
---
get +7% hit if you are a orc with axe, otherwise 9% iirc. Helps a lot, it's like... mandatory. There is a lot of gear to take you there. ALSO the first Bands of Accuria from Ragnaros, DFT in BWL... SHOULD go for the MT.
---
But yes, get used to lose aggro, have taunt ready, and coordinate with your offtanks for the taunt rotation, you can practise it on the Lava Annihilators, that reset aggro randomly, MT should communicate when his taunt has cooldown, so the next tank, is ready to taunt, and after that, third, and mob should be dead.
---
 It's just a question of time the raid dpsers get geared up and tend to overaggro more easy. Again, have the taunt rotation ready, your offtanks NEED to be prepared to execute this at perfection. If you see two taunts on the mob... You are doing this wrong. You tanks should take taunt rotation seriously.
---
 It's important shit, assume the dps will get aggro, because they will. Be ready to react fast.
---
This newspaper is the coolest thing I've seen since Classic launched. Keep up the good work. I really wanna make an alt on that server.
---
&gt; I can only imagine the salt when BG's hit and everyone on Horde side realizes they have 3x longer queues because of the imbalance.
---
I'm responding to his comment about BGs. Doesn't matter if you are PvE or PvP, you can queue for a BG, and roughly equal spread across factions means this 3x longer queues isn't true
---
One thing I have not seen mentioned enough that further fuels the issue is that not all players on PvP servers are PvP players.
---
Players who on their own would have rolled on PvE servers but landed on PvP servers to play with their friends. Since they are not enjoying PvP to begin with they are hypersensitive to faction imbalance. On a 50/50 realm they would drop off equally on either side but once either side not only are the ones on the loosing side more likely to leave due to more "intrusions" on their PvE gameplay but the ones on the side with more numbers are more likely to stay since there will be less disruptions.
---
Would I join as Alliance on a 70H/30A server as a PvP player? No. As PvE? Hell no.
---
Would I join as Horde on the same as a PvP player? Preferably not if better options are available. As PvE? Sure, I get a massive player pool of my faction for a very low risk of being ganked and a lower risk of being camped, which is my personal main PvP server turn-off. At that point the risk is worth the gain in my mind and every other PvE:er that joins in to take advantage of the larger pool further sweetens the deal in my favor.

---
No, but if I don’t want to tank every now and then I don’t need to hear “UR A WARRIOR WHY ARENT U TANKING”.
---
I don’t have the answer for you but wowhead has great information on each class and each spec. They even list the pre raid bis for each spec!
---
I like using a Tallstrider for leveling. Really good at keeping aggro and very tanky. If you keep Bite trained to the highest level and train Dash when you can it's really hard to pull aggro from Tallstrider. When grinding I send my pet to the next target before current target is dead and it gets aggro while finish off with a fat wingclip raptor strike and loot

Plz explain how the rotation works. Everyone zones in alone and if hws there that person becomes lead?
---
actualy i can't be angry this time.
---
The devil's advocate side of this is that when you start adding timed rewards people feel like they HAVE TO participate RIGHT NOW rather than just interact with the event organically.  If your way of interacting with the event organically is to not care about it, that's cool.  The timed gates on content is one of the things people disliked about content after classic, so I'm happy they're not modifying it.
---
AP doesn't scale with Kings like agi does.
---
You type that ironically, but it is correct.
---
They can't release content fast enough if people are going to clear it in a month. It's just not going to happen.
---
Different features for different models? Madness!
---
Yep. Too bad it's 7 day limited items.
---
Are there event bosses in classic dungeons?
---
It feels liek there are sooooo many more healers this time around than in Vanilla. 
---
I started BRD runs around 54 on my shammy, did the first few as dps and had 2 runs as a healer. Ended up respecing resto at 56 so I could consistently roll on healer gear.... Couldn't find a single damn group for like 2 days and gave up and am now leveling my lock.
---
Unless macros are functioning differently than I'm ever aware of them doing the cancelaura shouldn't be impacted by your gcd at all and spamming this macro should instabreak iceblock.  Further if it functions how you say that's also bad because that means you're locking yourself into iceblock for a gcd minimum which can be bad in certain situations.
---
How do you encourage against this? This has been the case for so long the only way to change this would be to change the game and give ally op racials
---
There is already punishment system in game for the horde which is bg ques.

---
That ignores any nuance at all, and completely misses the point of boe items.
---
Tradables are worth exactly the same to everyone. That's why it makes sense for all to roll: there's zero need to equip it on the spot and you can buy the item yourself at any time.
---
BoPs are not worth the same to everyone. And the "but since BoEs are just used for some gold that means I can need bops for gold" doesn't work because of everyone rolled need on everything nobody would get BoPs they can use. BoPs are not worth the same to everyone.
---
BoEs are tradeable and you don't run dungeons for them - they are simply a gold bonus worth equal to everyone.
---
Your willingness to open yourself up to ninja-looting isn't going to be appreciated when you hit 60 lemme tell you

Taurens make the best rogues. The fact that you've never seen one only supports this claim.
---
I had broadband by the time WoW came out but not for Everquest or most of Dark Ages of Camelot.
---
&gt;If your logic is that it's well known that horde would be overpopulated on PVP servers and that would make people roll Alliance instead, then wouldn't that cause Alliance to be the overpopulated faction?
---
Probably the dumbest statement in this thread. No, genius, that would (and did) have the exact opposite effect. People  who are scared of losing in PvP but want to dominate aren't looking for a fair fight, they're choosing the side they know will be an easy win.  Just like you did.
---
Nah, it’s econ, though behavioral economics is often thought of as more art than science. All of the social sciences struggle with this since there are limits on what experiments we can do with human subjects.
---
So people who want to be competitive in PVP will naturally pick the horde faction.
---
Damnit Blizzard, balance the racials - or give an incentive for pvp-frothing-at-the-mouth players a reason to pick alliance. Give Gnomes Yoda agility, Dwarves additional stamina, Elves +2% resistance to magic, or something else more thought out than what I just pulled out of my ass.
---
Maybe with the PVP phase 2 patch they do something like that.

Theres nothing wrong with trying though. If they arent interested in helping they can just say no or not respond at all. I've never been spammed asking for summons and if I was I would just ignore that person. I think it's a perfectly viable way of getting around as long as you're respectful and you should definitely tip fairly for someone going out of there way. That way it's a win win for everyone involved

I was told the archmages dropped the enchant too but I can't personally confirm. It would be a long shot in that case. I farmed there for a bit while a group of us were camping lotus spawns and got a boe epic, rare, other drops and about 20g in coin after about 2 hours. But results may vary.

Chrome has a picture in picture extension as well made by google. You can overlay a video easily over the chat window for example, adjust it's size, pause, etc. while playing.

You'll find that the faster your bow, the more you clip your aimshots. You want slow bows to clip as few autoshots are you possibly can. Also we have an Epic bow in MC so its a dickmove to take a bow so inferior from other classes.

You are right, it isn’t affected by the gcd but there is a small delay for some reason that has meant I’ve never had an issue. The delay is not the normal GCD. I don’t know, maybe I’m just really good (doubt it) but I’ve never had an issue with it.

Alliance should absolutely leave if given the opportunity. Leave these Horde kids holding their dicks in phase 2, crying on the forums about the problem they created.

You’re not a jackass no. The best bow in the game is Rhok and it’s not slow enough, but it’s damage is crazy good. 
---
Striker’s does good damage as well and even if carapace allows you to AS with no clippage, striker’s is still a good weapon. 
---
I’d hazard to guess your damage is going to be very similar but maybe slightly higher with carapace because when you look at your damage you’re going to see aimed shot as your second highest DPS spell. With strikers it’s going to be multi shot and auto shot all day.
---
Unfortunately threat dumps are hard to work around with prot paladin. If you have dps who understand and respect this mechanic, it's a little easier to manage. The best we have is judging improved seal of righteousness, but even if you have the CD reduction on judgement it won't be enough to get your threat high enough to pull off a dps who doesn't slow down after a threat dump.

To be fair, if they didn't really know of Kalimdor, they'd be unfamiliar with druidic magic, so shapeshifting should be suspicious of itself right? I find the lack of an action worse writing than the way Medivh warned Terenas.

You only need to worry about main-hand swing. You optimize a little bit extra by using things like SS right after a main-hand swing so you're not slowing down your swing timer much if at all.

Your glancing blow chance never changes. Weapon skill can reduce the damage reduction component of it but that is all. Glancing blow chance is simply based on level difference, not weapon skill, or anything else.

---
Just saying...
---
And you can be CS'd while casting it.
---
Many of the people at 60 also have real life priorities, but know time management. Many of us have families, children, careers, a social life, etc. which we have not neglected and have still been able to reach level cap.
---
Get off your little high horse, trying to sound better than others. It only makes you look like a salty asshole.
---
You wanted balance yet you play a horde in a skrewed server ? And then complain hours imbalance that is? What kind of fked up logic is that?
---
Enjoy your bg queue times, hordies 😂
---
Absolutely questing. I'd try to get some quest runs done in BRD if you haven't, you can grab the MC attunement at 55.
---
Hit up the Tirion Fordring / Cauldron Quests in the Plaguelands as soon as possible. Once you ding 58, you're essentially ready for any dungeon and can start working on preBIS
---
Horde: Oh...no, not like this...
---
Shadow priest
---
LOL, god I completely forgot about this. As far as I know there is no way to know. We used to have at least 1 message every 5 minutes to Loot the hounds when playing vanilla. It's weird that until I saw this post I completely forgot how many arguments happen because of that.
---
Shaman, for that sweet windfury lol

And why does DM being out hurt any of this?

Epic mount&gt;devilsaur&gt;weapons&gt;crusader&gt;lionheart

They're just stealthed on the character select.

eh in BC he is evil. they just retconned to give him good motives later.
---
What did you grind for rep?
---
If you reset it while ppl are in the dungeon, you get the error message. Once those people come out and you reset it again, it doesn't say "X has been reset", it just says nothing.
---
OP could well be right.
---
Not everyone’s days off are Saturday and Sunday. I thought my Monday and Tuesday days off would prove beneficial for open world farming, but Pagle is so crowded that it really makes no difference.
---
Warlock because they're rare so you get all the epix
---
Do you remember the guy's name?
---
Racial don't mean that much. Did lots of pvp through vanilla and onwards as Undead Rogue and will of the forsaken is very helpful. Once we get BGs and the pvp trinket, you become very hard to deal with.
---
Also Undead Rogues look metal as fuck. Slouching, sneaky, bastards, that would kill you and sell your organs in the Apothecarium.
---
Healer here: Not necessarily. When a DPS pulls aggro, I have two options.
---
Option A: Let them die.
---
Option B: Pump heals into the DPS and have the aggro switch to me.
---
There is simply no way a tank can keep aggro against the sheer amount of threat per second a healer generates when they burst heal someone who's suddenly eating a shit ton of damage. 
---
Bad healers also make the mistake of slapping a heal or even a fricking HoT on the tank as soon as he takes damage. Which means that the tank has to race against the AoE healing threat right from the start when their rage is low and a single miss throws everything out of whack.
---
Your right, I'm wrong.
---
Did some digging.  It would appear that nerf went live in Patch 2.0.1.  (TBC)
---
I've heard rumors of people seeing Tauren Rogues but none have ever lived to tell the tale. some say they don't even exist... but I believe
---
Best in what way? Each class has their own pros and cons and each plays different from one another.
---
Bite on autocast, Growl on manual.
---
The owl is amazing for solo dungeon runs or big packs where you want your pet to hold aoe. For ST cat&gt;owl all the time. Owl is also really good at annoying any melee who plays with in game sound.
---
Exactly! For the record, not talking about those whom race to cap with purpose.
---
I concur enjoy my upvote
---
Have any Warlocks been able to do the old Guard Mol'dar solo run in DM North. My understanding is they have messed with a few things in DM and interested to know if this is still doable.
---
I want them to fix it, I don’t want to fix it duh.
---
I understand that each family of pet gives different bonuses to stats like raptors and cats have +10% damage. From what I’ve read though it sounds like different mobs within the families have different baseline stats though, is there any good resource or database to better explore this besides randomly taking them? Like how would I find out which 3 raptors in the game have the highest DPS?
---
Thank you! The animations... TELL me about it! The night elf doesn't sit very comfortably on the horse (as you can see, I'm holding the mane rather than the reins).
---
Funny title
---
Why roll on Striker's mark when MC literally drops a Hunter exclusive bow for you?
---
Look up your best in slots. Target them. Don't be a jerk to other players just because it's an upgrade.
---
The idea is to maximize the mileage of the items looted. If a hunter gets strikers mark then gets Ancient Petrified Leaf, then that strikers mark is basically a DE shard. Where's a tank or rogue won't replace it for a long time.
---
Roll for best in slot, but most importantly roll for mileage.
---
I'm gonna hit 60 this weekend probably  on my warlock(sitting at 56.5). What comes next? What are good ways to farm gold? 
---
What builds are people running for dungeons? The sac/ruin raid build?
---
Is that the rare parrot?
---
Best damage per second?
---
Best to have in a group for utility?
---
Best for crowd control?
---
Gotta define what you're looking for.
---
Good bot
---
&gt;I'm not at all interested in RPing myself but I imagine the RPers would provide a nice foil to the usual slaughterfest on standard PvP servers.
---
Same as me basically, I always found it cringeworthy but most people that want RP simply want to keep the talk to in game topics.
---
What guild? :D
---
This was an addition in patch 2.0.1, not 1.12, so it is not a Classic WoW issue. 
---
From [here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Downranking)
---
&gt; Downranking has been nerfed several times and ultimately removed in [Wrath of the Lich King](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Wrath_of_the_Lich_King). The first time, it was nerfed so that any spell learned below level 20 suffered a penalty. **Then, with** [**patch 2.0.1**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1)**, it was nerfed again so that any spell of a certain number of levels too low was nerfed.** 
---
The 2.0.1 nerf is the one using your formula. 
---
And directly from the [2.0.1 Patch Notes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1)
---
&gt; Low-level spells cast by high-level players will receive smaller bonuses from +healing and +spell damage. 
---
The only 'nerf' to low-level spells in classic is for ranks learnt below lvl 20.
---
I mean if you're BM, a pet does 40% of your damage. You can't be playing without a pet, you need to learn how to control it.
---
&gt; the server is completely dead from a world PvP perspective 
---
Nothing at all wrong with that.
---
&gt; Herod is a Horde PvE server now. 
---
Good. PvE servers are the best anyway.
---
It has been proven by retail, private servers, and now Classic that most PvP players want to play on realms where their faction is dominant, and they have a chance to quest and easily kill any of the other faction they see, therefore making it impossible for them to quest.
---
PvP players don't want "fair fights" and "balanced servers". They will look for every advantage they can get to gank, camp, and otherwise harass and make miserable the players of the opposite faction, whom the players actually look down upon IRL (especially Horde looking down at Alliance.)
---
This happened in Retail.
---
This happened on private servers.
---
This has now happened on Classic.
---
Your choices are now to play where you are, transfer, re-roll, or quit.
---
The players caused this problem (especially the bullies), the players have always caused this problem, and it's not something Blizzard even needs to attempt to fix because they can't change human (or bully) nature.
---
Because they enjoy how it looks and want to play the game for fun instead of min/maxing every little aspect of it.
---
Nah. Atiesh has a ton of people with 2+ 60s.
---
add server cap and transfer options to the dominant faction, problem is solved instantly.
---
For raiding there is not pet requirements, I mostly play without it in raid and still can get to top5 dps on half the pulls. If you do want to min max raiding the ideal pet are the wolves from lbrs/ubrs as the howl boosts your next shot. 
---
BT is nice in pvp and general open world stuff but has no real point in raid for 2 reasons : first you will almost always be max range (41m) as most boss abilities won't be able to hit you this way, and therefore you will out of range to heal the pet. Second point joins the first, your pet will die a lot to aoes and shit on most pulls so you should not bother!
---
Ah dang, thanks for letting me know! Also no; we're a PS4 clan primarily :(
---
Don't forget if you play a female night elf bad things might happen. I got snared by a lvl 60 hunter, who spammed /NO and kept freezing me in ice traps if I tried to leave, then started to strip off naked.
---
Rogues throwing knives
---
Reddit does it automatically. They can't unhide it.
---
Follow up to my other question, am I understanding correctly then that all pets within a pet family have the exact same DPS and therefore different mobs within the family should only be tamed for appearance?
---
it's easier to rank if you are the less dominant side on a 40/60 server
---
&gt;Understand there are are hybrid classes and if it weren't for these classes filling in and completing groups, you would be sitting in town forever waiting for the perfect warrior, mage, rogue, hunter, and priest group. 
---
I understand that. In fact, so far, I only play hybrid classes in classic.
---
That doesn't change the fact that I don't think you should *ever* roll on offspec gear over someone's mainspec without asking first. As far as I'm concerned, that outright says "I think my time is more important than yours."
---
Nothing against reserve runs or asking to roll of offspec at all. Communication is how adults handle things. But just assuming you have the right to roll for offspec gear that someone else in your group needs right now is pretty shitty.
---
alliance scum!
---
Tank said he needed tank gear from the dungeon, not healing gear.  I assumed he wouldn't be rolling on the healing gear, guess I was wrong.
---
I don't really want to go into each group spamming loot rules. I really just want to chill and have fun with the game.
---
I played almost all of them back in Vanilla and am currently doing a Warlock in Classic.
---
I'd have to say that Mage is probably the best all around if you are looking to min/max and be a class that is hard to deal with in PVP and also can top meters in PVE.  They have good utility with Food/Water, Portals and of course the AOE farming everyone hates (that isn't a Mage).
---
If you are looking for something a little more unique I would be torn between Warlock and Hunter.  Warlock has a lot of utility, different pets for different situations, healthstones, summoning and can be a bitch to deal with in PVP.  Warlocks do have a ton of spells though so to get the most out of it you have to do your homework and be good at using tons of spells (mapping buttons, etc...).  Hunter on the other hand is just super unique.  You get to literally pick your own pet(s) and can change them up when you want.  There are certain pets that are good for different situations but than you can also just get vanity pets that might not be as useful for min/maxing but look good to run around with - or get a couple rares that are hard to find like the elite Ape off STV or Broken Tooth.  Hunter is also easy mode while leveling so you can do it pretty easily and solo elite mobs above your level, etc...
---
I like Classic a lot, but most of my friends rushed to 60 and then quickly abandoned it.  If I had more friends sticking around I might be more invested, but I don't really want to do nothing but run PUGs with randoms now that I'm 60 myself.
---
I'm considering giving FFXIV a shot just because it's something new, probably a bit more polished and I like the FF universe.  Maybe this isn't the best sub to ask but I thought I'd get more honest opinions here.  
---
Is the game relatively soloable during the leveling process... and if I wanted to start, do I have to buy the base game in addition to an expansion in addition to the monthly fee?
---
Summon them into the bottom of a silithid hive
---
Nice
---
Release in Phase 5, so no
---
If you play a rogue and play a kitty you'll realize just how bad the hybrid tax is. Personally I find rogue more fun, but druid is still my main and has been since vanilla way back in the day. Druid is just so much more flexible, if I get tired of kitty I can play as tank or play as healer.  Rogue feels more involved, I always feel like I'm missing cool stuff playing the druid (vanish, slowing poisons, kick, decent CC, pick pocket, etc).
---
Nothing wrong with wanting to be at the top of the meters. Now that being said, renew being used in a raid is a crapshoot and a waste of mana if the healers aren't on the same page.
---
Big true. I was HC in vanilla but even the casual pleb is running around in BiS gear.
---
Make sure to let us know when you don't take 6 hours to get to Rag too !
---
35/5/0 is what I'd go. At 49 you won't have enough points to get MS and Piercing Howl so no need to go further that 5 into Fury.
---
It's all blizzards fault. Vanilla wow did not have battlegroups for battlegrounds(At least not when they were released). You were only playing against characters on your server. 
---
Now that people know battlegroups are a thing they know they can get PVP when they want it no problem, while having an easy experience in the world.
---
#NoChanges right?
---
It’s almost like that’s why I run with warrior tanks like I said?...
---
What's terrible is youused to be able to feign on the run or in mid air in vanilla.  You could feign while still having W mashed.  In classic, it's become as sensitive as the zoomers and sjws.
---
What server are you on?
---
Just want to make sure I never group with you.
---
I have twinks I’m working on on Herod horde side
---
As a tank i sort of hate all this mages bashing. There is a reasonable 50/50 split between good and bad mages... Now hunters on the other hand, they are truly the worst
---
So now?
---
&gt; people are just now getting into the 30-50 range
---
lmao, no.
---
Sword and board.
---
&gt; i dont know what more you could want
---
A pet. Not that a Mage really needs one, but that's the only thing Hunters/Warlocks have over the Mage, imho.
---
Classic isn't for everyone and doesn't need to change for you.
---
I should say, I saw a druid do something similar in the duel tournament. It didnt speed up his heal cast, it just made it hard to see because it looked like he was melee'ing but he was actually halfway through his cast because the animations didnt line up and it also messed with the cast bar addon which could be a useful tip for sneaking in casts in melee range.
---
The dps is normalized similar to weapons. Like how a 2h axe hits hard and slow can have the same dps as 2 1h axes hitting soft and fast. However, each attack has the same chance to proc frenzy no matter the swing speed. This means you want as many attacks as possible to maximize your procs.
---
As a tank this is my biggest frustration. People going balls to the wall before I can so much as get a sunder off. Let your tank get some threat built up, people. Especially on aoe groups. Or casters shooting shit before I even finish pulling with my bow. 3-5 seconds of patience goes a long way.
---
My heal macro. I can heal mouseover, my target, or my targets target (just target a hordey and heal/dispel anyone they target), or myself. It also dismounts me, cancels any animal form, and stands up from drinking.

Is it possible to use a macro conditional to differentiate between an enemy player and an enemy NPC? I am a fire mage so i never use max rank frostbolt in pvp, while i never use rank 1 in PvE ... so I was hoping to reduce keybinds with a conditional of enemy type.
---
you do know theres a lot of people working shifts? have you ever had a job?
---
I feel the same way. Only went alliance to play with a friend and he plays way more than me and out leveled me so here I am playing a faction I don’t like alone 😡

Why would I do that when I am already on r/classicwow? You are getting the classic experience, why are you upset by it?
---
Grats only took 3 hours this time?
---
"Why power through the game so fast? Enjoy the leveling experience? Maybe dont play 8 hours a day do something productive lol. You cant be mad because you raced through everything. Go back to retail dude classic community doesnt need you speed levelers coming in talking shit about more content."
---
Op never said anything of this sort, projecting much? Also can't op just be much more intelligent with his time than you?
---
60/40 should be the limit for faction imbalance. They outright shouldn't let any more of the faction that makes up more than 60% into the world until more players of the opposing faction login or more people from the majority faction logout.
---
Wayback Machine is vastly underrated in my opinion.
---
Title could have been clearer.  Rolling off spec is fine if the people filling the role the gear is for don’t need.  That clearly wasn’t the case here and he should have passed.
---
Played with an RP gnome warrior who walked everywhere due to a bum knee but would run in raids cause the adrenaline was so high he fought thru the pain. 
---
I no longer think he is the most ridiculous person ever.
---
Does this game have more players than retail wow?
---
Goodluck replacing devilsaur this phase.

Apart from edgemasters and cloudkeeper, devilsaur is BIS for quite a while

Haha. We have our own sub and Discord and we don’t really have too much drama outside of random ninjas. XD We’re pretty chillax.

It's not a game. It's a gaming company that lets itself be influenced by the greatest human rights offender in all of history.
---
It looks like he did this twice to you on the same run?  Not sure why you stuck around - I would have left after the first occurrence and told him to go find a healer that didn't need any gear.

Correct. It doesn’t “make” anyone better, it **forces** people to *become better*.

Thank you so much for your thoughts.

Don't come to faerlina, same problem.

:o nearly there mate, keep trying. The lines are getting blurry now!!!
---
FFXIV is very similar to WoW in many regards. Firstly, its also a themepark style mmo, revolving around quests and soloing zone content. Secondly, the dungeons and how groups aproach them is also very similar, with the trinity of Tank/healer/dps.
---
we warned them repeatedly, they chose not to listen
---
and now we suffer
---
ICC is saronite so it'd make sense if Yogg interdered considering the OG Lich King was a plot of the burning legion.
---
I’d ask on the retail subs too if you want another side of the story, this sub is a massive “retail bad every other MMO ever is better than retail” circlejerk.
---
That is connected realms, not battlegroups.
---
I did the same thing leveling every time I got a new melee weapon, just slowly leveled it up from the occasional accidental time in melee until it got maxed.

Because I'm certainly not going to go to the effort to install some screen recording software to prove something that is easy for an individual to demonstrate to themselves. The "10 minute" number is utterly made up.

What counts as work? Does playing wow count as work because technically we're improving the experience of other wow players? It's certainly time consuming, so are we all e-janitors in our own way?

You should spend more time refining your talking points and less time speculating on my background in econ. 
---
There are TONS of unmoderated online communities on the internet beyond Reddit. If that strategy is so successful why not go use one of them instead? Personally, I like being able to go to subreddits and have discussion points above the lowest common denominator, so I'm gonna stick with the "e-janitors" even if I dislike their choices sometimes.

The Runescape hit noise around 2:35 was spot on. Along with every other edit. Well done good sir.
---
i'm guessing a typo since his priest is in shadowform lol
---
Yeah he probably should of so you could of made your decision, personally I don’t say at the beginning that I’d be rolling on tank gear (if I’m not tanking, if I tank I think it’s a given that I can roll on both gear but none the less will say before I roll on gear if I think it’s unexpected)
---
Yeah he should of been a bit more aware you wasn’t cool the first time so could of asked the second time but he probably already made up his mind on it that you wasn’t cool with it and didn’t wanna miss out on a chance to get the item, I wouldn’t necessarily say he’s scummy if he genuinely does need the gear, but he should make players more aware at the very least
---
At least you know for next time to miss him in your parties if that’s what you wanted, and could take it as a lesson learned for future to take it upon yourself to ask other players if they plan to roll on other spec items just so you don’t get anything like this again my guy
---
I did it around 15 times so far. I don‘t have siphon life which makes me having to watch my mana more. I don‘t think it‘s worth it though. Very little gain.
---
Have you ever stepped into high mythic+ keys? We’ve not been playing the same game.
---
Yeah don't complain about it because they are the absolute best in terms of Frost Enchants.
---
No, best you could do is a mod conditional (ctrl/alt/shift)
---
I logged in to retail yesterday and asked a question in general chat Nazmir. Not one response. No one even having a conversation.
---
I'm not saying one's good and the other's bad but if you don't notice a difference at all then you're just not paying attention.
---
Use a druid but start in caster form, then cat, then travel. Increasing difficulty.
---
If you stick around after the final boss you can run back through the hallways and kill a few large groups of skeletons. You get some pretty good rep doing this ;)
---
You master loot reserved items
---
Now that dire maul is out, does anyone have (or know where I can find) an updated pre raid bis spreadsheet?
---
Well.
---
If people who rushed to 60 weren't constantly complaining about having nothing to do (in a smaller timeframe than ever before), people probably wouldn't feel the need to argue with them.
---
Farm some gold. Play an alt. God forbid, *do something else.* We only have a few weeks before PvP comes out and you can gank lowbies with an excuse to your hearts content.
---
10 mooncloth to make Lololol
---
I'm always disappointed we only got two factions for WoW, being able to play as the Scourge would have been awesome
---
Good luck replacing your epic mount or lionheart **ever**.
---
I agree if they don't mention it beforehand. If they announce it prior to grouping, it's your choice to group with someone else.
---
/r/ffxiv has a great daily thread that you should ask the subscription questions in.  
---
You should definitely try the game, IMO. It's a fantastic game.  The best feature is that you can everything on one toon.  No need for alts.  
---
I personally would recommend, that if you like the game after trying it, that you buy the story skip for ARR because it is a serious slog.  The game gets better after the first part.  Shadowbringers is fantastic and definitely worth the money.
---
I always include Runescape stuff in these videos now, feel it's a staple at this point haha. Thank you mate!

I got Flurry Axe to drop last night. I would have posted a photo of it taken with my iPhone SE but this guy just *had* to go around asking gameplay-related questions, taking up prime real estate from my vanity project.

---
Off spec tank here, does it *matter* if they take aggro if they've got Imp Blizzard?  I certainly don't give a crap as long as the mobs stay grouped up
---
Fuck you zelus!
---
If you don’t see how it would harm the game, you don’t belong here discussing the game.  One change sets a precedence for more changes.  That’s not what is wanted.  Feel free to discuss it over on the classic+ Reddit, but here, your opinion on making changes is falling on deaf ears.
---
This is what you call a “slippery slope” - one change leads to another and another and you look up in 18 months we’re back to BFA. 
---
He said it perfectly; ‘this is intended to be a recreation of the original game’ and it absolutely is not going to make changes to make life more convenient. This kind of mentality is what ruined the game to be frank.

What level are you? I'm Horde on Incendius and it feels like the population is relatively even (there's obviously always going to be a split, but 55-45 is the sweet spot). I won't really engage in PvP until honor comes out, feels like a waste and I'm almost 60 so just focused on that, but still find that PvP happens - sometimes it's Horde dominate, sometimes Alliance.
---
he doesnt want reason or logic... he just wants to bitch
---
Can somebody give a pvp breakdown of how they approach other classes as a hunter.
---
What level are you? Heroic strike is a rage dump ability. If youre low level thats irrelevant, when you get higher level you will have more rage than you can spend. If youre not spending it on something, its going to waste.

Hi Frank, I’m Dad.

There's a lot of misinformation out there about hunters in Classic to be careful of. A very common one is about pet attack speed, many guides tell people that attack speed is extremely important on your pets in all cases. That leads a lot of people to put lots of effort into getting pets like the SFK wolf or the elite on in Searing Gorge even though it won't actually increase their pve dps at 60.
---
Also on the subject of guide misinformation, not necessarily aimed at you since you're not there yet but for anyone else who might read this, don't listen to the guides telling you to get Dal'Rend's for pre-raid bis. They're wrong.
---
No mana spent = keep regenerating. That's why inner focus is so good.

Being terse and unsympathetic is a part of what makes someone an asshole, yes. You can also think someone's an asshole or even point it out without being "wound up" about it. But this is the internet so just accuse everyone of being mad, right? Shit, you typed up two paragraphs against his single sentence. Are you sure you're not the one who's wound up?
---
I'd be interested in seeing the data that says that most players are level 60.
---
I always thought Incendius was balanced. I even saw a thread that had an alliance as the dominant faction. It might be different now, but that's probably because Yang Gang is the dominant guild - however, if you look at Warcraft Logs, the top 10 performing guilds are equal horde and alliance. I still think it's a good server for both factions.
---
Honestly, anywhere highlighted by jokerd has been littered with frost mages. Western plaguelands are the same
---
5-6 hours a level is a pretty good pace for 55+
---
Inb4 hes lvl 12 stuck on the 2nd quest in westfall.
---
One of the most frustrating things I've experienced in classic so far.
---
Level 33 and I think I am still wearing a level 12 boe green.
---
I think the reason they know phase 2 won't have BGs is because they already read the release plans...
---
He has devolved into saying only a single word.... well time to hit the ol cosmic trail.
---
Uh, does it matter, the answer to all those is Mage
---
Source: Am Warlock
---
Mages are the only class I won't play lol.
---
"What do you think the avg play time to 60 is?"
---
Thing is I don't know, and literally only Blizz does and they don't release that info. Just plucking a number out of the air based on your 1/100,000th experience is flawed to the core.
---
Yes, of course, I should have figured it out, since there were only ranged classes on top here.. Oh well, it's no biggie :) As long as I might be top 10, I ll be happy; horde btw, but with clever use of raptor strike weaving and lucky windfury procs, I might get there.
---
out of curiosity, where do you quest 32ish-42ish if you skip STV?
---
Yeah I was lvl 45 at the time and a 60 rogue was chasing me. Had like 20% hp left, accepted a dungeon invite and boom gone
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast Earth Shock(Rank 1)
---
THIS one? That's an understatement
---
I’m not going anywhere until the group is full. Had it happen too many times that the group fell apart and I went there for nothing.
---
Please, how do you bring up the stopwatch using a slash command?  I used to use /timer on retail, but on classic that command does not work.  Please what is the command because I use the stop watch all the time while playing and waiting on named respawns and tracking how much time I am moving between quests.
---
Maybe on onyxia, yea. That’s a threat fight. Every other fight I’ve been able to go hard after letting the warrior get initial aggro. 
---
Waiting for a paladin to get threat is a fucking snooze and not worth it when I’ll pull aggro anyways. Unless I wait til 50%..
---
Thumbnail gave me JavaScript PTSD thx
---
Geeez
---
Of course when you are talking about the challenge teir things get intentionally difficult, I just mean that there is danger and difficulty throughout the entirety of classic, it's baked in to the game's DNA, from questing all the way through end game raids.
---
For PvP, yes.
---
For PvE, yes, but only if you are raiding BM spec. If you don't have frenzy then it won't make any difference.
---
My one true main in my heart is Paladin.... and I rolled horde this time around. This is how I feel about every character I've made because none of them can fill the void left behind by my lovely healadin :(
---
Seems pretty nice so far, really liking how I can heal dungeons while being a feral druid for questing
---
thank you!!
---
I personally play hodre on Smolderweb, which is fortunately, to my knowledge at least, one of the most balanced servers. I wanted to go alliance so so so bad for this very reason you mention. I like having that slight weight against me like every single moment battle could ensue. That is a great feeling and I love every second of it.
---
The last private server I played on had a MASSIVE imbalance though to the point where every time I was stepping off a FP there were 5-10 horde waiting for me. It literally got to the point where if I wasnt in a full 5 man group I couldnt be in open world, alive, for very long. I quit shortly after, and so did many, leading to a very quickly, dead server. 
---
Its a fine line, but once that line is crossed, theres only a finite amount of ways to go back. and each one would outrage "someone". I would definitely expect it to only get worse over time. There will be no massive influx of new alliance players on these horde dominate servers sadly.
---
Is this for real?
---
As I said, there's nothing wrong with wanting to top meters. There are tons of things wrong with wanting to top metres and running out of mana. 
---
I agree with what you're saying though and wish more Priests knew how to play the class correctly.
---
this comment is an investment in this posts stonks.
---
very well made
---
What's the point/difference in role playing on classic instead of retail?

I think it’s like 2% per tap from rich veins.

I think ItemRack can do this among other things. [ItemRack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemrack-classic)
---
My mother had me tested, im not special
---
From the census I’m looking at earthfury looks to be about the same as Fairbanks only on a smaller scale
---
As a Holy paladin I put 3 points into Imp Righteous fury because I inevitably end up having to tank groups just to get one together.
---
Thanks for this, very comprehensive!
---
Carrion bird is better than owl.
---
Same abilities, with better diet.
---
I used carrion bird while solo, cat while in dungeons (so tanks wouldn't whine about carrion bird screeching in their ear.)
---
It's been a popular opinion that we want new content for a while now. It's just speculation.
---
These posts are nothing but annoying... get a life goddamn
---
So... BfA is Arthas' fault? Bruh fuck that guy.
---
Damn in that case why is burst of knowledge not at the top of the BiS trinket list for priest? Pop burst of knowledge, you can put free downranked renew on everyone and a couple of lesser heals without reseting your mana regen? Seems way better than second wind, flat 300 mana over time.
---
I have 1 character on each of those servers. I love them both. Smolderweb is my horde character and Incendius is my Alliance character.
---
It is best in slot for mitigation. You typically switch to the 300 AP 1-hand from AQ40 for most fights to keep up with the threat, but we aren't seeing that one anytime soon.
---
The Unyielding Maul is also an excellent tanking weapon and fills a large gap in itemization only Warden Staff could fill before, but Warden Staff is still undeniably better. The difference isn't massive, but if you care about BiS you need to get the Staff.
---
The secret is to main everything. It’s not like classes are more than 3-5 button rotations anymore
---
This is why I don't kill Horde players. Maybe out of some bizarre Karma I'll be spared in the future.
---
It’s not too bad. I got a level per day until 45ish now it’s every other day from then until 53. Which is where I am now. Weekend though so I’m hoping to hit 60 by the end of next weekend
---
So it goes back to the tank, then mage nova cone of cold crits after ice block and gets aggro again to only iceblock the second time.
---
He also listed way more reasons as to why he deleted it that could have been easily elaborated in the original reply. "Sorry, but your post was removed because the answer is easily googleable. We also have a question thread you can ask in here."
---
Would have taken all of two extra seconds.
---
The hardest part is getting to 60, there is MC pugs all the time and unless you play a weirdo spec like shadowpriest like i am, gear is not that hard to get actually
---
Pretty sure the phone picture posters were taken out back and shot so the thread removal would be redundant
---
You need that mount sir...get back in there!
---
Does bear form have an innate threat modifier akin to defensive stance? I can't seem to get a clear answer and most of the stuff I google end up being for later expansions.
---
And if so, does it increase threat generated from thorns?
---
Why would they change classic? Classic is classic. You can't change classic!
---
I just checked petopia, all Raptors are 2.0 attack speed, so just choose the look you want :)
---
this editing allows me to watch these videos with a vibe I am unable to perpetuate in my own head these days

You mean just making enchants, putting them on a piece of paper and selling it on the Auction House isn't community interaction??

I don't think anyone's gonna get banned for putting up a clout mace for 420 and 696 gold

I’m a warrior ✌🏾
---
They’ve already said phase two is releasing before the end of the year. Most servers are on either 1 or 2 layers already.
---
I did a mix of Arathi/Badlands and mostly spamming Scarlet Monastery / RFD
---
I'm level 60 and not bored. Please don't think you speak for me.
---
Yep. Also the game has had big free content updates that add a bunch of stuff, so you have a massive ammount of content to do in the base game, and there is a huge focus on your personal story, with instances, dungeons, quests, all moving it along. If you enjoy a story focused mmorpg, then ffxiv is a great choice.
---
One thing square really did well as how they give incentive to group, either in dungeon or other groups instances, with the groupfinder tool working incredibly well.
---
For leveling feral is great. I healed emp as feral. I switched to resto to finish out my resto prebis. Once you get to brd you will want to be healer so less people are rolling against you if you plan on going resto for mc
---
Mat farming will still be the same. The mats have to come from somewhere, besides I see guild mates exchanging mats left and right in my guild.
---
I’m not saying I want an easy route or a boring game. But a guild vault is not a bad idea.
---
The good type :)
---
I leveled as MM and stayed mm at 60. I'm 2/31/18 build.  Improved wing clip helps a lot, gives it a chance to stun. 
---
If someone comes in melee range: scatter shot, them fd/ice trap or wing clip into aspect of cheetah to get distance, then spam concussive shot and kit them till they dead.
---
Just look at the threat meter instead of the dps meter and it's actually  pretty easy.
---
They took their info from here: 
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/
---
But this site has been broken for quite a while now
---
That plus rushing the game at launch when you're advised it will take about 2 years to go through the 6 Phases...
---
Could you elaborate on how Blizzard broke the /who function? Serious question as I was unaware. Thanks for the reply btw!
---
I don’t know why you even ask.. the answer is just too obvious... main a Boomkin and rule the World! *furfur*
---
Even the weather changes, what a mood.
---
Most players are not level 60. They are more around level 40 ish. Tons are not even guilded. Nobody is "bored" of anything. YOU may be bored at 60, if you even are but there are dozens of guilds and players that havent even cleared molten core. There is no reason to add anything new because this is not bfa. Its classic vanilla wow where the point of the game is to have fun and play with others. Maybe you should reroll a new character join a guild and socialize. Stop doing the solo route because thats not classic that is current bfa WoW where u literally dont ever have to talk to anyone or group up. Just going into an area and questing with my guildmates is fun for me while we talk and chat on discord. Stop trying to speak for everyone please.
---
Burst of knowledge also gives +12 healing power
---
Do you know how big lordaeron is compared to the other kingdoms?
---
Yawn zzzz 
---
You do realize I never said it was difficult right..? I said it’s fucking pointless, much like your comments.
---
I just hate the alliance races. I'd rather be orc undead or troll over any of the alliance ones
---
I don't understand phase 1 wpvp at all and I choose not to participate. No honorable kills, no in-game reward whatsoever, why bother? I get why it's fun for some people, but that's not me. I see the enemy faction, but I also see another player just doing their thing. When there is honor and rewards involved that will be different.
---
"Competition over resources"? I guess? But I'm against ALL players for that; my own faction as much (if not more) than the other side.
---
Faction balance is an issue as it has always been, but maybe also recognize that players bring very different attitudes to this game, and don't bemoan the state of wpvp before it even truly exists.
---
I don't know how many times I've been told (not from the tank but other party members) "mage why don't you aoe?" 
---
Yeah, because I don't want to die.
---
Man you are looking of any reason to pretend you should be able to ninja shit.
---
Idk what's lamer the guy lying about the duration he had played WoW or the guy snooping through his comment history for no good reason
---
Lots of videos that put you around exalted at 40-45 on YouTube. Plenty of guides for doing this
---
If you don't rush the game them you'll be held back when pvp comes out
---
Anyone have one for dismounting/mounting and swapping out carrot for other trinket at the same time?
---
Thinking of transferring to either Bloodfang or Earthshaker (EU) any info on those servers? population, PUG possibilities, etc?
---
Omnicc
---
I think the difference is that it wasn’t an insult, you just took it as one. I simply made a quip that demonstrated an exaggerated stance. Rather, your most recent response inaccurately states that it’s similar to the situation you presented - when it reality it isn’t, and is only brought up to put me in a bad light.  
---
I’m leavin you here bud.
---
If you have certain loot expectation I would bring them up prior to the group. This way you may be able to out someone who plans on need rolling everything they can equip. Might be better than hoping they follow your set of expectations. May not be full proof but could help
---
When it comes to group pvp, Alliance are great. Paladins can do their thing. Priests are more free to act offensively. Outside of that, and in the vast majority of pvp we'll see before battlegrounds, horde racials are busted. Hardiness and WotF are insane, and can just straight up win fights that would have otherwise been close.
---
Also doesn't help that the only good pvp racials on Alliance are on the typically lowest-played races (gnome/dwarf).
---

The comments mention crusader dropping after TBC, so maybe what I heard was wrong, but I still had an ok time farming there as far as single targeting goes.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
That's just like your opinion man
---
There is one in wowhead I’m looking at. It looks really well done but idk how accurate it is considering it has one of the servers as 95% alliance
---
oh i surly don't that's why i plan to only put 21 in the Prot tree cause i want to heal in pvp/pve
---
Faerlina is still most populated. It's about 60-65% Horde.
---
Herod is 2nd but it's 80% horde.
---
Whitemane is 3rd, also 70% horde.
---
Benediction is 4 and it's a solid 50/50.
---
This has been covered extensively. 
---
Level an alt. Get one of every class.

/cast shadowform
---
/cast desperate prayer 
---
Exit shadowform and heaL yah self quickly!
---
Playing it properly is so rewarding, in my opinion, but it does make healing boring especially in raids and dungeons, at least to me it does.
---
How do I remove the transform if the innkeeper tricks me?
---
I agree. I don’t think this a controversial change at all and does not lead to a “slippery slope”. It adds transparency to guilds and is a simple quality of life adjustment that literally has no direct impact to game play or difficulty.
---
If I’m being honest. 95% of the player base isn’t good enough to make effective use of those facials and they only really matter in high level 1v1’s. That said, half of the alliance racials are incredibly powerful. Stone form is like a free win versus average to good rogues and escape artist is a free phase 1 pvp trinket. Alliance also has much better pve racials too.
---
Counterpoint: I'm a mid 50's Hunter and I'm having way more fun than I ever did on my mage back in vanilla. Dead zones suck but it's still way better than spell pushback. 
---
I do agree with buginess/incompleteness of the class but still find it more fun in spite of that.
---
I get it that some of you don't want classic to turn into retail but having a healthy discussion about what COULD be added shouldn't be shunned upon
---
This isn't where I parked my car..
---
So what else is situational about renews? I tend to just throw them out to warlocks or whoever else is taking damage that i dont have time to cast greater heal on.
---
The quests from like 43 to 50 are absolutely awful and almost non existant it felt. Once I hit 50 I felt like I could do a lot more again.
---
Gratz Bois
---
Well, why don’t you guys just tank then
---
what the fuck is up with that exalted reward
---
a 5 resist on a shoulder? 
---
really? wont even feel that
---
Working from home is also a thing here
---
Yea I love mages as a tank, they are basically just helping tanking. And if I die they can just kite around and no wipe. Mages are my fav DPS after shamans.
---
I pull from tank in crazy situations so I can gouge and cool the heat down. 6 seconds of mob stun can make a huge difference. 
---
I can always vanish.
---
Or, walk out, right click portrait, hit reset instance, and walk about it. It literally takes than 5 seconds *including loading time*.
---
Depending on the tier of content you're aiming for, the TPS bonus of Troll Berserking can be a bigger benefit to your overall raid's performance than the bonus 5% hp of Tauren.
---
One thing I did notice was that spamming the shit out of wing clip levels up your weapon skill pretty quickly (at the cost of mana, of course). When I get a new melee weapon, I do that to a few mobs that my pet can just solo anyways.
---
But my melee skill is still usually 50-100 behind my ranged. When my hunter hits 60, I'll probably just grind it out.
---

The following script (Which requires enabling user scripts - something that can be risky) will change your power word fort such that it always casts the right buff level for whoever you're targeting:
---
    /script Pre="Mark of the Wild(Rank " Sp={1,2,14,26,38,50} if (UnitLevel("target") ~= nil and UnitIsFriend("player","target")) then for i=5,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel("target") &gt;= Sp) then CastSpellByName(Pre..i..")") return end end end
---
Devils advocate, maybe they meant “Never player WoW classic”
---
As we can see from this video, it's not cool when you think you're in an empty zone but really there's a battle raging.
---
Are you convinced?
---
Ah my two favorite classes! Good to hear! 
---
Respec costs are a familiar old wound. In TBC it was easy to work around with making money off high level enchanting, but leveling up... seems hard. 
---
I had forgotten about being able to actually hybridize your talent trees for leveling. Is it possible to still heal non-endgame instances as a non-resto build while leveling?
---
Ah yes, go steal the literal inheritance of a dead wealthy family located inside a fortress like necromancer school that is protected by spirits, zombies, and giant spiders. And for this task, I shall give you the equivalent of what 2 stacks of bear jaws vendors for.
---
A raid has 1 chance at Striker's Mark dropping per week. That same raid could split up and have 8 groups each farm 5 Strat UD spider resets per hour for a whopping 6,720 chances at Carapace dropping per week. Carapace is basically a guaranteed item and it does higher DPS than Striker's. And then there's the Leaf... So hunters can immediately replace Striker's both inside and outside of MC immediately whereas furys will never replace Striker's and rogues will replace it in Naxx.
---
So, you took a worse item and will use it for a fraction of the time other classes would have used it as their best item.
---
That's more a turn of phrase than anything else, but really, everyone needs to (hopefully) learn how to be an adult one day, and in those situations it's up to the other party to maturely communicate the issue to the ignorant party.
---
I really mean "Just use your words dummy!"
---
Thunderclap has the highest threat I thought.
---
Even as of 2012 there were less then 1000 options

---
The only argument for not buying it would be if you already had access to pvp gear, then travel form + PvP bonus + enchant would get it to the same speed as the ghetto mount + carrot on a stick.
---
Yeah but it's when things start to get neutered and flying kills world pvp.
---
That edit made lose much sympathy. Create your own purpose in the game if it doesn't offer you any obvious ones. Or maybe start with another game. If you find the endgame a lackluster atm, then you should take a break.
---
You seem to be missing the point. Can a paladin tank work? Yes, but it requires the DPS to gimp themselves to compensate for the paladin's lack of threat. While they can do whatever they please with a warrior tank.
---
I've enjoyed runs with paladin tanks for shits and giggles, but its far from optimal. The vast majority will pick warrior or even bear every time.
---
I charge a % relative to the cost of the mats. People don't really argue when you put it like that.
---
Then charge 10-20%.
---
I'm not saying add anything right now. Please read my post. I'm saying after the power creep that nax gives it would be refreshing to see new content.
---
Always get 1 point in imp. shield block, everything else is fine
---
Although I prefer imp revenge over imp sunder, rage quickly becomes a non-issue with fury prot tanking
---
Feral instinct talent at 5/5 increases threat from all sources by 15% in bear form, apart from that there's none that I know of
---
You need both since classic feral pretty much means you're switching in and out of cat/bear forms. You need stg for kitty dps and bear swipes, and you need agility for kitty dps and bear dodge.
---
If we're talking dungeons, then yeah renew is wonderful. But in raids anyone who's not full HP will likely get topped off soon, wasting your renews. Especially on horde side. Exception would be fights where everyone is taking constant damage, but there aren't any of those in MC and you better not be carrying around a burst of knowledge in later raids.
---
It's generally different for class, but one that is usually the same is warlocks.  You bend over and die to dots.
---
Shields don't break so quickly that you would need two of the same. That guy's retarded.
---
Yikes dude rip
---
Mage = best AoE.
---
Shadow Priest = Best single target.
---
Hunter = Great AoE &amp; Great Single Target.
---
A good hunter will out DPS everyone.
---
How would you say it is without herbalism? My mage just hit 50 but doesn't have herbalism. My priest is 40 but DOES have herbalism.
---
It's quite the conundrum.
---
Its still pathetic damage compared to mages.
---
You should never have picked a PvP server if you’re one of the slower levelers
---
Yup. I had to reroll Faerlina. It's the only balanced high pop pvp server.
---
You sure?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10429 has it listed at 8%
---
Even better, try win+shift+s if you're on windows 10.
---
For 350 you can get a Ryzen 5 2500u with 8gb RAM atleast where i am or atleast the bit weaker Ryzen 3 2200U
---
This is unbelievable
---
Gotcha, I haven't done a raid before, but i want to eventually. About to hit lvl 57
---
The point is, depend on the server, the horde dont even need the /1
---
Cuz passerby horde or others on the same quest kill them to reduce competition 
---
its not one guy camping the place, its a bunch of people seeing targets of opportunity
---
Similarly I hate it when people mix up ‘Vanilla’ and ‘Classic.’
---
I’m glad you’re enjoying the game.
---
what I am getting at is that free downranked renews doesn't hold any weight when you are doing content where BiS is desired. its not that burst of knowledge is awful, but there are better options if you can get them! my take on it anyway
---
&gt; You cannot tell me someone should have anticipated blizzard fucking things up this badly.
---
Blizzard didn't fuck anything up. Players screwed themselves. There was a whole campaign on the official forums, discord, reddit, etc. that Herod was the defacto server to roll on.
---
When the servers were launched, Herod (and some others) had the highest, longest queues. Players waited **hours** just to log in. 
---
I just can't fathom how anybody couldn't have assumed that a PVP server with this much popularity wouldn't absolutely sway towards the Horde. Players had the chance to leave and go to fresh PVP servers to avoid queues, but they chose against it. Ah well. Enjoy.
---
I can't even describe the anger you ignite in me.  If you fucks actually ruin WoW like you did OSRS I won't have any games left to play.
---
Is Anathema any good?
---
Seven dogs in DM north before King.  They hit hard on plate, much less cloth.
---
I charge.  Demo shout, bloodrage, tab sunder, the whole drill.  Get about one sunder in when the mage fires up the blizzard.  Start taunting back the dogs closest to the clothes when mage runs in and frost novas.
---
Dogs are now stuck to the ground and will switch to anyone in melee range regardless of threat.
---
Instead of *moving away from the dogs he just frost novad*, the mage stands there and tanks them so he can blast them with Smokey's Lighter.  He dies almost instantly.
---
I endure two hours of bitching and log posting in /gchat about the PUG healer and how he didn't heal him through tanking 7 elite dogs in cloth armor.  "He didn't even throw me a shield before AOE!!"  Well then don't AOE, I suggest.  Terrible suggestion if you were wondering.  AOE waits for no man.
---
Blizzard told us many things but how in hell do they want to release phase2 when there still is layering on any server because usually Blizzard updates the game worldwide at the same time.
---
What if the servers still have layering active in late december?
---
This is obviously used in some way to access the cow level.
---
I don't think so but maul does have a threat multiplier despite not stating so in the tooltip.
---
Yeah just use world instead, that’s what everyone on my server does, and uses it as trade.
---
There’s no honor, what are you talking about?
---
so i download omnicc but how do you configure it to show the timer on the target?
---
Gotcha thanks for the answer!
---
I got downvoted immediately by people who didn't do their research into class specs before they picked when coming from BC+ experience.
---
Paladins just can't hack it like a Warrior in Raids on Classic. It's just the way the game was made. They're fine to OT an ad or trash, but they just can't for bosses.
---
My guild doesn't run a druid or pally tank. Warriors are superior in every way for raiding. They're better healers in this iteration of the game.
---
Well apparently it is because Ive had a few people, not just my friends tell me that... so much fake news!
---
Another way to think about it, is if you are Alliance on Herod, you are playing the hardest version of the game.
---
nice ill check it out
---
Min maxing is fun too
---
You should try a mage or hunter for even 36 levels and then give us your unbiased opinion on tanks getting into a group for a dungeon run.
---
You can find most of the farming spots unoccupied. There might be a quester or two or another mage. But with mobs respawning quickly I didn't find it a problem outside of weekend evening hours.

Except pirates in Tanaris.
---
yea that’s a good point, I have about 400g right now and nothing else in mind to buy since I have most of my pre-raid BIS. looks like i’ll be saving for epic mount :)
---
Honestly that's why I don't really mind those people. They'll self segregate into oblivion.
---
Well your problem is the Blasted Lands is probably the worst zone in the game and the other two people who were there were alt tabbed looking for better places to quest than the Blasted Lands.
---
I really wish Tactical Mastery was a first tier talent.  Tanking 5mans without it is AWFUL.  Raids aren't much of an issue since damage intake is so high your Rage generation should be fine; but in 5mans, you need every bit of Rage generation you can squeeze out.
---
And I don't even have one at level 20 yet...
---
Note that character population =/= realm balance population.
---
Hopefully with the Census mod working again we'll get some more concrete data to show the actual server balances once more people run and upload their data.
---
"Rather, your most recent response inaccurately states that it’s similar to the situation you presented - when it reality it isn’t"
---
How is assuming the worst of someone based on things they never said, not insulting?
---
If it is not accurate point to the reason, but just saying inaccurate cus inaccurate is ..
---
Oh I well most definitely try to heal, enjoy it way more, but if I can’t find a group trying to heal I’ll switch to tank. Glad you had a good experience with a resto Druid though. :)
---
How is that possible?
---
I strongly advice you to avoid using those methods in order to not ruin your experience.
---
I feel you, im a hybrid paladin too. But when im filling, i always state before the run that i will be rolling for the other classes as well. Maybe i should have phrased my thread better....
---
Hilarious
---
the only cost the warlock felsteed is whatever it takes to flight path over to Ratchet and get your free mount... The Succubus and the felhunter had us questing all over along with the blood robes... but the mount is legit a "Go over there and talk to him and he gives you a mount"
---
Of course not.
---
But as the old saying goes 'don't throw stones if you live in a glass-house'
---
or as I like to say: Don't demand others support Hong Kong with financial loss, while all you do is send 'thoughts and prayers' aka being useless.
---
the lack of wpvp for being horde make me wish i had rolled ally
---
So what type of loot would you roll on, or even be allowed to roll on in raids with a guild if you are hybrid dps/OT? The good dps gear would most likely go to your top dpsers and the good tank gear to your two main tanks right? And you will be left with the scraps, or pieces that they have already got? I’m in this situation now of being a tank at lvl 58 but wanting to go 31/5/15 at 60 so I can join MC raids.
---
Haven't tanked vanilla endgame, but TBC/WOTLK endgame you certainly need HS on your action bar because you're drowning in rage.
---
Available rage is definitely low as you level your warrior, though. So you often might not need it.
---
I feel like Blizzard doesn’t take the naming conventions seriously. I report every non-rp name I come across, yet I still see plenty of people at level 60 named Lolbigcritz. It’s worse on Horde side too. In the first few days I remember guys in trade chat complaining about getting their names force changed, but idk
---
Carrion bird has +5% armor but owl has +7% attack (cat has 10% attack for reference), so not quite the same. Personally I don't care about a few percent here or there as long as I enjoy it, but I just so happen to like owls the best so that's what I use. Wolves are really good for dungeon running for that party buff too.
---
Just get an invite from someone a guildee, friend rando thats on a different layer.
---
... XD
---
if he had chosen alliance he would have transferred off Herod long ago like all the other alliance did
---
When it gets hairy, I can fear this stack away. No problem, dude.
---
you are one who has no life
---
Really glad it's not just me, I dont claim to be the best hunter or wow player in general, but I definitely thought it was a little extreme.
---
Thanks! I already do.
---
He's Horde probably outnumbered Alliance 5-1 he'll be fine.
---
I was in a Brd group last week and the tank went and aggrod like 30 mobs long story short we wiped and he blamed me for not blizzing them all to death. I was the only one with AoE and he cussed me out saying it was my job to kill EVERY thing. I left the group.
---
The majority of people on the bell curve probably take 12 to 15 days, maybe more. Hell, the majority of people might not even hit 60 at all! The "most people" you're referring to are not casual by any reasonable definition. Playing 8+ days worth of a video game in a month is not casual. We, as wow players, have a ridiculously skewed concept of what constitutes a casual. You need to qualify that by saying something like "most people that are already 60 which means they're very committed to this game" take around 8 days /played.
---
&gt; Honestly, I feel like the no changes crowd being so obnoxious has caused a lot of problems.
---
The problems are the feature. 
---
No changes had to be the starting point, because that was actually the point. Where we go from here (new servers with new changes) could be an option. I would be interested for sure if they wanted to try and experiment with Classic, but it would have to be a new server. I doubt that they would want to poor resources into something like that, so this is all just fantasy.
---
At 60 you get an improved vanish and It shouldn't happen as often.
---
This guy watches your back
---
&gt;  the smaller faction never experiences queues even when the server is otherwise full
---
I complain about imbalance on my server Whitemane a lot, and I'll admit that being guaranteed a life without queues would be a pretty compelling reason to stay the underdog. 
---
That said, while I don't want to invoke the specter of #NoChanges, I would be ecstatic to have EMFH added as a mirror to WotF. That one ability virtually invalidates my entire gameplan in wPVP while levelling, and it's on one of the most popular races in the game.
---
So 1 post is indicative of every post on the subreddit? guess this is the only post here on the entire site based on this brilliant point...

Probably a dumb question, but couldn't see the answer anywhere.   
---
As a caster, would items with the effect: "Equip: Improves your chances to hit by 1%" work for my spells? Or only the items that specifically say "with spells by 1%'
---
To be honest all professions that revolve around crafting use a lot of gold. If you want to farm gold I suggest picking up two gathering professions like herbalism and skinning
---
I think the abandon quest button is missing from some player's UI's, and they need to make room for quests that have worthwhile rewards.
---
It's the only reasonable explanation for why people would put themselves through some of the shit they do for 90 silver.
---
I don't think OP means to blame the alliance players for how they act
---
Oh awesome. I did not know they (sort of) fixed it. Do you happen to have a link to the census add on?
---
For real, watching them drain their life to fill their mana between every fight then refusing to sit down and eat or drink and asking the healer to fill them up really grinds my gears. I'm a mage, I gave you food and water, drain yourself half way then sit and eat like a normal person.
---
Need if need. Greed if greed. Needing it for another spec you intended to play is need, it's not greed
---
He lied to me :O
---
4-5days? Ok so people in your guild were only 4 hours slower than jokerd? Yea I don’t believe you
---
Can you please test and confirm whether it procs off Mind vision? I’ve heard rumors it does.
---
Can you cast the summon on him while both characters are within the instance, then have him hearth and repair, then accept the summon? I know we have done that in regular dungeons but I'm not 60 yet so haven't gone into any raids.
---
The server Xfers only made it worse. For all of the 60H/40A heavily populated PvP servers (which was almost every full server), Alliance started jumping ship and it snowballed. Now, the server where they could all transfer to (Heartseeker in my case), is something like 20H/80A, and my server got even worse and is probably closer to 75H/25A.
---
Also interested in this\^
---
For one, Horde have much better PVP racials.
---
And for the people who stay, it forces them to hone their skill and become the best that they can be. What part of that do you not understand?
---
You can herb from the surface?
---
Means alot ❤️

"As a new player, people are so nice. But I get bombarded with so many tips is hard to keep track of them. I decided to learn at my own pace, goof-ups and all ! Thank you for being helpful though, I'll hit you up if I have any questions !"
---
How much for a back washing?
---
R14 is not realistic for 99.999% of players
---
woo so true
---
Awesome!  Hope you're enjoying it.
---
You do not need to be invested in Prot to be able to tank.  Prot spec greatly helps with damage reduction and a bit of threat increase; but is not required whatsoever (until the next set of Raids:  BWL, AW40, etc).
---
As long as you have a set of gear designed for tanking (Plate Gear with good Stamina numbers, and some defense stats like "+X to Defense" or chance to dodge/parry/block) you'll be fine.  You DEFINITELY don't want to tank in DPS gear if you can help it.
---
Bear tank has been "resolved" and nearly made optimal in the past few years. I can't imagine anyone saying otherwise with mountains of data/proof out there. 
---
I would trust, you stay away and ignore this vocal camp. And ask anyone in the future when is the last time they played WoW, to get a grasp of their knowledge.
---
True that. But thats like saying a warrior DPS can roll for tank gear. They shouldn't even have to state they're rolling for tank gear, because most tanks are warriors.
---
From one Den to another, congratulations!
---
Got one
---
Which should I spec if forced to choose between the two? Ferocity or Unleashed Fury? Or should I split points?
---
Hitting 60 at 2 months isn't no life-ing it. Experiencing things at 60 once and then complaining about a lack of things to do is not taking advantage of what's available in the game. Are you fully geared? Professions? Epic mount? Weapon skills? Reputations?
---
The grind is the game. First experiences might be all you care about but the rest of us need time before we want them to push more stuff at us. The sooner we get through the phases the sooner it all ends.
---
Happy Hallow's End!
---
when people ask me why I dealt with 20k queues for the first few weeks
---
Has to say with spells sadly :(
---
Lock yourself in a room and pretend wow is a job.
---
No it's the mods who want the sub to suck who are upvoting all the meme posts
---
Would it be possible to support multiboxers and multiple accounts?
---
faction balance is absolutely horrible in retail. you must not play.. Out of the top 50 or so raiding guilds theres like 5 alliance guilds or less. The problem continues all the way down.
---
Nobody plays alliance because it just means way harder recruiting for no benefit at all. So it keeps snowballing on itself.
---
Sounds like the problems getting so bad that they're going to do away with factions all together in the next xpac
---
My biggest let-down with Classic was realizing that foxes weren't introduced to Loch Modan until Cataclysm, and I wasn't going to be able to level as a hunter with a fox pet again.  It really impacted the vision I had for a my toon.
---
Fuck the horde
---
As a tank myself, if I wanted it, and you have time to wait, just sit in /lfg and wait until you see a NEED 1 MORE TANK FOR STRATH CAN SUMMON.
---
I was about to run something yesterday and I notice in lfg that this group was looking for a tank and willing to pay 15g. Uh... fuck yes. It pays to be a tank sometimes. I did feel really bad because literally only gear for me dropped. I told them because of that don't worry about paying, but they still did, so... yea. Sit in LFG and wait or make your own rules.
---
You guys make my heart happy
---
Nope not upset, just telling him the truth he needs to hear. Considering he just called me the worst I'd say yeah he attacked me. The common denominator here is him though, since he's never ran into a good hunter. It's easy to assume he's a bad tank.
---
and flying mounts! and transmog! and LFR!
---
Comparing ANY server to fucking faerlina is retarded. Its THE streamer server, ofcourse there's always gonna be a billion people on.
---
Why is this top contreversial this week in r all?
---
Found the huntard
---
It doesn't. 99% of the time mages know they're going to pull aggro, they just don't care because the mobs will die before it matters.
---
PvP is just fun.
---
Imagine doing something for fun and not a reward.
---
Oh interesting, I haven’t tried that. I don’t see why it wouldn’t work.
---
It was originally broken into many more patches... It got narrowed down to less. What are you even talking about mate... 
---
Also, what does that have to do w/ anything I wrote?
---
Yeah the buff ticks but it never procs

It's not much, but still best you can get until ZG. When naxx comes out, being exalted gets you a free entry without having to pay a hefty fee for the attunement.

Or atleast hand out warnings?! I called an asshole an asshole which wasnt even represent on reddit/in the thread and they acted like I sent out death threats left and right, if my comment is too offensive then delete it /warn me and move on.
---
My perfect group contains a warlock and a mage. A warlock for those sweet ass summons and a mage to port us to wherever we need once the run is over.
---
What about the one with 15 centaur bandanas (or something like that)?
---
&gt; **Only works for Tauren
---
Tauren are the only druids in classic.  Trolls and the other races (?) didn't get druids until later versions in retail.
---
Same with Tauren priest and paladins.
---
No it hasnt. It's always been free roll. If I roll on healing gear as a tank, I will say it's for healing. That's it
---
That's just level 60 life and it was and is awesome! 
---
The grind becomes something different, either maximizing your gear, proving your worth in PvP and climbing that ladder or simply just running a social guild and live in the world! (Of Warcraft)
---
Just because you've rushed through everything as  quickly as possible doesn't justify adding more content. Some of us are playing a different pace or have gone back to classic wow for another reason. It's not all about the top end Content!
---
Besides they already added that content, it's called retail! I know that classic wow brings into question all of the imbalances and reignites the desire for more (as we felt back in the day) but it's a different set of circumstances, different development crew and there already exists a fleshed out WoW. 
---
I'm sorry but I don't think further development is likely

Can you not take from the candy buckets?

Me and a buddy have names we really like and are basically only available the first few minutes of a server being created. So we decided to keep the names instead of our characters.
---
That's just the value of Druids. Dedicated OT's are great but when you really just need the biggest meat shield you can throw at something, you throw a bear at it because that's what makes most sense. Love having a druid in group that's fully embraced the wild card way of playing the class and is hyper-adaptable.
---
Voone

Makes me wonder how viable something like [this (10/21/12)](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05005-0505013100501-5023011) would be.  Eight points are left out because I'm not sure if they're better spent in Prot or Fury.  Probably Fury.
---
is pagle pvp? is it a streamer server? I'm at work and have no access to look these things up because it will say access denied
---
Damn nice. Gonna use.
---
Not everyone handles things correctly before they reach the tipping point.  
---
Or perhaps they did very gently try to point out problems to you and you laughed it off.  Or maybe they were reminding people, without naming people to avoid embarrassing them, to for example watch their positioning time and again and you just never put 2 and 2 together that you were one of the people that it was aimed at.
---
Every time one of these posts come up there is ALWAYS more to the story.
---
&gt; watching them drain their life to fill their mana between every fight then refusing to sit down and eat or drink and asking the healer to fill them up really grinds my gears.
---
omfg I hate this shit as a mage. I don't even give warlocks water anymore, just conjured food cause I know this shit's going to happen.
---
And then they beg for water.......and never use it.......

Benediction is equal pop.

There’s definitely one in Booty Bay, I’m not sure about Grom Gol I haven’t played Horde on Vanilla in months and I didn’t roll hunter as Horde. 
---
There’s usually a stable in every town standing right next to the entrance to the inn.
---
You mean the lack off? :)
---
By the way, im not at all familiar with druids, but woudnt a cat feral be able to put out decent dps as long as they are using this on boss fights? He would need one for each boss but a 50% haste has to make it somewhat competitive, doesnt it?
---
I’m sure you’ll figure it out soon, just keep trying to tweak things til something feels right.
---
My server is perfect. Always “medium to high”. I went for the free server transfer when it was possible. Never looked back.

Please do we need more.

Faerlina feels like a thriving Modern* mmorpg

you can't find a pug for what you want to do all the time at the drop of a hat?  that's too bad, that's not what makes vanilla

its the same on both sides and if you actually hold this opinion youre not bright and base facts on your own perspective
---
BRD, DM:E, ST
---
Thank you!
---
I don't think there's rounding to whole numbers, I think people tend to round because you can only get gear in 1% increments, so you couldn't get that .3% without .7% other hit coming along for the ride (unless you get it with even more weapon skill).
---
I'm talking about r/wow not r/classicwow. 
---
Yikes though.
---
If this were classic wow u would’ve died lol
---
Thanks I’ve been getting conflicting reports
---
&gt;every dickhead shitter in this game thinks is funny to dismount and one-shot the lowbie. That isn't fun. I want to play the game too. If you enjoy that then good on you but most people like to do things like quest in contested zones without spending half their time with a gray screen. 
---
Pvp on a pvp server. 
---
At least you're on a pve server and not demanding changes.
---
no, they feel like communities. they feel like real vanilla servers.
---
not some overcrowded mosh pit with streamers jumping around and everyone /yelling out of character trash to get noticed on some stream no one gives a shit about.
---
Not launching with BGs was a mistake
---
It's a valid distraction while leveling and a good way to keep people from raid logging at 60
---
Now by phase 3 the pre 60 bgs will be full of twinks and the gear disparity between fresh 60s and 60s that are clearing bwl will be too harsh.
---
I agree with you to a point, there isnt much to do at 60 if you dont like farming. Dungeons all seem kind of pointless if you're already clearing MC. Theres still some upgrades but I dont think the time commitment is worth the small advantage you'd get.
---
Seems like the worst of both worlds doesn't it?
---
I am not.

How much time do you think kids and a social life actually take up? Outside of babies, kids are pretty independent much of the time. Even moreso as they get older.
---
To maintain a social life, you don’t have to do something every night. You can spend Friday or Saturday doing that, and it only takes a few hours. You don’t need to meet some sort of hourly requirement for it to be considered healthy and maintained.
---
Not neglecting the wife is similar to social life and is  usually taken care of by general family time and social life maintenance.

It’s not hard to do all that and still get playtime in (there’s a ton of extra time in the week leftover after these are handled).

Really sucks that this only has 24 upvotes
---
How you handle it is really up to you and I don't think there's a right or wrong answer here. Either just move and and forget about it and hope to get Rhok'delar at some point, or if you think there might be some people mad about it but didn't want to cause any trouble then you could apologize to the warriors and rogues in the guild who it's BiS for and say something like "hey, I did some research and found out I fucked up by taking this bow, I'm really sorry."
---
You complain about faction balance but yet you rolled horde? Did you really think this wasn’t going to happen?
---
Me and my group purposely went alliance because we knew horde was going to outnumber alliance on every server. I have no shortage of horde to fight. Unfortunately every 1v1 eventually turns into a 1v6 if I don’t leave the area.
---
The corpse will be on the pull immediately after that because the warlock will still hellfire while your challenging shout is on a 10min CD and retal is on a 30 min CD.

Warlocks are not as in demand for dungeons as mages. But we are more in demand than say a rogue or hunter. Why? We bring a lot of utility (summons, soul stones, health stones, AoE, crowd control). But not the utility a mage brings (water, portals out, more controlled AOE, crowd control, etc). 
---
And warlocks have a lot of tools people don’t realize we do. In a DM North Run yesterday, I seduced and banished for crowd control. I even used fear in one of the fights for CC. And we also have tools like enslave demon. While I don’t usually seduce in dungeons, when a tank is newer and there is no mage, sometimes I bring out a succubus. 
---
For raids, warlocks have their spot. We are needed for curses (elements, shadow, recklessness, and weakness). Generally, warlocks are needed in lesser numbers than mages or rogues, but there are also a lot fewer of us. So getting in a raiding guild as a warlock is easier than a mage.
---
10% boost from the racial which helps. Wow head or another guide I saw recently said bosses stop giving rep at 50% into revere but I am at 13k and the bosses in strat still gave rep

sorry if I sound stupid, but what are bank alts for?

Yeah that guy has **no idea** what he's talking about. I play horde on Anathema and as far as I can tell it's 50/50 it or very slightly in alliance favor in the 50 to 60 lvl bracket
---
LoL silly healer
---
It's not *bad*, it's playable, but it's been sliding more towards horde lately.  There are also lots of guilds who don't log, I know of several.
---
Do you have a link for setting these up? Been doing things the hard way for 60 levels
---
You need **four** people to help summon.
---
Summon a Doomguard who will kill someone at random and run amok, murdering everything it sees until it despawns out of boredom or the server is restarted.
---
Gutgore is not the best MH or OH.  It's worse than Perd MH for sure, and it's worse than CHT OH.  But it's still a 1.8 speed 50 DPS dagger which is significantly better than even felstriker (though felstriker has a better proc, it doesn't matter because it will never drop).  
---
Perd dropped last week but I had 3 votes to 6 votes.  
---
I think I would get it if it dropped next week.  
---
We'll see.  I can't bank on Perd dropping every week so I'm definitely willing to settle for gutgore (even though it will put me behind someone else for perd).
---
Mats for what?
---
I've been in one pug MC with 6 of us. The other two I did only had 3 of us, and the Ony pug I did had 4. My guild MC group only has 3 of us.
---
Maybe some Horde players should ditch their pride and roll Alliance if they are tired of getting stuck with no one to PVP against?
---
What's that, you don't want to reroll to the Alliance cause you love the Horde and wear Horde T-shirts to conventions? You're kind of the problem, and we all knew this would be a problem.
---
I used to play Horde for about 10 years on a mostly even split server. To be honest, the "For the Horde" mindset is completely different from that of Alliance players and I never realized how different the experiences are till now. When I played the Horde I felt like I could safely stop and wave at an Alliance player or stop and /dance near one. On the Alliance, I don't feel like I can do that at all. I never *hated* the Alliance as the Horde and enjoyed fighting them. I never felt like they were overly aggressive or generally toxic in their PVPing. As an Alliance player I've come to actively despise the Horde for how aggressive and downright obnoxious they can be and I have begun to rethink a lot of my previous experiences in W-PVP on the Horde side.
---
I remember watching at Blizzcon as Horde players drowned out cheers of Alliance players with boo's. Everyone loves the game, but why are Horde players so overly aggressive and practically nationalistic about their faction choice? I feel like the type of people who get joy out of ganking lowbies or spending hours attacking people from the top of the center piece in Gadgetzan are generally more Horde based. These type of toxic players tend to fall into the Horde more often than they do on the Alliance, and for obvious reasons. Spikes, war banners, generally aggressive imagery and character designs. I mean the Horde has *literal* trolls for God's sake. If you were a jerk-bag who had no desire to PVE and only wanted to piss off opposing faction players and get your kicks which side Faction do you think you'd end up in? Of course these types of ass-hats will gravitate towards the "evil"/"mean" looking side.
---
The Horde is generally more aggressive, full of "hardcore" players and PVPers who *obviously* pick the easier and racially superior PVP side. On the Horde side you have it *easy* in PVP. It's basically a fucking handicap to play the Horde on a PVP server. Your racials are better, your populations are almost exclusively higher, and your players generally are more prone to bullying and picking on the opposing faction to the point of demoralizing entire realms worth of people for ever trying to engage you in a fair fight.
---
Horde players made their beds and have been like this for *years*. How many of you just *couldn't wait* to harass some person in PVP for a few hours to get your jollies? I'm not saying the Alliance doesn't ever do this, or that there are not the same toxic players on the Alliance. But the Horde has them in abundance and attracts this personality type then consistently wonder why Alliance players quit, flee, or go choose to play on PVE servers.
---
Have fun trying to rank. I'll be playing the underdog side and enjoying every minute of your overpopulated fuck fest.
---
Been 60 since week 2.
---
Except my leatherworking. Who needs me??
---
My recommendations:
---
- DPS Buff: Slavering Worg with 1.2 attack speed from SFK trained with furious howl, dash, bite and growl
---
- Tank: Turtle with 2.0 attack speed from anywhere trained with shell shield, bite, and growl
---
- PVP Grief Engine: ZG Bat with 1.0 attack speed trained with screech, five, bite, and growl
---
Then put talent points where you think you need them most, e.g. resistances, superior stamina, or armor.
---
Thunderfury like most servers is heavily horde dominant.
---
Bene hit different when you dont just try it on and it only shows in your hand. Congratulations man.
---
No cost but you do need 3 extra azerite pieces and (depending on class) new trinkets and weapon.
---
You can look up the faction differences
---
You really don't understand psychology at all, and this toxic attitude just furthers my point. 
---
People are AFRAID of being on the smaller side, terribly so. When you CONSTANTLY talk about it, when you make a MASSIVE deal about it, it further amplifies the issue. Hell, the biggest thing people talked about for 3 fucking weeks before launch was "What's the faction balance of X server" BEFORE THE SERVERS WERE EVEN LAUNCHED. 
---
How the fuck do you accurately tell that? You don't, but people were PANICKING over this shit, they were losing their minds. If there wasn't 20 posts a day about it, if we all didn't constantly feed the fear mongering nonsense, yes, it wouldn't continue to amplify the problem... 
---
People would have just gone to the faction they looked cool and it would have naturally balanced out. Instead you had people server jumping in a day or two because they heard "oh shit this server is 3:1? Bye." And then, even if those numbers were wrong... It slowly creates actual faction imbalances.
---
Don't leave Rattlgore, WE ARE THE RATTLEGANG
---
That's simply not true. I specifically looked up a server after a hiatus to join a balanced one. I went to Blackmoore in Cata/MoP, came back was quite lobsided, went to Defias Brotherhood and never looked back.
---
You probably just don't know how bad a lobsided server is. If you had played back then or on n.ostalrius or l h , you would know how bad the corpse runs were in Dire Maul.
---
A little anecdote. Alliance started using invis pots to run into the closest DM:E dungeon entrance to die there once to then be able to run into DM:N, because running from DM entrance to DM:N meant 8-15 corpse runs.
---
A balanced server 55:45 or 50:50 means you can just meet up with your dungeon group and run into a dungeon with 5 people in a cohesive battlegroup. A 80:20 server means, you meet up with your dungeon group and you still have 20 people waiting for you in BRM/ Dire Maul.
---
Sure, I'm a hunter too. Maybe I should have said 'discourage' rather than 'prevent'.
---
Making water for warriors was just a joke. Nobody is really talking about that and no sane person would expect a mage to make water for a warrior.
---
The cost of the FP or 100G, seems like an easy choice
---
I don’t think it would work. I mean, who would pick a server where you can’t pick the race/class you want to play? You’d just pick another server and you’d have the same exact problem imo
---
I didn't say I approve and I called it a scam, which it definitely is. I just don't have a lot of sympathy for someone that gets caught by it.
---
I hate to ask this. But how does this affect druid melee tables? I hear that druids don't have to worry about glancing blows because of near 100% yellow damage. But also are capped at 300 weapon skill and a 9% hit cap.
---
And I guess if I'm tanking I should probably be focusing on the opposite table anyway. But this is great info, thank you!
---
&gt;ur fukin stupid and lazy and bad because u dont play like i do
---
aight
---
It's just that the benefits of kiting when doing small scale shit are so negligible that I'd rather not put in the effort. My downtime is practically 0 as it is.
---
I honestly wouldnt know because it was never addressed until now. The only thing that was said was getting the shot rotation down, which is not rocket science and I felt I was doing pretty well. Apparently not. Not taking it personally, just legitimately confused.
---
Nothing stops him from using his ne mount.
---
The kind that doesn’t care how “everything hurt you” because daddy wasn’t home to teach you how to deal with life.
---
my main point was that you're assertion "people don't camp portals as much on balanced servers" is 100% untrue
---
A week ago before the Server selection layout changed you could sort by population. Highest pop went to top (Faerlina&gt;Herod&gt;Whitemane&gt;Benediction).
---
Since then they've changed it (for the worse).
---
I chose benediction because it was the highest pop, equal faction server (and it is).
---
Maybe he sells gold. Gold sells for a lot rn
---
I'm a priest, so I might be able to sneak into one as a healer!
---
Confirmed. It is not a new one.
---
Also, most importantly, the layout in IF is more efficient than anywhere else. It's a circular layout that you can easily access everything, AH,bank, and mail are right next to each other as well as the local inn for hearthing. The forge is also an anvil so you can make everything at once and is easily accessed.
---
You have to look on the main game screen and not the minimap when you gather.  Plus those are possible spawns.   Also stop intatweeting on the facegrams when you play.  Enjoy the game.
---
"Mouseover" means that when your cursor is hovering over a unit or a unit frame (either a player in the world, or a healthbar in your party frames), the spell will be cast on that person even if you don't click on them to target them first.
---
This macro does that.
---
Don’t bother switching to resto if you want to heal honestly. In the early tiers a Heart of the Wild Druid will perform better than a deep Resto Druid. Plus you will have the option to do whatever you want in the game. You can off tank, power shift feral dps and of course healing. In later tiers deep resto becomes better for healing but until then enjoy being a Jack of all Trades!
---
Came across a 33 mage AoE farming yesterday at a spot where named characters spawn for a quest around a bunch of other NPCs. Normally I’m not angry with people pulling mobs away from the named characters but this guy kept pulling EVERYTHING to the point where there was a crowd of people yelling at him to not take the quest characters. SMH to the extreme at the rudeness of some people in this game
---
I cant believe No one mentioned it, but god damnit i Will.. Elemental shaman is an amazing ranged dps.. Yeah yeah they have a harder time in raids. But dungeons, farming and leveling and not to mention Pvp.. Cant go wrong with the shaman
---
1st commandant:  Thou shalt clear thine trash.
---
Serious hardcore pvpers always rolled alliance because the shorter BG queues made the R13/14 grind more bearable.
---
And the way you steamroll people is by popping a FAP to get close and a Sapper to AOE. The only class that can somewhat get by without them is mage and even then they are a massive difference.
---
Don’t stock up and prepare to get farmed hardcore by those who did.
---
Yeah I think that's actually a good idea
---
Is it too late to start playing ??
---
BM is what most people level as but as MM with scatter shot you should have it even easier.
---
I think awareness is key. I don't tend to start engagements so when I have a feeling im going to be attacked or an alliance is in an area while I'm killing mobs I'll go ahead and drop a freezing trap at my feet just as a precaution. Multiple times this has caught rogues and warriors charging in at me. If they are super higher level i'll use the trap to escape or if I can take them I use the trap to reset the fight where I have the range advantage. If you aren't in that postion I believe FD/traps were fixed a while back. To get away use wingclip and Intimidation/ scatter shot to stun the attacker. Remember not to dot the attacker first and pull your pet off so you don't break the scatter shot. Switch to cheetah if you can to get more distance and strafe so that you can fire off a concussive shot while still getting more distance. At this point you just kite the enemy until they are dead. I feel frost traps are often overlooked for freezing traps. Many times I have been able to kite melee classes in a circle through a frost trap. Other notes are don't forget to keep up hunters mark to keep rogues from stealthing and flare on the ground and also viper sting is your best friend against casters.
---
Meanwhile on my server, certain things are crazy expensive because few people are no-living to 60 and so arcanite is 70g right now each.
---
I am hopin Dire Maul E jump runs bring the price down a bit.
---
I'm a Warlock.
---
My mount will always be cooler than yours. Your horse is boring/dead/not even a real horse; mine has fucking fire.
---
It has something to do with Hellfire Peninsula in so far as it is a scrapped prototype of a zone that resembles what eventually became Hellfire Peninsula.
---
Pve server. I don't seem streamers. And have no problem finding groups. 75% ally
---
No flight paths or hearthing either, dont be a cheater.
---
Since I don't like overly imbalances battle at all, neither losing nor winning, I signed up for PvE this time. And am having much more fun on playing Ally than in 2004. I still like world PvP, I just don't like 10vs1s every day while being at the 1 side. Never have, never will. Those who say they do are probably lying.
---
But your and my experiences are purely anecdotal. Those do not take away the fact that heavily imbalanced realms take the fun of world PvP away for many people.
---
Oh wow!
---
Lol.
---
You can even add a middle mouse line to apply poison to throwing weapons.
---
Nope. A lot of people aren't even 60 yet and lots of people are still moving servers, making alts/different classes, etc
---
You should always have pet passive or pet follow in your Feign Death macro. Otherwise, if your pet has an auto attack queued up and it hits right after you FD, you'll be pulled back in to combat.
---
There’s nothing like being a healer, who can sneak past mobs, and if things go wrong who can taunt and deal with a boss a few seconds for a team to finish the job...
---
Where are these lashers that get soloed?
---
Ah gotcha. Ty.
---
Lol adult diapers wtf
---
Pagle is PvE, East coast
---
And last I looked was still offerning free transfers to windseeker, although that might be over now.
---
Awesome job man, another great one. What program do you use to edit?
---
Maybe I won’t
---
Not from a Jedi...
---
Universal loot rules lmao it's fuckin MS&gt;OS brother, next time band of accuria drops and I'm with you though I'll remember to roll with you
---
u/CelosPOE, did you guys run the Dire Maul gauntlet as alliance when people were seriously ranking? 
---
N.ostalrius was heavily horde side, LH as well. Only ND was alliance heavy.
---
First off, it sounds like that was a pretty shitty guild to be in.
---
You aren't level 60, aren't geared, and in leveling spec.
---
Instead of understanding this they kick you? That's lame
---
MM is alot Better than BM for dungeons and raids for sure but TBH running running pre raid dungeons you should be totally fine as BM. 
---
My advice is fuck that guild and Don't let it get to you,
---
Practice MM now that you're nearing 60 in pugs, and look up videos or guides on MM talent builds, skills, and rotations for maximising DPS. You will be fine
---
Idk what I just watched but I like it
---
I actually prefer being on underdog side. I joined my friends as horde on Herod and was pissed when I found out we were dominant.
---
Damn that sucks
---
I wanted to experience the other half of the game so I rolled horde this time; it’s a shame because I really want an ally alt on another PvP server but now I’m not sure which server is even worth rolling on.
---
thats the hunter weapon from stratholme, so rare!
---
&gt; Tanking is just a constant swing between the emotions of feeling like the king, and also hating everyone, everything, and yourself.
---
so excited for 60!
---
It is relatively soloable, but there are dungeons that you will HAVE to run to progress the story. Fortunately, thanks to daily low level roulettes, etc., there's always players going through these dungeons. It's why every person almost always gets Thousand Maws of Totorak from their daily roulette. 
---
You have to buy the base game and the expansion, but I believe that only comes out to $60 and then the $15 monthly. Any time a new expansion is released (normally every 2-3 years) then you have to pay another $60 for the expansion, but in my opinion it's well worth it for the time invested. I've been playing FFXIV for nearly six years now and I still love it. I plan on going back and playing Shadowbringers once I get tired of Classic.
---
I don't see it as a red flag.  Tanking just isn't for everyone.
---
Another reason to introduce a new pvp system
---
And then we just get daily reddit threads requesting friend invites.
---
Design wise, Alliance are the adventurers going from a civilized bastion in to the wild frontier and things like goblins are supposed to be exotic and questionable...Horde *is* the wild frontier, and will reach out to anything and everything helpful.  So Alliance having to travel far away to adventure is all a part of the experience package.
---
Sure, it's a pain...but hey, you guys have an out of the way tram that takes the place of a short 5s flight path, that makes up for it, right?
---
Its a fair cop.
---
That annoys warriors too.
---
Count to 5 before you open up, and if your tank cant taunt (paladin, silence mechanic in fight) then wait a bit longer.
---
as ppl said tagging is a problem.So you start to skin devilsaur ,boom ally hunter interrupts you .You can pvp him ,kill him and get the skin for yourselves.But what can you do about your faction standing around doing nothing but waiting to skin?
---
You cant interrupt them..can't do shit.And they are helping ally giving him information where you are ,interrupting CC ,healing with Polymorph and so much more griefing ways
---
I expected Moonfire **spam**.
---
I see. Agree to disagree I guess
---
[His laugh at the end of the video.](https://youtu.be/0yNIvxeuP34?t=0m4s)
---
😂👌🏻
---
3 mobs and up and its snowstorm time!
---
Yeah, so were Arenas, didn't come out til BC
---
This honestly makes me sick. Wish I could sit down with everyone who was there and explain to them that this kind of behaviour is what eventually breaks will of even the most motivated players. It's not even PvP it's ruining your own server. But Alliance would have done the same were it them dominating. It really is on Blizzard hands they absolutely need to force the balance somehow. I'm so pissed of right now.
---
I would say at least every other day, those are just a few examples frequency obviously vary from player to player or server to server I don't mind it much but people pushing their nostalgia of how they remember the game being played as opposed to how it's being played now does get annoying at times.
---
i like gaming without motion sickness
---
thats a joke but seriously they bounce too damn much. the wolf has a smooth animation. i played horde from TBC-Legion and could never ride the raptors because of the bounce. always the AV wolf or the ZG tiger
---
That's been a topic of debate for about 15 years...
---
Oh riiight.. so that's the addon I need to get rid of if I wanna subterfuge my spec... :D
---
So I trained my tailoring to 260 and all guides say to craft runecloth bags and runecloth gloves. I've tried for hours to buy the patterns but I'm not getting it. Are there any alternatives that I can craft to level my tailoring up to 300 that don't cost that much?
---
Dividing stats and bonuses out against eachother put the maul and warden staff to less than .95% difference of each other.   I would not remotely classify that as undeniably better and most definitely not 300-500g better than a farmable item.
---
Items value has already begun crashing and will continue to fall due to this.  There is no tangible gains from swapping one to the other in these differences of percentiles.  In raids the extra 2 points of defense will account to just a few swings being dodged versus not if comparing across the aisle.
---
My advice to the OP is to sell it as fast as possible at a moving price as its value will continue to fall.
---
I came from a PVP server, this time I went PVE and it has made me have a much better time. I'm not into getting ganked or doing the ganking. Just want to get on, do my thing, and enjoy myself. I've had some really awesome experiences questing alongside Alliance.
---
The method I posted is easy and takes 45 seconds to teleport you to the entrance of the reset dungeon. Way easier than what you're doing. Try it out
---
If you use bagnon just hover over the bags at the top of the frame.  it'll highlight which slots that bag is for.
---
Dumb question, but is there a definitive record somewhere from Blizzard of what the balance is on Herod or any server? I'm curious to see.
---
I'm also on Herod, as Alli. Thinking of transferring to an Alliance-heavy server soon. Although it may make the problems worse for everyone., I just want to feel on top for once!
---
....kidding. I'm not transferring.
---
 I dont give a shit if you nolifed to 60 and grinded instances 0-24, good job now you can go out a little and wait there untill the next patch.
---
You're joking, right? Look at the model/texture quality of the other races' mounts compared to horses. Nightsabres are ugly as fuck. The white epic horse mount is one of the best looking mounts in the game.
---
It looks like they give you one month free with the complete edition, which includes both expansions.
---
Might give it a shot just for something new.
---
then I don't see what the whole problem is.
---
As you said, one can buy from and support blizzard financially and still not support their action.
---
Besides, Blizzard did not violate free speech. Free speech is only protected in public and not to be punished by the government. If you breach a contract or use someone's elses privately owned platform for your speech, they are free to cancel that speech as they see fit. It is their platform after all, their property.
---
Enjoy the massive faction imbalance!
---
Which is funny, because holy pallys far outweigh any benefit horde get from racials, as least as far as organized BGs go.
---
Im Horde on Heartseeker and its at least 3/1 for Alliance. Its just not fun getting camp and dying 3-4 times before getting into BRD or BRS. You can be sure that when Im mining on lower level zone I dont mind wasting an hour or two just killing lower level just for the fun or ruining their day. I feel cheap doing it but thats what happen when you have been bullied since level 20.
---
If Blackmoore was like how Herod is today, and the solution was to re-roll or suck it up, then what you are experiencing is the experience you signed up for. Currently I am level 59 Alliance on Herod. I have done my fair share of corpse runs into instances. So what?
---
Here's where I posted most of my macro's before
---

Need to step your name game up
---
That’s what she said
---
Keep in mind I've never played Retail WoW, only Classic, but I've played FFXIV for nearly 6 years now and have a lot of experience with the game. 
---
As far as I can tell, it's basically a better version of Retail WoW. It does a better job tying old zones to newer content through open world hunts, etc, and it's got a main story that's extremely character focused and is a large part of the game. There are also extremely long questlines that are just for fun and don't really impact the main storyline but still have a lot of lore both throughout the franchise and the game world itself, so if you enjoy questing and lore there's a ton of options. 
---
Almost all of the dungeons, especially early on, are from older renditions of the game series. There are few franchises with as historic a past as Final Fantasy, so seeing some of these zones/fights/bosses etc. remastered is absolutely amazing if you're a long time fan of the Final Fantasy Series. Obviously, the staples of the games are there, such as Cid, Biggs, Wedge, but even enemies are brought into new dungeons/raids, such as Halicarnassus. 
---
When you make a character, you can play as any class on that character, which is awesome. It's through the use of what's called a "soulstone", and each class can only have one weapon, which does limit you in your choices a little. I haven't played since Shadowbringers dropped, but historically ALL classes have been viable at all levels of content. Even back in the day when DRG was known as "loldrg", I was a DRG main and was normally topping DPS charts (at least for my class). It really comes down to player skill. Some classes will do inherently more damage (i.e., SAM and BLM) but they offer little to no utility, so often times a mix of classes are desired, but you can clear content with anything you want to play. 
---
If you're not interested in end-game raiding, but want to get end-game gear, they release 24 man dungeons as "catch-up" gear normally \~50-75% of the way through a raid tier cycle. These 24 mans have a lockout on loot just like raids, but you can run them as many times as you want. Hunts are also used to get end-game loot, but hunting requires a pretty large time investment over a longer period of time. so as a newer player you probably won't have time for that. 
---
Finally, the icing that tops the cake. The crafting/housing in FFXIV is absolutely amazing, and is quite literally the reason I still play the game. The housing wards are amazing, and really give players a long term goal that can require a massive investment. There are thousands of options for your house, and no two houses will ever be alike, which is part of what makes it such an interesting part of the game. And they're constantly releasing new housing items/designs, so any dedicated house owners are always kept engaged. 
---
I know this ended up being pretty massive, but if you're looking for a game to play after Classic, I'd highly recommend FFXIV. I'm also planning on going back to FFXIV when I get burnt out on Classic. If you're looking for good realms, Gilgamesh has always been the best raiding realm in NA due to the presence of some top tier guilds, and there are similar realms in both EU and JPN that provide extremely competitive raid environments. If Gilgamesh is full/locked (and it nearly always is) then I've always heard Balmung is a strong choice, although I don't know much about it's population, so character creation may be limited. You can join a cross-server static and then find a guild on your Server too, as a third option.
---
that's not how it works dude
---
Sadly not without changing the code of the add-on, it hasn't been updated in too long, it's probably abandoned. Someone else recommended using the addon Bartender and moving things around to match this UI, I haven't had the spare time (and remembering to do it when I do have spare time) to try it yet, but feel free to try it if you'd like!
---
People who post shit like this probably play mage or warrior or healers.
---
It's far from easy - doing a group the normal way requires someone who will actually tank and a healer. Getting the other DPS is easy enough but finding the other two is nigh on impossible when you got endless "LFM Warrior xx cleave" or "LF Healer cleave 50k/hr last spot" If you manage to find one (Druid bear is a great tank for normal runs) then you can't find the other.. and by that time people are AFK, they leave to do something else or simply cbfa any more.
---
Yes it is possible.. just like running 100m in sub 10 seconds is possible, doesn't mean everyone can do it. :)
---
Still just speculation. You don’t know what the servers are capped at and you don’t even know how many consecutive players are on retail right now. I would guess and say that Classic has more consecutive players. But my guess is as good as anyone’s.
---
Smorc on whitemane
---
They should have implemented that from the start. Then we'd only need 5-8 servers and they all be balanced and juicy fat.
---
To clarify, they were all outside bc it hadn’t opened yet. Not just to grief. The result is still pretty much the same though.
---
[About that...](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=184662/shield-of-vengeance)
---
A good tip I read on here is to /who 36 and it will show all the level 36’s and what zones they are in, can give you a good idea of zones you can go to.
---
Ah, the Morrowgrain farm. Possibly a worse grind than the one I did if you do it all on one character, although you can farm the items on a higher level character and mail them. It's only for Darnassus, though.
---
Battlestance doesnt get bonus threat, TC only hits 4 targets and eats your entire rage bar on a swap.
---
Honestly tab sunder + revenge on cd is better.
---
Yet I can't make a guild named "Atheist Soup Kitchen" because of it's anti-religious overtones...
---
There are DOZENS of us!
---
Some people are. Some people just like trolls and tauren.
---
That's a very artistic picture you've drawn
---
No one asked. Why did you write all this?
---
If nothing else, I’m calling bullshit on Benediction being 4th and “dead.” Incendius is always filled, it’s easy to find a group. So either Benediction isn’t as dead as you say or it’s not as high up on the population chain.
---
Yes. A lot of things about how they made this weird version of classic sucks for hunters.
---
This is my first time playing horde too. 
---
They made me kill a puppy in hillsbrad!
---
This is a subscription based game. My time is literally money.
---
This isn't true. There are several that are alliance dominated like Zalandar tribe and Faerlina.
---
What if the lock went afk on his flight and won't return for 5 minutes?  By not moving, you only potentially delay the whole thing even further.
---
orgrimmar fucking sucks and i cant fap to your women 
---
i also want to point out wow and most mmo's boil down basically to a race war
---
The total collective number of players on PVP realms is skewed heavily towards the horde. No matter how you decide to shuffle players around there are still more horde than alliance. You could create some perfectly balanced servers, but then all the rest would have no alliance.
---
This is not a server problem - it is a faction play problem. The only way to solve this problem is to convince players on the dominant faction to swap. GL.
---
I read that fury 2h was viable also. Is that true?
---
Not salty. You’re the one who felt the need to respond to it lol.
---
It actually speeds up the experience
---
Prowl worth getting while leveling? Already have dash/growl/bite/claw
---
You actually may need to do Bear-Human-Bear, if you want to get rid of roots while tanking.  
---
Or if you are fighting mage :)
---
I literally have a graduate degree in Economics and my tile at work is Economic Analyst, but ok lol. Sure guy.
---
Actually I made them when name reserves came out but thanks for being a debby downer. Can't a man celebrate being the last person to hit 60!?
---
The rings (Tarnished Elven Ring) and chest (Ogre Forged Hauberk) both drop from the tribute chest. The weapon (Barbarous Blade) drops from King Gordok which you have to kill during a tribute run. So you can get all of them by soloing DM tribute.
---
Great, love me some basic Barrens lion :-)
---
I read that 2h fury is a thing also. Is that a thing in vanilla?
---
What hunter spec would you suggest. And aren’t they squishy or does the pet take agro from you.
---
HORDE ARE SCUM
---
Yes it was dude before they changed the UI. If you sorted by pop the highest pop would go to the top. If you clicked it again, the highest pop would go to the bottom.
---
Maybe you've never built a UI before or have any MS Excel experience?
---
Mages are nowhere near top single target dps.
---
I guess you're right I haddent thought about it in that way!
---
Oh I couldn't confirm that at all. Everyone in this thread really wants them to be jobless losers or welfare leechers, but I think people are projecting there. People accuse them of that because those same people can understand a jobless or welfare leech position more, they potentially envision themselves becoming that. There's no chance of reddit losers becoming an old money European so they reject that idea quite vehemently. If that was the case &lt;APES&gt; would be better than them at WoW and have lucked out more in life. I think it's highly likely a few of them are probably quite wealthy yeah, European "rich" are something new money Americans just have a hard time fully understanding.

Controversial opinion here. I grabbed the staff with +mana and +health for kiting and raiding (when I’m out of mana or during drinking) since it’s the only weapon in classic with both. The bow will be easily replaced at 60 with better gear. I’m not sure which enchant I’ll put on it yet.
---
It also has a super slow weapon speed with high end damage for the rare occasion you need to raptor strike.
---
Why do some people use energy tick addons? Do they give any advantage?
---
Its a pretty well edited Nixxiom video. I recommend watching it (the purging of Arthas - Nixxiom)
---
Hmm...let's see here...ah yes here it is....&lt;Cruise Missile Butt Practice&gt;
---
In retail Bear has been resolved for years.
---
Before classic released, a bunch of people were thinking of 1.1 bears and bringing out the old stigma's, by the end of beta it was almost universally agreed that Bears are great for 5 mans.
---
Now, the zerg is learning about bears in raids also.  Obviously they aren't the best in every situation,  But it's nice to see  community lose the warriors only in every situation mentatlity.
---
you are so painfully retarded it hurts
---
How old are you people to think these names are funny?  Grow up.
---
Any my point is that this has always been the case and to expect something different foolish. The resolution for this is the same as it always has been. Re-roll. Tell your friends when and where you are moving and start leveling.
---
true, i guess, but i haven't used throwing weapons since before i got access to poisons lol.
---
HORDE ARE SCUM OF THE EARTH, THEY ARE UNABLE TO 1V1 AND HAVE NO HONOR. ITS EITHER 1V5 OR BODY CAMPED BY A HORDE SCUM 10 LVLS HIGHER. I HAVE ALL OF YOU WRITTEN DOWN AND I WILL END YOU.
---
I always set my hearth to locations I'm running.   Right now hearth is in Camp Mojache, even though I may be farming in Winterspring.  It allows me to farm even longer, while the rest of the chucklefucks spend 30 minutes getting there.
---
&gt; I will wear green "of the Eagle" and "of the Owl" plate until I can get my blues.

But the best healing blues are mostly cloth/leather items with a sprinkling of lucky mail.

spam r1 wing clip? doesnt it cost like 25 mana?

Try
---
/castsequence Blood Fury, Blade Flurry
---
Not if the fury warrior has a brain, watches threat and doesn't heroic strike.
---
Fury warriors can almost always push for more dps, but its flying towards the sun on waxen wings. You have to use that squishy thing in your headbone.
---
Isn't that every server?
---
No it’s a company with a policy to not get political that a community member broke and got punished for. Resulting in a community of justice warriors attacking blizzard so it makes them feel better about their inability to do anything productive with their lives. Resulting in nothing more than inconvenience for the uninvolved people trying to play a game to de stress after work.
---
There is plenty of content. I am 60. I don’t feel we lack content. I am playing WoW more casually than 15 years ago. But I am still putting in a lot of hours (60 main and 49 alt). There is so much to do. 
---
First, I plan to play multiple alts. I might do what I did in vanilla and slowly level every class to 60. And then gear them out. Eventually this means running farm raids on them. 
---
Second, world pvp can be fun without the honor system. I still remember the days I spent in STV and Hillsbrad in the early days of vanilla fighting other horde 60s in these zones (especially hillsbrad, which was the de facto spot for level 60 pvp). 
---
Third, leveling professions take time. I still have to drop gnomish engineering and pick up goblin engineering. But I am pushing that for after I get my epic warlock mount this weekend (robes of the void and alt gear made me a little broke). And then there is leveling professions for my alt and future alts. 
---
Fourth, I just need gold. Farming money is fun. Not if you do it 4 hours a day. But spending a little time just solo farming while watching tv can be fun. But I like grindy games (lineage 2, bdo, asheron’s call, etc), so grinding is something I don’t mind at all. 
---
I get you want more content. But zooming through content will kill classic. My vanilla guild never did MC once we were in Naxx. Heck, we even stopped BWL other than mostly alt runs. Yes, we occasionally did alt runs of MC, but it wasn’t regular. Once ZG, BWL, AQ, and Naxx come out, MC becomes irrelevant. Even casuals will skip it since raid guilds can carry a few newbies and get them geared in Naxx. 
---
I get not everyone agrees with me. And not everyone shares the same goals. I would love to see BGs our early. But I really hope they release content slowly. And if BGs are tied to BWL, I don’t want BGs out this year. Why? I want a slow release of content so classic lives for a couple of years before classic plus or TBC becomes real points of discussion. In the future, we will need more content. But let’s not rush to that day, especially since the decisions made then could make a lot of us who like classic quit.
---
 such a wasted oportunity smh :( and 30 hitsplats aswell
---
If you can find a healer, 2-man Dire Maul jump runs are lucrative as well.
---
Ofc I need that sweet experience points
---
At least with a summoning stone you require one less  person for that summons.
---
I am Horde. 
---
When i was a child I was introduced to the Warcraft Universe through Warcraft III: Reigns of Chaos and Frozen Throne. Durring my time with that game i came to learn that the Horde simply had cooler more level headed heros. Thrall, Cairne, Rexxar and Meisha. These characters were accepting of one another and tried to do their best to work alongside and with each other. We even see durring the founding of Durotar that the horde tried to establish a peaceful relationship with the Humans of Theramore. Until admiral Proudmore came along and tried to wipe them out despite all evidence pointibg towards the horde trying to work things out peacefully. 
---
Furthermore, the alliance champions that you control later on become villains. IE Arthas.
---
Garithos was a short shighted racist.
---
Night elves are cool i guess.
---
Point for point, 4% damage is going to perform better over time than 3% crit when comparing the two talents. However, if you favor the higher chance to crit and the difference this could make, then I would spec into Ferocity. If you favor more consistent damage (and more overall damage in the long run) then I would spec into Unleashed Fury. I think in PvP, the additional crit is likely more desired for the chance to swing the battle in your favor.
---
I think Improved Mend Pet is fairly meh but I don't feel strongly about that. If you feel you'll stop and channel Mend Pet to remove debuffs then maybe it is a good fit for you. If you're doing Imp Mend Pet, I'd either do 2/2 or 0/2. I don't think 1/2 is worth it (only 15% chance).
---
I think that Bestial Swiftness will be nice in open world and battlegrounds. You'll have dash/dive active 50% of the time, but the other half of the time it will be nice to have a fast moving pet.
---
I would potentially move 3/3 from Thick Hide and go 2/2 in Improved Revive Pet (if you are relying on your pet, best to be able to get them back into action with ease) and then 1 in Bestial Swiftness. Just my 2 cents.

I was in the same place as you and couldn't decide what I wanted to do. I respecced to the hotw/NS build, so I could tank/dps/heal anything (assuming you have a feral set and a healing set of gear) in my level range. Best decision I have made yet. I have a new desire to finish this grind to 60 after losing it for a couple weeks to level a rogue.
---
In my 15 years of playing on a pvp server, and warmode, i have learned one thing. 99.9% of people in pvp, only like to pvp when they are almost certain they will win the engagement. This is why you see solo players ignoring each other, until one side acquires more people in the area. After that, its open season.
---
Why do you post this every day?
---
Or in the instances I've been involved (i.e. getting murdered by level 40+ Horde in Redridge on my 21 Priest): "Red is dead, until someone of equal or higher level comes along. Then I'm just here sight-seeing."
---
That's the one in Feralas, right?  I believe swimming is actually faster than taking the boat
---
Maybe you should tank instead of complaining to others they’re not playing the way you want them to.
---
Yea guys grow up gah lee
---
Every time I join a pug it's like this. I'm always the first one there, just sitting inside the instance making stacks of mage water while I wait for everyone else to do god knows what before they decide to finally get there.
---
I'm not sure I agree 100% with what you're saying, but even if it is broadly true it's not as important as the perception.
---
Fury warriors are not the highest aoe dps in the game, theyre very specialized into single target unless slamspec.
---
Exactly. And if we're aware of what's going on we can always ice block.
---
I struggled with this for a long time and the best solution I came up with - roll of Druid. It’s so nice being able to switch play styles throughout the experience and makes the grind to 60 so much more dynamic
---
The thing with fury is that you need a good gear to really do the things in pvp. I often pvpd as fury during vanilla (bwl/aq geared) and it worked becasue you still have high dmg.
---
Sure mages is even harder to kill but everything else is just fun. Deathwish makes pvp as fury the shit and also enrage since you often get critted in pvp.
---
So dont be afraid to pvp as fury. U just have to be more awake with pummel, fear, trinkets so on since you cant rely on MS debuff.
---
I mostly just think people are lil bitches. I'd enjoy rolling alliance on Herod.
---
So much cancer in one video ;~;
---
Shadow priest get same problem.
---
why did you v.redd.it this?  link to your youtube channel yo!
---
I'm leveling a warrior, almost 54. I plan to respec to protection at 60 but would rather stay a DPS spec at least while I'm solo grinding. I'm 31/10/3 right now for spec. Would I be better off with Fury? I really like 2handers, is 2h fury a thing?
---
yep everyone is quitting, game closing soon
---
🤔 thank you for that input bro.
---
Aren't you inherently part of the problem then? Instead of giving it any chance to balance out you left and worsened the imbalance. I played on a horde underdog server day 1 of vanilla against two of the biggest PVP guilds that existed at the time, DIE and Serenity Now. We made do. Was it frustrating at times? Sure, but that was part of the fun of a pvp server. If you don't want to get ganked, you have an option, roll on a pve server. I'm actually disappointed that I'm not in the underdog faction on our server, I'd rather have the tough odds. The game is not unplayable, that's just silly.
---
Learn to play mage. You should aoe as much as possible.

It's very close.  If you miss the boat, it is definitely faster to just swim rather than wait for it to come back.  I had to afk for a minute so I was happy to ride the boat over.  Definitely a long boat ride.

I bent down the other day in stormwind to put out a cigarette and found 2g... I would give the 1.8g back to Alexi, he needs it more than me. Also is there anything left to buy after your epic mount? I'm at like 1,300g and only level 54.

Also ally on Noggenfogger.

[BRD](https://i.imgur.com/ihcUHD9.png) and [BRS](https://i.imgur.com/SJnBTgW.png) are pretty camped. Unless you're playing at off-peak hours you usually have to corpse run a couple of times to get into those dungeons.

Awesome, thanks for the feedback, this is definitely helpful! Happy hunting out there!

Not for 49 Twink pvp.

That too :)

warlocks are also super broken in PVP so there is that

Imma be honest here.
---
I'm thinking about moving but I logged on today at 16:00 and there were 4 bank alts in Storwind AH. That's as many people as have passed me by in 15 minutes of fishing in Dustwallow Marsh on Zandalar Tribe.
---
The trade and general channels were dead. I'm not one to be obsessing over population but I don't wanna log on during off peak hours and have no interaction with others.
---
I'll try again in an hour and see how that goes.
---

Dont pay more than 200-300g.
---
Drop rate is insanely high

That's very normal.

Lol i responded to your salty ass comment that had very little to do with the post but okay whatever you say buddy.
---
As you can see in this [1.1.2 map](https://wow.tools/maps/Azeroth/14/3/-94.063/72.500), here's where Old Outlands existed, you can see it west of STV. However in [1.12](https://wow.tools/maps/Azeroth/23/3/-56.188/20.625) it does not exist anymore. Not sure when it was cut out exactly, but it was before the time Classic takes places.
---
Sadly the map viewer doesn't support 1.13, apparently the way the map files work in Classic is a little funky and complicated
---
I’m one of those “vanilla experience” guys—the whole reason I rolled a warrior was for the nostalgia. 
---
But at the same time I go against that grain and use some addons that I didn’t back then because some things are just better that way. Kind of the best of both worlds. So just do whatever works for you 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Softsuckhole is foul
---
Ive been laughing at this for hours, thank you
---
I'm guessing this was at hillsbrad farms. It's a classic
---
NO TBC.  Take TBC raids and squash them down to horizontal progress.  Classic + is the one true path
---
Druids will never chart top, but they can reliably Tank/Heal or Tank/DPS in the same spec. Top tier feral tank gear tends to be throwaway gear otherwise so it's easy to get gear, and in full prebis you are substantially beefier than a Prot warrior, and will always out threat them. 
---
After they gear up druids are still excellent on threat fights, and can easily flex into a healing role getting fed extra druid gear with weekly raids. It's a class with a lot of moving parts and needs to be practiced but has a lot of utility.
---
As the other person said “best in slot.”
---
It means it’s the (sometimes arguably) best item for your class/spec in that certain gear slot. 
---
Like an item may be BiS for resto shaman but not even close to good for an enhancement shaman.
---
mp5 is going to be the better option if u want some regen. in pvp, you are almst always going to be in combat making spirit one of the more useless stats for it.
---
Funny, I’m horde on whitemane and I’ve had the opposite experience
---
What ui shows the player's location through walls?
---
Well yes I agree it's common decency, I always ask and wait to see what they say. But as a priest, I can't aoe farm like mages do and gold is alot harder to come by than as a mage.
---
Warlocks are best for getting that slow-ass fifth man who forgot his hearth is on cooldown a 20-minute run from the nearest flight master.
---
Your laundry is piling up sir. Need me to come over and put the washer on the correct setting?
---
Presumably the same reason as they added sentry totem and firestones.
---
To be honest I was being deliberately provokative with this post, the general point I have to make is that feint is unecessary, many aggro dumps allow you to increase your DPS but feint doesn't because it costs energy, you can easily use all your energy and stay below the aggro of an equally geared tank.
---
Hence it's kind of pointless, just don't overaggro in the first place and you won't need the spell.
---
Oh, hey Faucet. Wish our guild hadn’t died. 🙁
---
That was actually a very good explanation, Thank you!

PvE servers are included in cross realm u cocky ass monkey lmao

---
&gt;I will never understand why people want to play the dominant faction on a skewed server. Don't people want to world PvP on a PvP server? I actually prefer being slightly outnumbered as there are more people to kill.  
---
You've clearly never played on one mate. I want 50/50 too. But when you are on the 30% (or worse on many servers since transfers opened) it is a terrible experience. Oh you wanted to actually play in the *world* of world of warcraft? Not today!  
---
I was doing 1-4 corpse runs to get into BRM on Skeram, which was 35% Alliance as of the WoWhead census post, but is way worse now as tons of people left. My options were earthfury (already horde dominated, likely to skew more that way), or Heartseeker (already alliance favored, likely to skew more that way). So we went to heart seeker. Now I'm on the 70-80% side. I'm basically playing on a PvE server, but at least I'm playing the game..  
---
I was getting killed by horde that many times *with nothing for them to gain*. I don't think most people realize how **terrible** phase 2 is going to be for this game. Imagine these servers when everyone is fighting tooth and nail to try to gain more honor than everyone else on their faction to rank up. Almost every single FP will be camped, you will have roaming deathball raids killing everything level 48+ that moves and camping them until they yield no honor, people a few levels below that will just be collateral damage too. Graveyards will be camped for those that spirit res to get away from camping. It will literally be unplayable.  
---
If phase 2 is a somewhat long phase I think classic risks dying, or at least many servers do. I don't even know if there is enough players left on some of these factions to even have enough to make a bracket 1, so even when BGs come out, they could potentially never have a GM or HWL.   
---
There have been private servers who tried to have the honor system come out before BGs, and even with just 54% on the most populated side, the other side got camped off the game. It's even happened on other servers with like 56% balance, just people doing it inbetween BG queues. If one side gets camped off the game, the server starts to die, as it's not fun for either side.
---
I love when people use acronyms in completely the wrong context.
---
That was the far worse retcon than what they did with him in Legion.

Just because it happened first doesn’t mean it was the better writing.
---
Gordok Chew Toy is a humanoid ear.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I am in a way, because on my previous server it wasn't THAT bad and I could've dealt with it, but I mainly transferred because of queues, not the H:A ratio.
---
I also dislike the "just roll on a PvE server" because as both me and OP outlined it's not so black and white that either you like PvP in all its forms including getting roflstomped whenever you log in or you play on PvE. You can like most aspects of it and tolerate ganking, it's after all part of it, but there are limits as well for when the ganking turns into "I can't play the game anymore".
---
I’m pretty confident all you need is 
---
/equip item name

Bad animations? Horse animations are great. The idle space bar animation is beautiful, and did you notice that the horse tilts its head a bit to the right when you backup so it sees where its going? Horses might be mundane, but they animate beautifully.

If you pull aggro it is 100% your fault, even if your tank is “bad”. Get a threat meter and Manage your threat in raids and it won’t be a problem.
---
&gt; you guys chose to make life a living hell for any Alliance player on that server.
---
I'd like to second this part specifically. 
---
Being outnumbered in wpvp meant that nearby horde would always jump into a fight while alliance would just walk on by because they knew they'd be wasting their time walking into a guaranteed gank. I remember hearing someone tell their friend: "We should gank those two horde guys there, cause if a third one shows up they're going to gank us for sure." - Advice that was reliably rang true anytime you were levelling and found yourself outnumbered by more than 2:1.
---
This situation only became truly intolerable any time that a number of people needed to share the same location for a long time. Every instance portal and quest zone with long grindy quests like shimmering flats was a nonstop gankfest because there would be 50 horde onscreen at all times. 
---
You cannot make an instance group without people dying en route.
---
You can't farm valuable resources because all the resources have upwards of 20 horde on them
---
Every named quest mob has a party of 5 horde waiting for respawn
---
If you're on a grindy quest that's being also pursued by a horde pug, you may as well just log off because you're going to get camped.
---
Not to mention that when I *did* take a direct fight, abilities like WoTF, tremor/grounding totem, and resilience make most encounters an uphill battle to begin with.
---
How do you know benediction is 4th? It probably only shows first because it's alphabetically first of the non-full servers
---
Base mana should just be the mana you have with zero gear on.
---
I play Horde on Incendius and Alliance on Blaumeux and I'm very happy with the balance on both these servers. My first character at launch was horde on Herod and the imbalance there was obvious. Alliance definitely holds their own in world PVP on Incendius in my experience.
---
Then don’t read it.
---
Wow does have a sound for that.  Pretty sure my warrior jingles while wearing mail.
---
Aaah... how are you not using the Bagnon add on yet?  :)
---
Congrats on the luck though... nice pull.
---
The problem is you wouldn’t be allowed to win.
---
Mother Smolderweb provides. It's an awesome server. Just the right amount of peeps.
---
Depends on your luck.  My guild has an officer with the ability to make one.  All of our warriors will be able to have it crafted for just the cost of the materials.  Which is nice because for the longest time, it was just this one dude in trade chat that would craft it for 200g and YOUR materials lol.
---
Fucking gammon...
---
BC sadly
---
Complete bullshit, Whitemane is balanced, will always be more horde than alliance on pvp servers but whitemane is balanced unlike herod
---
That's ElvUI.
---
Oh do you know how I can enable this by any chance?
---
Well dang, now I want a whole theme of characters based around Powerthirst. 
---
Shockolate for Shaman for sure. ^_^
---
Pretty sure it should be level 50 quests. Level 49 quests are gray.
---
thank you!
---
Horde is more fun, idc about racials. I want to play as a massive brutal green skin orc. Why would I want to play a human or mini human? Sounds boring
---
Stop spreading false hope.
---
Reveal your ingame username and server you coward and we will END YOU
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
It's like the dark iron dwarves to the horde, we know dwarf = bad and we don't care the color
---
i make no difference. Alliance players who do this are monkeys too.
---
The Improved Cleave talent is underwhelming because it only applies to the bonus damage from cleave. So you're spending three talent points to add 60 damage to a low priority ability. 
---
The main reason people spec 5 points in Shield Specialization is to get 1 point in Improved Shield Block. This 1 point is the single most effective talent point in the prot tree. It doubles the effectiveness of shield block (1 -&gt; 2 charges per use). Block takes precedent over crit and crushing blows on the attack table, so if have shield block up you can't be crit or crushed. Extra points in Improved Shield Block are not important, because the duration already matches the cooldown. 
---
Iron Will is also more of a PvP talent since when bosses stun you it's typically unavoidable. Improved Bloodrage, Last Stand, and Defiance are better options. 
---
Along the lines of what you're going for, this would be a casual dungeon tank + arms DPS build. If you wanted to lean a bit further "tank," you could drop the 5 points in cruelty to finish Defiance and get Improved Taunt if you really wanted to, but I'd personally take Improved Sunder over Improved Taunt. 
---
[](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033250013525100001-05-502301103)
---
Though as other people have mentioned, you could go pure-DPS talents and still tank dungeons just fine by putting on plate gear and a shield. 
---
If you wanted to raid, Fury is preferred over Arms for DPS warriors because Mortal Strike takes up limited space on Boss's allowed debuff slots.
---
2H Fury is a thing, but Arms is generally favored once you get MS at 40.
---
Once BGs come out, I'd imagine a lot of Horde getting frustrated with 2 hour long WSG queues. Perhaps queue times will shift the imbalances a bit.
---
Or if there was some way Blizz could figure out a way to make classic faction xfers work, could offer free faction changes to hugely imbalanced servers.
---
Hah yah, already read the posts from other submissions. Well let’s see if this is an actual bug or not x) provided them proof.
---
this seems like a really strange thing to do but congrats
---
Uh... maybe I'm understanding you wrong.  I'm wearing mail and there IS the sound of chain when I run... which is why I mute/don't wear headphones most of the time.  Its.  So.  Annoying!
---
Wow thanks! I'll try this when I get home!
---
What'd you say Chief?
---
Here you go https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295719/wow-classic-hallows-end-event-guide
---
I mean how many times does this shit need to be said:
---
*A 'medium' population server on Classic has more players than the highest population servers from Vanilla*
---
Faerlina, Herod, Whitemane...they are bursting at the seams with players, but **every** server is at least medium during primetime. That means **every** server is a true Vanilla experience.
---
I use this but drop winters chill and grab shatter. Way more burst!!
---
This mentality really annoys me because it makes it hard to distinguish what is simply not the best and what is _actually_ trash.
---
I don't kill the other faction because I'm on the dominate side, and I want them to still be there in phase 2 so I can rank off them. Everytime I see one of my faction killing them I tell them not to and explain why, most of them see my side and agree.
---
Bis comment right here.
---
I love that Azeroth Health Organization's acronym is basically a sneeze. AHO
---
I’ve moderated a sub in the past. There’s almost no reason to remove a post because it’s easily answered by google. 
---
If it gets traction, the community obviously had trouble with googling it. If it doesn’t, then it gets buried and no one sees it anyway. 
---
The only time it’s an issue is when it’s a repetitive comment that gets asked everyday, or by the same user.
---
It's a strange mishmash, I agree it could have been better.
---
The built in alt function is the biggest thing for me.  
---
Bagnon was legitimately one of, if not the first addon i got when i started 10+ years ago.  Its the one addon that i really cant play without.
---
I like where stv goes on on your table :)
---
Once you're in the late 40s/50s, throwing Power Infusion onto Warlocks in dungeons and then watching them take aggro is pretty funny.
---
Not exactly. It's a stand alone program that changes the shaders. It works with multiple games. And last I checked blizzard still allows it.
---
I expected a "Not even close baby" at 2:39 lmao
---
Great edit i give it a dank/10
---
You don't need a UI just turn on enemy nameplates, I think the range is like 15-20
---
The difference in kill time between using a carrion bird over an owl or bat will be around half a second. An owl or bat will technically be better in dungeons as well but, again, it's a tiny difference. Since it's a difference of only 2-3% in your own overall damage output, it's going to be a difference of less than 1% towards the overall group's damage output. If you care that much about min-maxing your dungeon dps output then you should be switching to a wolf for them anyways.
---
I guess, I have only had one gank attempt outside of Dire Maul so far despite walking past tons of horde.
---
more cringy than saying ROFL?
---
Pardon my ignorance, but what rep is this?  Argent Dawn?
---
Where my locks at? Rise up.
---
this guy surfing the market
---
Classic+ to me seems like the biggest waste. Especially if they open it up to voting. I could see classic+ with achievements and tons of other things, things that I don’t think ruin the game but imo don’t belong in classic.
---
Yeah i never have an issue holding aggro while they spam blizzard. As long as they have a decent 5 seconds to build rage. Tabbing like a MFer is sort if the fun part of tanking. I havent seen people blast a single target with blizz too often
---
Well dang, alright. That sucks. Guess i'll wait until p2 to decide if I wanna switch for real or not. My servers pretty balanced, so we'll see.
---
Ally been loving it. Has consistently met every requirement I was looking for in a realm and continues to do so.
---
Just be honest man, you would never do it because you want those ridiculous pvp racials working for you not against you.
---
Lol no we're really close and everything. I just have a weekend to golf and play video games. I told her that's all I was going to do since I don't really do either with other responsibilities. I also feel weird playing video games while she's just sitting there watching me
---
Why did you respec from arms to fury on the level where arms overtake fury? 
---
Anyway, you start out the fight by charging, you shouldn't really use berserker stance while leveling except to use abilities specific to the stance.
---
Hmm clear image or multi colored striped clearly phone taking a picture on monitor quality. Either way i was just messin with ya and i can see i got the other people who responded fired up hahaha
---
These posts are so insane like you have to be trolling. You seriously need anonymous internet approval to confirm this guy is in the wrong??? Yikes
---
For a guildmate? Yeah.
---
For a pug? No I am not going to gimp myself to benefit a competing (enemy) guild
---
I haven't found issues. Sometimes a healer will want to reserve a piece but most understand that druids need to raid heal too and there's a shortage of tanks
---
What about me and my blue collar?
---
Oof, that's rough.
---
It's way better now dude. It exists, but feels more fair. I had the same concerns at first too.
---
this guy RoLePLaYs
---
I had a Sentry Cloak drop for me on my Hunter last night. I know it’s BiS lvl 19 Twink Warrior, Rogue &amp; Hunter Back but 100s of gold? Really?
---
&gt; And if you think I'm worried about burning my bridges with a guild that legit stole the binding from me, Im not.
---
No, you should be worried about the server at large being like "That rogue is so selfish he would rather advance himself at the cost of an entire raid"
---
Pagle is a big server but the raiding community is still pretty small. Word would travel quick about the rogue who won bindings over the MT, just because "It's only a pug" - That is how you ensure you don't get invited to *any* pug in the future. Maybe your goals are more narrow - maybe this is the last pug you run on your rogue before you just do guild runs. But I would be surprised it you could successfully farm the BWL mats for TF after trashing your rep in Phase 1.
---
&gt; The white epic horse mount is one of the best looking mounts in the game.
---
It's not even in the game
---
Yeah I don’t know. I’ve been 60 for a few weeks. My profs were maxed before 60. I even did the enchanting grind for my BiS trinket and I’m still not close to being all pre raid. I haven’t really touched quests yet either. 
---
Still plenty for me to do at 60 even though I am MC attuned and have a piece of tier gear.
---
horde has cooler races (orc and undead) but the ally races (night elf and human) just look better.
---
for the alliance.
---
The rules? No only thing against TOS is stating in chat your intent on loot then doing otherwise. “LFM MC free roll on all drops” then master looting bindings to your fury warrior without a roll. 
---
TOS and socially acceptable are two different things though. It’s widely excepted you are rolling on gear on the run that is for your spec you are in the run as. You are a healer. You only roll need on healer gear otherwise it’s offspec. If no one needs, ASK if it’s cool to take for offspec. If the group is cool with it THEN roll need. You may not be a Ninja but you are a scummy loot whore for rolling NEED on offspec items over main spec group mates.
---
This is the way it’s always been done until BFA and personal loot came out.
---
That's the same reason for 90+% of the people that roll horde. They want an advantage before the fight even begins.
---
Crazy right?! Thanks dude
---
What are we paying by the laser?
---
nah im not interested in leveling a mage or hunter
---
I am playing an Orc Fury Warrior.  I was running Axe of the Deep Woods main hand and Mirah's Song offhand.
---
Last night I got Deathbringer.  I believe because of the speed, that should be in my main hand replacing Axe of the Deep, so what should I try to get for my offhand?  Would it be crazy to use Deathbringer in my offhand (it seems crazy to me)?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
♫ Carry on my wayward son, there is purging that needs to be done. ♫
---
They want the benefit of being able to zone into dungeons and raids without issue and still be able to gank lowbees cuz they're scum. 
---
I play on a pretty balanced server, and I really enjoy the back and forth.
---
Great job making something as dull as SM Lib immeasurably entertaining to watch - the edits are spot on and just makes you giggle n smile.
---
What I do is if its your class book and you need trinket, you get priority. But if its epic Forors book, its free roll.
---
Imagine opening reddit on your desktop and pressing ctrl v to paste a picture, wont even need to grab your phone :) but i guess bfa players like you dont understand the concept of not having your phone in your hand 24/7
---
Is there anyway to do this for Undercity Reputation? Trying to get UD mount for my troll. At level 1 I walked to UD starting area and have done Trisftal, Silverpine, and about to do Hilsbrad. Not sure what other places give Undercity rep, but think I've only see people get to Revered.
---
i can form a group in like 5 minutes every time
---
I've completed each map but only 4 of the maps 100%. I can't tell if Darnassus is more annoying to travel to or play in Peggle.
---
Wow, TIL
---
You're stupid :)
---
There's a word for that: "best"
---
No transparency in metrics makes it difficult to make an informed decision
---
I don't know why anyone would trust Blizzard or this community to add new content to the game.
---
LFG: BEAR BLASTING
---
I leveled to 60 and then realised there were like 15 players online during prime time. It was just depressing. Haven't logged in on that char for a long time now.
---
So, I just bit the bullet and releveled to 60 on a high pop PvP server. Even though I hate PvP in WoW and think it is the most stupid thing ever. Finding people for dungeons is worth a lot.
---
I'll up the bounty to TEN gold to kill Defiasbandit twice.
---
Yeah fuck you Defiasbandit, spit on me again you cocksucker!!!
---
Hatefully,
---
Sower
---
It's such a nice looking sword, i use it on my retail transmogs all the time. Congrats!
---
You said you're a tank. So yeah, duh?
---
Inertia means it doesnt really work that way.
---
Mod quality rarely impacts how active the sub is. Most important thing is just getting the name.
---
lol
---
I love those too! Wish I could ride them, but the vendor fatshamed me and said I would break the delicate mechanisms if I tried. Damn my elf for being 7 feet tall.
---
So if you read the post and my comment it is stated that the debuff slot doesn't matter, his guild doesn't care. So saying it's a big no no is just stupid. Also flurry is good sure, but you lose sword spec and atleast partial 2h spec. Flurry dps increase doesnt out do, sword spec+2%dmg+ms higher dmg...
---
idk. I think I'd argue windfury and holy paladins are pretty similar in value they bring to raids. Infinite mana holy pallys is pretty nice tho, but then again so is that sweet sweet windfury proc. Raid comps are extremely different just because of these two things.
---
Maybe I’m not remembering properly, I don’t recall getting AD rep from mobs in Strat.  Then again, it’s been years...
---
DM:E would like to have a word with you.
---
White hits.
---
PvP titles weren't even real titles either. They were more like saying what your rank was since you couldn't change them manually or hide it. I guess rather that they aren't like they were for BC onwards
---
Damn lip piercing high schoolers.
---
Whats really amazing is how many huntards dont know what FD is. Or not having your pet on aggressive or auto taunting everything. Also dont open with multi shot.
---
I dont understand why your so offended by what i said. It was a general comment and wasnt a personal attack. Hey maybe youre one of the good ones. Youre probably not though considering how salty my comment made you. You must have been booted and black listed a lot with zero awareness that you suck and now you just blame the tank.
---
I love this... But... The crossroads inn is just a circle with a firepit in the center and some hammocks/beds on the sides...
---
[x
---
No Earth bind totem?
---
It works totally fine if you just practice it. I often like to do a super quick ice block as a debuff removal, and if you're planning on sitting in it longer you just don't mash it.
---
There aren't any glancing or crushing blows in PvP. The dodge, parry and block chances can be nullified by getting behind the target, which is why every melee PvPer runs around like a crazy person.
---
&gt; I just don't understand why they wont just allow the tranfers for the dominant faction on overpopulated realms.
---
Because this would require Blizzard to actually acknowledge that there is a huge faction balance issue. They will never do this.
---
You're telling me that the most popular [variant of the epic horse mount this one](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18778/swift-white-steed) isn't in the game?
---
Are you saying 2h with crap gear can't compete with fury with preraid/raid gear? Because then yes, duh...
---
That’s really impressive
---
Improved cleave is probably the worst talent in the warrior tree. The modifier only applies to the +damage on the cleave and not the actual, total damage. I would never pick this up.
---
Also, define "end game" tanking. You mean raids? Or 5mans? You're definitely going to want 5/5 in defiance and 1/5 in shield block if you're going to be tanking raid bosses. For your purposes I would go either 31/5/15 or 0/31/20.
---
Mmmmm waffles.
---
What a drama queen. "I'm concerned for other people's health" rofl.
---
It's a rare drop and with a 1% chance of dropping you could be looking at way over 300 kills and not get it.
---
The way this works is that you might even do over a 1000 runs and still not see it while a random Joey will go in for the first time and get it.
---
This is ABSOLUTELY wishful thinking because this is Blizzard we're talking about, but: 
---
* Open up paid transfers 
---
* Next to realm names, maintain live stats on faction % based on active accounts
---
* Don't allow transfers to realms where their faction make up the majority i.e., 60%+
---
I'd imagine people would be more willing to spend $25 on character transfers with a more informed decision on which server to transfer to based on faction balance. I have faith that some sort of equilibrium will start to form all while Bli$$ard rakes in $25/character.
---
Yeah but it's retarded, please join Fight Club and read some actual theorycrafting. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#) is the bis list for current phase, and you would literally *never* have 13 hit.
---
Better than the hunter hearthing home and the pet being infected with Corrupted Blood.
---
I mean yeah these are good points in it's favour, but these don't separate Ironforge from Stormwind which also has a forge and anvil right next to each other, a mailbox, AH, bank and inn right all in the same location, and easy access to any part of the city.
---
Shaman wolf form says hi too
---
I still have 2-3 hour queues on the server. We used to have 12 hour queues. Can’t get any worse in phase 2.
---
&gt; "immersion"
---
ehmmmershion
---
As a rogue I appreciate you.
---
You just have to be aware of your GCD, a lot of people mash because they don't know how to time the IB press until after your GCD has completed. StopCasting + IB will also not work if you've just recently (less than 1.5 seconds) used a different instant cast spell.
---
Better macro
---
&gt; -#showtooltip Freezing Trap (remove the dash, reddit formatting issue)
---
&gt;/stopattack
---
&gt;/pet passive
---
&gt; /pet follow
---
&gt; /cast [combat] Feign Death
---
&gt;/cast Freezing Trap
---
Shows frost trap, only casts FD if you are in combat, otherwise just casts freezing trap. Also, you listed frost trap, that's the slow. Freezing trap is the one you want for the FD PvP macro.
---
As an aside, other people have said this macro works for them, it works about 50% of the time for me. I still have some issues with it not casting freezing trap or immediately standing me back up, even when my hands are completely off the movement keys and right mouse button.
---
which one would that be?
---
Perfect, I just hit level 50. Any suggestions on undead mobs to farm?
---
what is the balance on incendius?
---
No it hasnt. It's always been free roll. Anyone who cried about loot was a whiny child and ignored and not reinvited to runs
---
SW does not have easy access to all parts of the city. The bridges make getting over to the trainers and forge area obnoxious. And the mage quarter is also out of the way.
---
SW is nice in that you can fish in it.
---
I for one think #nochanges is stupid, aslong as the changes are done properly. 
---
As blizzard allready ignores no changes and changes what they feel fit. 
---
But that was a feature during vanilla and everyone knew and loved? Well, it's a bug now and removed.
---
&gt; Also wtf "just to hear yourself talk", you're the one spouting your opinion as if that's the only truth?
---
It's obvious this has nothing to do with you, so why are you here? The point is everyone has an opinion; just learn when to not voice it. Like when you are talking about PvP server imbalance while playing on a PvE server. 
---
If people just want to relax and smell the roses, then isn't the solution to this obvious?
---
FlameShock + AutoAttack on that macro? Nice.
---
I havent said I was better, the point is the state of tanking in retail is not as it was in classic, you cant instant DPS and expect the tank to be able to hold aggro. 
---
You've missed the point entirely. Allow me to slow clap for you.
---
Not really, I mean you can't really except a group to automatically have a warlock in it. I'm all for you getting what you like extra gold and stuff, and warlocks are nice, but it seems a bit much to ask for a specific class to be in the group.
---
YIKES
---
Well, it's about 20gold now on my server, I guess there's not much interest.
---
I guess it could go up to 100+. I may have exaggerated a bit, I admit!
---
Oh yeah totally I'm not saying locks are useless, just that if you want 'the best' ranged class mage is a better choice and fits the description of 'the best' in more scenarios than the other ranged classes
---
Absolute edge case that doesn't nullify any of the positive aspects that every single player got to experience. 
---
So... NO
---
These are gold
---
They seem to be around 20g on my server too atm. I’d be very happy if they went to 100g
---
no he’s not. I tanked this last night. only have to kill the pylon elementals, then immol, then summon.
---
At level 20 I am!
---
How long are these bis?
---
Laziness doesn't strike me as an endearing quality in a tank.
---
The intense AOE action on one mob left will always crack me up.
---
So did the memoir at the end.
---
Wicker an buff also increases HP &amp; Mana Regen as well as stamina by 25% for 2 hours.
---
Best way to keep pet aggro? My pet has growl but whenever I use my combo the mob runs onto me and then i run back and that makes my pet run and not attack
---
if you want a challenge then do it undergeared anyways... no one said you had to bring a fully decked out character.
---
What a pussy. How about you try and fight?
---
... it's bridges as opposed to tunnels.
---
A game of soggy biscuit
---
I'm not even thinking about the zones with too much players. Given, that the only other solution would have been more servers, we'd literally be flooded with death servers already. Blizzard - simply put - was right.
---
Lordaeron is represented in WoW by Silverpine, Alterac Valley, and the Plaguelands.
---
I always thought SW included Redridge, Elwynn, Westfall, and Duskwood, so it feels just as big in my mind.
---
/join world
---
/leave world
---
"Fight the level ?? enemy! You'll certainly have a chance of success!" -an idiot
---
As others have said its not an unreasonable request, but lfg will take it sourly
---
As a lock, this is something of a red flag for me personally. I've got no problem summoning anyone anywhere, I'll even summon group members even if they're just a minute out. 
---
But when a tank has this requirement to even join a group, then it tells me his time is more valuable than mine. It's a reasonable enough price to pay for a tank, but with that first impression, my gut feeling would be the type to not check mana and pull, wipe and blame the healer and ragequit 
---
It's not a guarantee that's gonna happen, and I'm not saying that you're that type of person. But unless I were desperate I'd wait for a tank who'd be willing to walk and summon him anyway.
---
I was always arms in Vanilla, and so far in classic, and I just want to try something new.  The self healing in fury spec looks fun.  I'm all PvE, no PvP.
---
Tracking macro
---
&gt;/cast [nomod] Track Humanoids
---
&gt;/cast [mod:shift] Track Beasts
---
&gt;/cast [mod:alt] Track Hidden
---
&gt;/cast [mod:ctrl] Track Undead
---
&gt;/cast [mod:ctrl, mod:shift] Find Herbs
---
Change around the modifiers and tracking as you please.
---
Wait they have brake lights
---
Was I wrong about them being shit this whole time, my god
---
You think being ganked to hell and back again makes you better. WoW is a relatively low skill ceiling game that highly rewards time invested in grinding gear. This isn’t CS or even Overwatch where a high skill player can dominate several average players.
---
The longer time it takes you to get the your gear, the worse you’ll be. On average.
---
Yeah trash tanks will still exist but a large number of tanks don't want to tank because people don't understand that aggro is a thing in classic.
---
So if I did
---
26.4% Miss
---
6.5% Dodge 
---
6.5% Block
---
14% Parry
---
40% Glancing
---
93.4% of rolls would be accounted for?
---
Leaving 6.6% of rolls to be split between Hit &amp; Crit. So with a default Crit of 5%, I could expect
---
5% Crit
---
1.6% Hit (Normal Attacks - Non Crit)
---
So if I gained 2% Crit in this setup, I could Crit Cap and lose an effective .4% Crit?
---
Thanks for your help! 
---
Do you know exact value on blocks? They don't touch it in the blue post.
---
Pressing the macro will cancel your bearform and transform you into a bear again.
---
Yes if any hunters do any of that they're bad. I'm not offended by what you said you're just a dumbass and probably a bad tank judging by how assblasted hunters make you. Of course this sub refuses to believe there are bad tanks though.
---
And yes I am a good hunter, even got poached to my current guild. Not black listed and never have gotten booted but thanks to dickheads like you who can't tank and throw hissy fits I get refused from groups a lot just for my class.
---
Gotcha, Thanks for letting me know.
---
Except BiS means best-in-*slot*... Where is the specific item Im going to equip here?? 
---
He used it incorrectly so there is indeed something wrong.
---
Your toxic asshole RP is pretty on point. I think you'd have a good time!
---
the gold starts rolling in the higher levels you get. Just keep questing and doing dungeons and you should have near 100g if you dont spend it on the AH. 
---
to put it into perspective you should never farm gold at low levels and do the most efficient farm you know until 60 and then worry about gold. The farms are exponentially better every 10 levels.
---
Not on any server I’ve ever been on bud. It’s cool though you can keep on being a loot whore. Would you have this kind of mentality in a non PUG?
---
I play alliance on Herod. My main focus was Pvp. 90% of the time if I try to pvp in anyway it will end with me being camped by 4-6 horde spam humping my body. Two days ago I went to farm essence of water with my rogue buddy. There were 5 horde there, we had some fun skirmishes but we came out on top and soon as we started to get the advantage (we out geared them quite a bit so 2v5 wasn't much of a stretch) they literally brought 18 guildies who proceeded to chase us around the zone on their poverty mounts for the next 45 mins. This is the story of what happens if you try and pvp as an alliance on herod.
---
Where’s the bong?
---
So maybe fury is a more extreme case of what happens to arms warr? Weak alone but a beast with a healer to dispell and heal you?
---
In raid: Pool rage before pull, sunder first global to get insta 5 stacks then prio BT &gt; WW&gt; HS while HS queuing to make sure OH never misses. DW 30s before boss dies and reck on some bosses. Know consumables and when to use them.
---
Outside of raid: Don't play fury
---
Could you also teach me how to Paladin?
---
Dude, i've been trying to remember the guild I was in when I was a kid in vanilla for so long and couldn't think of it. Found them on this website. Plagueweavers on the realm Lethon. Even found someone who was in the guild. I'm gonna message him and see if he knows anyone else who was in it. Thanks for this link!!!
---
This does not fit the narrative he is pushing so it does not exist.
---
It seems to be no more than 60/40 but probably around 55-45
---
It's a free Greater Heal when shit gets heated. That plus Inner Focus can be the difference between wiping and not.
---
Never heard of this, I'm curious. Will check it out
---
I'm telling you it's not going to work. You're going to be in PvP, trying to finish a cast like poly, realize you're in deep shit, and be mashing ice block to queue it so it casts immediately afterwards.... and find yourself accidentally mashing it one too many times.
---
A YouTube video I watched by Kargoz says that the breakpoint is 1000 agi which seems ridiculously high. I trust his video though because his YouTube guide was amazing and he nailed all the other talent trees perfectly
---
How can you guarantee that enough players would actually transfer to balance the scales?
---
Trick of Treat!
---
You can use the wowhead filters to find quests that give Undercity or Horde rep.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/quests?filter=1;68;0](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests?filter=1;68;0) (for Undercity)
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/quests?filter=1;67;0](https://classic.wowhead.com/quests?filter=1;67;0) (for Horde)
---
It doesn't seem like it's possible for Undercity; the only repeatable quest is Runecloth at lvl 50.
---
Never buy any gear, ever, for any reason unless it's Lionheart helm.
---
If it's in a dungeon, farm it. If it's on the AH, fuck it and never touch it.
---
Once you get good weapons that'll last you until raid weapons then hit that shit with Crusader. Throw enchants on all your gear that'll last you a while.
---
Get your epic mount, you spend a long ass time getting places and running away in PVP is as essential as breathing.
---
WPL.
---
But I’m not sure of the accuracy of that info. In Vanilla, I got 2 bags in one UBRS run and I can’t recall any undead mobs in that instance.
---
Damn the guy replying to you made you look like a dumbass fr
---
I am literally Karl Marx. Here I can say a lot but without any proof a degree doesn't really help and tbh you should probably rethink your career choice then if you think that is what capitalism is all about.
---
I am great at typing...
---
It's more like classic good.  I don't play or think about BfA.
---
https://youtu.be/yyaXrKP5cPQ
---
Thats pretty legit. Except at the last boss put your pet behind the last pillar and not in front of it so the boss cant charge to it and Overseer wont start casting from far away. Also you dont have to attack with your pet after you whistle it back.
---
depends what talents you've got. basically spirit for priest is 4 spirit gives you 1 mp5. however that's not all you take into account. if you have a certain talent, forgot the name, you also get +healing 25% of your spirit. so that 4 spirit gives you 1 mp5 and +1 healing
---
Yeah people don't always see the Hearthglen defense as the turning point where Arthas completely lost his shit.
---
And if you played that mission on Hard mode, it made complete narrative sense.
---
Actually, a lot of Arthas's behaviour throughout the entire campaign makes perfect sense when you play in Hard mode.

Is there any information on block % and verified how it is determined?
---
Also, crit suppression is mentioned, is this actually in place?
---
Thanks!
---
It's likely for search hits
---
I can also feel the indignation when you do gank them 1v1 or zone out of ubrs with 9 to summon and wipe all the horde afking with the idea they are 100% safe.
---
All things being equal, my understanding is we want to focus on mp5 over spirit. This is because spirit mana regen is impacted by the 5 second rule while mp5 is not.
---
HOW DARE YOU SIR! OP IS NEVER WRONG!
---
Ik and he used flame shock instead of frost at first lol
---
. . .  How
---
Concussive shot when they’re running at you gives your pet a better chance to grab aggro back
---
Lmao you created a mass triggering
---
Wow that is a badass name, gratz
---
I wish people would just upload to youtube these imgur/reddit.io videos take mins to load even if it is just a few seconds long.
---
Sure, you can do all that, but you've already beaten the content. What's the point, so you can pull more DPS next time you effortlessly down the boss? The truth is, unless you're a tank, you could very likely AFK every boss your next trip through and your group will still clear.
---
This content was released when gear was in a much worse state. Those things were all necessary at this point in vanilla, but they are not needed at this point in vanilla unless you care about topping meters.
---
&gt; So as a result, a dual-wield's hit cap can be absurdly high compared to a 2-hander, and they may never get fully hit capped with gear. 
---
This is very interesting.
---
For PVP, get your abilities then max all resistances, use remained on stam and armor.
---
For PVE, get your abilities then max fire, stam and armor, followed by nature, shadow, frost, then arcane for MC/BWL/Ony and AQ/ZG.
---
I feel the point here is if you're a warrior and you can actually cleave, even as DPS you should be able to take some damage without crying about it.
---
If you can't, probably don't cleave.
---
As a tank, I'm not going to worry about getting mobs off another warrior, because if i taunt and the healer pulls aggro, he has to wait or I have to spend a ton of rage to get aggro back throwing everything off kilter. 
---
If you got plate, you're on your own mate.
---
Best route for sure. Good mages and good healers I always friend. In addition to my guildies it’s supper nice to have a list of healers (and mages) to ask to join your group.
---
As a rogue, let me just say this is the stupidest idea I've heard in a long time.  I would never lose a 1v1.  EVER.

I believe it was part of the initiative to reduce que times in servers.  Often in Vanilla, que times for BGs could be 2-5 hours, some times even more and they’re looking to reduce that.

He said he would not instate quarantine without proof of their claims, which obviously he now had.

Dude relax. It was a joke. You must really suck to be so offended

Sometimes the up/down doesn't work because it isn't based on fact or relevance, but on popularity.
---
It is not.  People don't run that weapon because the proc rate is extremely low.  It is a once every 10 minutes type of proc.  Definitely not worth building your profession around.

This is how you rogue.

This should be top comment. I instantly could say he's a dick by the way he writes in all caps.

Thanks mate. 👍😁

Female Orcs got that booty tho.

This is why we leave the smithing to the dwarves
---
And monks had an armor penalty anytime they went above 16 weight
---
I like the edit but wasn't the last one PVP? 
---
You didn't ask for opinions but do people watch PVE videos? I mean - I ran this dungeon 40 times last month lol
---
Flawless editing, even got some Reviewbrah in there. Keep it up!
---
So you've never been on a high population, top progression server, nd only been on normal realms, that's fine
---
I don't understand... you're playing an MMO in which one of the main objectives is to get the best equipment possible, but you're bored because you don't want to do that?  Go play something else?
---
You can get 80-105k doing brd escort farm. Those groups want a holy priest
---
Stam is a trap imo because you don’t get very much for how much it costs. Resists and armor will make your pet tankier
---
Juice Springsteen!
---
Tunnels you can avoid by going through the center, the bridges end up making you go around. If you want to get to the tram or the forge you have to go through old town or the church district. I find it more annoying than cutting across the forge
---
Raid leader here with several war tanks.
---
We'd love at least one bear tank.
---
Also, not every class can do everything. Not every class has self heal, not every class has interrupt, not every class has aoe, etc.  Summoning is way more awesome when a summoning stone isnt doing a better job.  Mage water is needed when mana actually matters.
---
This won’t be a very popular opinion here. All classes have some drawbacks and hunters are no exception. That said, they’re a decent DPS class, incredible soloers, and a huge PVP utility class.
---
Warsong three man offense with hunter, Druid, and pally is almost unstoppable.
---
Isn't tauren warrior for tank better?
---
Health has always regenerated out of combat. I don't know the respective rates of each expansion/stage of the game, but it always has.
---
There is a lot of regeneration at low levels, but as you level up, your total health/mana outstrip your regen considerably, so you will hardly notice it most of the time.
---
Regeneration is based on spirit.
---
Because you only need a few main tanks.
---
Wait, there’s black level 40 horses??
---
Health regen is really quick early game. It slows down considerably as you level.
---
Because raid guilds dont need but a few warriors and tanks get treated like dirt in dungeons , would be the obvious answer.
---
*slaps body* This baby has room for so many 'lytes
---
damn, I remember that game. played it so much... mustve been around... 1995 ish?
---
OMG! LOL! THIS NEEDS TO BE AN AUDIO ADDON FOR WOW
---
I have a macro bound to a convenient key to cancel all forms/mount. This way I can hit this key and cast any spell in human form.
---
Except BiS has only a gaming context, and gives the implication that it has been tried and tested to show that it's the best.
---
Might be monkey quest, does similar things.
---
Raiding guilds only need a small number of tanks.  Once they have their core and gear them up, other roles matter more.
---
You need more dps roles than tank roles filled for a raid?
---
You probably just didn't notice how quickly it regained when you were a low level back in the day. It'll slow down level by level as you get more stamina.
---
Get this through your head:
---
There is no "do it all" class. 
---
They do not exist. You cannot do it all. You will never have it all. Every class has major positives and negatives that will be outshone or even shittier with another class.
---
The game is designed around you *needing* other players and the diversity their classes bring to a fight in order to succeed.
---
Hate the fact that your warrior has no CC capabilities? Well the mage wishes he didn't get one shotted by most enemies if he grabs aggro.
---
Don't like how your Rogue struggles to solo content? Warlock wishes they could stealth through areas cause getting caught out as a clothie is death even though they solo most content without issue.
---
As a druid, you're getting geared before everyone else. But you're stuck healing and most people will scoff at bear tanking as MT and you're DPS basically doesn't exist.
---
As a hunter you can solo everything and most newer players cannot do jack shit against you and your pet in PVP and you start out stronger than every other class, yet almost every single class has loot competition with you and half the time even if you truly need an item people will hate you for rolling on it.
---
Hate how Holy Priests can't solo well? Roll a shadow priest, except everyone will expect you to heal instead of DPS and respecs are expensive.
---
There is no perfect class. They are all meant to have pretty obvious deficiencies. These deficiencies are as much a feature of the class as the bonuses. It gives the class flavor, and makes them all different unlike the cookie cutter classes in retail.
---
Making 5 level 30 alts is just plain silly. Don't be that guy. Find a class that you like and can tolerate the negatives and revel in the positives and when the negatives *do* come into play, laugh along with your fellow class-mates who share your pain.
---
Youre responding to the wrong person chief.
---
How do I become the main tank then?
---
So you are denying what server I played on now? Again would use that same mentality with a guildmate/friend? Would you roll need on BOEs? Just admit you are a loot whore and move on bud.
---
You know I play ally on Herod, and from my side at least why would I take a 1v1 when its truly never going to be a 1v1. It either becomes a casting couch with my hot night elf ass and six orcs or fighting something more akin to a gauntlet that never ends. It's not a matter of being scared it really is just a matter of it not being worth my time to fight when I know sooner or later I am going to lose. On the flip side sitting in BRM as 5 or 10 is some of the most fun you will have world PvPing until you get crunched by 2 or 3 ubrs groups.
---
In the novel Rise of the Lich King, there was a bit more detail covered in the book that wasn't as obvious during *Warcraft 3*.
---
When Arthas went to purge Stratholme, among his first victims was a little boy who ran up to him, all admiring and starstruck by his presence. When Arthas' mace came down, caving the boy's chest in, the holy light went out.
---
That boy was not infected by the plague, and neither were many of the citizens. Yes the bulk were, but many were not. They were killed anyways, and this is what Uther didn't manage to get across.
---
It depends on race/class. I have played vanilla way back when and I remember it being slower too, but I am actually not 100% sure, since i mostly mained a hunter.
---
&gt;The Improved Cleave talent is underwhelming because it only applies to the bonus damage from cleave. So you're spending three talent points to add 60 damage to a low priority ability. 
---
Damn it!  Well that is great to know.
---
If you want to get away you probably can. But you basically have to give up on what you are doing.
---
It's the fog from weather effects. It only happens when it's raining and unfortunately the fog doesn't seem to be restricted to only outdoor areas.
---
It confused me a lot in SM Cathedral until I noticed it only happened when it was raining in the courtyard. Then some guildies of mine confirmed it's the fog effect during rain.
---
Granted, but I wanted to try it.  I'm not asking what's best, just how best to play as Fury specced at 40.
---
Zandalar Tribe EU like Grobbulus NA are outliers. RP-PVP servers are usually pretty balanced in H:A ratios.
---
Grob has times where horde controll BRM for hours and others where alliance are doing the same thing. It has a good ratio.
---
I mean you are tanking a 5 man, you pretty much have the final say in which you want any competition for 'your' loot. there's plenty of caster DPS who want to run ST.
---
More players might roll Alliance.
---
But actually *playing* the Horde is for casuals and noobs because everything is handed to you.
---
The staff is very slightly better than the weapon from dire maul.
---
It was crazy valuable last week.
---
This week, is valuable but only as total min max, "I want to pay gold for something less than 1% better than I can get for free."
---
Every druid that already bought one has already removed themselves from the pool of potential buyers. 
---
Every druid that gets the nearly as good from dire maul is going to need a dirt cheap price to make it worth spending gold for a very minor upgrade.
---
As inventory backs up more people will be undercutting trying to sell out before the price hits the floor.
---
100% this. I, as a rule, never join these groups because why, if the item drops, do you get it for you? Unless your a tank (and even if you are) loot rules still apply to you.
---
I'm a tank and I never reserve anything, because I don't need to. Most of the time the groups I run with, people will be nice enough to be like, Nah give that item to the tank.
---
Yeah that's what I'm learning the hard way.
---
This is completely flawed logic as it actually plays out in the real world. Maybe once in a blue moon you manage to kill the opposite faction and now get that mob. Most often though, especially when its 30-70 your gonna get gang raped after you attack them causing more wastes GY runs only to hope they aren’t camping you for your audacity to kill one of their own. 
---
Reality is-the 30-70 split makes it even worse as instead of on a pve server when you see opponents, you at least compete for the mobs where the pvp server you often have to just relinquish them or face the real consequences of even trying.
---
Same. I really wanted horde but it’s honestly fun to play with friends too so alliance... here I go...
---
Keep In mind new ranks of growls are only learned every 10 levels, so you could be level 29 with your pets growl last learned at 20. Arcane will pull aggro hard. 
---
Most rotations to not aggro and keep mana is mark, pet attack (I keep swipe and growl on auto, some turn it off), sting, then just auto. multishot if you want. 
---
Brought to you by: precious WoW daily threads that helped me with the same issue (:
---
I’ve spent the last 14 years forgetting this was a thing. I know what I’m going to watch tonight. Thanks OP
---
In dungeons you need a 1:3 ratio of Tanks to DPS and in raids you need roughly a 1:14 ratio of Tanks to DPS. Pretty clear how this happens.
---
Uther had no proof. Just Arthas’ word. (And the men that were with him I suppose)
---
Yeah I understand leaving the queue game, they were pretty freaking outrageous there for a while. And you're probably right, I was probably a bit dismissive with the pve server comment. There's a difference between pvp and hopeless gankfests.
---
Grob has a really close ratio
---
With the surveys it was close to 50:50
---
You're gunna turn into a death knight, bro.
---
Let groups reserve if they want, I dont see how it affects you in any way shape or form.
---
Can I equip a 1h and a shield with one click? The macro I created I have a delay when clicking on it that equips my shield, then my 1hander.
---
I think that's the opposite of what layers do.
---
They said that each layer is the size of a vanilla server. So they do help reduce queue times and they don't reduce any density in crowded areas.
---
You are correct and I will try to do a better job next time. Thanks for the correction.
---
Why don’t you check the manual and see if there’s anything about changing the keyboard backlight color
---
the alliance have very nice hair models and i dont like it!!!
---
What level are you? It's super quick at the low levels, but doesn't scale well unless you're heaping on the Spirit stat. :)
---
I don't think the real cause is anything as logical as that. I think the horde ambience simply attracts a more aggressive personality type, and PvP servers attract a more aggressive personality type in general. 
---
So on PvP servers you're going to have more aggressive people in general, and the average more-aggressive person is going to be more attracted to the horde ambience.
---
Sites like Wowhead usually have quests listed for each dungeon. You can just go down the list and take notes on what zones to go to in order to pick them up.
---
A lot of the quests are in the flight points of the Burning Steppes, but not all of them.
---
A lot of the BRD quests are pretty easy, so its good to just go ahead and do them all. The only one thats really a pain is the Jailbreak quest, which is the Onyxia Attunement.
---
Sounds like I hit the nail on the head.
---
Next time you engage someone 10v1 you'll remember my words and wax nostalgically about how you used to think you were good but now deeply and hollowly realize you're just getting spoon fed PVP victories.
---
If you want your hand held and stuff handed to you like you're playing retail: Roll Horde.
---
If you want to be challenged and actually earn your accomplishments: Roll Alliance.
---
You play fury and do well until your guild needs a new OT and then OT well until guild needs new MT. I would never recruit a tank from outside the guild.
---
    /cast [mod:alt] Cat Form; [mod:ctrl] Dire Bear Form;[mod:shift] Travel Form; /cancelform    
---
1 button powershifting. Takes you off your mount and out of whatever form you are currently in and puts you directly into the selected form.
---
Ex 1: You are in feral cat form, you burn all your energy for 3 combo points. Assuming you have furor and wolfshead helmet on, pressing alt+key will take you out of cat form, put you back into it, and give you the 60 free energy from furor/woflshead so you can immediately claw/shred again.
---
Ex 2: You're being attacked by a mage/warrior. Powershifting breaks all freeze and root effects. So say a mage runs up and novas you, simply press alt+key and you will break their freeze and instantly go back into cat form.

You got to 60 a few weeks ago, planned with a guild to be a MT, or start up a MC raid that you plan to fill and tank for.
---
People don't normally wear gear below their armor class in PVP. And he said his spec is pvp oriented. You guys are basically talking different languages.
---
I mean it's also a good healing trinket...
---
Art
---
It’s a numbers game really. Tanks have no competition for gear when they run dungeons, so the moment they hit 60 they get everything funneled.
---
That’s why when you see people hitting 60 it’s scarce because the tanks have already geared up and don’t need dungeons anymore.
---
I’m a fury war and I got my tank set complete first. 
---
You also notice an increase to price of righteous orbs, no one wants to run that anymore, and if they do it’s going to be orbs res for tanks.
---
never too late, no matter phase 1 or 5
---
Made a Rogue im in a dilemma though. Deadset on going Engineering for future pvp but gathering profession cant decide between Mining to make Engineering leveling easier or Herbalism so I dont have to buy Swiftthistle in AH...... (they are pricey on my server)
---
You need 1 tank in a 5-man group. (20%)
---
You need 3 tanks in a 40-man raid. (7.5%)
---
So I was under the impression you didn't lose combo points for performing a friendly action.  In any case I know you can't do a harmful without losing points.  I thought I was going to be slick and use mouseover for faerie fire just to find out it clears my combo points.
---
Join a raiding guild, play well, make friends, hope for the best.
---
There's no one answer. Most serious guilds won't make some one they've never played before their main tank just like most organizations wouldn't hire a random for a high end position in their organization. 
---
Your best bet is likely to join a raiding guild, farm out your prebis, and take an offtank role.
---
What spec and pet are you running? I was beast mastery for a while with an owl that was using screech, growl and claw. The owl would almost never drop aggro from the threat output from growl and screech. If you can't find an owl, a carrion bird or bat will also be able to learn screech.
---
I'm a 55 druid but...
---
I log in check my mail, and peruse my quest log to see what I can finish. I either find a PuG in LFG or get whispered by friends to run BRD or something. Although I'm spec'd feral and resto, I end up going as ranged since my friend is a paladin and our group is melee-heavy. I end up offhealing, caster DPSing, and switched to cat gear as needed. If the paladin logs I heal. I'm now thinking of resetting my talents for Moonglow since I'm having fun as oomkin and could still heal.
---
Sorry for being an ass, I should have behaved better.
---
Ok. Goodbye then. Stop crying and quit.
---
I skipped that one, I knew the amazing respawn timer\^\^
---
Facials.  Nice.
---
Yes gray castle or a fucking tree, gg
---
&gt;how much mp5 do you get per point of spirit
---
Zero, unless you have meditation (disc talent) or the T2 set bonus for 15% casting to continue in combat.
---
Mana regen for priests is 13+(Spirit/4); and that value ticks every 2 seconds. So if you have 100 spirit, you will get (13+25)=38 mana every 2 seconds if you haven't cast a spell in the last 5 seconds.
---
With meditation, the equation for in-casting mana per tick is:
---
(13+spirit/4)*.15
---
So, 26 spirit =1 mp2; or ~10 spirit =1 mp5. 
---
&gt;Which is better, spirit or mp5?
---
&gt;I'm level 48
---
Assuming you have spirit tap (you are fucking up if you are leveling as a priest without spirit tap) then spirit is more important. The 2x spirit regen after kills, continuing while casting, means that spirit is going to be huge. On top of that, there's a reason wand spec is considered the second default ability for priests... It doesn't take any mana, and lets you get out of casting mana regen. So spirit is just much better for priests than most other classes.
---
This changes at 60 with raid healing or raid DPS, where you will be casting a lot more and can get a ton more mp5; but you don't need to worry about that right now.

I love how you can make a normal, mundane, dungeon run into something so entertaining. Very talented, nice work

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/
---
&gt;WARRIOR ABILITY THREAT VALUES
---
&gt;With some of the basic mechanics of threat generation laid out, &gt;here are the approximate, modifier-independent, damage-&gt;independent, threat values for all major warrior tanking abilities:
---
&gt;Revenge: 315 + threat from damage + 25 threat on stun proc
---
&gt;Sunder Armor: 261
---
&gt;Shield Slam: 250 + threat from damage
---
&gt;Shield Bash: 180 + threat from damage
---
&gt;Heroic Strike: 145 + threat from damage
---
&gt;Thunder Clap: 130 per mob hit + threat from damage
---
&gt;Disarm: 104
---
&gt;Battle Shout: 55 per player receiving buff
---
&gt;Demoralizing Shout: 43 per mob receiving debuff
---
Additionally, from https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Strike
---
&gt;When tanking, this ability is not as useful as Devastate or Sunder &gt;Armor due to its lower natural threat value, its removal of rage generation from normal attacks, and being tied to the weapon's swing timer. **However, burning extra rage on Heroic Strike (especially if the rage bar is nearing full) will result in a significant increase in threat per second.**
---
I've done a LOT of warrior tanking in both Vanilla and TBC, I may be slightly rusty on exact numbers, but your assertion is proven wrong with a quick google search. Please, from one (former) tank to another, DO NOT USE HEROIC STRIKE UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT OF RAGE.
---
If you have gold for those axes you have gold for respeccing and testing fury, no?
---
Wouldnt recommend dual wield fury until you have some %hit gear but with those weps you can do fine anyway. If i were you i’d wait tho. Killing multiple targets will be hard if you get 3 misses in a row.
---
I've LITERALLY never ONCE across THREE different servers EVER seen someone mock you or tell you to let it go. Period. The server/s you're on are hot garbage.
---
You're correct on all counts people are just dramatic. The majority of horde I come across don't even attack since it's still phase 1.
---
That's not my experience with Sulfuras. Plenty of people and the lookingforgame channel moves so fast it's hard to keep up with at times. Maybe you're not playing during peak time?
---
No, there is a single mob pack that would require an MC to clear a mob.  MC then aggros the mob pack.  If you can get the mob killed and run back before he resets then it's theoretically possible, but it's deep in the dungeon and you have to mind sooth a ton of things before you get there.
---
Saltposting
---
In no specific order...
---
* Gear up.
---
* Join a raiding guild.
---
* Establish dominance.
---
*Before we go further here, some clarity - I'm not related to either side of this event. The last time I set foot in MC was in OG Vanilla.*
---
If you would farm the mats with your guild, why are you running pugs to get the binding? Is it because your guild prioritizes bindings to the tank?
---
I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that these pug groups aren't like LFR, where it's true randoms each week. There is a core of consistency with these groups. When you jump in and go after tank loot, you're hurting the effectiveness of that core group. The thing you're saying here is "I don't care so long as I get what I want" - that's the sort of toxic attitude I'd be wanting to avoid playing with. The reason you got shut down so forcefully during that video is that your BIS sword brings much, much lower utility to the raid as a whole than if it was in the hands of the tank. This is like core hound tooth going to a hunter - might be much better stats then their dal'rends, but the dagger is just SO GOOD for melee that the hunter's roll should be Offspec for that item. Even if that hunter is top DPS, I'd still hope that only rogues/fury wars would be MS rolling on that item.
---
And you're just dumb. Unfortunate.
---
Does /tm mark a target? Never used that command

Horde have small brain and need to be put down like rabid dogs. They foam at the mouth while chasing on their epic mounts. I'm sure the people behind the characters are nice tho. /wave
---
so are you gonna respond to me again with some snark or admit you were wrong or...
---
Biggest nerf on release of TBC was Illumination went from 100% to 60% and Divine Shield got two counters - mass dispel and heroic throw
---
Sodium chloride
---
If blizzard does it right and smartly pools the PvE realms with the PvP realms the queues won't be as bad. 
---
It's in the best interest for the PvErs too, who are massively skewed alliance.
---
It’s for sure Monkey Quest
---
Yeah unfortunately it being a PvE server plus *literally being named after* an Alliance zone it was destined to be massively skewed towards Alliance.
---
I have spent a lot of time pvping in WoW's competitive environments (Arenas, RBGs) and it's very fulfilling working to become a better player and improving.
---
There are also other times where you want to play a game for a power fantasy where you turn your brain off and just have some fun. One shotting people, whether it is with BGs or ganking lowbies gives that fun.
---
Ganking isn't a waste of time because the action itself is enjoyable. You don't need an in game reward to make an action "worth it". TBH ganking in hillsbrad and seeing 10 low levels banding together and failing to kill me is some of the most fun I have ever had in WoW.
---
If you don't understand, at least know I am not alone because there are entire games based around this concept. Just take a look at the dynasty warriors series. You turn your brain off and hack through hundreds of mobs that basically just stand there.

Corpse camping is real,  though not necessarily common,  yes m usually the result of ongoing fights or just someone being a dick.  Even though you can rez a bit away,  you still rez at minimal health/mana, and have to either immediately run or hearty, and it's not hard at all for someone camping you to find you before you can do either.
---
&gt;This will only hold true if every player that wants to buy said items is running around with 3000g.   
---
Yes, but that is exactly the scenario I'm talking about. 3000g is an exaggeration plucked from my imagination, but the point I was making was that if there is a large injection of gold into the marketplace (free gold, gold farmed directly from mobs) then prices will rise accordingly across the board for all items, regardless of how important that item is or isn't to any one particular player.  
---
It is the value of gold that decides the prices on the AH, and the value of gold is determined by scarcity. The person I was replying to was saying that the gold value of player sold items would not increase until they are immediately relevant, despite any increase of gold surplus in the economy. I think that retail wow has proven that to not be the case, though.
---
Dude I’m reading all these horror stories and I’m like “did we just get lucky on Incendius?” Sure Incendius might be 55/45 or 60/40. And you can tell that it lean horde, but overall the server doesn’t feel imbalanced at all. Even stv wasn’t too bad for me and my guildies as alliance.
---
Fairbanks is high pop but it has significantly more Horde than Alliance.
---
Nah, but feel free to keep responding ;)

Whatever u say babyman

\-professions. mining and herb have some pretty solid gold rates atm. but my guess is if you're asking, you probably dont have mining to just get the arcane crystals.  
---
\-solo maraudon princess runs (go watch staysafe's or similar youtube video on how to and gold/hr)
---
\-play the ah market, buy low sell high, usually takes some time to get a feel for how much items are truly worth, but its an option
---
probably the top 3 atm. dire maul runs seem to be more difficult and require more gear/skill, so inherently are less profitable to those who can only play so much
---
Hoj is really good, it's bis for all of phase 1, not just pre raid bis
---
&gt; I wonder how these someone can be so delusional.
---
You're delusional if you think most people know stuff like this. Who the fuck knows what happened on private servers? If you think even 10% of the population kept abreast of that shit you live in a bubble.
---
I am a hunter now. Is it faster for hunters?
---
Okay handiclapped.
---
&gt; If I am bored or have free time, I will corpse camp you indefinitely until your respawn timer renders that character unavailable for play. 
---
Or until they, you know, layer out of you after the first death while they corpserun.
---
Yeah... did you see the part where I posted a meme?
---
&gt; You do not get more rage from a faster weapon, rage generation is normalized. So a slow weapon will get more rage per hit than a fast weapon, but the fast weapon hits more so it equals out to the same thing.
---
what about the talent unbridled wrath though?

That's the number someone else cited in the comments. Even if it's only 250 a given demon, those odds are still under 2%.

Keep in mind I'm still being very generous with some of those estimates.

Before the siege of hearthglen Arthas and Jaina learn all the key details about the plague and must of shared that information with Uther after he relieved the siege
---
So, you rushed to hit 60 knowing full well that the content was going to be released over a long period of time, but now you're "bored". Sounds to me like you have no one to blame, but yourself. Even at 60, there's still plenty left to do. Missing quests, rep grinds, profession grinds. Even if you have somehow managed to max every single thing out (and you would REALLY have to have no life to do that) go play an alt or another game until the next phase.
---
You are essentially proposing Classic+, which personally, I don't think will ever happen. WoW has already progressed through its life. If they try to go back and change it now, they'd be better off to just start developing W4 or WoW 2.
---
Only offset by the AV layout
---
walk 5 extra steps? WHY WOULD I DO THAT TO MYSELF
---
I mean that would fall under the category of gitting gud. He used his options to evade me, pretty gud
---
Its not unless you are human, I just meant, I rarely had to watch my health, since my pet took the most of it.
---
Go mining and skinning to start, then drop skinning once you hit 60 for engineering. You can power engineering 1-275 or so for maybe 100g, and you'll make way more than that skinning 1-60.
---
That makes sense, although that doesn't necessarily mean the game will get harder. Since you have a larger health pool anyways. I realize the enemies would hit harder too but still...
---
ive been using an accountant addon to track spending due to mats, flypaths, training, etc. I downloaded killtracker to remember how many mobs ive killed. Been wanting to figure gold/hr incoming and grinding gold tracker. Im gonna download this and try it out. Thanks
---
Lost and insecure, you found me.
---
Tailoring is a fine profession to keep, since you can make gear for yourself as you level. 
---
Drop enchanting, it is super expensive to level, you won't get money off of items you dust, and you can buy enchanting supplies and find an enchanter later on. Enchanting stuff isnt even worth it until about lvl 30, when you can get minor speed increase for boots for a few g, then ignore enchants entirely until you get solid end game items. 
---
Pick up like herbalism while you level for cash
---
Lawl, basic wow player
---
no, daggers are good 'cuz they build rage faster and heroic strike is just a flat +damage thing.
---
😂😂
---
Good news is the whole guild or friend group could faction change together!

Yeah I recall only seeing a couple on the AH at once, and them selling for 500+ gold as well (Garona-US).

If they can reconcile playing as a different species then I'm sure they're alright being a different gender.
---
Layering is literally sharding 2.0.
---
It's been made continent wide exactly because they didn't want you to see players randomly phase out because they entered a different shard from you. It's literally been made to prevent server load
---
Tl;dr: I have a small peepee but killing people 20+ levels below me makes it tingle

Imagine being the allies and u see a lowbie horde phase in right in front of your raid.
---
The BIS part is kind of silly. I might need a change from Mara farming, so I will check this out when home later tonight.
---
Thanks, man
---
WoW is an MMO, the first M stands for massively. Empty zones doesn't make it feel massive. Sometimes zones are overloaded and that's part of the experience. If there's a raid on a zone I don't want to miss it.
---
I think the positives of allowing levelers can now be considered completed and they can hurry up and remove it. I'm not 60 yet, for the record.
---
I should probably be a little more clear. I’m not arguing that in the current canon lore Illidan was crazy/evil in TBC. Much of that was retconned in Legion. What I and others on this post are arguing is that way back in late endgame TFT/Vanilla/TBC they wrote him as legitimately mad, not actually chaotic good we just had the wrong perspective of him.
---
And then killing their level 60 guildies with my pvp squad makes it grow lorge
---
How can I have all these posts and not know how to read?
---
Haha yeah, Redridge is like that for us and a reason why we go to hillsbrad.
---
I'm not sure. It's worth a try. Mind soothe then pot. If it were that easy, I'm sure there would already be posts, though.
---
1. How do I feign death and then freezing trap in dungeons?
---
2. Does growl work like warrior's taunt, or is it more of a threat-builder?
---
3. Is improved guns/bows/crossbows basically equivalent to hit % ?
---
You must be depressed and sad.
---
It’s not fun for you? Imagine how not fun it is for the alliance on Herod lol...
---
Both health and mana regen is quick at the lower levels. I don't think I had to eat or drink anything on my paladin until like level 20.

Yeah,

    /tm &lt;#&gt;

Is a target marking command - I believe this came out in MOP or CATA, long after I personally stopped playing wow.  The UI is based on Legion's updated UI (so I've been told...wtf do I know?) and this is something that makes it into classic as a byproduct of that.
---
WHAT DID YOU TYPE? I CAN'T READ!
---
&gt;With that logic, why improve your gear at all?
---
It's not a matter of improving your gear at all, it's a matter of what's most **impactful** and **meaningful**. You having devilsaur isn't going to allow you to do anything you couldn't do before, and it will eventually be replaced. Epic mount allows you to farm faster and be more efficient. Lionheart is never replaced. Hell, I'd even buy edgemaster's over devilsaur and open yourself up to more weapons.
---
&gt; but what AQ40 guild would bring a dps warrior who doesnt even want to invest in Devilsaur?
---
Literally 99% of them? Unless you show up in greens and blues as a new recruit, it's not going to matter. By the time we get to AQ40 your average guild will just be happy to have 40 people.
---
Ahhh lol that tripped me up
---
Ez ignore❤️
---
Actually if we stop memeing for a sec I'd say that Horde have it way easier in PVP for pretty much every way that matters with the exception of city raids.
---
Horde cities are so much easier to raid than Alliance Cities.
---
Mostly cause they were made by dumb-mudhut orcs and brainless zombies and... cows.
---
construction? maintenance at audi nets you 5k€, as a shift supervisor you go up to 6-7k€+ depending on your companys size. benz and porsche pay the same and even more, quattro aswell
---
the whole industrial sector works shifts and if you live in a country with a strong economy youll get some money from it, especially if you work 2 nightshifts per month. im not saying everyone working shifts gets paid good money but theres definitely countries where you can get paid a lot for it
---
If only you welcomed a popular Alliance streamer to your server, and let his tens of thousands of alliance followers populate your server... too bad, now they're horde too
---
Yes, a sample set of 1 proves it works.
---
I spent 8 days out there before giving up and buying it off the AH for 500g.
---
Upset cause you can’t get past hillsbrad quests
---
 :-(
---
&gt;If you take into consideration the fact that trueshot also gives 3/4 of your melees 100 AP, there's no reason to go Lightning Reflexes over Trueshot Aura ever.
---
This x100
---
No, it’s not inappropriate. Tank lfg with summon doesn’t hurt anyone. It’s his choice to do that and it’s your choice to find other tank if you don’t like that.
---
Well your regeneration *does* slow down comparatively to your health. But I'm not sure what type of challenge you're looking for, or expecting? If you're smart with pulls, aware of your environment etc, you won't have too many issues when levelling. 
---
Some classes are much easier to level than others. Warlocks, Hunters and Druids are great at this. Maybe even Wand-spec Priest. The other end of the spectrum would be Warriors and Rogues. Paladin is an outlier, in that it's dead boring to level due to how slow it is. 
---
If you want to make it more challenging, you could always pull bigger. Most classes can handle a 1v1 fine. Throw in a 2v1 or more and that can change.
---
It is not and would be bug fixed within a day.
---
PicnicFace had some real golden content, then they tried to make that format work on TV, and it failed pretty miserably.

100% of the times it works, every time.

That's not true.  He's just a dick.
---
Hoj will be bis for a long time, but that just means it beats other trinkets...its a real dps increase, but if you dont have good weapons, devilsaur armor, or one of the good preraid chests, youd be better off allocating most of your current hoj to those instead.
---
you're missing the whole point that you're giving a 2-tier BIS weapon to tanks "For threat" because they are shit and can't get their act together.  If there are numerous tanks holding threat against the top DPS in the world using eskhander's claw, then your tank is shit for "needing vis'kag/deathbringer".  That's the point.  Other tanks don't need vis'kag/deathbringer, your guild is shit.
---
This, if you don’t mind the extra time it’ll take to find a group that caters to what you want, then do whatever you want lol.
---
Lul, in AV we have a fence that can be jumped over while alliance get a badass bridge with the most skilled of archers
---
Interesting. I honestly never even pay attention to the names of servers, That people would pick a server just because it has an Alliance or Horde themed name never occurred to me tbh.
---
There will be paid character transfers later on that's 100% certain
---
Not sure if that's a crack at humour or you're confused
---
AHK itself isn't banned, but automation is. What you've done is automation and it's the same regardless of what kind of software you use.
---
Personally, I use AHK as a simple key cloner for when I dual-box in order to make leveling a paladin or warrior less... numbing. I've had no issues with Blizz and I've used it since launch.
---
So, like the other guy said, as long as you abide by  the 1 action for every 1 input without any repeating (and I THINK delaying) you should be good.
---
I mean, my 2013 MacBook runs the game just fine on 3 graphics, any higher than that and it will sound like it's going to explode. But even on 3 the graphics aren't anywhere close to how terrible the screenshot makes it look. Has to be an incredibly outdated laptop.
---
Thank you for the detailed instructions. It is much appreciated.
---
TBH I don't see many people wanting fair fight. Most of the people want odds rigged to their favor as much as possible.

One plays on a layered server, the other doesnt

But there isn't a way to squelch emote text as far as I know.

That drives me crazy too, the way the hooves sound hitting the ground is almost like nails on a chalkboard to me. I was NOT expecting that (first time leveling any human to 40+). I plan on farming for my tiger at 60.

A mage can't viper sting an opponent from 41 yards away. No thanks I'm not playing a mage instead of hunters which are incredible. Try getting good at the class before you whine on forums.
---
That's fine. I get that can be frustrating. Its known that many players are just greedy and about themselves. I normally dont pug I just play with friends I've made in game or my guild. As a healer tho you could have more leverage in creating a group as hardest thing to find is a decent tank.

Herod Alli here since day 1. Have a 60 and a 40 on Herod Alli and from what I've seen it's 100% to grief. 
---
I've had times, even during late night off hours (well past midnight server time) where it can take upwards of an hour for my party to *zone in* to BRD/BRS. Have not even bothered with DM yet because I don't play my 60 as much anymore. 
---
"PVP on a PVP server" is cool and all, but when its basically a full raid of Horde (who are often better geared due to more access to resources thru population) camping a 5 man BRD group it ain't even really worth the time. 
---
So for now I've benched my 60 and am currently leveling profession alts and working on my future twinks to pass time until paid transfers become available and I'll see how that affects Herods pop.
---
Meh either way. 150 mana is like 1/4th of an additional spell cast.

He was outside aggro range. I do the same thing in South Shore. Just one shot lowbies right in front of the guards.

Better off using a fast axe. 1.4 vs 1.9 isn't that much of a difference and has huge impact because of proper stats.

Yes, your oh only does 75% damage even with full dw spec, and doesnt factor into your instants...deathbringers lowend is higher than deep woods mean swing. I know youre attached to your first purple but you would be insane to oh deathbringer.
---
GRIZZLY sucks lmao. We troll those losers all the time on stal.
---
Stupid
---
Yeah I see the same thing at the furlborg camp near Everlook (on Herod). One horde on alliance grinding rep? Leave each other alone because fighting means nobody gets anything done. As soon as either side has a group though they just take over the camp. Seen alliance and horde both own in a fair amount.
---
What level are you lmao

 /wave

I doubt it.
---
RemindMe! 2 hours

They shouldn't for skills that dont generate cps. I'll double check here in a bit, but almost positive that kick and blind both shouldn't drop them.

As a long time hunter (in real vanilla to retail) and warlock (from tbc and now maining it classic) player I have no idea what the melee speed number means, do you mean for example if it is mind flay that the number "Speed    X" on the weapon needs to be 2.9+ or does that mean it must be 2.9 or below?
---
Do you know if this can work with drain life on warlock because that plus firestone might be a lot of damage if so.
---
Aggro range of mobs decreases the higher your level is in relation to the mob.  The hordies were probably level 60 and weren't close enough to aggro the guards.
---
Im here for that
---
Lol alliance on pservers wrecks horde
---
Such an ignorant statement
---
How do you farm "BRD escort"? I've been in a AOE grinding group once now, they only farmed the trash and usually did the arena event.
---
Escort quests are doable. They're only a nightmare when the faction balance is completely fucked.
---
What dps meter is that?
---
Kill hippogryphs in south feralas while you wait for people to travel. They drop reasonably priced vendor trash.

&gt;Until admiral Proudmore came along and tried to wipe them out despite all evidence pointibg towards the horde trying to work things out peacefully.

You willingly let yourselves be controlled by demons to help them invade our planet. After we beat you, your 2nd in command willingly let his clan be controlled by demons again, killed a demigod protecting our planet, and helped the demons invade again.

Sorry if we had trouble trusting you, our bad. Oh wait, since then you've asked us for help twice to overthrow more of your leaders who went on genocidal rampages killing everything that didn't look like them.
---
My server is 30/70 horde and other than STV/SM rest has been fine tbh - I feel it dies of the closer you get to 60 as everyone is busy getting to 60
---
Why? What's the point in wasting their time?
---
That's neat. I wish I also had a handicapped sign for parking my mount.
---
No your right, WoW has nothing to do with improving your gear. Especially in the case of dps Warriors, gear is completely useless. Hell the only thing you need to get into a high end raiding guild is to have an epic mount!
---
thats a completely different scenario that only applies to arenas and BGs in a version of the game were which  servers you are on is basically.  sure you give alliance a big buff they might choose to queue for pvp but its a lot more to ask for someone to leave a character behind and re roll a whole new toon which is what is required.  peopel arent talking about arenas or Bgs here they are talking about world pvp and no amount of buffs is going to convince a horde to delete thier lvl 60 character and reroll and start all over for simple buff. I mean would you?
---
Ah nice, I‘m from Enigma :)

what editing program did you use?
---
Thanks for the help!

&gt; You FD then cast Freezing Trap.

I'll have to keep trying, but every time I use feign death in a dungeon I always remain in combat, making me unable to throw down a freezing trap. What am I doing wrong?

This happens more at DM than any other instance. Someone plz explain

Okay lmao good argument.

Typical horde scum, thinks wpvp is 5v1 and doesn't understand the point of a shit talking post.

Repost
---
Not sure if it's possible without an add-on. The mod Prat will help you out there though!
---
First off start in combat stance. Use charge gain that bit of rage, cast rend and maybe one heroic strike. Then change stances to berserker stance. Use berserker rage and enrage then cast bloodthirst when enough rage is generated. And then spam heroic strike/bloodthirst when up
---
naw, then you'd have to play a *Gnome*... and Gnomes can't be Priests.

Regardless of the "not to be taken seriously" disclaimer...this is cringe as fuck.

Ah yes Mediocre books mmhmm quite.

Since we are on the topic of macros there is an addon called supermacro but I cannot find a working version for classic. Anyone know if there is one currently? Also as a warrior I have so many macros I want to make but can't since there is a limit of like 15? characterspecific ones. Does anyone have an addon or something to expand this without having to use general ones?
---
    /script DeleteCursorItem();
---
I think that’s it. Click an item in your bag then hit this to delete it with no prompt.
---
You definitely want a 2.9 speed weapon in your mainhand.  I believe BiS is Flurry Axe which is a level 42 BoE, if you're looking for something a bit cheaper Annihilator or Bone Slicing Hatchet are decent alternatives.
---
I didn't mean "over the Alliance".  The scourge as an organization is opposed to everyone else.  It's main role would be fighting the Alliance and Horde.  The Horde, for its part, can win conflicts, particularly when it has the same goals in a situation as the Alliance.  Likewise the Alliance never really "wins" vs the Horde because their victories can never mean any change in the status quo.

Realize this: At the end of the day, the most optimal PVP spec is 21-3-27 (you use swords or maces and spam Hemo). A lot of experienced rogues feel that, while this spec is optimal, it is not particularly fun. In that respect, a lot of dagger builds have surfaced because they generally feel more fun, and are still viable.
---
At current gear levels, you won't have enough crit chance to make Seal Fate daggers super viable.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxboxZGcZAMIccMR](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxboxZGcZAMIccMR) 
---
I would recommend you use this spec. It provides you strong crit chance on ambush and backstab, but your damage output will never be as consistent as 21-3-27 spec. It WILL be harder to grasp than a simple Hemo build.

Remember when Blizzard was blatantly against basic human rights?
---
People don't want to relevel and regear. Blizzard has an existing system for faction transfer. They should implement it.
---
You're probably better off selling that particular dagger (if you can).
---
Daggers can be useful for tanking, however there are other considerations to make, the main one is:  What race are you?  Try to take advantage of any relevant Weapon Specializations.  Human?  Mirah's Song from Scholo is absurd.  Before that, Hakkar's Might mace from ST is very good.  Orc?  Try to use an axe.
---
End-game, 5 weapon skill equates to ~3% increased hit chance against level 63 monsters (aka, Boss Level mobs).
---
I know you said you're 54, but 60 comes before you know it and you will easily replace that dagger with 60 gear and you could sell that dagger for Epic Mount cash.
---
You knew he was level 40 and you still went on a tangent about fury in raids
---
:thinking:
---
This was like watching an episode of Scooby Doo.
---
I think you can combine all that into one line. Shouldn't matter for this macro, but depending on what you're doing, it can help you stay under the 255 character limit.

For example...

---
You know GIMP is free, you don't have to use MS Paint.
---
Holy shit I never thought of just swapping bank bags for gear.
---
actually that is exactly where i was thinking to put my points as i always lose agro with multiple mobs, and swipe only hit 3 people and barely does any damage.
---
I definitely dont get that message.  Maybe if you have it as a mouseover macro or something you have to do that, but i just have PW:F on a key and target people while out in the world.  I can always use the same bind (max rank) no matter what level.
---
The only time i get 'target too low' is when i try to cast DS on someone too low lvl to receive rank 2.
---
Undead are dope ass rogues.  Being able to get out of fear is very useful in PvP and PvE even if it does not feel like it for the first...40 or so levels.  Cannibalize is also sneaky great (flavor AND insulting in pvp) and means as long as you are keeping up on first aid, youl never need to carry food with you.  I played originally as a male but went female this time so that I could do bad ass front flips every time i used a finisher (plus their death noise is hilarious).  Highly recommend.  Being able to stay underwater comes in handy that first time you fight Rotgrip and your orc tank forgets his breath meter and goes belly up.  Yeah save your evasion for that!
---
Not when he's talking about a good looking horse lol

A fun little tip for using Eagle Eye is to make a macro that allows you to chain them together to go an unlimited distance. It will only spawn mobs/players in your current zone, but it's really useful for hunting down targets or scouting areas.

Should have moved to Earthfury when you had the chance. I'm getting ganked left and right by Alliance!
---
One shot by a rogue in Stonetalon when I'm minding my own business? You bet! Squabbles in Shimmering Flats where other Alliance join in? Absolutely! Roaming gank squads in Hillsbrad? We got em!
---
You forgot PVP. I eat mages for lunch as an SM/Ruin lock in pvp
---
I'll re-watch the South Park episode and get right back to ya
---
Even if you see the boat on the island dock from the mainland it is faster to swim.
---
&gt;It was they who imprisoned the orcs in camps!
---
You invaded us and refused to surrender. Camps or edecution, you pick.
---
&gt;It  was an Alliance prince who unleashed the might of the Scourge!
---
Who was given power and then merged with a former warchief of the horde who had created the Scourge.
---
&gt;You Alliance know nothing of honor, and you sow only destruction in your wake.
---
*Looks at Stromgarde* 
---
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
---
The answer being is that allof them want to have an overall advantage, those pussies just want to be the benefactors of a "prisoners' dilemma". 
---
Now how many rogue and Frost mage mains are going to down vote this?
---
Yes. Yes it fucking does.
---
How is this so entertaining?! I was smiling like a dummy the whole goddamn time
---
Bud, dun garok is a shitshow but its also a rite of passage for that rogue life.  I had to compete with two opposite faction rogues, both higher level.  Was pretty damn slow going, logged off for a bit, logged back in and they were gone.  I recommend that.
---
Except that we absolutely are more important than everyone else. Sorry boutcha
---
Please fuck off.  We all wanted to play Classic - leave it alone.  If you fucks ruin Classic WoW the same way you ruined OSRS I won't have anything left to play.
---
Unpopular opinion but I wish I could play monk and dk in classic.
---
Yes they have told us many things and they've also delivered as close to what they've said every time.
---
I've got a Kroll/Thrash, both Devilsaur pieces, eye of rend, rest is random decent blues with a green 15 agi cape.
---
No problem. I found quite a few old mates on that site. :)
---
Right now, they think they own it, all it takes is a few times to prove they don't before they give up.
---

---
Nope, no DPS difference whatsoever. Attack speed varies, though - so faster attack speed pets have a higher DPS for BM hunters, due to better uptime on Frenzy.
---
I’m new to macros—what does the exclamation point do?
---
You've got that
---
Grats! May your Blades Never Dull!

You sound like your going to be burned out months before you're even close to rank 14
---
I'll get my 10% discount and then ignore that shit system forever
---
I mean... 2h fury is better damage than arms, so...
---
Never change. Some of us appreciate you.
---
It’s real easy. The fp tower connects everything basically.
---
Sunder provides a fair amount of threat and armor reduction to increase dps. Try and get 1 or 2 in early on to maximize. Sure it might only add 10 damage per hit, but that equates to 1-3 more hits over the coarse of the kill. 
---
Avoid heroic strike while solo questing unless you have over 50 rage - you can pretty much abandon it once you get mortal strike. It is helpful for threat generation in dungeons, but sunder is also great. The reasoning being that it doesn’t generate rage and replaces a normal attack while only adding a small amount of damage.
---
Or just use `code block` by adding 4 spaces to new lines
---
    #showtooltip Kick
---
    /cast [@mouseover, harm] Kick; Kick

Orrrr wrap the lines in \` so it looks like \`Code\` = `Code`

I get that. I said modify everything so you don't need them!

Oh I'm a riot, that's why I'm going to Hong Kong

Tbf you CAN fish in IF

Wtf are you on man? "The safety of the sidelines"? And you only think it's useless because you don't agree with it. Disagreement is fine, narcissism is not. I hope your wife manages to handle your toxicity
---
alliance!
---
Super alliance heavy, but horde pop is decent. Cant say I wouldn't transfer to a more balanced one given the option
---
I was mostly talking about enhancement shaman, which i see about 10 times as many of.
---
I play on sulfuras and sulfuras is very lively and full of people when I play. Are u sure?
---
I really fell for that huh?
---
150 mana could be an extra downranked heal. Its worth something like 500 healing of you use all your mana. If you dont have mana problems, then its a waste.
---
Those raid groups look horrendous -- the buffs are not ideal at all...
---
Ah that makes sense. Thank you so much; really appreciated :)
---
Yeah but WHICH Discord? As far as I remember there was a splintering of "official" Sulfuras Discords after some drama or another. Which Discord do you refer too and how active is it?
---
You use sunder because cost of heroic strike is too much.  Heroic strike, youndont generate rage on that swing.  You sunder only until about 60% mob health, then only heroic if you're going to rage cap.
---
Sunder armor is there to increase overpower chances as well.
---
&gt; Come test your chops on a pvp server, it's much more fun.
---
I'm on Smolderweb which is PvP. Even as a ghost, you can see someone in stealth based on stealth detection and level, so it's always a good idea to use the fact that you're dead to scout the area before you res... 
---
I think a lot of people getting camped make the mistake of ressing the moment they reach their corpse and also ressing directly on top of where they died instead of planning a route of escape.
---
I'm so tired of seeing this completely manufactured drama splattered all over this subreddit.
---
This is *by far* the lamest reality TV I've ever seen.
---
You're late to the party then
---
320 Arena Runs, no chest
---
So the minute you're outnumbered you run? Wooo fun. Also you actually seem very angry
---
Manufactured drama?  What do you mean?  All of this stuff happened...
---
Yes but it effects each a differ amount based on the spell damage coefficient for that spell. Idk what they are for shami though sorry.
---
Wasn’t it just Garrosh iirc
---
Dude I am fucking MIFFED😂
---
The average guild wont clear AQ. Thats the point.
---
i'm not skipping STV. I love the STV grind. I was asking him where he goes instead. good job
---
Uhh,  not really sure tbh, i guess u could send the file over everytime to get the data from where u come from and then just copy paste that data into the folder from the chars.
---
I like it. Make THAT the free transfer instead of a realm transfer, up to a limited number to get it evened out.
---
The devs mentioned it all the way back in wrath.  They could retcon it, but thats the state of things.
---
We don’t call it justified. Even by saying the “ends justify the means” don’t hold up with the culling, because the end was the same. 
---
This would also be a common “battle or war” scenario. It’s insane to say that one victory is acceptable if it lost you the war. Yeah sure, you won the two V one in bot lane, but the nexus just got destroyed. We could do that all day lol
---
And if the plan was to save Stratholme it still failed since they died, but that wasn’t the plan. The plan was sacrifice Stratholme, save Lorderon. It doesn’t count as a “victory” just because the towns people didn’t kill Arthas.
---
No, they just lack the ability to perform introspection
---
Can't get away if you dont have epic mount.  Lost opportunity cost of the time it took you to travel wherever you were going.  Some people dont get long to play and that may have ruined anything they were doing for that day.
---
I just put the LFG channel in its own tab, so I don't get spammed all the time but I can check on it easily if I need to.
---
Is there even enough Alliance players to shit talk?
---
In raid with WF 2h fury is fine, Arms is unarguably superior for leveling. /sit batching is fucking awful and Arms is way better in dungeons which is most of leveling.
---
This has all been figured out already and isn't really in contention among theorycrafters.
---
and I can't read lol
---
&gt;if you kill mobs for veins/chest/skinning the aformentioned thing is all yours. 
---
not if i get there first
---
this is a you problem. This loaded faster than YT would.
---
&gt; Mage water is needed when mana actually matters.
---
Yeah, not sure who made the call so that almost nothing actually costs mana anymore.  I couldn't try retail for long because it felt like a repetitive strain injury was inevitable from all the full rotation spamming.  Felt more like a rhythm game than anything trying to 'fulfill class fantasy' or w/e their likely stated reasoning was.
---
Thrash blade hunters ww@
---
I wish I didn't have to ride a tiny horse as an Orc.
---
Yes you can. The real shame is that the trolls won't let you ride a raptor.
---
Neato, thanks.
---
Would definitely recommend Gnome Rogue instead of Warrior.
---
As the other commentors have stated, Warrior is very highly dependent on gear. When you HAVE the gear, they are monsters. Without, they're kind of shit.
---
Rogue, on the other hand, is one of the less gear dependent classes. Take all of that with a grain of salt though, obviously ANY class will perform worse with worse gear, and better with better gear. It's just more apparent on a Warrior.
---
No to all of this.  I agree to add some new races since they are in the game like give high elves to the alliance since they are in the game, but they should keep the old models. No to the revamp of combat. If this is where classic + goes I'd rather have TBC.
---
I rerolled here from a PVE server really happy I did.
---
What?
---
Just be aware that not every pet can learn every ability, the way a lot of sites word it made me think otherwise.... like just because you learn furious howl from a wolf doesn’t mean you can teach that to your cat....also can’t teach charge to a cat... I learned the hard way.
---
You only have no offhand hit penalry on the one heroic strike, not every white hit until it goes off.
---
Rule 1.
---
It's still 30-50g an hour w/herbing. People crying about it being nerfed have either only farmed pservers or are actually garbage at the game
---
&gt; And we're not talking about paladin vs shaman.
---
We are talking about faction balance and this is part of the equation too.  Horde have strong racials for small group and solo PvP.  But in an organized group, WotF becomes way less desirable considering a priest can just dispell fears.
---
Its ok, its a common mistake to just skim through a text and say something based on general keywords and make an assumption, but yes, i meant farming the gold in Zul'Farrak and buy it off the AH, far more efficient, considering the respawn in heartglenn is really really slow for some reason.
---
Did you want us to call hoarders for you?
---
I have all my pre bis and like 5 pieces of raid gear, including benediction. Im wondering which enchant I should put on my t2 head.
---
Gnomes supposed to be so fucking smart but they can’t even get their own city back lmao. 
---
Dwarfs supposed to be proud and mighty but they’re just a bunch of tiny alcoholics in disguise. 
---
Night Ells supposed to be highborne and knowledgeable. Still lives in a fucking tree. 
---
Humans supposed to be righteous and noble but couldn’t even run the bath let alone run a kingdom.
---
lmao this guy is actually mad cause some chad orc ownd him and then stole his paladin waifu
---
*insert chicken noise* 
---
If you're gonna be a dick to low level players at least man up and take the death when they fight back lmao
---
As far as I'm aware, it's used for abilities that put a buff on your character. Normally, for instance using Eagle Eye again after you already have the Eagle Eye buff, it would just cancel the buff. Similar to your Aspects. Adding the exclamation point causes it to just recast the ability instead of clearing the buff.
---
Mage defines glass cannon in classic PvP, one spec is focused around one shorting people every 3 mins  actually. Warlock is more control and chaos in PvP with all the dots and fears. Both are great classes for 5 mans especially now that DM is out warlocks can really shine with banish against all the demons and elementals.
---
Good for you?
---
But that doesn’t make them upset, which is the primary goal here.
---
I have this old clunker and it plays at 60FPS. This game will run in basically anything at this point.
---
https://www.asus.com/us/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-G75VW/
---
You can create a weak aura to do that for you. Or import one that someone else has made.
---
I’d play Warlock, as I think the leveling is better, solo play is also nice with the pet. And overall seems like a more fun class. Play on Bigglesworth for best experience.
---
Heard it's pretty dead though.
---
/tm #
---
No reason to type all that for a mark.
---
But according to the Alliance this never happens!
---
You can ask for whatever you want if you hold the power
---
&gt; Of course, once the tables turn and they actually have an opportunity to get a few kills without inviting their own certain destruction, they turn into the most ruthlessly, sadistically underhanded sociopaths you'll ever meet
---
That's how pvp servers are on both factions. This even back and forth on PvP servers almost never happens, it's always gank squads or 60's slaughtering lowbies.
---
Or I'm just Mana dumping and popping consumes. It's really not hard at all.
---
Most people. Are not good at healing. Also you shouldn't be primarily raid healing as a druid in MC. Druids are really bad raid healers unless it's the fringe scenario where blanket eejuv is actually good 
---
Best raid heals on ally is pally
---
 /DND no, I won't summon you.
---
That's all it takes. And your ignore list won't max out in a week.
---
Even with gear, they are still kind of shit in pvp.  They need a pocket healer to steamroll.  Without that, it doesn't matter what your gear is.  A mage in greens can still make the warrior cry as long as they don't get double crit off the first charge.
---
I'm playing a druid.
---
Noggenfogger isn't dissapearing when I shift.

I would say:

**Druid** \- Reggae
---
**Hunter** \- Country
---
**Shaman** \- Psychedelic, Shpongle
---
**Rogue** \- Rap
---
**Warlock** \- Emo/Metalcore/Post-Hardcore/Deathcore
---
**Warrior** \- Iron Maiden/Metallica/Judas Priest type Metal
---
**Priest** \- Healer - Classical, Shadow - Some kind of dark/industrial electronica
---
**Mage** \- EDM
---
**Paladin** \- Orchestral movie soundtracks
---
There’s so much content available right now it’s mind boggling. If anybody feels they have nothing to do, they’re lazy. Unlock all of your bank slots, fill them with 16 slot bags, farm mats for potions, get your main gear set, a fire resistance set, and an Offspec set, get them all enchanted, farm mats for your guild or in preparation for future content (myself I’m farming mats for TF down the road), stock up on E’kos and Jujus, stockpile a ton of gold for future respeccing costs, large expenditures, or getting a different races mount, level an alt or two to 60, help your guildies get gear or their class mount, max out your professions and try to learn every available recipe, find players in high level zones to PvP, run some lowbies through low level dungeons to get them some easy gear, max out reputations you may need in the future, I mean the list just goes on and on. Either you enjoy the game for what it offers or you don’t. More content is coming and if you don’t want to do the above or you no-lifed it all already, just take a break and come back later.
---
Also Benediction and Mankirk are layered. Not entirely sure how that works but hypothetically there could be a lot more people right beside you on Benediction and you just don't see them.
---
not for pvp .
---
Idk how your google works, but when I search "wow classic reputation" this is the 4th result:
---
[https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Reputation)
---
It goes into great detail to explain the reduction to you...
---
yes it's a quest from thrall for lvl 60s only and you have to kill 300 lvl 12 gnomes, and it's repeatable ofc
---
What server?
---
&gt; Some people dont get long to play and that may have ruined anything they were doing for that day.
---
I have limited play time too, but it's not like the expansions where there's only one level appropriate area... For instance in the 35-40 range, I can hop between Badlands, STV, Arathi, etc. Not to mention there's sooo many quests in certain zones that you can just jump to another quest for 30mins and your gankers will have wandered off, or you can go farm mobs to keep your exp/hr up.
---
Yeah, my only healing experience was up to about lvl 40 on a druid back in vanilla. Dps and tank all the way, so it would be a whole new experience I guess. :)
---
My point in all of this is soft people wanting to pick and choose their Classic WoW experiences as if unbalanced servers and the challenges that they bring were not, or should not be a part of it. The softest of the soft do so from a PvE server. 
---
That is you, in case you are confused.
---
It's like crystal meth in a can
---
All of this is legitimate, Asmon invaded Herod server - happened.  GM of Medellin took the HoR mats - happened.  Not sure what you're on about, pal.
---
They aren't trying to escape problems like you tho. Dont worry man itll get better!
---
I hate everything about this photo, I don't know how people can play without keybinds. Like by the time you clock Warstomp, you're already dead.
---
Finally! A Moofire macro!
---
Is Robe of the Void worth grinding to 300 Tailoring as a warlock assuming I already have a tailoring alt?
---
charge &gt; sunder &gt; sunder again(if rage) &gt; beserk stance
---
Okay...whatever you say lol
---
Undead priest on sulfuras here. Our server is a gem in the midst of all of this sub whining about faction imbalance. The server feels so evenly split.
---
since I found this thread, are there any MC PUGs etc going on? or do you have to commit to a raiding guild to get MC raids?
---
As a lock, no. Please come tank for me.
---
DW Fury is the best dungeon tanking spec.  I can build threat noticeably faster using two weapons in defensive stance, as well as keep about 30 rage leftover for chain pulling.
---
And let's face it, chain pulling is the name of the game nowadays, and snap threat is the rule of the day.  If I can chain pull a pack and set a demo shout and two targets with a sunder and whack the third with revenge; I can flip back to the primary and simply sunder while waiting on a revenge proc to smack secondary and tertiary targets to keep them pinned.
---
Never had as much luck tanking with Arms as I did Fury.  But it really sucked trying to tank as prot.
---
AFAIK This was possible post 2.0 and on private servers because of higher reputation rewards. But it is currently very hard to achieve without cloth. Some people (like the author of [shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net) a well known rogue site) tried to theorycraft during beta how to achieve the tiger on a human (rep bonus) before lvl 40, but they always arrived at \~60% Revered max.
---
Your salt is cute
---
Ooooh, so how did you do it? I don't like the armored cats so I've been thinking of getting exalted for an armored horse for an epic mount (meanwhile I just hit 20 lol).
---
Losers, apparently.
---
Likely not, but at the end of the day things like ddos doesn’t effect the company as much as it does the consumer. Which is the only point I’m really trying to make
---
Warrior=Gear.  If you you only have a couple hours a night to roll out some quest and maybe a dungeon you can make a warrior work but its not the easiest class by a long shot.
---
With setting up realm transfer for particular factions in a certain way they could remedy the problem a bit.
---
Touting something to work that has literally never worked is incredibly asinine and stupid. Its not even a solution, it's just annoying, bizarre preaching
---
side note, Mankirk is one of 4 PVE servers, whereas there are 13 pvp serves for this time zone. Meaning the spread between those who wanted to play PVE would only be to 4 servers in this time zone vs 13 for pvp. so Mankirk could very well be the Faerlina of the PVE timezone, streamer or not.
---
Why should I or anyone care? I really love all of the posts each day about such pointless/fake events "first time playing vanilla and seeing a boar xD" or "someone sent me 100g after I helped them kill a mob" or "just got my mount, so nice to not have to walk anymore" or "someone sent me a very clever letter chain that I responded to most sarcastically!".
---
This isn't math, this is language. I guess Reddit has a thing with wanting to correct people though.
---
Paved roads.
---
Can anyone confirm the rep from this is all the major cities? Or is it just UC for horde?
---
I noticed that! I think part of the charm may have been having the content in the online format
---
That's some extensive work. Better create new content if you are going to remake it anyways
---
Right, but just because Arthas didn't have the power of prescience doesn't meant he wasn't objectively wrong.
---
He made a call to do a horrible thing in the hopes it would save his kingdom, and it ended up being the wrong thing.
---
According to the wowhead comments they do not. Take it with a grain of salt but someone said they got a travelers backpack during the event
---
The main reason you use Sunder is that the mobs might dodge, giving you an Overpower. When you pick up imp. Overpower (and Deep Wounds/Impale), Overpower is by far your meatiest damage ability.
---
It isn't literally every hour, like from 2:00 to 3:00 or something. It is every 60 minutes. Exactly when it starts is hard to tell, but it is something like when you enter your first instance, a rolling timer starts and if you try to enter a 6th instance before 60 minutes have passed, you get locked.
---
Lol... so how about replying with an actual helpful response along the lines of "Your post was auto removed for being under 75 characters, so try asking in the daily question thread instead"?  
---
Instead of telling them to google it, which is the least possible helpful response anyone could come up with. This isn't even an easily googlable question.  
---
Man, what is with the mods on this subreddit?
---
yet the people in the raid look to be having fun, hm guess they must not be aware of how INEFFICIENT their buffs are /s
---
&gt; Not by default, no
---
The regular skill does by default. It's when you have a macro of PW:S do you get the "target is too low" message. Idk if it's a bug or what.
---
So it violates Rule 1.
---
Also - it's boring.  The narration is dull and your graphics go on too long.  Edit that stuff down.  Asmon as Bane, especially with the "O" face was funny, but you over did it.  It's funny for like a second.  You dragged that out way too long.
---
That's when I lost interest.  I can critique the rest of it for you, if you like but I'll need a second to grab some coffee.
---
You can literally google the average time it takes to get to 60...
---
Not much worth listing on the neutral AH. Thorium bars for the people who forget them for their Scholomance key, STV pages, and pally/shammy T1 pieces, pally/shammy twink items, and cross-faction pets are all you'll really find.
---
Right on brother.I was figuring as much. I saw "cover down" and non vets dont use that lingo. :)
---
The fact you edited this to add that second part tells me otherwise. Again don't worry man, you don't need to convince me
---
I know opinions are opinions but holy shit do yours suck. Pretty much every sane person agrees nightsabers are the best looking mounts in the game. Horses are trash and an accepted meme.
---
Leveling session while a raid?
---
I was on my way to SM when I see a fellow horde attack an ally. I don't hesitate and charge in to help out.
---
The guy straight away start to curse on me I steal his "toy" he was playing with (yea wtf?)
---
So I was like right dude and just continued my way to SM. 
---
While I'm waiting in front this same guy approaches and start to yell at me why I am always at the same place he is at, should stop following him and get out of his face (never meet the guy before our first encounter before and I was there before him?). Then, as the psychopath elitist jerk he is he tells me I have no right to talk because I am a lower lvl then him - I was 37, he 42.
---
I told him to fuck off and don't ruin my day because his was bad.
---
Better than dirt, wood, rock
---
Well I just want my wording to be clear
---
123
---
Make sure that your pet has enough focus to cast it when it's up. If you have bite and claw on autocast there won't be enough for growl.
---
Necrosis is an all around warlock add on that had a nightfall alert
---
"Is it worth" questions are always subjective.  Look at the cost then look at the benefit.  It's replaced by ROVP so if you can get that pretty quickly, I would say not worth it.
---
    /cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] Healing Wave; [@mouseover, harm, nodead][@target, harm, nodead] Lightning Bolt; [@target, help, nodead][@player] Healing Wave

Order of priority: Heal mouseover target --&gt; lightning bolt on mouseover --&gt; heal target --&gt; lightning bolt target --&gt; heal self if no target/mouseover
---
I combine several abilities with  similar macros since shaman is so keybind heavy.
---
Healing Wave / Lightning Bolt
---
Chain Heal / Chain Lightning
---
Cure Poison / Earth Shock
---
Cure Disease / Purge
---
Lol no priest with 700 +heals and 5.1k mana is popping mana pots on CD in ony/MC. That's totally unnecessary.
---
From my understanding, the details threat tracker wasn't working at launch... Is it fixed now? (this was also true for omen, and other trackers...)
---
Basically the only threat meter that was working for a while was CTM, and only worked when OTHER people also have it installed, if they don't it's arguably useless.
---
I’m 59 and I’m stilling wearing (blue) quest reward shoulders from razorfen Kraul
---
All. Creat a macro to equip a trash gray weapon. Use it when you know you’re going to wipe. Durability loss effects the trash gray instead of your high end weapon.
---
home...
---
You want to get 315 weapon skill. The reason is that the soft cap for weapons skill is 315 and anything after that suffers diminishing returns of .04 chance to reduce miss / Dodge chance as opposed to .1. 
---
5 weapon skill is 1% chance to hit because .5 reduction to miss AND Dodge. You should be using the 1% hit value in your stat equivalency for gear. 
---
I use Otto's rogue guide for rogue stat equivalency.
---
I (Horde) have handled all my 1v1s fine.
---
His name is Akela like the wolf pack leader from the jungle book :D
---
"A more healer oriented healer" 😂
---
Pve servers are fucking pontless..... lmfao !!!!!
---
6-slot bags HATE HIM!
---
bind macro to a key with "/cast !Auto-Shot". This way you can even spam click range attack and use right click for melee
---
No one has ever properly explained it, but my theory is that each instance ID takes 1 hour to expire, and you can only have 5 max IDs at a time.
---
This so perfectly sums up how I feel.
---
Wowhead comments from vanilla look like they drop from any 50+ mob? Lots of mentions of satyrs and demons at least.
---
I'm just saying that it is what i'd like. i'd bet money it won't happen
---
Hah! That's a good one. Hope you don't mind if I pickpocket it
---
It's trash now.  They've trivialized all the content from when the game was good and moved the game in a completely different direction based on community voting.
---
They're doing Ony, melee don't  exactly need shaman buffs for Ony. Putting them with your healers kinda helps dummy proof it by giving them all another huge chunk of Mana for when the fight drags on too long.
---
Having a shitty "quick" experience is worse than having a fun slower experience.
---
The Horde side can be a little dead at odd hours(besides weekends), as of most servers, huge lack of tanks which can sometimes cause a long wait to find groups.  Not the best guilds either, seems to be 1-3 guild holding majority of the people and makes that makes it harder to find PUG if your not in those guilds.  Overall the people seem great though.
---
dude fuck demons
---
It's true, I really should stop being by the instance when finding a group
---
Then you could get a second warlock to level while your diversion-lock keeps them occupied
---
Yea boat goes all the way around the freakin island instead of just going to the port. Troll ass boat captain.
---
Damn bro, had to dig for that one huh?
---
Isn’t [Alcor’s Sunrazor] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14555/alcors-sunrazor) bis for non-human and non-orc tanks?
---
No, it was streamer drama which relates to WoW Classic, a streamer invaded an entire WoW Classic server.  Do you not understand what the word "relates" means?
---
Also, boring is subjective, especially when you had a negative opinion going in.  It's doubtful you even gave it a watch, so don't mind me if I ignore your opinion, kid.
---
It's pretty inconvenient to visit and there's not many items worth listing. STV pages while you're in the zone and Paladin/Shaman BoE set pieces are all I can think of.
---
Blizzard are gonna think we're account sharing mate
---
I mean, you don't exactly need anything for Ony or MC or beyond, but it definitely makes things smoother, for example having a lock and pally in the tank group.
---
this sounds super familiar, what is it from?
---
It seems really wonky. I have heard theories that dots can mess up the reset, and I have seen what you are talking about happen, but I haven't seen any solid proof of how it actually works.
---
&gt; worst mount of all factions
---
&gt; not basic ram or mechanostrider
---
Also, get real, the epic horses are genuinely cool. Plus the horse animations are way better than the kodo and wolf by FAR.
---
Shoutout to Snackybox, the best content creator on this subreddit
---
You clearly never played against DIE and Serenity Now.
---
That is the non optimal auctioneer. The other guy is a few steps from the bank and mailbox.
---
Omg racist
---
I'm glad man, makes me happy hearing that :D
---
no fuckin way
---
Vegas Pro 14 mate :)
---
Yeah, what's really frustrating is that it feels like the majority of corporate game design is done by the same hivemind.  I originally left WoW because of certain design changes that didn't jive with me, and then those changes followed to the other games I went to.
---
Really frustrating when WoW devs show up as leads on other games, like Ghostcrawler going to Riot(Though lol was going in to the toilet before that).
---
New logo, same great taste!
---
Ya ain’t a horde-e unless ya feel the sands o’ Durotar between ya toes mon!
---
Just to add some pet training details - https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php
---
Try roleplaying as someone who wouldn't steal everything that isn't nailed down. It's more fun when you restrict yourself. I had a great time playing as a complete pacifist and seeing what I could accomplish that way.
---
It’d still be his first holiday event in classic, is essentially how I’m interrupting it. Which could be wrong, he could be just farming Karma.
---
If browser hardware acceleration is on, switch it off, If it's off, switch it on.
---
/r/unexpectedoffice/
---
That’s really good to hear, had me worried honestly
---
/r/montageparodies is calling you
---
Nah, it's right there at the top of your post history. I figured you would have shared your opinion on OSRS in the past, so took a look, and boy was I not disappointed.
---
Aye.  I've only ever played on pvp since vanilla,  so i'm just used to doing special ops style rezs behind trees and such.  You're correct that being druid makes it 10x easier with a quick stealth away to safety
---
&gt; Alliance are so terrified that they never engage unless the odds are so massively in their favor that it's outright impossible for them to lose.
---
Opposite but same on my server, there's seemingly 15:1 horde to alliance, but horde will still only attack you if it's *at least* 3v1, AND they're all 5 levels higher...
---
I'm level 56 and have had one. One (1), 1v1 PvP encounter.
---
Level 58 mage, still wearing level 23 legs I made
---
PvP happened on a PVP server.. weird
---
But here you will have meditation and spirit tap
---
Do mining nodes always re-appear in the same spot you mined them before?
---
Seen, at 2:40pm
---
And is it based on any actual blizzard data pal?
---
Stay strong, friend
---
Did something similar with the Ratchet -&gt; Booty Bay ship a couple days ago, except I literally got stuck on the **outside** and it dragged me all the way there.
---
The whole time I was thinking "This is never gonna work".
---
I like horde, because I think the alliance side is too fluffy... I certainly would welcome playing on a server that has more alliance. I would prefer 50/50 of course, but I hate the Faction I like is the one most often played. Who the hell wants a robot chicken.
---
You're a monster.
---
If anything especially as warrior I would've picked alliance if I wanted a good time and picked the optimal faction/races. You really do not know the feeling engaging a warrior + paladin combo and you dont know if you want to attack the 45% physical mitigation warrior who gets cleansed and spam healed by a never OOMing paladin or if you want to attack the 60% physical mitigation paladin.
---
Alliance &gt; horde in all circumstances in which you play PvP in an MMORPG fashion with people supporting the warrior and each other.
---
Wait for phase three. Altered Valley ram is great looking and easy to get.
---
Shut up dude
---
Dont forget in AB where the alliance first cap is closer than hordes. Thats why we always lose 1990/2000 on the really tight matches.
---
Preach it brother
---
HoJ is your BIS until Phase 5. I would prioritize hit gear and weapon upgrades first (plus stuff you know you can grab easily) but it should definitely be a priority because you won't worry about ever replacing it. Other PreBIS will get replaced pretty quick by Ony/MC
---
I was mostly trolling anyways - I don't genuinely think mobile is a bad idea - it obviously brought in a bunch of new players.
---
Happy to say that Jagex didn't start making too much 'mobile-friendly' content either.
---
Nice comeback. Want me to wait for some of your horde buddies to show up and help you think of a better one?
---
This sub doesn't have this problem, but in r/wow's case, lots of people post about "things that make you say wow!" In theory (given the name) those posts are legitimate, but the sub is about World of Warcraft, not another r/mildlyinteresting. So moderation is required there.
---
Maybe you should stop gimping yourself
---
Yes, every 15 minutes or so
---
You have to use the neutral auction house, booty bay, ratchet, gadgetzan
---
Just remember, people may quit wow because of those people, but the multiple 60s camping one level 32 are moments away from quitting real life (I assume the only reason people do that is due to crippling depression or other severe mental issues)
---
What server are the Kor Kron on?
---
We don't know, and blizzard doesn't release player numbers anymore AFAIK
---
HP Regen is fast in wow, and on top of that its Hallows End and I believe I read somewhere that its increased by another 25%
---
go to booty bay, you can hit AH, mailbox, bank and guild bank without moving you just have to run up the little ramp and stand next to the inn to log out
---
For one book?
---
You get a certain amount of points and have to choose which ones to take. Yeah it's like talents. Some of the skills are free, like growl. Bite and those skills are cheap. It's the resistances and stam and stuff that are expensive.
---
I do have spirit tap, yeah, and also the wand spec. So it sounds like I want to prioritize spirit still for now at least.  I assume things with mp5 though continue while casting while spirit based regen does not, but it's probably not enough to make a large difference.
---
They just have them grouped in order of role. G1/2 are teams tanks or Melee, 7/8 healers. The rest are ranged DPs or more melee. It's a good way to find out what you need to fill out your raid. Fix the groups later
---
&gt; Is AutoHotKey illegal 
---
Sorry but I'm endlessly amused by people describing things that violate some software's fine print as "illegal."
---
I mean I get it, you're probably young and have grown up in a pretty strict environment.  But it's still funny.
---
Mining and herbalism nodes have pre-set spawn locations, yes, but not all of them are populated all the time.  It will eventually respawn in that same location, but when is hard to predict.
---
My work blocks imgur links so anything v.reddit or i.reddit is perfect for me.
---
Interesting, I distinctly remember watching a video in the weeks before classic outlining how to get your tiger by level 42 or so. They may have had incorrect info for rep gains I guess.
---
&gt;Asmon invaded Horde server - happened
---
Yes, happened... For one day, solely for the sake of people making videos like this and generating him free advertising.
---
To the second point, valid, didn't watch the video, just saw Asmon's face and GM/Ninja in the same context and assumed he "ninja'd" something yet again.
---
does not seem like anyone wants to watch your shitty stream
---
Even more aggravating when you're not on Alliance.
---
I LOVED that mission. Defending missions are always my favorites in rts games but this one takes the cake. It goes from Arthas being the hunter to being hunted. The full effect of what the plague is hits him and like Illidian’s favorite line, Arthas was not prepared.
---
I expected older people to be playing but alas, horde seems to grossly outnumber alliance in many cases (I assume only 12 year old edgelords roll horde)
---
I don't understand why they just make the honor gained from killing Greys close to zero. Force people to kill those around their levels. Make the honor much higher for same level...
---
I remember when doing such (attacking players while engaged in pve meant that the attacking faction enemy would be banned for greifing. or something similar.  so has blizzard changed this policy?  ( i know of people whom have been banned during actual vanilla for doing these things)
---
If I were you and these arent among your random assortment of blues, id work on getting mirahs song and cadav chest from scholo, bracers of the eclipse from dm west, tarnished elven rings from tribute runs, and mark of fordring from the tirion chain. None of these -- except cadaverous chest -- will be as much of an upgrade as hoj over what Id guess you have now, but theyre all preraid bis and on the same scale as hoj...id be very surprised if you didnt end up getting more dps going after these for 20 hours than farming hoj, because even if you get hoj in those 20 hours, youll get at least 3 of these in that time. Hoj is worth farming for because itll last, but you could be more efficient.
---
Sally Whitemane.... WHO?
---
IT'S ALL BOUT DAT RICARDO
---
Kelzod is the only cool dude in the group ;)
---
I don’t know recent numbers but it’s relatively close to even
---
Blow job in thrall cosplay.  Trust me
---
Edit: with YOU in the thrall cosplay
---
Yeah, that's my assumption as well (that mp5 continues while casting but spirit does not) but it's still unclear whether the difference is worth it. Maybe if I had more mp5 than just one piece?
---
Ah yes the rocket helmet.... of course, yes I have one of those... classic rocky helm
---
"Be right there just finishing this quest."
---
20 minutes of waiting later and everyone else in the group is waiting at the dungeon entrance. See last guy is still in Plaguelands.
---
"Hey you coming?"
---
"Yes I'm ready summon please" 
---
"We dont have a warlock"
---
Thankfully the party leader was fed up with waiting too so we kicked the guy and found someone else pretty easily but seriously dont get into a group and wait until the last second to start going to the dungeon.
---
It's out of the way and the goblins take a bigger cut of the sell price than the normal AH.  It's useful for specific exchanges, but not everyday commerce.
---
My rep with Undead faction is honored and o have 10% off . So If i got revered will be 20% off?
---
Eastern Plaguelands lvl 60 boars got the last rank for the charge.
---
Yours was Jaina
---
It means everything you said above.   
---
In general though, world PVP that everyone desires is even battles of even numbers of the opposing factor of roughly the same level.
---
There is no such thing as off spec. That was disinformation created by pure dps classes to prevent hybrids from taking gear. I play a class, not a spec.
---
You roll on gear for your class. That means Paladins can get healing, tanking and dps gear if they need it.
---
No, you don't need it. You  also don't need world buffs or consumables, but it makes  things easier. Shaman in the healer groups is a safety net to cover people beeing dumb which is very, very likely on Ony.
---
long term whats the most stable profitable in your opinion?
---
Yeah man Every monday wednesday and thursday you find pug days.
---
On sundays aswell!
---
While it may not have been part of the *Vanilla* experience, perhaps being told that whatever you're doing isn't part of the *Classic* Experience *IS* part of the Classic Experience o.O
---
Been there before?
---
Create a guild twink army. Any one guy can make a 19 twink, but it takes several to get the really good stuff like the furbolg medicine pouch and the arena grand master trinket.
---
I was standing on the boat waiting for it to depart and decided to run off and swim. It launched the second I ran off and I still beat it to the opposite dock. (Without levitate or any swim speed boosts)
---
Moral of the story: There are zero situations where the boat is faster than swimming.
---
I’ve never done va before but this seems interesting to try!
---
yikes
---
Basically you end up respeccing your pet a lot at the pet trainer to specifically prepare for certain things. Or have specific pets specced for different things. Like for molten core you want fire resist. If you are farming maraudon then you want armor and nature res. For pvp stam and shadow and arcane resist. 
---
Things like that
---
Are there any hallows end quests that can be repeated for Alliance (Darnassus) rep? I saw ‘crashing the wickerman festival’ is one, but it’s not repeatable.
---
But who's on first?
---
Okay, but what were you rolling for?!
---
Omfg this is dope as fuck!! Source? Who makes them? IG or anywhere to follow?
---
He only removed the post... find something else to whine about
---
&gt; Something about the Horde makes people stupidly fanatical
---
It's not that horde gives people personality disorders, it's that people with personality disorders overwhelmingly roll horde, and 12 year old edgelords.
---
Fuck if I know...I avoid that sort of thing.
---
Is that post Malone
---
Feels very active to me. Always people online, trade is busy, ah stocked, lfg channel filled.  Alliance side.
---
Most insane luck, congrats. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t envious haha
---
Few years ago I bought my buddy a horde banner that he has since framed and mounted above his monitors.
---
Something similar?
---
&gt;Add a couple of zeros and we'll talk
---
"I'm prepared to offer your client 18000 copper on completion."
---
Oh warchief
---
It depends on how you look at it. Take for example, Grand Apothecary Putress and the Battle at the Wrathgate in WOTLK. Dude gasses everyone, both sides invade the Undercity and shank his ass. Sylvanas declares it an attempted coup but it's perfectly sound to consider he was acting under orders and got thrown under the bus. 
---
Furthermore with the horde plotline in BFA it's now debatable just how much free will the Forsaken actually have.
---
It's entirely possible that sylvanas has been plotting this for years through careful control and manipulation.
---
Same here, Ally on Kromcrush. Trying to finish my Pirate Hat quest in Tanaris is hell
---
“You lied to your men and betrayed the mercenaries who fought for you”
---
That and the whole killing his father, destroying his kingdom, betraying the paladins, and a few other things, but what better way to beat the undead than to become undead?
---
It is almost Halloween
---
And it was your first UBRS run!
---
Buncha armorsmiths fixing the price on lionsheart helm caused one dude to start spamming their names and making it for free
---
It was in vanilla.
---
With the exception of hardiness, a passive that blocks 25% of all stuns (which feels like 50% to most rogues). I agree though.
---
Hey, being a lvl 28 warrior I found it amusing critting a lvl 60 dwarf called "tastemycrit", paired with how I was just questing and somehow ended up in southshore
---
Looking to Trade for real word Faerlina names.
---
Have :
---
Faerlina - Rap
---
Herod - Sinful, Erp, Ign
---
I think if you mouse over attack power it shows attack speed.
---
In case you are this thick. Making personal loot would ruin end game because Classic end game is all about running the same dungeons and raids over and over again to try and get gear to drop for all 40 people in your guild/raid. If there was personal loot and everybody got their own loot after every kill it wouldn't take nearly as long to progress through raid tiers, which would effectively fuck up the end game progression. Not to mention it's way easier to find geared players to raid with if you have personal loot on because you can just do unlimited pugs to get geared and never have to find a dedicated raid group or guild
---
Honestly, I have it and I would say no. Winter night is almost as good, tier 1 is almost as good, and volatile power is better.
---
Everyone should be KoS on a PVP server.  Anyone who doesn't play this way is doing it wrong.
---
My suggestion to help balance would be to do something similar to how GuildWars Factions handled it. As one side grows stronger, the underdogs get more and more "perks".
---
Maybe after a 20% difference in a given contested world zone, the underdogs get a 10% HP buff. At a 30% difference, underdogs get 15% damage as well. At 40%, a buff similar to resilience, reducing crit damage and increasing resistances. At 50% underdogs get a straight 30% damage reduction in PVP combat. I'm just spit balling these perks but you get the picture.
---
You're close; It's the other way around. Dispel Magic normally and Abolish Disease on alt modifier.
---
You have to make sure nothing else is bound to it in your keybindings, or it will not work :-)
---
Laziness and efficiency are only the same thing to a programmer, and then only long term.
---
Only joining groups that can summon is lazy. Being ready from minute 1 is efficiency.
---
"Just because you beat a player who is bad at the game doesnt mean you are good at the game" - Faker
---
Huh, we have molten core swim team but it's alliance side. And also booty bay swim team.
---
I think it's just that it doesn't have any major streamers playing on it. I believe it was one of the servers Blizzard added in after launch when every server had a huge queue to get in. It's got a very healthy population and faction split from what I've seen.
---
Yes, it works. The animation shows cannibalize first, then you sit to finish eating/drinking.
---
He probably forgot to hit the tank button.
---
I'm serious, push Avenging Wrath and you are a fucking black hole.
---
Troll Village. Darkshore.
---
Eventually we'll have the opposite problem where everyone is at level cap and it becomes hard to find people to play with as you level.
---
I'm genuinely interested in what happens to classic in the future, if there's development beyond Naxx and how we don't repeat the mistakes of retail.
---
Now that I think about it, it may have been an addon not a macro, but it certainly wasnt vuhdu. *Clique* might be what you're looking for:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/clique
---
But you can't switch trinkets while in combat, so do you always dismount before fighting just so it equips your right trinket? As a Mage doing AoE pulls that'd be impossible.
---
Who pissed in your cheerios? Sounds like you got rekt my dude.
---
I just found out about DME last night. Did blizz ninja nerf those veins or something?
---
I mean he's probably like 12...... or 32 with the attitude of a 12 year old.
---
If you start a group no matter what spec you are and get a lock and force 3 people to summon you, you're a lazy ass player. Sitting in trade chat and picking what groups you go to based on a summon is different, and fine.
---
For some info: 
---
Guild is running a little scavenger hunt for 20G to post a SS from the exact location someone decides to hide. Here’s week 1! 
---
I figure reddit is best to help me win haha :)
---
Not sure if you're being serious or not (I hope you're not) because that's a pretty terrible rebuttal, pal.
---
WoW classic has been around since Nov 2003. The experience from 1-60 has never changed, from Original release to private servers (original not boosted PServers, naturally), to re-release August 2019. So why would we EVER need blizzard data to support how long it would take the average person to gain 'X' amount of experience? It's been the same since 2003 and will be the same in 2019. The average player is going to hit lvl 60 with 6-8 days played. Let me know if you still don't understand, pal, I'll try to dumb it down further for ya.
---
😘
---
I know a lot of *edgemasters* whose hands would fit perfect in these.
---
Druids are in a complete different world than the other classes
---
It’s not true
---
Not much until you get growl.
---
perditions blade as well. That's an awesome loot spread.
---
this is di-fucking-rectly up my alleyy.
---
Swamp of sorrows?
---
Your raid setup is lacking in dots.  
---
You need moar dots.
---
As to why he died: I was trying to save mana for the MT and thought he'd gotten out of the way already, last bite before the MT's intercept and taunt got him however.
---
we are not bois
---
After a wipe when everybody is mad and irritated, having to use 1800 mana on buffs x5 it'll take some time drinking
---
I used to just leave trade open with the water sitting there mocking them until they put money into the trade interface.
---
If they were jerks trade window closed and I'd tell them to get a life, I'm not a charity. Losers.
---
Same with ports, trade chat open when they ask. If they're particularly obnoxious, I'd port them to thunder bluff.
---
Honestly not that hard. Pretty much as soon as you get dire bear, druids are particularly competitive tanks for warriors. They have some decent damage, with buffed theat generation on it, so with the right gear, a bear can definitely top a warrior. 
---
That said, a bear tank has relatively few tools, so there are certain fights they struggle with. And they do have to understand how bear weapons work. DPS is irrelevant, it's all stats and certain effects.
---
Wut. That’s a complete lie. Troll on trollseph.
---
It had what plants crave.
---
I hope you didn't resurect him.
---
Maybe some one knows the math, but it's just a random chance, I'm personally a warlock and rotgrip in mara, who is a 51/50 has resisted my curse of doom before. And I'm talented into resisting it less. It's just random and maybe your getting the short end of the stick in this case.
---
Hes right tho.
---
This is the one change I think needs to happen
---
Servers and realms are archaic
---
It defeats the nostalgia of #nochanges but I feel like Classic WoW is potentially a candidate for PvE and PvP megaservers
---
I have no idea how it'll be handled with everyone's names and whatnot, but it's a lot better than half of a server disappearing
---
&gt; I regularly use AE r1 in combat. To finish off a very low health target without spending hundreds of Mana is one example, but I mainly use it to prevent mobs from resetting when going for big AoE pulls on spread out mobs.
---
That stops being a thing at 60 in dungeons/raids though. And once you have your epic mount, I dont see much reason to AoE farm anymore.
---
If you have meditation, the conversion of spirit to mp5 while casting is approximately 1 spirit to 0.2 mp5, or 5 spirit for 1 mp5 (calculated here in terms of mp5 for easy comparison since that's what is shown on gear pieces). However, spirit provides more regen when not casting (5 second rule), and it can also provide some additional healing power when specced for that, so spirit is more valuable than its mp5 conversion alone.
---
"I've played private servers [badly] for years" fify
---
Come on then, cite it, or his that too hard for your brain to comprehend.
---
Imagine thinking that people leveled at the same rate in 2003 as they do today or on pservers...
---
I would be alot less happy as the over populated faction. It's mildly annoying at worst as alliance on herod for me. Most people are terrible so its easy to kill 5-10 people as 3 or 4. Eventually the numbers become too much because they pile up like a dam ready to break, but it's enjoyable for the most part. Sometimes you gotta die two times to get to a dungeon and ghost run, really not that big of a deal for me personally.  
---
Also it's kind of weird you talking about how it is on herod when you are on faerlina lol. I can tell you as someone who actually plays on it the server xfers had little impact to the situation.
---
add comment about how much better the classic community is than the retail one.
---
but honestly, just ignore people like this
---
#showtooltip shield block
---
/cast shield block
---
/cast revenge
---
My go to hotkey when I was low level tanking. One button tanking.
---
#showtooltip mocking blow
---
/cast battle stance
---
/cast mocking blow
---
Always be able to mocking blow without worrying about current stance for an emergency taunt.
---
Then I have one for my 1h and shield and def stance and one for my two 1h and battle stance
---
yes but it does scale. Like my druid, I have a lot of +healing gear. However some spells only take 80% of that +healing, some take 70%, some the full 100%. 
---
So I'd imagine you'd need to find out what each spells take from the +spell damage.
---
Starting a bidding war on username conflicts sounds like a win for blizzard
---
Well, I was super bitchy and harsh.  
---
Now.  Can I make you some cookies?
---
Except Horde outnumber alliance on every PvP server.
---
Every. Single. One.
---
Damn you’re right. That was quick hahaha well done!!
---
Incendius isnt too off balance. Could use a little more ally.
---
Is no one going to answer Skafa's question?
---
On top of that on the neutral AH the deposit cost is higher AND the AH fee is also higher.
---
Smash that like and subscribe!
---
Stealing streamer content?
---
All the good chests and boots are RNG drops, so I'm still working on those too
---
Np, enjoy this makes it double as good
---
Make it possible, but with a wait. Similar to how queues are discouraging, but not ultimately prohibative. I'd wait a few hours to play with my friends, but if I'm some dude randomly picking a server, I'll click something else instead of waiting hours. 
---
There are soft options Blizzard could explore.
---
I stopped doing dungeons on my druid after ZF to make some gold and then quest for some quick levels... now i find myself at 54 looking at all the dungeon gear and im afraid i won't be able to tank or heal. I tried to look on the AH to see if there were any gear upgrades to get me bsck up to par, but everything seems to about the same... would i have any problems trying to tank or heal the dungeons at my level? Should i try and just dps them for now? 
---
I'm currently feral cat spec, but am planning in going the 30/21 spec to tank and heal.
---
Any insight would be much appreciated.
---
If we're talking about Strat good chance most if not the entire party is level 60.
---
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR A RAID! GET OVER HERE
---
[Thanks for coming out.](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-level-60-in-wow-classic-an-objective-look/)
---
Edit: Googling sure is hard.
---
Your mom is a prostitute
---
If your MT/RL is sitting on the corpse distributing loot for 15 minutes that's 15 minutes you aren't moving to the next boss, so you just end up taking FOREVERRRRR to clear.
---
I would be livid if you did that to me ... so great work, perfect rogueing lol
---
Robe of the Void isn’t that much better than winter night, as someone else said, but the real benefit of tailoring for warlocks is the Bloodvine set
---
Oh yeah. I think desolace is just an unpopular zone. Sulfuras is still strong from what I see
---
Stay AoE to farm gold until you have epic mount and a nice gold stash. I switched to frostbite single target after that but there're better raid builds incorporating 31 into Arcane or you can even go fire for kicks
---
I nvr played a hunter but i do have a lvl 46 lock. I would say leveling a lock is very different from hunter, our pets cant keep the aggro. Sure you can put 2 dots and wand but that will take forever to kill a mob. Most efficient leveling spec for lock is called drain tank, you face tank mobs while drain their life, your pet just provides dps and act as a mana battery. It’s pretty easy, you kill stuff very fast and has zero down time. Lock is also super good at solo elite quests because of fear.
---
You sure? I always thought magic resistances reduced the damage taken from that school of magic but did not affect full resist chance as the ‘resist’ you see when casting a spell is the equivalent of missing the spell.  
---
Therefore spell hit chance reduces caster’s spell’s chance to be resisted(miss) but if the target has increased resistance it doesn’t affect the caster’s chance to have their spell resist(miss).
---
However I have no source on this and I’ve been wrong before.
---
Bartender for bars, inventorian for inventory, basicminimap, titanpanel at the top. I like it simple
---
Frost until AQ and Naxx, then fire is optimal. For grinding gold and stuff, stick with Frost aoe.
---
To be fair, as an alliance, if I try to practice shamanism I get ganked and spit on so..yeah, I slay demons.
---
It's important to let the pet attack something until you get the yellow text that you've learned it.
---
Mmm.  I'd love some.  Chocolate chip?
---
the census data shows the facts lol. Your anecdotal experience doesn't override objective facts

Most skips are extremely easy and have very little chance of accidental pull. You probably aren't even be thinking of them as 'skips'. But nobody kills everything in Strat. Nobody. Not even people who say they don't like skipping things.
---
well I have 17 people watching.
---
How can I kill a mage as a rogue? Even with mind numbing poison frost mages just kite me to hell and fire mages will poly me and then burst me with 2 spells.
---
Whats the music? It sounds so familiar...
---
Quick question...
---
Why 1/2 Arcane Subtlety and 2/2 Incinerate over 3/3 Improved Flamestrike, if Flamestrike is at the core of the combo?
---
ie.: Wouldn't [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-50520031200331-203502101120513) be better?
---
Stoneform is the only reliable way to vanish w/ DoT in classic. Thats huge for rogue, its not as huge for anything else. 
---
Escape Artist gives you another means of removing roots / slows, but vanish already does this, and sprint can as well when talented. It is strong, especially versus mages or hunters, but i would argue not as useful as stoneform.
---
It still feels like 50 50 on mograin (even a bit alliance favored)

I believe the 5% glancing bonus is reached at 308+, not 310.

Did you find that information?
---
I feel like you need this macro for almost every ability as a warrior. It’s so clunky manually switching stances otherwise.
---
Either that or the actual attack damage
---
Logs aren't split and the rogue and mage offshoots I've been told are upload errors? Not sure on that. But you can definitely find BM hunter logs by searching.

It's a Star Fox "Corneria" remix, but I'm not sure which one
---
Possibly yeah leveling is kind of a core element of gameplay in MMOs in general but especially in classic. So if leveling isn’t fun to you then classic may not really be your cup of tea I would say but at the same time there is still plenty to do even if you don’t want to level alts. 
---
I think it helps tremendously having a core group of people you enjoy playing with. So getting into a guild and doing stuff with them will get you that extra mileage.
---
2h fury is viable for pve when you get a very good 2h that's better than your 2 1hs.  only pve though
---
Brave opinion and quite original thread too.
---

---
What op said.  Also make sure righteous is up.  If everyone is using aoe the only issues should come from a rogue or warrior targeting one mob.  In my experience judging that target should do the trick.  If that doesnt work you may just want to stun.  Allot of time people forget that ret aura works on allies and actively builds threat for them.  Remind groups that the best place to be when they draw aggro is right next to you inside your consecration.
---
Well yeah they want to make money. Its.... a problem with the core concept of popular = more of itself. Sometimes when i'm playing a game i'll notice a small feature or detail and think "they could've completely left this out of the game and it would've sold just as well." and it makes me really glad that the developer or whoever decided to put that little detail in.
---
You can't attribute every nugget of quality to sales or success so theres this weird imbalance between the two.
---
It may also be there was someone else there on his threat table you weren't able to see, but I don't know. Could also just be bugged.
---
Same. I just didn't have the time to properly cultivate it. Friendship dissolved as well but due to a hack. Did you hop on with the new guild?
---
I'm Ally, all I personally ever see are pre-60 shit being spammed in LFG. The only time I see stuff like UBRS/LBRS (I've never seen an MC or ONY LF-pugs) is on fri-sat-sun

---
The census data also didn't account for inactive players for a long time. Sure man you definitely know what its like to play on the server you don't play on too smart for me. Guess we'll just keep bitching about blizzard shit in our own food and then continue to eat it.

So its blizzards fault everyone wanted to play horde on Herod? Many issues stated are the communities fault. Most knew before the launch of Classic that in pvp, horde traits were optimal and most would take that route for such. What did they expect? Most would take alliance to benefit their pvp? No. Doesnt happen like that.
---
If you were really a pimp you would've had your epic mount already. Poser detected.
---
If I don't engage as an enhancement shaman, what pvp match ups should still be easy wins? Maybe I just suck now, but I remember enhancement being better 15 years ago
---
If you don't even see the loot window with auto loot on, it's working as intended. Sometimes I just see it flicker for a second, but usually you don't see it at all.
---
Tranq shot just makes it easier, but in BWL and Naxx Tranq is super important again.
---
The main reason hunters are dragged along is due to the fact with no hunter any hunter gear that drops would be literally wasted
---
Same here, I just added every decent tank I ever ran with to my friends list, so I always have a handful of tanks available to tank for me when I'm looking for a tank.
---
Still, tanks (or anyone else, really) who are building up a group for an instance (or raid) are free to set their own terms/rules. More often than not, it will take slower for their group to fill, but the group will fill sooner or later.
---
What's inappropriate is when those rules aren't disclosed as fast as possible.

Does anyone know if Recipe: Transmute Undeath to Water is dropping? Haven't been able to find it on AH or see anyone post about it.

So there's the rub. I'm currently clearing all of MC and Ony on a weekly basis, so I'm certain most things will be upgraded OTHER THAN the hoj, so I feel like I should stick it out for that. Agree?
---
How is its community?
---
you had me at ***free food***

I purchased it last night actually. Ask your Mom, she was there
---
What? Slang, especially now, can take months to evolve. I remember in high school out of nowhere everyone was saying "salty" for mad. Lots of people, especially younger people, can find new meanings for words and have it stick. 
---
I would bet sooo much money that the majority that use bis "incorrectly" know exactly what is stands for and the true meaning behind it. They're just trying to be a little funny and edgy, but it's nothing to get upset about. 
---
But I don't care about BiS specifically, I'm more annoyed over the fact that there is a pattern where Reddit LEAPS on the opportunity to correct someone, in an effort to briefly feign superiority while ironically revealing their insecurity. I'm a hypocrite, I do it too, it just gets fucking obnoxious seeing it all the time. 
---
Sorry, I don't mean to take it out on you, or any one in this thread (it IS technically not what the acronym means). I just see the behavior everywhere on here and it's like the straw the broke the camel's back.
---
I mean it's pathetic from him
---
But how comes that you actually checked his post history
---
I never said it was better than BM, just more fun and more beneficial to your team in dungeons. Aimed shot does not cost that much mana and if you know how to play this class you will be absolutely fine. Beastial Wrath has a cooldown so it will not always be there when you get ganked especially when you’ll be using it on cooldown to kill mobs. Aimed Shots that don’t crit don’t do bad damage? If you’re using a good weapon that is slow you will do lots of damage. I can send my pet at two mobs, while it attacks the first one I can straight up obliterate the other mob before it can even reach me. Also my shots crit quite a lot you are acting like crits barely happen but how would you know when you don’t level as MM? You’re speculating and it’s obvious by your out of mana comment. 
---
If you don’t suck at hunter and know what gear and weapons to look for you will absolutely shine. Do you top damage meters in dungeons as BM? Because no class can even come close to my damage in dungeons even if I’m a lower level. Not to mention you will be buffing everyone else’s damage at the same time. BM is for the Huntards who want to sleep the whole way to 60 xD the ones who want to have fun, be gods in PvP, and beneficial in dungeons will spec MM.
---
Eh, really two buffs with Prayers. One if you use Inner Focus.
---
I find the mana issues as a priest aren't bad at all, especially compared to a shaman or a mage.
---
GET UP GET UP GET UP GET UP
---
Does a hunter at 60 farm gold better than a mage? How does a hunter primarily farm gold? I wanted an alt for my resto druid 60, and i like both classes. I don't really want to run instances or anything on it either (if it can be avoided). I assume that hunters aren't super gear dependent if BM spec farming. Mage just seems like the king of gold farming. If its close, i probably prefer hunter though, i just don't want to depend on AH prices.
---
Iceblock?
---
That seems the likely situation, then. I use the macro more often, so maybe I was incorrect about using a straight keybind on lowbies.
---
Does anyone know if Conjure Food Rank 7 is in the game yet? I haven't seen it drop and never see it in the AH so was wondering if it's even out yet.
---
If he wasn't fast enough to ice block / ice barrier / blink / coldsnap / block and shield again, its his fault. Everyone levels as frost and they have several ways to escape death.
---
Hahhaha omg thanks for the laugh holy shit this is terrible. Fucky little twink if I ever did see one.
---
I'm ally, at 60 I've not seen any other hunters doing shit outside of UBRS / MC / Ony
---
That is possible? I thought you can only cast it once
---
Lol ya
---
It's super hard to "forget" and not do something you know is good. Purposely playing unoptimally feels bad.
---
Straight up put a fee on your service. When people ask me to heal a dungeon I tell them between 15-25g and I'll do it. I don't need anything except gold and im greedy with gold. If they say no to the gold I ask for all blues not needed to be passed to me and 10g if everything is needed
---
Noooo gtfo. Don’t tell people about Atiesh 8*(
---
Nope, a lot of my guildies are just starting alts and twinks now. There will always be lots of low level players. It's even better now to level than it was right at release because you won't be fighting for mobs. Playing right at release was just a fun nostalgic event.
---
Man, I'd wear that get up all day at 60. Classic tranmog would be a nice addition.
---
It's really so dumb. I have fights in MC where some weeks I'll be number 5 on dps because I got crits and no resists and some weeks I get resisted 5 times in a row and barely beat the ret pally. Nobody should care about performance as long as the bosses die and you aren't wiping the guild consistently. Hell, we have a very good fury warrior that regularly gets DI trolled by our paladins during Golemagg just so the rogues can out dps and heckle him.
---
Yea im sure ppl who cant even farm up devilsaur are going to somehow farm up titanics before AQ. Titanics come out same phase as AQ.
---
Liked and Subbed. I needed a good laugh today. Get this to the top so others have the YT link!
---
No you can sell the disenchant goods on ah but not vendor.
---
Learn to Read / do Maths, k thx.
---
Oh yeah because thats such an isolated incident. I've tanked and wife has healed for most of WoW (BfA is the only xpac i haven't played) and for like..... 8 years I cannot get 99% of players to talk in dungeons, or at all really. People bullshit in chat sometimes but the game is so socially redundant and everyone knows it.
---
Classic is where all the people who wanted to be social are now playing because the game is attuned to that kind of gameplay.
---
&gt; Druids are in a complete different world than the other classes
---
I've mained druid since vanilla and played other classes (only after Cata).
---
Since the only character I leveled during vanilla was a druid and every other character mostly through Dungeon Finder in later expansions. I never realized how difficult some classes have it.
---
I had a weird experience the other day grouping with a priest in Swamp of Sorrows. We needed to get to the other side of the zone for a quest we were doing together and I decided that it was annoying to keep running ahead of the priest, so I just stayed in cow form for the whole run.
---
I literally said, "Wow... you just walk. Like you have no choice but to walk at 100% speed the whole way there." Total epiphany and wild realization at how good it was to be a druid.
---
I mean I knew that self heals, and soloing elites and group quests was a perk, but never realized how long a walk could feel at normal speed.
---
I get that you really really want to blame people for wanting to play the faction they prefer instead of trying to single-handedly fix blizzards mess of a game but this is a bit too much mental gymnastics for me
---
Im also on herod horde, and I've witnessed several alliance raids on kargath and grom gol.  
---
The thing is, there's literally no incentive to go out and do it right now apart from fun.  And it's a load of fun, but there's also a lot of gear and money grinding to be had.  It'll be better with honor.
---
That said I've noticed the same from alliance, they'll either just give up or rely on a 3:1 advantage before attacking.  It still makes for fun, getting the barov trinket last night they kept coming after me and my friend.
---
Being lazy has nothing to do with it, it saves quite some time where you can pinpoint exactly where the chest is located, no need to ask trainer since you can check on wowhead what chests for what lockpicking lvl are.
---
I can assure you it's not 10 minutes
---
Whelp, you're not my boi now.
---
Uh....sort of. Idiots never \*really\* go away, but the game punishes them more and more at higher levels. At level 20, people are often doing their very first dungeon runs, and are understandably bad at it. Some learn from this. Some don't.   
---
The key's to find the groups with the former and you'll be alright.
---
"Gotta make that epic mount gold somehow" and "I purchased it last night" Pick one. You cant even talk smack right, Alliance player detected.
---
I didn't find disenchanting greens or blues from sub 40 items profitable at all.
---
What's funny is that you see wow forum posts asking,  "Why are alliance players unhappy?"  What do you mean?!  The faction balance issue just carried over from retail to classic.   The first year of BFA was shit for alliance.   Then there  was horsegate and being the butt of every blizzcon joke and The Night Was Warrior losing to undead with a bow...Its a terrible time up be alliance.
---
Shatter is only 50% extra crit though
---
They counter you, it will be tough. Real answer is probably a combination of pvp trinket (phase 2?), abuse blind, vanish and other cooldowns, improved sprint, get lucky and resist.
---
Good gear helps considerably
---
Imagine investing hours into it BEFORE checking the prices, but still thinking you were gonna be rich. Valuable life lesson.
---
That could work. Sneaking and stealing stuff is just so fun... Maybe another way would be to not sell or use stolen goods and just hoard them somewhere.
---
There's a handful of flexible points thats up to preference, but 1 pt for 20% threat reduction on AE is a huge value.
---
Imp flamestrike is just bad value, especially if you have shatter, and the spec I linked is designed to be viable for single target too, not just AoE.
---
What silver0113 said
---
Item reserves
---
as a human rogue, your hit % required is a little under 6%.  hit past that is still good but crit is going to be more valuable.  
---
agil is slightly behind 2ap, but gets better the more ap you already have. 
---
str=1ap
---
how much agil vs 1% crit on a gear is the harder thing to answer though.  29 agil give 1% crit and 29 ap.  so i would think around 17 or 18 agil is likely on par with 1% crit but the scale will adjust with your gear
---
Did the quest, got rep for all horde faction
---
"The games so dead No one plays it, It will never be the same"
---
*Me a planetside player* Yeah hehe I guess wow has dropped in playerbase
---
Yeah, I suppose. I'm a fresh 60 with barely any gear, so I'll still have quite a while where I *do* use it like that. And personally I like having control over when I use which (rank of a) spell. I tried the macro which automatically chooses between Charge and Intercept depending on combat and I really disliked that one.
---
That's a dumbass suggestion, it wont fix anything, so many people have spent so much time on their characters to reroll or transfer to dead realms.
---

Everyone should need BoEs. Beats the ninjas, and it's not like you can't turn it into gold and an upgrade for yourself.
---
Because people made a choice on what server they wanted to be on and what faction. Blizzard can't make you pick alliance that's on you. But sure lets keep blaming blizzard for not deleting your character and forcing you to make alliance.
---
&gt; we think they were running five layers of 3,000 each for a server cap of 15,000

lol nope. Many servers were in double digits. Especially early on

Awesome. Freggin subbed

"Can't get in trouble for dpsing the wrong mob if you nuke the crap out of EVERY mob!" - Mages

Nah, you're doing a fine job IMO. The math is there. Scroll down. You'll find it.
---
^ This. SPriest even in blues will destroy people. The problem with shadow is mana, the survivability for pvp is easily #1.
---
Does the DW side of the table apply to tanks using one-handers and shields?
---
So the items that are on 1(pre-raid) is the items that i should get before MC and Ony?
---
this, if I die in any circumstances as a mage, I know its all down to me.  Even in a raid I expect no heals, if I get one great.  
---
The fact is the mage should never have had the boss on him, that is where the blame lies.
---
Why would anyone want to watch cancer in motion?
---
I agree ganking is fun, but part of wpvp is the paranoia of "Will the Rogue cherry tap me after I nearly died to King Dickus?".

Please, both of you, continue.  This is going great!

Once again at a loss of what to play, got a hunter to 60 didnt really enjoy it that much after 2-3 weeks but might go back to it.
---
Been thinking of rogue alot and it something very appealing about them but i started leveling a priest with plans to go shadow since they seems really strong and is a rare class but at 20 i started thinking of a rogue yet again and at 30 it started getting real slow so I lost the motivation. 
---
What do you guys think? Is rogue the definite choice if ur mainfocus is going to be PvP?
---
I’m a Dwarf Hunter and DDDDDUURRRRRRR
---
Your toolkit is still pretty empty at level 20 leveling prot will make you a better tank in the end. Play with stance dancing and tab targeting
---
is it really that hard to corpse run in? genuinely asking because I haven't done DM. Is there a gate that has to be opened or something which requires time? If not so what you die once or twice and then you're in

There's some rando every so often who remember that reputation matters... but forget that flaming people in trade chat and whining like crazy when they don't get absolutely whatever unreasonable thing they want is going to get you nowhere.

I am on mobile.

I just google the names of the items I'm not sure about and find the wowhead page telling me which quest it belongs to.
---
Best anime
---
So to make sure I have it right, it just checks if you've created 5 instances in the last hour based upon the time they were opened at?
---
So if I do 5 Arena runs in 50 minutes, I would wait 10 minutes before being able to start another one?
---
frag videos are back baby
---
A small suggestion for any tank over level 30 having a hard time. Paladin healers have Blessing of Salvation. It reduces the threat that player generates by 30%; a lifesaver. Request that they put it on every DPS class, regardless of what buff that class may want. Mage asking for Wis? NOPE Salv.
---
If they're pulling all the time, salv away.
---
I'm not kidding lol. I have all my bis gear to lol
---
I use discretion personally but definitely don’t expect others to do the same lol. You’re totally right tho. It’s war.
---
Well that is true though I don't know why you would laugh about such a minor correction. I'm talking about when server queues stabilized. I don't know for a fact but the general understanding at the time was that there were 5X3K layers.
---
Just my perspective as a random player, I've never had any reason to use it. High fees and I've never had anything worth selling to the other faction.
---
Oh yeah!
---
Sure,
---
Mages - you're likely going to end up frost nova'd near the start of the fight.  Your goal here is to not end up poly'd or eating frostbolts.  While frost nova'd, start purging the mages buff but be ready for him to turn and cast.  Use R1 earth shock on his first cast, ground the next cast and by then you should be out of nova and able to run toward him for the kill.  It's important you cycle interrupts and grounding totems to not take any damage and it's a pretty easy matchup.
---
Rogues - I'm not sure what level you are but it's difficult at low levels.  Once you get higher up, I'd reccomend getting a shield and an addon to track kick cooldowns.  You'll want to get free from his stuns, put your shield on and juke his kick before healing, trying to cleanse poisons and kiting as best you can.  Keeping distance doing damage with fire totems / frost shock is the best success I've had.  Trying to stand toe to toe with a rogue w/o overpower doesnt work.
---
Warlocks - Similar idea to mages, first thing is get a tremor totem down ASAP and keep an eye on it (good locks will wand it down).  After that I usually try to time my grounding for AFTER they've dropped their 3 dots because then it'll eat a spell cast or death coil.  Keep an eye on your health, and if you get low a simple grounding -&gt; Healing wave is easy to get off.  Usually end up healing more than most fights but most times I end up winning.
---
Hunters - roll into a ball and begin to cry while the bad man has his way with you.  Honestly, I'm still working on pvp vs Hunters, I really really struggle with it at the moment.
---
I'm so sad that my favorite hunter talent is bugged and no one seems to acknowledge this. The talent Entrapment has a 25% chance to root your target per tick of freezing, explosive or immolation trap. This was huge for me in vanilla in PvP and many PVE situations
---
I'm not the person you're replying to, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to me that a company who owns an IP as large as Warcraft would plan plot points quite a few years down the road. Especially with that IP's most recognizable characters.
---
Even more so when you're riding the wave of the highest profits you've ever made as a company, with no end in sight. Illidan was always slated to return. "There must always be a Lich King..." etc.
---
So it's only locked for that 60 minutes? EX: I run 5 instances in 30 minute, I have to wait another 30 minutes until I can run another?
---
It’s not you. It’s me.
---
There is some serious elitism about PvP servers. I've seen so many posts about people who play on PvE servers are not actually playing wow. There are so many subtle jabs at us PvE players that you might not notice if you aren't the one being targeted.
---
&gt;Durring my time with that game i came to learn that the Horde simply had cooler more level headed heros. Thrall, Cairne, Rexxar and Meisha.  
---
Just imagine where the Horde would be if Thrall didn't resign or fuckin' Magatha Grimtotem didn't fuck shit up or Vol'jin had a reign greater than 30 seconds. I wanna see that Horde! Oh lordy the timeline if Cairne had lived to finish fucking Garrosh up? I need to stop thinking about this, it's too depressing to have hope.

You didn't.

Either...

* a) You understand rule 5, but decided to disregard it, because you thought rules don't apply to you.

...or...

Which is it?

Dafuq? It's not working?

You'll be fine man. It's fun and escape artist is so op for sure!!

kite it or ice block? its slow as hell

Thanks for sharing.  Sorry about your lack of self control or whatever.

I put my YouTube at the end for those that may be interested, tbf I have gained some subs from this :)
---
Hey everyone look at this Disney casual! Get the flex pass and just plan out your day like a pro. No need for fast pass bro, cmon! What are you some sort of Disney scrub?
---
I picked Horde on Westfall because of the same criteria. I did have a passing thought ... Westfall is an ally zone hope the server isn't completely dominated. Nah it'll be fine! Started to level, plenty of people around starter zones and when I hit the Barrens it sure seemed lively. Completely forgot about the population (im)balance until I hit STV. Wow good luck doing any of the mastery quests. 
---
I hope I don't regret choosing this server when I hit 60. If transfers open up, I will probably take it. Sucks cuz I found a super chill guild...
---
yeah I was leveling as an enhance shaman and could not get groups at all. switched to ele and suddenly I had no trouble.
---
Sure is. I was messing around with Eagle Eye macros while camping Broken Tooth. My preferred macro is as follows:
---
showtooltip
---
/cast [@cursor] !Eagle Eye
---
hashtag goes before showtooltip but Reddit formatting is a mystery to me.
---
Best part about making these is the different memes that everyone gets
---
How close were the bosses when you FD'd? Distance plays a role
---
Well yes, every class has to dismount before fighting. In the fringe case of mages AoE farming and gathering mobs via mount, and using both trinkets slots, maybe use trinket menu?
---
On pve you can
---
kite or iceblock
---
fully aware of the fight, the spell can be removed from the tank, you can set a pet to take 2nd on agro list or even a rogue, trigger happy mage either way.
---
"Excellent for those who like to **damage**"
---
😂
---
Not to mention you can tell it to pause the update anyways.
---
Are you a moderator?
---
I mean they do kinda share gear. I have a questing set of gear and only throw on the cloth for dungeons.
---
No most everyone can do that. But it’s not the instant win everyone thinks it is. And the experience I’ve had on stalagg is yeah they’ll break out of the fear but they don’t carry resto pots to get rid of dots or have any idea what a felhunter does to them. They just listen to what the YouTube videos say.
---
Fuck me get over it
---
And now I am genuinely lost.  You were the guy saying you were a real player and not a horde casual like me, so I’m just not sure where we go from here
---
Thanks mate, you predicted it!

full aware, mage can kite due to move speed of boss, also has blink and iceblock.  the sleep can be removed and you can also set up ANY other class to be 2nd on threat list.
---
True, but since Blizzard is desperately removing every way we were trying to use to get an informed decision it makes me think its worse than I initially thought.
---
Sounds meticulous but it's probably the best method, thanks
---
reminder on your phone?
---
Huge for WPvP, thanks
---
Everyone is hunting some rare cat, my alt hunter and SirBacon are having a great time instead.
---
I LOVE the weak side - I get instant BG queues.
---
slapman indeed.
---
Do you really think this video is xD random humor? Sorry homie
---
Don’t thank me, just keep up the good work!
---
And on Dreadmist people use the Trade channel.
---
WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS FROM MY DUDE...
---
Blizzard stated last week that all servers are down to 2 layers at the very most - there is no 3rd layer even on Herod (I play on Herod as well).
---
Bruh you get the flex pass year round pass like me, the master of Disney, and then instead of pay for the $55 fast pass you just get so good at knowing your Disneyland that you plan your day so perfectly that you don't lose a minute of time waiting in line just *like* the fast pass but without paying for it.
---
Like, yeesh!
---
Not on immolation or explosive traps. It actually removes the explosive trap dot component instead of rooting the target. Works fine with frost traps
---
Why would a horde player delete their character that they've worked on for 20+ days /played, with their name, playing alongside their friends, the gear and rep they've grinded...to try fix a problem that they didn't create?
---
A lot of people are so deep into the game that rerolling is simply not an option.
---
Pls I need my insulin
---
I keep going through the motions of quitting classic as I am in the same predicament but then I make myself romanticize the game even more an come back with a vengeance. It's a vicious cycle.
---
Honestly the best way I have found to keep it from ruining my life is by moderating the amount I allow myself to play, have discipline and be strict with myself. It is alot more enjoyable when you do get on this way aswell as little things don't frustrate you as much an you appreciate your time.
---
I find I think about WoW the most when I'm not playing it and trying to give it up, especially when I'm in bed. Its teeth are sunk in deep and pulling them out slowly but getting my fix is more healthy, for me, anyway. Good luck mate!
---
Yeah but if the server pop is 90/10, good luck ever 1v1ing, which is kind of the point.
---
Do you like hot pockets or pizza rolls more?
---
I am an lvl48 enchsham engineer 285 on pve server. Should I craft myself this shield for raids?
---
I don't want any flying areas. I don't want existing areas to be reformed, ala cata. I don't want a higher level cap. Ever.
---
If they add new content that doesn't invalidate old content, that is geared towards 60s or lower, fine. I know a few quests were added in classic areas in the TBC era, and largely, they were alright. But that's small stuff. It still feels like classic.   
---
I would also like layering to go away. Mostly I don't care about updated skins and textures. Unless it's somehow causing a bug or something, meh? Ugly items are a normal part of classic.   
---
I definitely do not want hellfire penninsula pvp or a revamped combat system. I could see minor, MINOR tweaks to meme specs. Moonkin, ret pally...things that are terribly unloved. Tweak a number or two to make it work a bit better, maybe add some alternate itemization via  quest or something. But don't change all the abilities around.
---
You'r
---
I use Vegas Pro 14, I've been doing it as a hobby on and off and recently decided to go all in. It's just learning it over the years really :D you can see here on my channel I've definitely improved over the past year: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA
---
With this setup how are you not a druid?
---
I wouldn't bother yet. It's pretty low for melee as many of the enemies are 55+ so you'd be pretty restricted. Just make sure your lockpicking is 250+ and you can start doing BRD however you want at 54+
---
(The locked doors can be opened with lockpicking 250+ instead of doing the fineous quest line which involves killing a boss way in the back of BRD)
---
I believe I saw it on my server last night.
---
Don’t knit that any of these words mean
---
I feel sorry for you, really I do.
---
An entitled mage with a superiority complex? But those are so rare! /s
---
Welp, sorry then. I read this sub daily but I guess I have missed it.
---
Get over yourself
---
Shouldn't take but 10 mins. Quick Google. Click the Wowhead Classic link. See what's it's associated with. Delete or keep.
---
Legend bro thank you!
---
I could see it.

“We have the greatest buffs, don’t we folks? The hoooorde think shamans have the greatest buffs. They don’t. Their terrible, okay? Believe me. Blessing of Kings is going to be yuuge”

When you get to searing gorge start the chain at bottom of thorium point, the two humans, you can get 2% hit shoulders as a q reward
---
No one cares?
---
Yeah guilds like APEs are really not invested in PvP. What a silly comment lmao
---
Haha congrats dude!
---
I've lost three so far :(
---
There are elephants on copper when you loot it
---
Only ever played horde.  Quit almost 10 years ago.  Came back for classic and couldn't find any old friends that play.  Rolled horde out of reflex...  Kinda wish I rolled alliance to experience the other side which I never did.  There are quest chains I've never seen and story lines I'll never know.  Life is too busy to contemplate grinding to 60 again even though I'm still only 41.  Maybe one day I'll do it...  But I hate starting from scratch on a server broke and lonely.
---
The thing about warlocks is that they are the biggest fucking pussy class in the game. You just fear and dot and win. No skill required. As soon as you encounter someone with a restorative potion or their pvp trinket you get ass raped in seconds.
---
I got 2 of them this morning while killing the satyrs in Felwood. Was farming felcloth and surprised when 1 dropped. Then an hour or so later another one!
---
DOO EEET.
---
Priest doesn't really shine til you get some utility spells that most people probably find useless. But I totally love Levitate, Mind Vision, even Mind soothe and of course Mind Control.
---
So subtle.. yet we all noticed it and knew lol
---
are you a fat person
---
You obviously dont hunter
---
I agree friends are the primary reason I play.
---
I honestly don't know how people play on their laptops. Awful. More power to you I guess!
---
Anyone aware of how much city reputation is available? This presents a good opportunity for people to reduce the gap on their desired mounts.
---
I hear megumin i upvote
---
This, holds so much value. thank you Arnhermland
---
Nice use of a screen capture with cropping as well.
---
I also played on Shattered Hand for 8 years non-stop, and intermittently after that, and never saw either of these guild names before. So this gave me a good chuckle.

For me it's:

Night Elf, Orc = Dwarf, Paladin horses, Troll, Undead, Human, Tauren, Gnome
---
Haven't really seen the lock one so I couldn't comment on it.
---
The night elf epic speed ones do look a bit worse than the 60% though, the half face plate they have looks derpy af
---
Really...I've read about so much WOW drama here on reddit and I haven't experienced any of it in game (playing on Atiesh). Everyone I've grouped with or talked to have been super nice , no dungeon aoe mage drama, etc.
---
RP Servers. Players tend to favor Alliance over horde when it comes to RP stuff.

Maybe a faction hoodie or metal poster?

---
I’ve got full Pre-BiS and enchants but seem to be doing less than I was previously with more stats and less hit chance... is 9% hit chance in raids actually worthwhile in raids? I see people with greens in Molten Core doing similar dps to mine
---
No I just dont play with shit warriors :)
---
I have a macro to make water on left click, and drink on right click. Very useful.
---
But I thought everyone have been saying that LW isn’t any good?? Today actually I made a hunter happy by making him a quiver.
---
Same, never had to downrank fort on newbies, but maybe I'm misremembering. Never saw that error message though.
---
Yup on the todos, just need to find how to identify an instance ID or reset instances event.
---
do you seriously think farming for titanic will be a problem when you literally know its coming?
---
Hijacking a little, I want to start an ally toon, what eu pvp server is balanced but not empty? I like queues, then I know people is there
---
bonuses to alliance? Then that will be perceived as punishing horde players. You cannot award one side without the other feeling disgruntled.
---
Incentive for one is penalty for the other.
---
What if they increased the level cap to 70, added some new zones, new content, and maybe even a new race. They could call it “The Burning Crushade” 
---
New name = brand ass new game
---
Asmon and his army have rolled horde on my server. We already had a 3 to 1 ratio, now it's probably 4 (or more)to 1.
---
&gt; Missing on 1% of your hits is better if your damage is increased enough to compensate.
---
This, 100%. People here are saying hit cap at all costs, but that's just not right. Hitting for 2% more while hitting 1% less often is still a net gain. 
---
That said, keep your hit gear around and reevaluate periodically, as hit scales the best of all stats until you cap.
---
Everyone hates The Enclave.
---
Yeah compiled his pvp into one video. If you play rogue there's lots of tricks you can pick up on watching this.
---
I like the way he threatens that he will never group with you again.
---
I guarantee you, if you get into a group that he's in, and say that you are leaving because you won't group with that mage, that he'll get kicked faster than you can hit leave group.
---
Mages right now are a dime a dozen.
---
That literally not even the topic at hand. Lmfao you think a random clickbait YouTube video is proof?? Hahahahahaha dude. I bet you didnt actually play BC. Calling me lazy then linking to the most generic clickbait crap.
---
I wish I could help you google how not to be retarded but its not possible. Poor thing.
---
probably to charm a mob

Lol, I do have a desktop PC. This is my travel Laptop but we got a new dog recently and trying to get her house trained. Easier to do it in our open living room/kitchen compared to our cramped computer room.
---
How do you remove the sleep?
---
Doesn’t play on mobile app

&gt; but I mainly use it to prevent mobs from resetting when going for big AoE pulls on spread out mobs.

You have changed my life

its upto 19 on my server (bigglesworth)

Clicking yes on reset doesn't appear to reset, also the window doesn't close when you hit yes. (edit: nevermind it was just really inconsistent, and I suppose resetting is not optimal... hadnt read the rest of the github, feels like sessions start/pause should be part of the UI but not reset, since you wouldnt want to reset too often on specific farms).
---
LONG LIVE THE ENCLAVE
---
I'm very happy I leveled up pretty fast on kromcrush after launch. I got ganked a lot from 20-35 or so, but after that everyone was quite polite. Plenty of /waves and moving on in Feralas and Tanaris. I even helped a horde lock with that damn chicken quest since the madman was doing it solo and almost died
---
Test the waters, make level 1 toons and run to the capital cities and ask trade how they feel about the faction balance. You're not gonna get accurate statistics, but at least they'll be able to give you anecdotal data. I heard Incendius and Benediction populations are fairly close for US east.
---
Can I have your stuff.
---
Why waste a talent point on an invaluable utility talent when you could spend it something that increases frost damage by 1%?
---
I don't know the numbers, but as far as i've always known striving to hold that 9% hit chance is extremely important
---
Very mystical
---
Yes, check out the 'melee damage and you' guide somebidy posted here today for more details.

It's not funny

Talked to another. He found 2 in 1 hour for his guild. After 3 weeks of farming those dragons I wanted to throw up a bit

Team 5 adding new modes in Hearthstone
---
Muiltiple guilds were sure it was around and multiple guilds were wrong. There is absolutely no reason to believe the number of layers would have gone up at all let alone to as many as 5 as you previously stated just because of Dire Maul releasing.
---
Your logic is that because someone wasn't said at nearing exact moment of your comment(s) that it is therefore invalid because it is from a different time frame.
---
Blizzard is very clearly trying to cut down layers as much as possible currently, likely in order to announce at Blizzcon a release date for Stage #2 and potentially Stage #3, so going back up in layers when they are actively trying to get people to leave and transfer off the mega-servers would be counterproductive to their cause.
---
what shield is this?
---
Yeah raid pugs have been popping off for sure, seems like every night I'm on there's an MC pug advertising
---
Rogues can and do get pissed at feral druids rolling on leather. There's significant overlap there. And it's quite common for feral druids to end up healing because a healer's needed.   
---
It's better to talk about gear up front, but ultimately, if nobody brings it up initially, you gotta expect that whoever needs gear will want it if it drops.
---
More, considering he likely went to grab a beer and have a piss!
---
Same boat here. I miss Mulgore I must have leveled 15 Taurens back in the day
---
What is farming argent dawn rep useful for?
---
Where did you find a Kripparian mask?
---
That's what VE is for.
---
So true.
---
Rattlegore, Drama Free since 93, or maybe I just don’t notice it.
---
Sure. This is what u need to do. Place both character in booty bay. Say you want to give dwarf 100g, you log on ur dwarf first, sell a linen cloth or anything in booty bay ah for 100g, then log onto ur troll, go to ah buy that linen cloth for 100g. Now your troll just spent 100g, and ur dwarf just got 100g from ur troll. This is how you transfer money cross faction, i think you can only do this on a pve server since pvp server will not let you create character in different faction.
---
Great PvP Class
---
Great DPS in raid

Great class for dungeons

Best farmers in the game right now (I think?)
---
Portals/Teleport/Water OP
---
What about the orcs born into captivity? Did they earn it? And when the horde left the eastern kingdoms for kalimdor who followed? Alliance. The entire 3rd war is of alliance aggression. You justify our eeadication because of past events. Thats racism.
---
Some friends wanted to play on a pvp server, to which I said we should roll horde. Friends of friends refused to play horde and would only play alliance, which is fine with me because I love paladins. Except, they wanted to play alliance on a pvp server... I tried to explain how much it would suck, but they brushed aside my warnings. So, now I get to be outnumbered 2:1 in the best case scenario and frequently find my questing zones overrun with raids slaughtering everyone of the opposing faction because nobody took my warning (that exactly what has happened with horde and pvp servers was going to happen) seriously.
---
On the plus side, almost all of those friends still play, so I guess I still rolled the right faction. But I guess I really couldn't have rolled the wrong faction, I have played both and like both.
---
No complaints
---
Apparently farming for devilsaurs a problem for some!
---
Mr. Slave
---
Why quit outright? Wouldn't the better option be to just play less? Set limits for yourself that way you get the best of both worlds?
---
I wouldn't really bother, killing stuff 4 levels above you is so slow, it would be more efficient to just level and make gold faster and by 16 slotters off the AH. traveler backpack is like 20g on my server.
---
Bruh, just heal, or roll lock
---
Only the hardcore min maxxers will care about what pet you run. I have the purple winterspring tiger cause I think it looks dope. Run what you want.
---
You should absolutely continue to use aimed shot and multishot. Aimed shot's cast time is reduced by rapid fire and multi shot will fit between autos even with both rapid fire and improved aspect of the hawk active.
---
Additionally, there aren't any instant cast abilities you should be using at any point during your rotation (assuming we're talking about dungeons/raids).
---
I sincerely hope you enjoy, but man, I cringe now when I think about long sessions using laptops on a table like this. I did it for about 2 years straight for school and work and ended up needing massage therapy for my neck and back. Nothing but raised monitors for me now.
---
From my experience the boon of a hunter is to be fairly consistent and safe. However, i definitely don't feel like I can farm super fast or do any sort of AoE pulls. Mages imo are truly the kings and will always be on the top when it comes to farming gold.
---
Prevents interrupting casts when u click the macro for the second time

I've never heard of this.

Well shit now I’m guna use it and try get others to use it!

time to get her a sub of her own!

Making it for free doesnt mean you wont have to buy the materials.
---
Wow where did I say 5 layers lol?
---
Your logic is that because someone wasn't said at nearing exact moment of your comment(s) that it is therefore invalid because it is from a different time frame. &lt;--- What?
---
This is not about logistics, I was there on it when buff went out around 3 we were looking after 5 for the correct layer...
---
ty man works perfectly
---
Sorry
---
I downloaded titan panel and felt the nostalgia teabag me in the face.
---
Whats a good balanced server
---
How do you expect Blizzard to deal with the fact that 60-70% of classic wow want to be horde? It's a cold hard fact and while there may be in-game solutions, those are the kind of changes they can't do.
---
You can't actually force people with hundreds of hours in the game to abandon their character and make an alliance level 1.
---
Give me Stampi or give me death
---
What is this supposed to be for? Arcane Concentration is pretty important for the zombie farm, and so is Barrier. Is this supposed to be for just grinding normal mobs in the open world?
---
I like this idea!
---
Stampi is love Stampi is life.
---
Cya in a week.
---
Thank you for educating me! TIL.

Oh i just had a thought. Before even the orcs came to azeroth the night elves and their lust for power drove their narcissistic queen Azarha to summon SARGERAS into the world causing the sundering and destroying the well.
---
Actually, when I came to WoW from WC3 I found the whole Retribution tree to be highly questionable, lore-wise. “We must not allow vengeance to become part of what we do,” as Uther put it.
---
Nah didn't start at launch, I'd already be 60 if I did haha
---
Dont relent. Your shadow. Not holy. You damage. Not heal. Dont even put up VE.
---
No it doesn’t, you can just open fear full dots.  Or shadow bolt into full dots.
---
You always wanna save death coil to break a heal, peel them off you, or just to create space
---
Too many complete sentences and lack of spelling errors.

Side note that maybe you’re aware of but perhaps OP is not. There are parental controls you can setup for yourself in your bnet account settings to help with this. You can set restrictions that only allow you to play for a certain amount of time each day or week. You’d have to have the willpower to not turn off your restrictions but it can certainly be used to help break negative playing habits. I would guess it’s easier to stop yourself from playing too much when you’d have to go change account settings that you set up in order to play longer.
---
It happens. And it is really frustrating. I've found wPvP to be totally different to what I was expecting. I've more often been killed by skull level enemies and roaming bands of enemies than by 1v1 skirmishes. It's not usual that either will camp your body (unless you "provoke" them) as they will quickly move on to find the next target. The times I've died to a 1v1, they usually leave me alone when I respawn, even if I encounter them again. I've only had one ass of a player who sat on my body, and then called in skull level enemies when I finally was able to shake him off and return to questing. Then they all then proceeded to sit on my body. For 30 minutes.
---
In my experience, Entrapment only started working once I had 5/5 points. Prior to that, I never had a single proc on all three traps. As soon as it was maxed, I started getting procs on frost trap over its duration. The fire traps now roll once, immediately after they are sprung.
---
On the private server I played on, there was a roll on every fire DoT tick. Also, explosive trap was a persistent debuff, whereas in classic it's like consecrate. If you have a video example of the intended behaviors, share it and I'd be happy to double down on my reporting, for all the good it will do.
---
Another douchebag mage what a surprise.

Sorry to lose ya Simpson

It's almost like you didn't even read the post before commenting.. The answer is not found on the Googles thats why he posted it here.
---
+healing makes you mp-hp ratio better +mana does not. +healing is better.
---
The Speed number on a weapon indicates how many seconds are in between attacks, so a weapon that is 3 speed will be able to swing every 3 seconds, 2 speed is able to swing every 2 seconds, and so on. Drain Life is a 5 second long cast so any weapon should work with it, but if you take too much spell pushback so that you only cast it for like 1 or 2 seconds before getting interrupted, then 3 speed weps won't get their swing in. So it varies.
---
I just hit 60 on Sulfuras. The server is almost perfect, great balance of factions. As for the perceived lack of people, what level are you? I find that on each server the bulk of players are in 1 lvl bracket and you may not notice as many players if you aren't in that bracket as well.
---
yay my server !!!
---
&gt; DAE this game is pretty good?
---
You mad? Get good weapons too fast. Don’t act like you know what you’re talking about lmao
---
Thorium shells/arrows are best arent they?
---
Alliance on Herod are all gonna quit or transfer off in p2 if there are no bg's. lol
---
Thanks! Does the same apply to spell damage?
---
The reason I ask is I've noticed I may crit less when leveling in higher level zones... but I dunno if it's actually true or not.
---
Barry fucks
---
Bleuxmuax or however you spell it
---
Engineers make Thorium Shells, and there's a repeatable quest to turn them in and receive Thorium-Headed Arrows if you use a bow.
---
Some mostly-not-too-useful crafting recipes, but the big thing is shoulder enchants. AD rep is the only source of shoulder enchants in Classic.
---
They aren't very *good* shoulder enchants considering how big the grind is, but if your goal is making numbers go up, this is the only way to do it.
---
Also, when Naxx comes out, you need to be at least Honored to get Naxx attunement, and the cost of Attunement goes down the higher your standing is.
---
I just have /burp macro'd to my Cannibalize. :)
---
It was a weird sentence. He was talking about mages - compared them to warlocks. Then to warriors as a competitor for single target. The last sentence was referring to mages again, holding their 'king of AOE' title.
---
How long does it take to do edits like this, insane :D
---
I see no wrong in his actions.
---
Ret and Prot Paladins aren't team players. Totally selfish specs that bring no extra utility. Holy is the intended raid and dungeon spec and anyone playing the other 2 should be flamed.
---
He's talking about the 20 dps ammo that drops from LBRS I think.
---
I mean. I was about to write a long post trying to figure out the issues you are facing and perhaps offering some advice to help you have fun in pvp as a fellow alliance Herodian that's having a blast in solo pvp.
---
But since you specifically mentioned that we can't change your mind then Idk. Get good?
---
same lol. perks that makes the grind a little less long
---
Can someone explain this more? I read you can apply poison to range weapons and have tried many times to do it manually, but it doesn't work so I just figured that info was wrong. I don't even care about the macro, how does this even work at all?
---
I’d love to put it on everything but there’s an 18 macro limit :(
---
Benediction is definitely not dead. Definitely not &lt;50 players in IF or SW at prime time. Even with the layers, there is almost 50 people in your field of vision if you glance out of the AH, let alone everywhere else in town. Heck, at that time, there is usually 25ish people in freaking Azshara, which is normally a ghost town. 
---
It is not underpopulated by any means. If anything, the fact that it requires layering means it's probably a heavier population server.
---
When your raid group buys the WARRRIOR BEST meta and stacks ten of them, they give up the "dual swords fury bis" mentality and will roll on literally any epic weapon. It's not about the quality of warriors, it's about their quantity of warriors. CHT? Warrior. Spinal Reaper? Workable for 2h fury PVE. Finkle's Fucking Lava Spinner? WARRIOR PRIO. Anything to get rid of dal'rends ASAP apparently.
---
&gt; you can argue that a mage might want to slow roll it to make sure it's not him
---
As a mage, I've found that if a boss is loose, concerningly often the healer's third on the aggro list and is the boss's next target after I ice block. Better for me to stay above him and blink/kite as much as I can before blocking.
---
not to mention the drop rate is miserable. This is definitely something you're better off just farming gold for
---
I leveled from 52-57 solely doing runs (almost 0 questing), only saw 1, lost it to a 7 with a 1
---
Definitely not salty at all... /s (he was happy though)
---
Why do people make posts like this anyways?

Anyone with a psych degree care to chime in, because I see these as pointless ramblings no one really cares about.

Farming that LBRS boss is the only way to get Doomshots for maximum dmg. However it's not necessary and thorium arrows are what you should generally use.
---
Real quick
---
It's not all ranged weapons it has to be thrown.
---
You can just enjoy the game and play it as intended. If you wanna use that exploit man go ahead but don’t go around saying that you don’t like it.
---
You just use Thorium Arrows(17 dps). Doomshot is to much of a pain to farm for very marginal increase.
---
Do you want a 1 time payment of 150 bucks or 10 extra cents on every dollar you make.
---
Incorrect, they are the only shoulder enchant now, but later zg phase 4 adds better enchants to shoulders, and lastly sapphiron drops shoulder enchants.
---
TClap in later patches got bonus threat. In Classic it doesn't even hit more than a few targets, and is only usable in Battle Stance, and costs a lot of precious rage which then lowers your rage production because enemies are hitting slower.
---
Maybe an addon or your internet connection causing it?  I haven't had issues on any NA servers and I primarily play Herod.
---
...to craft something nice for a useless class xDDD
---
"Beyond your wildest dreams"  is relative
---
Which NA server is fun and brimming with life? I want to be social and part of a server community but the classic servers I've tried are silent and antisocial. Any recommendations? Want to feel part of this amazing game phenomenon again
---
I wouldn't mind 5k though. Almost half a year's rent.

&gt; They started calling me daddy after how firm I was

Uhhhh.....

Shaman thirsty as hell.
---
It's around but expensive and rare.
---
I got d/c’d once and lost 4 macros I had created about an hour before, but that is the most loss I’ve experienced.
---
Mages have so much to defend themselves. He's an awful mage.
---
Why did this happen?
---
I thought a macro like this was definitely not possible....isn't item swapping not possible as soon as you enter combat? How can this work?
---
He should’ve blocked, but in that fight yeah, you fucked up not bubbling him / heals until tank woke.
---
why unless you're MT is having threat issues he shouldn't need to be bumped full of hit gear till late BWL once the warriors/rogues get Visk/OH.
---
...nice
---
Lol shoot, there's a similar skele circle in DM isn't there? They reused a lot of these. Either way thanks for the correction!
---
I didn't know about this would of certainly helped a while back but I'm happy with my hours played a week now :)
---
Good information  upvoted
---
you can't actually remove the sleep I'm pretty sure.
---
People really hating on STV in the comments? I thought it was the most fun zone thus far lol (hit 40 last night maybe the next big one will change my opinion)
---
No, they will not.
---
In my experience there are clusters of ore spawn points, and only one node will spawn in that cluster at a time.
---
The game rerolls it, but it’s hidden
---
There are plenty of good mages, but there are many many more who are not.
---
Healers really notice when mages do and don't iceblock. I'd say the good ones are maybe 10% of the population I've dungeoned with.
---
Admittedly this is mostly pugging, you'd expect that better mages are likely running guild dungeons more.
---
Skerem? I noticed the only ones selling devilsaur leather were from onslaught.. Is total disaster an ally guild?
---
Not just crit btw, harder to hit in general.
---
Respect that mate, I won't let you down
---
Mate play for more than 2hrs and get lvl 10 then come back to us ok? You got ur answer
---
That is why I rolled a Druid, 31/20 Feral resto hybrid FTW.
---
And don’t forget Shadowmelded Moonkins!
---
Best assumption is the game just rerolls again randomly and we dont see it. 
---
Some people are dead set believe that it goes alphabetical because thats all they have ever seen, others say its whoever clicked/rolled first... 
---
But it most likely is just another random roll.
---
Wolf is cool as hell, I loved getting the one from AV on my undead rogue back in the day. So bouncy!
---
Odd, that server is pretty Alli heavy. I know being horde on Pagle / westfall is essentially playing single player but at least on Pagle their Alli side lfg scene is boooming
---
I'm on Skeram-Horde and it's felt good. Horde is definitely the dominant faction by a margin but I see plenty of alliance PVPers out and about to the point that I only really tell the faction imbalance when the factions are fighting over something, like the BRD or DM entrances for example (Alliance won't be able to hold the line for too long as more horde show up)
---
Heck, just the other day I saw an ally doing a quest mob I needed to kill so I helped him out since it's pretty tough solo. He /thanked me and helped me complete it once it respawned! Very cool.
---
Capital Cities are pretty bumping and the amount of people that show up when Onyxia Head is dropping is surreal.
---
If you care for PVP, it's definitely pretty popular on both sides to pick fights if it's not just one person on each side so world PVP seems reasonably active
---
I became one of those after I played with too many people from retail who just blow the target up before you even hit it.  
---
Now I just blow targets up before the tank even hits it.
---
With a good group, tanking is easy and your efforts will make the run go so smooth.
---
But literally everyone in the party can do something that makes it look like it's your fault the group is dying.
---
Healers can pop sheilds that deny you rage, they can heal too hard too early, and take all of your aggro.
---
Dps can start off with an AOE that moves everything way away from you. They can use their stuns, knockdowns, fears, and other abilities to  make enemy not hit you and therefor deny you rage. 
---
DPS also has a tendency to "Focus  the tanks target" even though we dont target stuff. We just stack sunder armor and move on to the next target.
---
So the short answer to your question is : No. it doesn't ever get any better. Though you can find better groups.
---
I do around 5 hours a day Monday to Friday so around 25?
---
I don't know if that is sarcastic or not.

Join a grp to help get guildies attuned through LBRS. Keeping losing rolls on gems for the UBRS key. Quartermaster only drops his box.
---
Run UBRS, another reed, no Dalrends, lose the roll on painweaver, again.
---
Check the AH for cheap relic coffer keys. Run BRD pickpocket/vault for gold.
---
Run UBRS some more. No dalrends, lose the roll on painweaver.
---
Run DM, first time for some, run takes a long time, no drops.
---
Do MC or Ony, no drops.
---
Run UBRS, dalrends don’t exist, lose roll on painweaver.
---
Thorium shells / ammos are good, but don't let anyone tell you that vendor ammo won't do - unless they are min/max bitches.   My entire guilds worth of hunters raided standard ammo AQ40 + in vanilla and IT.WAS.FINE.
---
Just a few usable bombs. Nothing much tbh, but maybe I'm missing something. 
---
If you just know a Goblin Engineer you can get all that stuff and not relevel Engineering. 
---
The teleporter can be important for some. Gadget or Winterspring target.
---
I'm glad you noticed :D
---
Hey I saw this Gnome at the club the other night near my house... it's a mens club btw. Nothing sexual, I swear...
---
Do you mean the food book you get from dire maul drops? If so yes it’s in the game
---
doot.
---
With sexual partners, the love and romance goes both ways
---
With pets, the pet gives the love, the other tosses the pet over their head #RIPMILO
---
Don’t forget everyone hates Thottbot and his profiteering! Won’t mention the main since it’s not a call out per se.
---
Ultimately it only really matters in PvP - and only slightly. You can get some cats in Winterspring with 1.2 atk speed, and the rare Broken Tooth with 1.0. But the difference is very minor.
---
It's a current glitch I've noticed to. They only dropped combo points in Vanilla because there wasn't a mouseover function. You technically retargeted, blinded, then switched back to primary target. Since they updated the macro functionality, that doesn't happen any more. Since you're technically not losing target any more, it should not clear combo points. Therefore, a glitch. Hope they fix it soon.
---
If anyone gives me crap about group composition for a druid healer and a druid tank, I ditch them instantly. Another DPS is super easy to find, and tryhards who tell everyone how to play invariably make for an unfun time.
---
I'm herb/engineering with the intention of dropping herb for tailoring in phase 5 for bloodvine.
---
Phase 1 is about early gold earning and the gold you'll spend/miss out on by leveling tailoring is not worth the relatively small upgrade. Get robe of the winter night and use the extra gold towards your epic mount.
---
Help me choose, Reddit. Gonna respec to a holy/disc priest soon. Mostly PvE, gonna do BGs when it comes out. Go Holy heavy (whatever it’s called) or the Power Infusion route!?
---
I found that when I'm being overwhelmed by extra mobs, I'll do

(cancel form) War Stop -&gt; Travel Form
---
Large up gamers 😎
---
&lt;3
---
I feel the same way and so do my friends originally they went ally cause a larger group of their friends all went ally. Me being the most new to the group rolled with them just to not get left behind.
---
Fast forward to them hitting 60 all those friends they thought they would play with bailed and here we are 4 amigos in a random guild. One dude already rolled horde on another server for shits and gigs. Wouldn’t be to hard for me to re roll I never made it to 60 in fact I’m barely 33.
---
But I don’t think they are willing to really grind a new hordie to 60. I think the reason I’m so slow is I really don’t like alliance and it makes it hard to wanna play.
---
Good man.
---
You seem to be pretty committed to your opinion on this and I know no one on the internet changes their mind, but I will simply point out that the DPS on CHT is better than the DPS on DTG, and it has good itemization for fury, and so a warrior need not be an idiot to roll on it. A warrior could either be selfish or strongly believe that the weapon will increase overall raid damage more in his hands than in the hands of any rogue present when it drops. People aren't necessarily idiots for disregarding the soft tender feelings of people they roll against for epics. If you happen to be part of a raid team where the warriors are so tender-hearted, that's nice, but I'm not sure why the internet at large or I specifically should care about the mentality of your specific guild as almost none of us are or ever will be members.
---
Also, I hope a new humor detector drops for you soon because yours is red.
---
Normally add-ons that cause this. If your internet is fine.
---
Also make sure you stay on the WoW window if using dual monitor.
---
This was very informative thank you!
---
K.
---
Nah, that just means I gotta powerlevel to 50 before this event ends...
---
Allegorical, but, the only people I've had bug out on me while I've been healing have been mages. Are mages the asshole class now?
---
i go to him when there's too many people at the first one. Sometimes those 5 extra steps are easier than having to find the auctioneer in the pool of toons
---
which server?
---
Heroic throw was not tbc
---
Can you please stop asking people to use “low key” to describe everything. It’s not being used that often so your complaint is overused.
---
1.Healers are in plenty of demand. 
---
2.Yea 30 min CD is rough but I have had many great runs with druid healers.
---
3+4. Fair enough
---
But understand that healers are basically used to solo rolling on gear. You are double the competition they are used to having. You should really tell a healer that you will take their loot before the run.
---
Also, I would argue that intentionally doubling loot competition for yourself is a harsh punishment to suffer for more engaging gameplay. In theory, you could get all your healing gear in half the time and then tank as you please without upsetting anyone.
---
BB AH is very limited and you won't sell much on there unless the items are rare or don't cross factions
---
or are STV pages
---
You dont think you can get 10 lvls in 2 weeks?
---
After the Devilsaur stuff loses its BiS character, what items can leatherworking produce that are still in demand?
---
Spread the good word my friend! Most people don't know it exists.
---
Why did he go to another server?
---
The moderators are bad and you should all feel bad.
---
Mouseover macros are a must for a healer in my opinion.  I hate grids and this makes it so easy.
---
Is it realistically possible for me to get Exalted rep with Night Elves without doing ludicrous cloth donation quests? I have a level 24 Human priest and my plan was to level through Darkshore, ashenvale, basically all the Night Elf zones where I could accrue rep through questing. If I keep doing this could I expect to reach exalted in a reasonable amount of time?
---
That is so incredibly frustrating after a long FP to get there.
---
I like that people talk to each other magnitudes more than in retail, even allowing for the fact that sometimes the speaker is just an asshole, lol

Terenas got that he was a big deal and he flat out told him to fuck off, he'll defend his land how he sees right.  
---
The same Terenas who flat out refused quarantine despite a plague going on.  
---
Terenas himself was not the sharpest tool in the shed...
---
Neither. I use no form and use spells like a half baked moonkin.
---
Wrath mainly, since I got alot of talents for it and I use moonfire.
---
So I can use almost the same gear, just swapping the +healing for +sp in dungeons and quests.
---
Nice.
---
Does normal undead above 50 drop it cause wow-head says only elites?
---
Context: used Ravager for a pull in BRD with 20+ non-elite dwarves in the torch room before Thaurissan and procced whirlwind on the first hit.
---
Mistakes happen, it’s not that big of a deal and there’s nothing wrong with admitting it, but it’s never okay to talk to another player like that.
---
Gullen is the only auctioneer I use!  ):-D
---
He invites me *into* his tent to transact business!
---
The instances expire exactly an hour from when you reset or exit the group, regardless of if it's your 1st or your 5th.
---
If you leave a BRD group at 2:15, then enter and reset 4 instances at 2:45, 2:46, 2:47, 2:48, your instance lockout will free up at 3:15 for ONE instance. If you enter another instance at 3:16, you'll then be locked to 5 instances again until your 2:45 instance expires.
---
I really dig the succulents
---
Yeah, basically, but exactly when it opens up I am not sure. It is somewhere between when you left the first instance or when you entered it or something like that.
---
45 is the midpoint if you measure "number of mobs my level I would have to kill"
---
Personally, not a fan of merch gifts. A good gift (for me) would be buying the game and attempting to play occasionally. Show interest in his activity. Or at least hang out and talk (about the game) while he plays. Schedule gaming date nights. Learn a bit about it. /shrug
---
You can advertise for whatever you want it's just a matter of whether people are willing to accommodate. Although unless you're on the complete opposite side of the world I think the time you'd save by getting a summon would probably be outweighed by the extra time it would take to find a group with a lock. I suppose if you're okay just questing until you can find a summon it's not bad.
---
I enjoy throwing extra bombs into Stampi's gaggle!
---
Slapman! What is best in life?

I would've got stuck on a table or chair and died

Damn what is that Druid doing?
---
I really like TB as a city in terms of how it’s laid out (miner/eng) so having the forge/anvil smack dab in the center is amazing.

My only complaint is when I want to go to one of the side “bluffs” from the center I GET DISMOUNTED.
---
First World [of warcraft] problems I suppose...

https://www.battlechat.co/2019/08/no-gm-island-in-wow-classic-at-launch/

Hope they do.
---
Honestly no. Even if you only did quest and areas that gave you night elf rep till 60 you’d be hard pressed to get far into honored. Cloth donations are an unfortunate requirement in Classic.
---
Sounds like you are a bad healer.
---
It's waffle o'clock 24/7 around here.

I got it from Satyrs in Azshara a couple of hours ago.

RIP Radus, who I assume just wants to complete his set, but then gets completely surpassed.
---
Man I try to get her into games. Shell play sparingly. Like Mario Party or Kart or weirdly Tiger Woods, something like that shell play. Fairly easy to learn and play. She likes games where she plays against me, she's super competitive. But she would not do well on WoW at all. She thinks it's too nerdy and time consuming and complicated. She likes the games you can pick up, play for an hour or so, then go about your day. She doesn't care if I play, but I want to spend time with her when were both home and have free time.
---
You go first to hell and then you die
---
In this case, I just imagined the mage yelling really hard and having to take powerful breaths in between each yell.
---
Oh, I must've been tired when I read our comment. Didn't see that you said already at 60. Because yeah, I agree. Fuck that.
---
Hey, we also have purple humans.
---
I'm glad I could make you laugh mate, that's why I do it!
---
The Winner Has Been Announced
---
Nice. Nice. Nice.
---
It’s okay lots of people suck at this game
---
Have a wife, toddler, full time job and sports now. Can only get on maybe 10 hours a week if I'm lucky. Hence the level 40 character.
---
I cried a little it's just so beautiful
---
This stuff makes me want to play a lock but then I play one and I just can’t...
---
I still have never heard of this. Fighting over mobs is quite literally the entire point of playing on a PvP server. I've never heard of a ban being given out for contesting a world boss.
---
Hallow's End for 50+ = 16 slot bags from 50+ Undead
---
Hallow's End for casuals = No bags for you.  Buy em from the 50+
---
50+ "I love this event! I can sell 16 slot bags for above market value!"
---
Casuals "I want that bag but I can't afford one"
---
Not so much, but they give city rep for all cities. If you're trying to get one of your other factions mounts, this could save you some money on runecloth.
---
I can't remember the names of the spells but somewhere around either level 80 or 85 for my Mage there was a combination of spells you could use on trash pack pulls where I could get DPS for the pull to be 21,000... it was pretty funny.  You had to do it and then immediately ice block of course because they all came for you.  
---
From the little I remember it was a like a Shatter (but for fire spells) - maybe Combustion? -  that jumped to mobs close by or something along those lines.
---
Lol you must be buttmad goin through my post history on your alt.
---
&gt;Until blizzard simply admits they have to close servers and funnel people into bigger servers, this problem will persist.
---
Yeah, this is pretty much the solution. No meaningful amount of people will ever xfer off the populated servers, we need to be letting the third world countries immigrate in.
---
Farming them just sucks because of the limited respawns and reduction of layers. More people hitting 60 and doing endgame farming results in higher contesting of the same finite resources.
---
Your best bet will be resist gear and hide of the wild, although some demand for devilsaur will persist, because rogues dont replace them til t2 pants and warriirs dont replace them til p3, and the replacement is wsg exalted kegs iirc.
---
Hahahaha loved it. The WATCH OUT WATCH OUT was hilariously well timed. Didn’t want it to end
---
Westfall Horde here, in &lt;Axiom&gt;  
---
We have biggest imbalance of Alliance to Horde ratio but being PVE it’s all good. A few guilds, including mine, have down all content and a few are coming up. Always good pugs going down and lots of helpful and friendly folks. Come join the Horde!
---
Shitty tanking weapon? Isn't it 2nd bis behind thunder fury for fury tanking warrs
---
I hate this post so much.
---
When you _just_ get cat, yes, bear actually does have better damage for typical solo scenarios. You get Ravage and Ferocious Bite in a few levels, that'll fix it. Cat is still better for solo play even with its temporarily lower damage if you got Feline Swiftness though.
---
One easy trick to leveling your Warlock in peace. The Horde hates him!
---
this was seriously terrible. the guy has great editing skills but the content was just terrible.
---
Ok so this isn't server drama but it's drama that pissed me off. Doing LBRS for ony attune and this warlock wanted to do mother's milk. After the group told him we weren't down for that, he decided to do it anyways. I the healer and an intellectual just let him die so poison would go away. He got mad and eye of killrog aggroed the rest of the instance. Kicked him, through him on ignore and used the SS I still had to Rez everyone. Wasted a solid 10min and didn't get to finish his ony attune because he wanted 5k exp.
---
Rotation is key to hunter damage.  Clipping autos will ruin your dps.
---
Yep cant be dispelled.
---

---
First question:
---
What is BDO
---
Hilarious.
---
He just made a horde char, Mcconnell wants to play shaman
---
As someone who loves wow but not merch...
---
You may want to consider getting him a gift basket with his favorite munchies and drinks to enjoy during his play sessions. I'm not sure what your budget is.. but you could include an Amazon or Newegg gift card so he can pick out something nice to improve his gaming setup. Whether it be a new headset, microphone, keyboard, gaming mouse, mouse pad, etc.
---
your'nt
---
Those daggers rogues are combat specced.
---
What the fuck is BDO
---
We got a badass over here
---
The money you'd spend on them is probably better spent on elixirs for str, AP, or agility as far as raw dps.
---
This shit is sooooo fuckin good. I love it.
---
I adjust zoom constantly depending on the situation.
---
Pay them 100g to faction change.
---
Best option is very simple. Free xfers to horde and free entrance from alliance servers.
---
6/8 shadowcraft and 2/2 devilsaur is the best armor pre-raid. I am the top DPS rogue on Incendius and am still using 6/8 Shadowcraft despite getting raid gear. Also dal’rends are way better than other preraid options, especially daggers, so if you don’t have them you need to farm UBRS. My guess is that you also are missing many enchants, specifically 8 agility head and leg enchants, and hopefully not crusader. Your spec might be off and you might not bring the right consumables or acquire any world buffs. The hit% prioritization isn’t suffocating your DPS as much as those other things I mentioned, so to truly help you have to provide more info.
---
You say that, but the Orcs who call Durotar home are the only race with properly intact boots.
---
Love that you enjoyed it mate :)  there's some more here if you're interested https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA

Ahhh ok, thanks!
---
Black desert online is an action mmo wow is a tab target. Personally don’t have any interest in that game.
---
That looks like both a picture and person from the early 2000s
---
They say we only see what we want most.
---
&gt;Save multiple farm sessions, you can switch to a different session and continue from where you left off.
---
Does this mean I can logout to reset the dungeon, and when i login again, I can continue the same session? That would be awesome. Most addons clear the sessions as soon as you logout :(
---
As a healer, my job is to do everything in my power to make sure that the boss dies so that we all get loot.
---
If that means that I conserve mana and let somebody die, so that the tank can live and the boss can be killed -- so be it.
---
Bad healers go OOM healing expendable players and allow the party to wipe.
---
Good healers make the tough calls and prioritize appropriately.
---
Players need to stop taking everything so personally.
---
It's mad seeing comments like this, thank you for the support :D
---
i was gonna try to suggest games, but she sounds like my opposite number, as far as tastes go. but i feel you on wanting to play together. wow classic has been great for me and my boyfriend, and before that we platinumed diablo iii. love of the grind is hard to instill, but so rewarding, haha.
---
does she enjoy watching you play wow?
---
Honestly if all you care about is bigger crits then get that 9% hit, muggers belt and distracting dagger and then prioritize attack power over any other stat. The good news is you can solo farm a barman's shanker.
---
Your overall dps will be poor in raids but that's not what you care about.
---
Cool, get out.
---
Wanna promote and circle jerk about BDO? go to that subreddit.
---
Wait, does this work? Whenever I put /dismount in a macro it only dismounts me and then discontinues the rest of the macro
---
Got some more here bro 😎 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA
---
They will change some maps to better fit current lore. For example the Stratholme map will be redesigned to better match the Stratholme we experience in WoW.
---
Quite simply: BDO is an asian style MMO, WoW is a western style mmo.
---
The two types are not interchangeable gameplay experiences. It's like asking why Solo RPG players won't play WoW. They have similar roots, but they are very different games.

It's that herd mentality.
---
Does anyone have leatrix addon? Is there a way for it to show where to repair armor in towns?
---
To be fair, it's not just the "current version of the light". In the Tides of Darkness novel Turalyon, one of the original paladins and a former priest, has several doubts clouding his mind and iirc it prevents him from using the light until he finds new conviction towards the end.
---
ive got a root from initial immo
---
Ok, I see.  You said to enchant the armor, not disenchant it.  That's where the confusion came from.
---
I've been waiting for so long to get her in one of my videos
---
That's completely contradictory.
---
It persists. You can switch between sessions and accumulate farm time for each session, the more time you have per farm session, the more accurate G/H value you'll get.
---
I may add quick AH scan, takes 30 sec to scan the whole thing (can do it once in 15 min), but for the moment you can write `/fl set [Item Link] 5.5` to set an item's AH value to 5.5g, the addon will then use the AH price instead of vendor price.
---
You should try to learn how to time out a blind cast with a blink. If they're not great at pvp they'll usually frost nova and blink immediately after, a blind between those casts is enough to get out of the freeze and within melee range. Also enough to restealth and reopen.

Fuck sake.  I started a warrior alt for the near instant groups, questioning whether I want to just fucking delete him after running WC with three mages who I'm pretty sure were IRL buddies.  I might as well have not even been there for all the aggro I could hold... I get one autoattack in and they're all jumping around spamming Arcane Explosion until they OOM, every single pull.
---
I don't blame people for not wanting to tank.

Back in the day in BC there was a guild on Gurubashi called “brb my cats on fire”

I dont care about internet approval lol just sharing a story. What I find more tragic is people desperate to find some fault and disagree with everyone and everything just to feel different. It's ok little one, we notice you x

You’re getting promoted to heals the second you get there, just a heads up.

it is a joke my dude...

THIRTEEEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!

Pipqua, so help me if you’re reading this and you’re messing around with another warlock, I will make you read barrens chat for the rest of your puny, pitiful existence.

Because it isn't WoW. Wow has something special to it that keeps people. Tons of imitators and legit competitors have came and folded during Wow's reign. I've heard this same argument from every other game that tried to compete with or be the WoW killer.
---
&gt; The only argument that can be made against bdo is if you like lore... 
---
There's plenty of arguments against BDO. If there wasn't people would be playing it. 
---
Plus Wow graphics have improved though they will never try to be something they aren't and retain the same art style, but as time has shown, graphics ain't everything.

I just wish gnomes were horde tbh
---
That is when you go into the dungeon and DPS as normal until you go OOM and then use bandages on the tank.
---
I don't know if I'm the exception but my half way point was between level 37 and 38. Had a mount right at 40 an had non stop quests to 59, then got my last 4 bars in one dungeon. I would say 50 being the half way point is very exaggerated. People saying low to mid 40s I'd believe based on playstyle differences.
---
I know what you mean. This is the first time I've played a mage at all and Apr leveling is very satisfying and relaxing.
---
Bdo is a cash grab game that uses gambling mechanics and time gating to pump real money transactions out of its users. There is no real group content and the pvp is incredibly imbalanced.

I reached soft cap and quit entirely

These kind of people are so narcissistic, it's pathetic. I had a mage in a SM armory group do the same kinda shit when I was healing. He died at the very end because he had aggro of an enraged Myrmidon and got one shot and blamed me.
---
I don’t understand... how is your mage wearing leather?
---
Rogues &gt; warriors when both are skilled in a 1v1. You can kite a warrior so easily with crippling poison and sprint, and gouge is great for resetting if you pay attention to berserkers rage. especially if you use evasion as well (yes, it gives warriors overpowers so don’t use it against a 2h, but it’s absolutely worth it against dual wielding warriors.)
---
Dead zone the warrior, wait out bleeds and open as many times as you’d like. Bonus points if you carry luffa on you.  Warriors can still win with a few big crits or if they get off the intercept/intimidating shout, but it isn’t easy
---
I'm no psychologist and I couldn't define what bullying is explicitly but all I know is that I feel embarrassed to say I play on a PvE server in a place like this. It makes me feel like I'm playing on easy mode and I feel that people will judge me for not being good enough to play the 'actual game'. 
---
I can't speak for others, this is only my experience, but maybe this could help people have an insight into what some PvE players might be thinking. 
---
I'm not exempt from judging people though. I certainly have an opinion on what I think of PvP players.
---
there's also some 20dps bullets from strath ud
---
Lympkin for life!!!
---
I'm just saying if I had to pick between the two. I'd rather be playing with less people then not playing at all.
---
I did want that, but I had no way of knowing how the balance would end up. And now it's way too late to do anything about it. Maybe one day I'll roll a character on a new server, but I'm level 54 and all my friends are on my server with me... it's not like I'm just going to leave...
---
Marvelous!

I like how all the other classes have some suggestions but for warlock it's like "fuck it there are too many, just have a guide".

Citation?

Can you ask without sounding retarded?

Private servers =/= vanilla.

Proof would mean infiltrating their discord, taking screenshots, recordings etc. but thats seems too much for a game
---
Is it worth it to get a dwarven hand cannon, or should I just stick it out and farm a carapace spine crossbow? Also around what lvl is it recommended to switch from bm to mm?
---
Multiple runs, mostly east, a few north a few west.

Dropped from Zevrim.  Now i am in a big debt towards the guildmates that ran with me :)

Realy question, how do you play a tauren female?

I have the gold to buy it, but I figured I would farm it myself in the spirit of the rest of the questline being solo-mandated.
---
WHAT
---
How do bards do?
---
From what people can gather it was hard nerfed in late vanilla, so it's blizzlike.
---
I don't really understand tanks who have an aneurysm and run 15 yards with 3 melee mobs backstabbing them just because a caster is hitting a ranged. The odd mob (especially magic damage) on someone else is really not a big deal unless it's on the healer.

1. Go into the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app. 
---
2. On the WoW launcher tab. 
---
3. Make sure the drop-down list is on World of Warcraft (not Classic).
---
4. Just below the WoW BFA logo, click the Options button (has a gear symbol).
---
5. Choose the Uninstall Game option (should be at the bottom of the Options list).

So, there I was a fledgling 52 Undead Warlock thinking I could solo Kroshius to get my Infernal. Well, I was wrong, and I died. On the second or third run back to my corpse, I see Jugg the 50 Night Elf Druid fighting elementals in the area.  I run up to him and wave, he waves back, I point to Kroshius and to my surprise he heads over and waits for me to summon, buff and drink up. Then we fight Krushius together! ...and die.  So we run back and try again... and die again. 
---
This time, Kroshius despawns and is no longer there. Bummer, I think to myself, I'm going to have to try another time. Then Jugg givesthe wait emote. I nod and wait for about a minute before I realize my mistake. I emote back to wait, then run off to the quest giver to get another felfire to try again. I get back to the quest giver, get attacked by some slimes, kill the slimes to farm a couple shards for the upcoming fight, and think Jugg will probably be gone because I took too long. To my surprise, he is still there waiting!
---
This time he is cat form, I have succubus out and we just go ham and fear kite. Running low on mana, Kroshius is getting low on health, Jugg pops out and starts throwing out some roots. Sure enough we kill him and I now have my infernal and learned that not all Alliance are scum!
---
If you see this Jugg, Thank you!
---
&gt;Yea those patches were later on.
---
I assume BDO, means Black Desert Online. I think BDO is very deep compared to WoW Classic. While depth is great in mmo's. Too much depth and your going to lose alot of players early on. The learning curve is just too much for a broader audience. It also doesn't help that BDO has a horribly confusing UI which is typical of asian developed games. 
---
WoW Classic finds that happy medium between depth and simplicity and BDO does not.
---
good to hear :)
---
I love how cryptic Blizzard is about their population.  Has always been that way with them though lol.
---
but fear ward

_Cries in Long Cooldowns_

&gt; In (ACTUAL) classic Dire maul trash drop rates were way better 
---
Only for like 3-4 months in vanilla. DM was released in 1.4 (March 7 2005) and by 1.6 (July 12 2005) it's XP from farming lashers and gold/item drops were already nerfed. 
---
Patch notes, and comments from 2005 confirm it. We are playing in patch 1.12 so that's why they are nerfed. If you played on a private server then the private server got it wrong. All this has been proven already. 
---

These mobs were nerfed literally while I was pulling. I zoned in and got 225 per mob, zoned out, reset, came back in and got 65 per kill 📷 Either way I went from 52-58 in 2 days of casual play.

---
They need to place ques on the dominant faction with the option to faction xfer for free until the population balances out.
---
Even if you play perfectly, the number of packs in each and every 60 dungeon I need to clear additionally so you don't add them are not worth for me. 
---
You are very welcome to open a quest/level dungeon run and try to find players of your level. I might even join if you're upfront and I'm bored. But if you try to fool me hiding behind a 60 healer, then I'll leave the group instantly again.
---
Yeah, those patches later on that we're playing on. LMAO
---
pirate servers fucking shit up does not mean blizz nerfed anything.
---
Action MMOs aren’t my cup of tea.
---
What UI bars are those?
---
Even got some smash Bros in Nice!!
---
I've been 60 for a bit now and I can guarantee there's still tons of people like this today.
---
The blue ammo from boss drops is not the ammo you should be using except on very special occasions, my dude. As you say, it's hardly farmable.
---
Use the 10s ammo for 90% of the content, then swap in thorium ammo for bosses.
---
Don’t think this is right way to promote your opinion, probably better suited to the bdo sub reddit to reach out and see if anyone else plays both and compare your opinions, you’ll probably just get a tonne of backlash here
---
This is incorrect, the exclamation point is a modifier to toggleable skills that means it will always use the "activate" part of the skill.
---
T\_T its beautiful
---
After years of reading jokes about low drop rates and int buffs on warriors basically every time you look at the chat it's hard to find that funny.
---
Sorry.
---
It's not a bonus to the alliance, it's a bonus to the faction that is 'severely outnumbered'. If horde makeup less than 40% of the players, meaning alliance makeup more than 60, then these bonuses would apply to the horde. It's not a punishment because you can always choose the other side thus gaining the benefits.
---
I think you should just farm a Carapace. If you have an excess of gold then I'd say go for the hand cannon. I switched to MM at 60 once I started raiding, even though BM is still probably going more individual dps. A lot of the time you can't even use your pet in MC so there's no point to being BM.
---
And yet, as a horde side player on Kromcrush, I've gone into BRM only to run into a full raid group of alliance just camping the entrance. When I leveled in Tanaris, the pirate area felt like an alliance flight point. It ebbs and flows, Kromcrush is def not 65/35, much more likely around 55/45.
---
There's not a devilsaur mafia on every pvp server by the way. Glad you're having fun on your server, but idk how you can say you know what it's like on every other pvp server. 
---
On alot of servers guilds who are the biggest and strongest arent always led by people who wanna ruin the game for the rest of the population. 
---
On kromkrush the horde and alliance genuinely do not like each other lol. I'll be damned if I get in discord with any of them. Both sides constantly troll one another. Everytime you wanna go raid it's a huge war to get through the portal. When DM came back to do the other wing alliance had killed them and were blockading and it took us 30 min to get through.
---

So it was good for a bit yea? they should let the people still subscribing to the game maybe enjoy farming before half they're playerbase quits.

Oh, nice to see &lt;Kor Kron&gt; still around!

EU server then?
---
Endgame activities, social focus, upgrade path/style, combat style, endgame pvp are completely different.
---
The games do not feel alike at all. The closest they both get is "MMO".
---
F :(
---
No it's not worth imo. Get carapace from stratholme and that will carry you until rhok.
---
Well, he could probably have used ice block, but a great healer would have the foresight to know he would get aggro after the Tank is sleeped. You could have used a pre shield and spammed flash heals.
---
They aren't preraid BIS, you are an idiot. But thank you for revealing that. Current live, barberous blade is preraid BIS, and 2nd bis is Peacemaker. So yes, a hunter rolling on 3rd preraid bis that requires 2 drops that is Rogue Preraid bis is fucking stupid and should not happen.  
---
Barberous blade = 60ap 1% crit  
---
Peacemaker = 56 AP 1% crit  
---
Dal Rends BOTH drops = 50 AP 1%crit.  
---
It is straight worse than dal'rends... And before you go "BUT THE AGI ENCHANT" its not in the game... And won't be for 2 phases. And even after the enchants are added its 110ap + 1.5 crit, vs 110 ap + 1.6 crit. Its .1 crit more and no AP difference, which is a MINISCULE difference, but sure its technically better.  
---
TL;DR: Your argument is wrong. Please try again.
---
Hide yo kids!
---
The people saying the dps is the same because it's normalized, are either uninformed or giving you a simplified answer.
---
Because of buffs (namely gift of arthas and frenzy) faster attacking pets have higher dps.
---
Donnie
---
I absolutely gaurentee you that BM out damages MM in dungeons while leveling. I HAVE leveled as both. You clearly haven't. You clearly have no clue what you are talking about. This idea that leveling as MM is some 5head genius move is ridiculous and faux-elitest. How exactly is MM more fun? You get to stand still and charge a shot for 3 seconds? The fun aspects of hunter exsist regardless of spec. Also, news flash, you can have scatter and aimed shot as BM you huntard. 
---
I dont dungeon grind at all while leveling. I find it boring. Especially as hunter. Questing and grinding is so efficient trying to do dungeons is largely a waste if time. Gear is next to pointless on a hunter, especially as bm. Also for MM you cant find weapons slow enough for it to matter while leveling anyway. 
---
Obviously MM is better at 60. I've been 60 and MM for like 7 weeks now. I have my rhokdelar and epic mount, I'm no stranger to mm. MM is no where near as good as BM for leveling. Sure, you play hunter so at the end of the day it doesn't matter. You can level as survival and still beat everyone else to 60. 
---
You can disagree all you want. You can be one of these people who think BM is some idiot's spec. It's fine, you're allowed to be wrong. BM has just as much nuance as any other hunter spec. The fact that you think 
---
&gt;BM is for the Huntards who want to sleep the whole way to 60
---
speaks volumes to your aptitude for hunting. Apparently the only benefit you bring to a group IS your raid buff. I feel sorry for the group that has to carry you
---
Dude. Yes. I hate not having mana as a resource in retail. One thing I really hate is healers basically cannot die unless you have 2+ DPS on them constantly CCing and interrupting. I like being able to kill their mana bar, then you can actually kill a healer.
---
Is that... *legal?*
---
Me big dps, you no heal. Oooga booga uhga.
---
horde side, Unfortunate Consequences and Furniture That Kills. Went to Grim in TBC.
---
Character creation and animation in Asian theme MMOs really turn me off.  Reeks of trying to be cool rather than fun.  Also not to be dismissive because the last time I even considered BDO was years ago, but no one that described it made it sound like an experience I would enjoy.
---
It is true that when an action style-MMO with the right art design and combat direction comes out I'll probably be all over it.
---
Also I know this is going to sound like a small deal but when you spend hundreds of hours playing a character its actually pretty important.  I don't like the race choices in BDO.  I play a cow person, and I like my beastial character races to look more on the animal side than on the human side.  This is a fantasy MMO why are my character choices human, human with pointy ears, and tall human with odd forehead?
---
I'm sure BDO is fine.  But its promotional material didn't appeal to me and when people described the pros and cons of it, it never sounded like a game i wanted to play.
---
This drama sounds way better than asmon's drama.
---
I put it on my bow. Tooltip according to 2 addons = no change. These addons were accurate vs the aura hit bug.
---
&gt; For PvE, yes, but only if you are raiding BM spec.
---
Or if you tank has any idea what he's doing.
---
It happens way more often than you think, so don’t feel that bad
---
Oh I definitely will.
---
"LF2M Strat UD need tank/heals quick run gogo mount res"
---
I guess it’s only 3 hours wasted, which is a small fraction of the time I’ll be spending farming anyway
---
Oh well, probably should've waited a bit to see if it would become red. But I wouldn't last long against it as a priest so I didn't have much choice.
---
I know I’m off tangent, but do you ever go fishing?
---
Is this alliance or horde?
---
Cat is far more damage. 2.5x faster auto attack 
---
Bears biggest hit replaces an auto attack. So far less of a boos than you think
---
Energy vs rage. More skills that dont replace autos
---
It might sound dumb but as a tank, especially for SM alliance, if I don’t get summons or if I’m at the dungeon and the majority of the group isn’t there and ready to run I will most likely leave the moment I see another group open. Last night 3 people posted lf2m sm tank/dps and they were questing in Desolace and didn’t have the Southshore flight path. Guaranteed I bailed to join a group that said “xxxx summons available”. Nothing personal, just don’t waste our time.
---
Don't forget profession items and racial skills. Gnomes can break roots, a BoE cloth belt can break roots, bombs can stun, free action potion makes you immune to a lot of movement impairs for 30 second.

Here are some of my Mage macros. I removed the "#" in front of the "showtooltip" to prevent stupid reddit formatting.
---
/use [mod:shift] Arcane Explosion(Rank 1); [nomod] Arcane Explosion
---
Casts rank 1 of Arcane Explosion when I press Shift, max rank when I don't press a modifier key. Same macro format for Blizzard and Cone of Cold.
---
showtooltip Counterspell
---
/use [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Counterspell
---
Casts Counterspell on my target or on my mouseover when I press Shift. Also stops my casting. Same macro format for Polymorph and Frostbolt rank 1.
---
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] Remove Lesser Curse
---
Casts Remove Lesser Curse on my friendly mouseover. If that's not possible, it casts on my friendly target. If that's not possible, it casts on me. Same macro format for Arcane Intellect, Amplify/Dampen Magic, etc. and also all healing spells and buffs when I play on a healing class.
---
showtooltip Ice Block
---
/use [nomod] Ice Block
---
/cancelaura [mod:ctrl] Ice Block
---
As a button masher I don't like having the /cancelaura of IB on the same keybind as IB itself. So I put that part on a modifier (Control in my case), but also on the next one:
---
/cancelaura Ice Block
---
/use [nomod] Frostbolt; [mod:shift] Scorch; [mod:alt] Arcane Missiles; [mod:ctrl] Fireball(Rank 4)
---
Casts max rank of Frostbolt or one of the other spells when I press those modifiers. Also cancels IB.
---
/use [mod:shift] Portal: Darnassus; [nomod] Teleport: Darnassus
---
To save action bar space I put the Portal spells on a Shift modifier. Same for IF and SW teleports/portals.
---
/use [mod:alt] Conjure Mana Agate; [mod:ctrl] Conjure Mana Jade; [mod:shift] Conjure Mana Citrine; Conjure Mana Ruby
---
Another action bar space saving macro.
---
/use [mod:shift] Conjure Food; Conjure Water
---
And another one.
---
Your tanks and healers probably don't like you that much
---
Hahaha so funny, can you please elaborate on that?
---
fantastic input
---
Need it for Paladin mount quest, could probably talk down the tank for just taking the first 5 Holy waters and nothing else though
---
Legend
---
you have to activate the macro again, after it dismounts you.
---
if there was no /dismount, it would say "you cannot cast while mounted" or something.
---
[leatrix plus](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic) has an option to stand/dismount when u cast a spell
---
SO CUTE

Yes, YTA, you screwed over your guild so you could change the color of your ranged slot to purple.

I like you

Very helpful, thanks!

For now reset using `/fl r` and toggle pause/resume with `/fl` , adding these to the UI now.

This describes Stalagg perfectly. The Horde population dominance is staggering and was made worse by opening transfers to Heartseeker.

Did you buy most of your bars? And where did you farm?

Really need to just start naming names for posts like this. Put idiots on blast.

Would like to know this as well

This is the pissiest post I’ve ever seen on Reddit.  Damn.

lol no, swipe hits 3 targets for next to nothing. Spread rake

Came here for this, but don’t let on about the best server too much.  Gotta keep it that way.

Yeah right after I checked out your channel.  Great stuff man keep it up
---
Yes! Reset only when you want to, or just start a new session.
---
Pullo, name checks out
---
Get good.
---
But they did wipe and camp Final Boss at BRM a day or two ago. A couple points in their favour I guess...
---
When I heal on my alt, if it becomes apparent that the DPS is/are bad players I joke that my UI has a bug that only allows me to heal the tank. Outside of unavoidable AoE mechanics, you better protect that Healing Stream Totem with your life, because it's all you're getting if you pull aggro :&gt;
---
They removed this quest from retail a while back due to the connotations.

As a ganker this isn't a waste of time. Im likely sippin my beer having a smoke listening to some heavy metal. Killing noobs is just 1 part of the gank experience

I actually believe hunters can make more than any other class right now tbh. You can do a tribute run in 20 minutes, if you can sell an item such as the ring to another player, you are looking at over 100 gold per hour, that is not including book/trinket chance as well.
---
Will do man thank you!

Probably the same people who upvote pictures of regular dice or books in /r/DungeonsandDragons

Honestly if they were good mages you could have them pull entire rooms and aoe them down, warr tank is just there at that point to taunt runners and stragglers.
---
Terrible mages essentially
---
Pleasure :)
---
arms tanking is really easy, just put your defensive gear on and charge+attack=sweeping strikes pop over to zerker stance and blood rage and another attack whirlwind pop berserk rage and into defense stance where you can sunder or cleave and even get a surprising amount of revenge if you have good defense gear 
---
if you get the whirlwind off you will dominate threat on the majority of the mob group 
---
can even switch to 1h shield after the whirlwind to boost your defense 
---
i do prefer tanking in prot though but i also like doing stuff in the world
---
And now: “A Scotsman on a horse!”
---
*bites lip*
---
Oh for sure. Even on retail. Especially on retail tbh
---
This. Way too many healers and too few tanks. I actually started playing other games which bums me out, but I can't take it anymore :(
---
Which part..?
---
I got the offhand on my third run and am dead set on completing the pair.
---
Ya I always feel bad farming my shards that way but we have dreadsteeds to summon!
---
Or they like PvP on hard mode, which is a completely different subset of goals and desires. 
---
Or are you incapable of seeing generalizations don’t mean 100% of the population?
---
Flamelash mate, that's where all the big boys hang out
---
I actually am curious about something that rolls along with this.  I almost always roll greed unless an item is clearly a need.  When I have dungened I'm the only tank and almost always need on mail because everone else greeds.  However it isn't always better, I was just told to need on all mail, 2 handers and shields.  What are people opinion on this.  I don't care at all to horde good items for gold if what I have is better.  But if everyone rolls greed I guess it doesnt matter?  No one has ever complained but I don't want to piss off anyone in the future.
---
obviously ignoring the FACT... no one forced anyone to do anything, it was buyer beware at all times, and no, its not actionable... GM's will not reverse any auction transactions or be able to even PROVE you did anything... so, you're a whiteknight tryhard crybaby and thats that.

---
About to hit level 50 soon on my hunter, wondering if I should continue questing until 60 and then worry about gear? Or what is it I should be doing? Not sure if there is a certain order of getting things that you recommend.
---
Is there certain pets I should tame? Currently I’m using king B from stv, the white tiger stripe cat, that is a mini version of my mount haha
---
I played on Xbox March-July pretty heavily and I did enjoy my time playing it at first it quickly became clear how much is aimed at enticing mtx sales. I got the 10$ version with a few pets so I spent roughly $60 to get in. The idea being it was as much as another console title. PC must be a very different experience.t first character was a DK. Second was a wizard and third was the ninja when it was released. I was interested in Kama for the content but it was really just more of the same
---
Ok let’s start small. Pick just one of those things and cut it out of your life. You’re welcome.
---
*MENERGY*
---
How boy maybe too comfy :D
---
If your server is anything like Whitemane, you will find a dungeon group easier as shadow than holy/disc. I sit in /lfg for over an hour at times looking for 3-4 different runs. I think it's a mix of tons of healers + not enough tanks.
---
Saving for later
---
As he shouts “With great vengeance!” When I make him attack a sheep.
---
I'm using a carrion bird and have growl and screech on autocasts, but it seems like it never actually casts growl and just spams screech (so basically it never has focus for growl) the strange thing is that it keeps aggro really well despite that. My threat meter shows that I have aggro but I don't (Not sure if screech is bugged somehow)
---
How are the odds getting a triple same number roll on one item?
---
Yeah I just found this out a few days ago. I was using complicated macros to assign target markers before. I switched to direct keybinds as soon as I learned about it. No need to take up extra macro slots for no reason.
---
No I am saying I typically roll off if I am taking.  If I roll off, I stay off.  If I came for a shield, I would announce I am there for a shield and roll main.  
---
If he was rolling main the whole time and rolled for a shield because he wanted a second one, I get why he did it.  Thinking you deserved loot because he already has one is silly.  He did half the work, he gets half the chance to roll on loot.
---
From AFK progress onwards
---
It's your highest DPCT (Damage per cast time) ability. Good on raid bosses if your raid group has spare debuff slots. Not incredibly useful for anything else.
---
Just be glad there isn't a weight limit as well as an inventory size limit.  Carrying around a lot of coin in everquest was cancer.
---
Oh! No no, these don't do anything special like spinning. These are just some ways to do AoE damage as a paladin. If you're looking for cool effects like spinning you'll have to look elsewhere!
---

---
Its default blizzard raid frames. You can unlock it and drag it around. Play a bit with the settings under interface -&gt; raid profiles. :-)
---
i don't know, the intent is obviously that you lose your combo points if you switch targets. that mousovers *technically* don't switch your target, even though you're totally using abilities on a different target, seems like a technicality and i don't think dropping combo points here is a glitch.
---
Yes hemo is a very good PvP spec.
---
 Nice now I have to spend money on unhealthy food again :(
---
use cat form.  You can spam your abilities in cat.
---
The #showtooltip command also makes the red "?" icon automatically display the icon of the spell! I didn't know this until recently, and had previously wasted so much time trying to scroll around to find the exact icon I wanted.
---
Amazing I'll be sure to sub
---
Excellent job
---
I like this comment
---
May as well, it's BiS for tanking but for PvP, Rogues and Hunters will mop with it. Don't underestimate the wingclip spam- proccing TF at a rate higher than any other class - even more than hemo sword rogue (when not CC'd that is!)
---
Same Fucken here 🥺
---
Makes me want to watch the illegal danish again
---
I think we can agree to disagree here. I deprive myself of trivial and therefore worthless information, while at the same time being able to see more of the screen, which allows me to gather more valuable information. 
---
I initially made my UI like this for arena, where its insanely important to have an overview on everything thats happening, and where trivial information is actually hurting you because of information overload. That‘s (usually) not as important in classic, but there‘s absolutely not a single reason to see my frostbolt, AE, fireball or other spells icons without cd.
---
You can replace macros that only contain /tm marker commands with direct keybinds.

If you want a better pvp spec for swords, I would go subtlety hemorrhage.

I understand what you mean because let's be honest the game is widely different from the release of vanilla wow. The #nochanges people are really toxic but fail to see the truth of what blizzard did.
---
Thank you mate
---
It was indeed haha
---
hit is very strong up to the yellow hit cap, then just good after that, until you get so much crit that your white attacks have enough miss that not all your crit is happening, then it becomes very strong again
---
Uhhhh no, you're flat out wrong kiddo.

I sit in LFG all day while I farm i've yet to see one MC pug in there.

I'm not at all talking about pulling one over on anybody.  My example of going into UD strat as a 56 was extreme for the sake of making a point.  I get it, you're an elite level 60 player and cant be bothered with having your presence tarnished by someone 16 hours of playtime behind you.  The purpose of this post is to encourage DPS players on how to get into groups.  I throw myself on your mercies for endeavouring to share my experiences.   I also sincerely regret that you assumed that there is any deception encouraged in my advice.

You cant even make your mind up on whether you are serious or having a laugh bud. The fact is every single thong you say to me is irrelevant because I dont need to worry about pug mentality in my guild.
---
Good thing you can clear the content in greens/blues and don't remotely need the buff.
---
Priest Rogue was pretty good. Mage rogue also. Better than Druid/Rogue.
---
&gt; Maybe all the horde that complain about not having enough alliance to kill should roll alliance ? Game isn't as fun when you can't lose though so I can see why all these guys who "love world pvp" don't want to get camped into the ground.
---
Thing is, most of those players are also the sort to go full cringe of
---
"i'd never play an alliance scum" unironically, while playing on their actual PvE server with the rare spawns of 'oh hey, that's a player! /camp time!' only to then notice the next time, there's even less people to gank/pvp against.

This opens the dress up frame with a naked char, either your target or, if no target, yourself. That's handy if you want to e.g. see how a shirt looks without getting naked in the AH.

I'm levelling a prot pally and at one stage I tried switching to healing. The amount of abuse I got made me switch back to tanking after two days. Seriously, most people won't be shitty to tanks (though I feel like a kindergarten teacher herding a group of hyperactive kids most of the time when tanking), but some will happily abuse and insult the healer.
---
Oh, you ran ioff nto the next room when I'd just finished rebuffing the entire group after a fight and hadn't even started drinking yet and pulled 8 mobs and died? Yeah, totally my bad. I'm the retard. Of course.
---
Decided to AoE on an LOS pull before the mobs had even reached the tank and then died? Yep, my mum must have dropped me on my head as you said. Couldn't agree more.
---
Seriously, screw all the assholes who can't be civil to their healers.
---
"My anecdotal is true because i say it is"
---
Nice logic kiddo.
---
i know mobs can dodge from behind, pretty sure players can too
---
/use &lt;mount name&gt; works in classic? Are you sure? I tried doing this a few weeks ago when I got my mount and I couldn't get this to work. So I have to use a /use &lt;bag number&gt; &lt;bag slot&gt; command instead, and my mount has to live in a specific bag slot. If you got a direct /use &lt;mount name&gt; command to work, I'd like to know so I can figure out what I did wrong. I'd definitely prefer this over my current mount call method.
---
Just use puggle
---
Yeah every time I bit the bullet and started my own group it'd just end up with me and 3 other groups spamming for 1 tank for the same place.
---
Any weapon vendor will do it... Not hard to find
---
&gt;I chose a PvP server for the social aspect. The small scale skirmishes over quest hub dominance. The competition over resources. The terror of fighting mobs and seeing an enemy nearby knowing they could easily kill me. The frustration when they capitalize on my vulnerability. The surge of adrenaline when I die knowing that I *will* make their life living hell when I get my body back--Or die again trying. The relief when they choose to save me instead. The satisfaction and pride of getting sweet deserved revenge against the rat fuck that stabbed me in the back and kicked me while I was down.
---
Then you should have rolled alliance
---
It is up for 6 hours. The buff is only two. I think op is confused.
---
&gt; Who the hell wants a robot chicken.
---
Then don't roll gnome, or if you do roll gnome, work on other reps. Like ironforge.
---
Yeah, winter night is only very slightly being the void chest, so even if you are a tailor its not really even worth making over the winter night.
---
On top of what everyone has already said, the one thing you should spend coin on is bags. Get 14 slot bags ASAP
---
He’s an NPC. You never directly control Uther.
---
&gt; Everything is not easy and convenient in classic.
---
My point is that getting this buff was more reliable in 2004 than it is on any given Classic server due to population size. Its not about ease or convenience its just not an accurate representation of the possibilities that could be taken advantage from.
---
Combination of buying bars and farming EPL/Burning Steppes/Winterspring.
---
I don't get it.
---
Please correct me if I am wrong as I am really trying to understand this and math and I don't go together super well. 
---
I am hoping to understand the interaction and difference between Hit Chance and Weaponskill. 
---
&gt;Continuing on, each point of hit you get will work to combat miss. So for every point of hit you get, you reduce the miss chance by 1 point.
---
I read that as; each point of hit reduces the number of points (1:1 ratio) that exist within the auto attack table. Based on the last table you provided in the "Making your own attack tables" section, you indicate that a "Miss" will occur if your auto attack roll lands between 0-80. So, using this table as an example, if I were to get 1 Hit on a piece of gear, that auto attack roll now becomes 0-79. Am I understanding this correctly? 
---
As for Weaponskill, this effectively reduces that 0-80 window based on the difference between your weapon skill and the mobs defense skill. It also directly effects Glancing Blows. 
---
When fighting a mob, the Weaponskill vs. Defense check is done first to determine how big the roll window for miss will be (among all other outcomes), your current Hit chance is factored in to reduce the window of "Miss" by a 1:1 ratio, and then the roll occurs to determine the outcome of the swing. Is that a very elementary understanding of the process? 
---
I realize that way more factors are involved, but my biggest concern is just understanding the interaction between Weaponskill and Hit.
---
That’s my biggest reason for my PVE choice.  My Gf and I don’t have a lot of time to play so a death because of some pricks wanting to camp us severely disrupts our R&amp;R time.
---
Yeah nobody decided horde because of racial except for the top 0.001% of players.
---
Cat does a lot more damage, remember cat is attacking every 1 second + you dont have to take damage in order to have resource to use abilities.
---
Cat also gets 30% movement speed outside if you spec correctly by level 21.  This bonus stays in combat too.
---
My bad, must be thinking Arthas - that being said I swear he does shout that when attacking.
---
Obviously its by design, but there should be a way for people who can kill Onyxia to rely on getting the buff even if its just for the person who turns it in and their respective raid group.
---
That is very helpful!!
---
Illegible on mobile :/
---
Typical alliance scum
---
Oh LFG is booming, for the 45-55 dungeons. And it's really boomin at 60 for tanks. (unless you want to raid as a tank)
---
He didn't swap.  I'm 90% sure there's 3 layers on mograine-eu right now, at least at peak time.
---
Crazy to me that you were able to find that many in epl, I did a full lap last night and found 1 RTV and one true silver. That's it.
---
So I joined during BC (which also makes it my favorite era) SO CURIOUS, what does happen at end game after you have done all the raids multiple times? Is it still fun?

Why does it look so much cooler in this video than in the actual game

Hey there folks. I was lucky to recieve the Blackblade as a drop really early on and while it's been a great item I am having some theory crafting questions and concerns?
---
I am an Alliance dwarf warrior and playing 2handed fury with it and while it has been performing alright I think I could be performing better as 2handed arms since I won't be able to reap the benefits of wind fury as alliance.
---
My primary question is should I just use this weapon as 2h Fury or would it be utilizing it better as Arms?
---
Thanks so much for any help.

sports over WoW you deserve to cry

It's going to be cross server from the start

I see warriors not stance dancing in dungeons, questing, anything. As a warrior, you should be stance dancing EVERY single encounter, and if you are not, you are only playing a warrior at 50% and will get beaten by any other warrior who actually can play the class.
---
You need the Tactical Mastery talent, which I believe is taken in every single build that is considered to be the best for Fury, Arms, and Prot.
---
There is a VERY easy way to stance dance. 
---
For every single ability that requires a different stance, you need to have a macro to switch stance.
---
Overpower, for example:
---
\#showtooltip Overpower
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
/cast Overpower
---
(All capitals/lower case are purposeful. if you do #Showtooltip it will not show the tooltip.)
---
You can replicate this for any ability, just change the Overpower to the ability, and the stance to the correct stance. There are much more complicated macros for this that do similar things, I haven't found a need to even write anything more though.
---
Ohhh nice, I mainly wanted the class colors :D thanks
---
Lmao me and my buddy gank tons of horde on herod as ally we love the imbalance ganks for days

Well, there's three classes which have a pet, only two of them get theirs at 55+ they can all level while being away from keyboard as their pet kills count as your own without your player input, I leveled a beast tamer 1-55 not actually playing the game, you find a low pop uncontested zone, summon pet, afk. you can farm exp and items with your pet alone. At level 50+ there's books any class can buy for gold which you essentially hit a target dummy for hours to get free exp. So real life money can be converted into character xp pretty much. 
---
After level 55 I believe, you have free for all PvP enabled  by default you can't disable it, anyone of level can fight and kill you for whatever reason.
---
Afk fisherman kidnapping is when you get a sailboat or a rowboat.. maybe it was a canoe, you go to.. one of the coastlines of the major cities, there will be plenty of Fishermen who are afk standing at the shoreline fishing. If you ram your boat into their character model. They will clip into and onto your boat sometimes, allowing you to essentially kidnap players and drop them in shark infested waters, on some crazy far island, you can even take 55+ players out into the ocean where they would be flagged for PvP, due to not being in a safe zone. 
---
Anything else you want me to explain or that I missed? Sorry it's a bit long.
---
I pretty much dont want to reset any categories, after I used it for a bit I realized it mostly defeats the purpose.  A couple things come to mind after using it for awhile:
---
* Stop tracking instance sessions if you exit the instance. 
---
* Dont start tracking a session if you click it from the session list.  Sometimes you just want to review a session.
---
* as a part of #1, maybe have a default session that it reverts to when not in an instance (or allow the player to specify one, or use the one that was currently tracking before you entered an instance).  Maybe these can be options or you pick the best that fits, not sure.
---
* you need tooltips on most things, I figure that'll come in time.  Tooltip on the minimap icon could be the basic info of a session, like gph, session name, length of session, etc.  Also the behavior of click/right click in the session list is unclear, i ended up deleting some sessions when I was playing around with it and also creating a 'default' session.
---
* maybe right click minimap icon to start/stop sessions?  or maybe it can be a dropdown menu that gives you a list of sessions and you can pick which one you want to track in, or a prompt for a new session?
---
* maybe eventually a gui for setting custom AH prices on things, if it's not possible to link from auctionator or Tsm databases (I honestly dont know how hard the latter would be).  Maybe it could be a right-click option on the item within the session view.  Some sort of indicator of what has a custom price, or maybe overall what the prices are for each item (like as a 2nd and third column it could be unit/total prices, and it could be a different color for AH prices or something like that).
---
Still, its already better than lootappraiser (which resets after every logout reset of an instance, whats the point lol), so the rest is just gravy and just some random thoughts of mine.  I mostly think #1 is the most important thing you could do though, since you're already tracking instances automatically you dont want to keep tracking them by accident when you leave.
---
The Herald/Crier that has it will patrol around each main city, so you'll have to find that NPC and they should have it.
---
If you've found that particular NPC and they don't have the quest for you; I'd put in a ticket.  It doesn't appear to have a requirement other than the level req of 54.
---
Might as well balance the classes and raids at that point
---
You can definitely PvP with swords as hemo. That being said most experienced rogues prefer daggers.
---
The reason is daggers requires much lower uptime on a target and has way higher burst. This is important for BGs and group PvP but is less important in non-mage 1v1s.
---
Item reserve was the "only" way for me after I got bored of doing the same dungeon every day for weeks.
---
35 runs in Scholo for dagger, 23 in LBRS for gloves.
---
You're right. This is one of the worst things about Classic. However, the good features stand out more than the negative ones.
---
24/3/24 is a very good hemo sword specc. You lack strong burst because ambush and backstab are dagger required, but you gain consistent dmg and a lot more combo point generation.
---
It hits 3 targets and doesn’t work when you’re not getting hit because you have no rage, and you’re not getting hit when a warrior is whirlwinding.
---
questing is such a tedious chore
---
it could be an adventure if there was some degree of immersion, but my screen looks like a bunch of polygons mashed together... even on max settings
---
I'm not saying anyone needs it, but if you don't need purples because you can Kill rag in Greens why do purple items even exist?
---
Just because you don't need something doesn't mean its not fun to have it. In this case there are people and raid groups who can kill Ony easily and would like to lean back on the buff to make their raid nights smoother and it would go a long way by being able to reliably get this buff to their raid.
---
My argument is that back in the day population size was so small that you would rarely run into the issue of having too many head turn ins. The server sizes are roughly 55-60k players now, thats 20x the initial size of a population capped server in Vanilla.
---
In my experience tanking like you said is like herding a bunch of suicidal cats who all want to jump into traffic.
---
But healing is like being an ice-cream guy who doesn't have their favorite ice-cream so they scream until you do
---
Try using hellfire in the middle of a large pull 😈
---
When are you able to get Dungeon Set 2 gear?
---
All that depends about players opinion. For me BDO is far better than WoW
---
Yes. Arthas, even back when he meant well, was too fiery for the Paladin order.

Maybe you dont actually like WoW?

Wow, quest loot doesn't drop often.

---
That scarlet chaplain will never reach the truth
---
Say what you will but there is a spot for a Spriest in every raid...only one tho. There can be only one
---
Doesnt get any better as you level up for single target at least, mages spam frostbolt, locks spam shadowbolt. Rotations in classic were, for the most part, extremely simple, and compared to later expansion, alot more boring.
---
Can you help me with the math? Specifically for this part:
---
&gt;That's 8,000 warlocks online of your faction. Assuming an even distribution of 1,000 possible pet names, that's 8 warlocks online that have the same name for their pet.
---
I get this number instead:
---
    1 − ((1 - 0.001)^8000) = 0.99...
---
In other words) it's virtually certain that there are multiple warlocks online with the same name.
---
Let's instead assume there's only 250 unique pet names per demon type and get only 30 locks online. That's still more than half of the time. It's realistic to assume that a lock that plays to 60 will sooner or later have met 30 other locks with the same pet summoned:
---
    1 - ((1 - 0.025)^30) = 0.53...
---
Is my math wrong somehow?
---
Lmao, what....
---
If you’re playing solo and not doing dungeons then yes you’ll be bored. 
---
My combat rogue is 34 and yes sinister strike spam isn’t the most exciting but yet ya get blade flurry and that’s fun.
---
Perhaps Druid is more your thing.

isn't a twohander still better for hunter pvp so you hit harder with raptor strike, mongoose bite, counterattack etc.? thunderfury will hit like a wet noodle compared to a good twohander, the only benefit is the proc. only reason i can see a hunter wanting tfury is to look cool.
---
Triggered the rogue 😆
---
You've written a good summary, thanks for that.
---
I just want to emphasize that for almost three months there was nothing to do *but* kill C'thun and Ouro. How many full T2-T2.5 geared raid groups were attempting C'Thun multiple days a week knowing it was a buggy encounter and knowing it wasn't tuned well?
---
I remember the desperation. We knew the mechanics but it felt like something was missing or there was a secret we didn't know about. And then a patch came and C'thun was nerfed into the ground.
---
Reserved would be not letting tanks from outside the guild roll. You’re wrong. MS&gt; OS = prot&gt;dps for that item. Maybe retail would be better for you. They fixed a lot of these common sense issues.
---
yea already gave you a follow m8 ;) great content
---
i did deadmines 16-24 on both chars.. i fell asleep in my chair quite often. I would try druid but getting even to 28 takes so long
---
No wowhead is just garbage.
---
"alliance are the underdogs" cringe
---
Make an alt.
---
Mail any excess gold to that alt; then you won't be spending it on your main.
---
Remember to log into that alt occasionally.
---
Charge and bloodthirst, then switch berserker actually.
---
How nice if you to explain why you were being such a dick! Great work bud.

#nochanges is the whole point

[What's everyone staring at? They never seen a night elf on a horse before?](https://youtu.be/bCTj0TgyGH8?t=71)
---
The system is rigged against tanks though.
---
You can tank 5-10  mans just fine but there's no raid spots for tanks, so why even bother tanking?
---
Hit cap is extremely important. You will need to at times sacrifice potentially slightly better DPS pieces to meet the hit cap. Every miss is a tonne of missed damage, hunter is very much based on slow heavy hits, so these cant miss or it becomes a huge DPS loss. Also, every miss is wasted mana, which is inefficient.
---
Thank you for going out of your way to share your inner angst
---
Yes, but phase 2 has not been released yet. They released dire mail early. Consider this phase 1.5
---
This was instrumental for me and my Broken Tooth camping. Great tip.
---
Because it is true. In PvE, pet attack speed doesn't matter unless you're specced deep in BM. What would make that not true?
---
Damn maybe it’s the opposite for you, sounds like too much dungeons!
---
You don't need to put the name of the spell with #showtooltip &lt;spell name&gt;. It'll automatically show the tooltip of the spell the macro will cast with just #showtooltip by itself.
---
This man understands.
---
That and why bother gearing a tank when there's no fucking raid spots for em?
---
Getting phat gear just so you can tank 5 mans better? piss off.
---
Why is your comment so focused on a super low drop rate BoP bag when a BoE bag at around the same drop rate already exists. Makes no sense bud.
---
I use to use Ravager on my TBC server as Ret Paladin when we were doing speed clears. Dragging all the humanoids on top of muru and everyone AOE.

This macro equips my riding gloves/spur boots/carrot on a stick each time I mount and switches back to my original gear when i press it to dismount.

As heartwarming as the story is...

*I would've camped his goddamn body and murdered him endlessly until he got out of my quest area then got some horde over there to help with the boss to assert true dominance*
---
But I'm a blood thirsty piece of shit who believes in 1v1's so :D
---
Social interaction, slow but rewarding progression/gearing, challenging levelling process, real and useful professions, open WPvP, sense of a packed and full world, etc...
---
Hey thanks, I made it. I need to create an IG account, but for now you can follow me here or on twitter (info on my profile)
---
She kills lowbies inside cities and camp their corpses.  
---
nothing wrong here but its kinda childish and not enjoyable.
---
Now that DM is out the great VC vs DM debate is back on Westfall
---
Nice. Grim was the top horde guild until realm weren’t they? I was alliance. Mini marauders in vanilla and joined drunken legacy until it died in WoD
---
SS is trash? For tanking with a 2 handed? How?
---
Mining all the way
---
I'll grind strat for the ud rep then.
---
Power thirst is crystal meth!
---
Well someone mentioned the faction flag. A good quality/interesting variation on that could be cool.
---
If hes currently rocking a healing mace you could get him an really interesting theme hammer.  Found some Damascus ones but those are a bit price and only tangentially related if you can find something cool it fits especially well with the dwarf theme.
---
I was gonna say figure prints but they don't do classic servers, maybe if you email them they'd do it.
---
Also you can check any of the custom prints websites for even something simple like blue and gold alliance coffee mug or shirt.
---
Or if you have any skilled art friends you can give them a picture of the character and have them do a painting/sketch.
---
Just some thoughts.
---
How come you went human over gnome.
---
Curse of doom is a 1 minute cd, not 1 hour. The cd is as long as the duration so that you cant multidot with it. As for how useful it is.. there are many spells that arent exactly useful or very situational, curse of doom is probably more useful than most. And the guy who said its probably good for raid bosses, probably not so much, if you are already fairly high up on threat and you have doom up, good luck not pulling aggro when it pops, if you have a slot free go with agony.
---
Vampiric Embrace
---
He knows all that - he had a different question.
---
Then that would be modified classic wow and THATS NOT CLASSIC wow.
---
That's what a lot of players asked, WoW Classic servers with updated graphics and with some useless retail features.
---
The funny thing is that that mace is actually insanely good for leveling as rogue. It has huge damage and is slow, it's the best weapon you can easily get until trash blade.
---
And he decided to throw it away.
---
TURBULENT JUICE
---
The point is *classic.*
---
Yah there was a good balance, iirc those mage/rogues sucked to fight, just total lockdown and tons of damage
---
Tanks are just baby sitters in classic. You try your best to not let the dps kill themselves
---
Then do it.
---
How does sixtyupgrades.com creating a gear set work? How do the equivalency points work? If I want to make a pre-raid bis tank set, should I have a threat and mitigation equivalency on the gear set? Really confused how it all works.
---
Dungeon finder was the reason I quit retail...
---
Offer a gold on chat if you get desperate. Someone’ll help.
---
Both are multi rank 1 players. Ziqo is like 20x r1 glad...
---
Yep it's passive, not sure how it could be interpreted as an active.
---
&gt;Reroll alliance then you are the solution...
---
as soon as I knew that the horde was the dominant faction on my realm I deleted my toons and swapped sides
---
I think that there is no honour in winning a fight when you outnumber your opponents 4-1 but if I beat you once when you outnumber me It was all worth it
---
Needs to be more players like you in general, Unfortunately a larger majority of the side that plays on servers where they overpop the other are pure
---
 'I'd never play Horde/Alliance, I'm not a loser.'
---
Followed by "where's all the &lt;enemy faction&gt;???"
---
Classic isn’t about tracking everything you do, having an achievement for killing a boss, hitting a level, or anything else.
---
It’s about being an average joe in the world of Azeroth and fighting for your faction.
---
Buy sword of zeal
---
People who play on PvE servers aren't necessarily bad at PvP. Many of them enjoy battlegrounds. You're making a giant assumption.
---
How many precursor orbs did it cost?
---
I guess, what I'm saying is yes if people want to go to the trouble and craft them, then fine, no problem.  But it really isn't going to be the difference between downing a boss, and not.
---
Lol, I'm normally right there with ya. Don't know what came over me. 
---
It wouldn't have been a fair or even good fight anyway. DoT's, fear... he heals, travel forms, runs away. Never ending cycle. Good ol' seduce - soulfire could've done it if I got a nice crit!
---
This is not how it was in vanilla. I distinctly remember this because for a large portion of vanilla I was a 29 hunter twink who relied on this talent
---
The improved blue set? Should come out with AQ so phase 5.
---
Ive also seen her defending westfall from Horde raids and organizing counter raids. They seemed like a really nice person.
---
I love the idea of Horde players seeing her as a villian to fight against, to role play as bounty hunters, or Horde players seeking vengeance... But she's a nice person and enjoys PvP. I don't personally camp people but it's just part of the game.
---
They are not easy to farm, but only the really top end guilds will require you to get it. There is some damage difference with the lower ammunition, but you can get by.
---
I always go see Gullem, even though Stampi has an awesome name. I like to patronize him. Don't want him to get fired!
---
Those nipples can stab by themselves
---
really only useful for soloing dungeon bosses/select dungeon mobs that you're farming. any boss you farm is gonna take well over 1 minute to kill. though usually you only will get 1 off. also best not to accidentally spawn the doomguard.  
---
with DM you can use it on big lashers, then banish them for 30s, kill the adds, then rebanish for 20s and boom, big doom hit.  
---
aside from that, not really useful even in raiding because debuff slots are at a premium, so you'll never get to put it up.
---
Could sacrifice some comfort and try sub. Yeah it is an incredibly simple rotation, span sinister strike eviscerate the the party counter (I don’t remember the name of the ability). If you have a friend to level with sub sounds more appealing for the backstab.
---
Honestly a good blow job is always a great gift.
---
"POWERTHIRST NOW COMES IN WOMEN!" was my favourite line, perfect comedy
---
Wot?
---
The happy Kanye dance did it for me man!  I know you're not taking requests yet but if you could throw the song Runaway at some point that would be the most awesome thing ever! Keep up the good work
---
Yes you can definitely play swords for pvp. There are 2 big pvp specs: Hemo and dagger. Hemo doesn't care what kind of weapon you use, as long as its slow and hard hitting. Sword is perfect for that. There's no mace needed at all.
---
As for hemo vs dagger, it's hard to say. hemo is a lot easier to play and more versatile, but dagger has very high burst without using CDs, and it's usually considerd more fun to play that's why most rogues prefer it.
---
Pay to win is fine
---
Just pay to win and you'll be fine
---
Are hunters good twinks? If so, at which level bracket?
---
Or can anyone point me in the right direction as to where I can read up on general twink info.
---
Are your insult skills the same as your in-game skills?
---
You're not wrong.  lol
---
That's because their time IS more valuable than yours. Take a look at LFG chat, it's always full of "lf tank" you never see "lf warlock" unless it's an aoe group and they'd still rather have a mage. Dps leaves you'll have another in 5 mins, tank leaves and it could be an hour before you find another one. Hell I recently turned down an offer to tank a Mara princess run because I asked for the ring to be reserved, they said no, I said OK then and made my own group. They were still looking for a tank after my second run.
---
At a glance, [Painweaver Band](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13098/painweaver-band) is better than [Magnis Will](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12548/magnis-will) due to 2 AP = 1 STR. Otherwise they are the same ring and both seem good!
---
It does not. Someone could write a plug-in for Questie to do it but as far as I know that hasn't been done.
---
So anyway I started blasting
---
Most useful for padding your dps on golemagg.  You can try some gimmicks with casting it on a mob and then casting rank 1 and 2 banish.  Then recast and rebanish.  Elite elementals or demons.  Otherwise pretty gimmicky and useless.
---
MH dropped in my group the other day. Shaman rolled on it "by accident" and won. I've never been so close to uninstalling.
---
Gift of Arthas?
---
I swear to god. If you ever stop making these. I will find you!
---
Only good on human and orc if you get an epic non-sword non-axe respectively.
---
This coming from the guy who has to bitch on reddit because he can't handle STV PVP? Blame it on faction imbalance? Mmk
---
Not sure i heard of a shaman class quest item that gives mana back?
---
Probably pugged at 60 and won head. Lucky man haha
---
I’m a mage, i have never expected to be healed in grp or raid. I feel sorry for this mage. Seems like he/she is the kind of mage who only cares about how much damage he/she does, and feel good about it, and neglected that mages have a shit ton of defensive / utility spells that make mages even more fun. I enjoy the big dmg number procs on my screen, but what I enjoy most is to handle all “oh shit” situations as a mage. Eranikus is quite challenging, but also very fun to do as a mage.
---
Oh no you ruined his top dps in a leveling dungeon. The horror. 
---
Let's see this guy go on whine rants in raids and see how many people keep inviting him.
---
Honestly, 
---
Maybe some snacks, a light stimulant like coffee, an intoxicant...
---
And tell him you'll be fine if he ignores you for 2-3 days kek
---
For the lazy people, you can use the add-on Clique to do this without making the macros yourself.
---
Maybe it's like... Democrat. Everyone cuts their own piece.
---
Never mind the "play what you want", I already do that with Paladin.
---
My realm is dominated by Mages, does this fact hurt my chances at my mage alt getting into raid teams as well? I don't know how many spots are available for Mages.
---
Only multiboxing 5 toons? Amateurs.
---
Fucking beautiful
---
No holiday bosses.
---
I wonder if a “Remastered” WoW would be just as popular?
---
Use Vanilla era combat system and talent trees.
---
Remaster the graphics, appearances, weapons, etc to more modern, detailed skins.
---
Include minor QoL features (Tmog, barber, collections).
---
Win?
---
If I could play the most epic version of WoW, while looking as awesome as I do in retail I’d sign up in a heartbeat!
---

---
Go back and re read the thread brother...
---
Well yeah you need to take imminent doom ticks into account for threat purposes if you're going to use it, but it is objectively better than agony for fights that last long enough for it to tick.
---
Go blacksmith and craft arcanite reaper, you'll be alright
---
To reply to both of you. I dont participate in these types of ganks, I prefer 1v1s or fair group PvP. But I certainly don't complain when I'm outnumbered and ganked repeatedly because its the nature of the game. So instead of complaining, ask around, gather a group and initiate in battle. Or complain and sound like nagging bitches aka Alliance.
---
Painweaver is better, it has more 4 more AP
---
&gt; It's fair until you meet a pre-made group and you're 10 randoms,
---
Don't forget, usually the premades dodged the other premades and specifically went after groups of randoms. And that was both sides especially if one group was way better than the other.
---
Yeah like how would any player passing by know he’s grinding instances or that he’s grinding mobs instead of questing.  What lmao
---
I just love all of the Minecraft stuff
---
Painweaver band has 16 attack power, while Magni's Will has 6 strength (which is buffed to 6.6 strength) for 12 attack power (or 13.2 attack power with King's). You will want to upgrade to the Painweaver Band but will probably get Magni's Will first (on alliance) because it's just a quest reward.
---
I can't figure out how to get the regular button to be auto attack then shift button to be a pet+spell cast. Not sure if you can help me but this is the most relevant place to have my question.
---
In that guide he has pet macro:
---
 /cast [pet:imp,mod:shift]Fire Shield;[pet:imp]Firebolt;[pet:voidwalker,mod:shift]Sacrifice;[pet:voidwalker]Torment;[pet:succubus,mod:shift]Seduction;[pet:succubus]Lash of Pain;[pet:felhunter,mod:shift]Spell Lock;[pet:felhunter]Devour Magic;
---
My question is how do I do this macro but instead of the regular cast / non-modified click be a pet spell cast I just want the pet to attack normally and keep auto attacking. 
---
Basically with one button I want to have them auto attack, with a shift+button i want the specific pet's specific spell, then with alt+button i want the pet's 2nd specific spell.
---
Good suggestions, thanks.
---
I'll rewrite the UI from scratch, it's ugly at the moment as I was just focusing on functionality, it'll definitely implement these features.
---
Nothing tilts me as much as people who want to do that piece of shit quest
---
Tanks are the only thing I don't like that website for. If you use the Threat EP you will get the full on Fury set, because damage = threat. I'd say use the Mit EP and swap in pieces with more Str and Agi over some +Def.
---
Well your character in an mmo is not a physical representation of yourself. Otherwise everyone would be playing human

Only one way. From FM to the feralas coastline is a pretty short sail, the other way is LOOONG af , def faster to swim there.

I'm on phone right now so can't check but I if use doesn't work, try /cast Mount Name. Pretty sure either one works. I got /cancelform then /cast mount and have had 0 problems

Also! If you need quick weapon skill leveling Dire Maul North has Ogre Spirits that have infinite HP, are level 60, and can't hurt you. You can max skills on them last I checked. Just gotta get through the instance to them.

Alterac Valley? Surely you mean Tirisfal Glades.
---
News and information about the game mostly, I’ve no interest in memes or whatever else. I don’t care if they’re allowed, though I prefer they be flared so I can filter them out.
---
But that’s not really the point. No matter what the rules for content are, you need people checking what gets submitted. People will post illegal content, or groups of people will push content against the subs original intent to the top repeatedly and drive away users etc. If you have a particular idea for a sub, you need people to moderate it or the vocal minority will take over every time.
---
But it’s also like
---
You can hold threat with whatever
---
This was me in WoD and I quit and said I wasn’t coming back ever because it was so bad. 
---
Then a friend talked me into getting Legion and bam played the whole thing.
---
I'd disagree, you need 30 rage or so for sweeping strikes, if you're spending time in battle stance for that, you're taking more damage, can't taunt and generate less rage. If you're in def stance you can't really sunder anything for a while to generate the rage.
---
I use a lot of revenge, in fact I find that if you can open with revenge on the skull, you tend to be able to sunder other stuff before you lose aggro on the skull, usually getting back to the skull for a sunder to keep the threat up.
---
Challenging shout I tend to use for an oh shit someone gon' die, paired with shield wall
---
Quick question! Is that ililililililili from Azhara server on alliance back in the day?
---
U won’t have enough for bloodthirst though
---
Savage
---
strangely enough it can be absorbed with grounding totem
---
The damage lost on a boss to glancing blows is 15% at 305 weapon skill, but with edge master's a human or orc reach the soft cap for weapon skill in terms of reducing the glancing blow damage reduction further.
---
The true warlock is in the comments
---

---
I didnt say it was overwhelming, but as an original horde player the bias during vanilla was definitely real. Didnt realize how easy we had it.
---
But by all means if you want to use the hillsbras thing as a reason to kill people then do it. At the end of the day I do it because it's fun.
---
 Just search the weakauras site for classic hunter auras its there
---
He probably didnt kill you 5-6 times while your party were waiting on you.  
---
Wasn't hilarious for me.
---
Ok....now that was funny. Rip!
---
I'd just push through to 60 unless you need a break. A lot of the Hunter prebis comes from strat/school/ubrs so you need to be 60 to effectively run those and farm the gear. Can also add dire maul North to that.
---
Didnt realize that ammo was actually better than the thorium stuff
---
What is the point of trashtalking Warlock masterclass?
---
People have said that playing on a PvE server is not "classic experience". Screw what the others think, just do what you want.
---
Wait why exactly is your girlfriend leaving you something that would STOP a blood rage?
---
Seems to me like it would make it worse.
---
Ok, interesting.
---
hope he can run a lot more than 10 on a "massive custom rig", my toaster laptop from 2010 can do 5 not bad
---
Yea it brings the glancing blow dmg down to 5% at 310/312 skill so its better to use gloves that give crit/ap on a human/orc. The gloves are only bis if youre at 300 wep skill with the weapons you have basically.
---
It has been fixed now, didn't have time as soon as I thought I would, but yeah, I actually noticed the missing stuff a few days before your post, but still good to have people keeping me up to pace :)
---
I guess I’m getting old, I don’t get 90% of the references. Have an upvote anyway

I prefer to just pretend thunderbluff doesn't exist at all after like level 40 personally.

and then they reopened the free server transfer for no fuckn reason so it will just get worst ( u can transfer off herod only)
---
Stay fury for raid DPS, flurry is really good.
---
Lol not sure where all the hate is coming from. Looks great imo.
---
Im a lvl 37 dwarf hoping to pick up a human mount. Could you explain how you gained all that rep without handing in runecloths?
---
You won’t get in to groups with a bad DPS who pulled aggro on a boss, didn’t use any cooldowns to not die and then whines about it?
---
Mate are you gonna be ok? Maybe we can crowd fund a server transfer to another server where healers aren’t as common as mages. I think we could try... lemme see... literally any of them?
---
Such good
---
The mage is not getting fair due here because of the fight mechanic.  Did you know the fight?
---
I don’t agree with the mage being a dick but as a healer i question -  why did you only hit him with a renew when the boss mechanic is to sleep the tank and go to next on the aggro list?  You could have bubbled and healed him until the tank recovered.
---
If you had another warrior /pally/Druid in the group they should have picked him up.  Would you have only put a renew on them as well?
---
This isn’t retail, not everything is instant and gcd capped, get your swings in for a bloodthirst sooner than running. It’s with a whole -3% crit, call it a day. Also charge + bloodrage + melee is almost 30 rage your not gonna have to wait long.

Awesome, now I can watch this on my Chromecast. Danke.

Having WoW features being catered to the Majority on big game designs is how you end up with retail.
---
Alliance side Incendius. I've been there since day 1. Im enjoying it greatly, especially now that a lot of the alliance has caught up to 60. 
---
Passing ownership of BRM back and forth has been a lot of fun! I'm not disappointed in the decision to stay in the least bit.
---
I got the impression that wasn't THE plan, but the backup.
---
And Arthas would have gone either way.  If the city turns (and it would), and he wiped the populace out, Mal'ganis's taunting would have lured him anyway.
---
But that doesn't really impact this topic; the morality of a situation is based on what the person knows at the time and what they can be reasonably be expected to know.  You shouldn't hold him responsible for not knowing the opponents backup plan to bait him to come to northrend in his emotional state, use a magic sword controled by an undead orc demigod to rip his soul out and have him massacre his own army and lead it back to destroy lordaeron.

Medivh transforming into a raven isn't really druidic magic, it's tied to the Staff of Ateish.

No, I'm saying people won't care if you don't enforce it.

If you don't enforce rules people post whatever and your sub becomes a karma farm.

&gt;Go ahead and link me one high quality sub with a sizable userbase and zero or close to zero moderation. C'mon. Show me I'm wrong.

The 2H gets more threat from sweeping strikes!

Yeah honestly if this was just a YouTube link I would have scrolled right past but since I could watch it in the Reddit app I did. And then I opened YouTube anyway to subscribe, so smart move my dude.

Thanks! It's been fairly confusing how to figure that stuff out. Getting to the hit cap is probably pretty important as well, no? Guess I'll have to do some more research as to what is important to reach.

You keep saying “Vast majority” and you’re making exactly the same mistake you’re accusing me of lol .

Solution: everything stays the same with buff cool-down except buff is applied to raid members in Orgrimmar when head is used if buff is on CD.
---
Sword is much better than dagger
---
I forgot about the debuff slots, that could be a big factor. Do you think the bosses themselves were made any easier in Classic compared to Vanilla? As in, could it be that in Vanilla their stats were nerfed over time, and Classic used the nerfed stats?
---
I have 100/100 fiber so it's probably not that :(

No kidding. I hate the N word too, but these people let it severely shake them when it shouldnt. On top of that, it's all selective too, some words are bad and others arent anywhere close despite also being derogatory according to a lot of people like that.
---
So dumb imo
---
Find how to do it without siphon life, i dont want to respec from raids to farm dm east.

EXPLOSSSSIONN
---
a konosuba reference out in the wild :D
---
if you have enchanting, you gonna have a bad time making it worth till late game.
---
sometimes you can make a profit by disenchanting, but you depend on luck of the roll
---
&gt; because u wont get in my groups again  
---
Bitch, you're a mage. OP is a healer. You won't be getting into OP group again.
---
LeatrixPlus I think is what delivers this functionality, but it can also be done using AdvancedInterfaceOptions
---
WhAts the add on to use for your map ?
---
I've tried both disabling all addons and reinstalling them, the issue still persists. I have a dual monitor but always on the main one in loading screens. :/
---
I heal all dungeons as shadow if guildies need me to but my healing set is pre raid bis with some raiding gear, pretty easy.
---
Purple items exist because BWL will require gear. 
---
Too many people dropping Ony heads is annoying but not a major problem at the moment. It’s nice but totally unnecessary for MC anyways. By the time phase 3 comes out I think we will see better coordination of drops, and fewer guilds making it past AQ anyways.
---
Wouldn't recommend this unhealthy behavior
---
Almost all the guides I read say that swords are best to level with as a rogue but I really enjoy the dagger play style. Should I continue with daggers or is it a significant loss of efficiency?
---
I read half these comments expecting a /s at the end.
---
It says the paladin class can wear Leather, Mail, and Plate. I thought they only used cloth to heal?
---
Good druid weapons are hard to come by. I recommend that you run gnomer for the manual crowd pummeler, it has great stats for a long time.
---
paid to win bullshit game
---
Check autoloot and voila
---
Yes I know. I'm saying that if they don't make it across ALL servers and instead make pvp servers only cross realm for pvp servers, and then same for pve. And RP servers would be included in either PVP or PVE depending on their type
---
For soloing out in the world that pretty much the go to thing, instead of switching to zerker as you charge your gonna be hitting bloodrage, then going zerker. It’s not terrible.
---
This is what classic wow movies were all about with a great modern twist! Love it!
---
so fuckign gay lmao

---
Its just common sense and art of war shit that people aren't going to choose to take an unfavorable engagement if they dont have to. If you think you have a higher chance of winning than losing then you pvp, otherwise you avoid it.
---
* Get the Vendor Price addon for quest rewards, etc. 
---
* Don't buy skills you won't be using anytime soon.
---
* Pick up everything that is dropped.
---
* Don't buy gear or consumables if you can help it
---
* Don't level a crafting profession
---
* Grab 1-2 gathering professions (Mining + Skinning or Herbalism + Skinning)
---
I legitimately only ran UBRS Jed/rend runs for 3 weeks. No other dungeons and finally got it 3 days ago. Minimum 4 hours a day for 20 days, it hurt
---
Enjoying bgs and being good are two very different things
---
I am in talks with other guilds but the fact remains that the dragon head lasts really long for how how many people have ony on farm.
---
They still give rep, just less rep.
---
100% behind this idea.
---
Also 31/20 because tanks are more in demand the the burst heal is negligible in raids, which is usually the only time I heal, and it’s only for a few fights, not the whole night.
---
Or *more* kiting, I suppose. Thanks for the information.
---
Oh dear god, what madness have I stepped in to...
---
Move on
---
it’s the way you read things. it comes off as dickish but it could be playful too tbh
---
That f Zero starting music tho
---
That's awesome and made me chuckle. Do you have a website? How could I read the others? Really good work.
---
Time spent corpse camping is hardly wasted.
---
Am I strange or is that pizza lacking a bit? Chorizo would be great! :p
---
Druid! ho wait I'm a druid...
---
My question as well.
---
You’re in the wrong
---
#freeHongKong
---
Rogues kind of suck in BGs tbh, world pvp yeah
---
İ am in same server. Are you Horde or Alliance?
---
Why. Are. You. Here. Then.
---
That's not really a retcon, even if it did come from Blizzard and not from some poster on reddit.
---
The Lich King's goal has ALWAYS been to kill everything so that they could use the Scourge to defend Azeroth from an even badder bad. That started with Ner'zhul manipulating Arthas into purging Stratholme, then eventually going to Northrend to give him (Ner'Zhul) a physical body to inhabit instead of being stuck inside some magic armor. It was all so that Ner'Zhul could defend himself from being soul-waterboarded by Kil'Jaeden.
---
What are ya drinking?
---
&gt; The fact is the mage should never have had the boss on him, that is where the blame lies.
---
he literally says the blame lies in the mage having agro. thats simply not true and thats what i'm replying to.  the context of the post is irrelevant I'm replying to him flat out saying this is where the blame is.  this isn't where the blame is.
---
I mean bless their hearts, they had to wear a lot of different hats from time to time, and they wrote a *lot*.  
---
As a kid I always thought the cinematics were so amazing that there's no way they couldn't make it into a movie.  As an adult I realize they were basically just action scenes, and the actual dialogue and narrative were really corny.
---
There is no fair wpvp. It's a sad fact of the game.
---
 In 100 hours /played, I can count the number of good fights I've had on one hand. The vast majority is getting ganked while low health, getting ganged by baddies, and griefers with huge level advantages. 
---
It's three and a half, three awesome fights and one awesome fight ruined by a shitter running in when I had him where I wanted him. Wpvp has awesome potential - it feels some much more dangerous and real than BG pvp, the environments are interesting and ever changing, the competition is a mixed bag. It's an honest pity that there are so many people who'd never engage in a fair 1v1.
---
Not saying you should /point and /bow before attacking, and only if they emote back. But come on, bro, you can't possibly be having fun fighting people ten levels below you.
---
I don’t like it = pissy apparently
---
Ahaaahaaa!
---
NO CAPS! DOESN'T COUNT!!!
---
400*
---
As a 57 fury warrior myself. I wouldn’t recommend respeccing from arms until at least lvl 50. Not very much hit% gear before that.
---
Yeah theres a sound clip you hear in cities that sounds like a hammer and anvil going *tink tink tink* and I hear it in movies and tv all the damn time.
---
For me alts are just casual. The point is to have fun trying different stuff. I never push to get stuff done on them.
---
So full disclosure, I have only played a few hours in Classic on my son's account and machine. I was planning on getting  new gaming computer for myself around now but things have come up. So I haven't started leveling. I played retail from Wrath and raided through Mists of Panderia and on a few Vanilla private servers. Here is my leveling plan:
---
I expect to still be leveling during Phase 2 on a PvP server so my main will be a Night Elf Druid tank I'll push to 60. They are good for escaping bad PvP situations and I'll gather herbs while I level because Druids are good for that. You can pick them in Travel Form. I'll take Alchemy for my other prof at low levels to get some cheap buffs but there should be a solid demand for the higher level herbs on the AH so when I get to that point I'll drop Alchemy and pick up Enchanting which I will need for the [tanking trinket](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11811/smoking-heart-of-the-mountain). 
---
My main alt will be a dwarf rogue. I won't be in any hurry to level this toon but will make sure to keep it well geared with some enchants so can engage in world pvp or hide as necessary. Gathering is my main income source and this is the toon for it. I'll take Mining and Skinning and as I run through zones grinding Beasts I'll switch from searching for ores to the dwarven Treasure Seeking racial which is great for finding chests in dungeons and the open world. I expect this toon to more than pay for the gold spent on gear. 
---
When I get bored with those I'll inevitably start a healer. Likely a dwarf priest because again, PvP realm. And eventually a paladin I think. I've never leveled a pally even to 30. I'll just play those toons when I feel like it so they will prolly always have bonus xp from the blue bar. 
---
I figure 4 toons, plus my bank alt, will give me plenty to do. I've found that I like the familiar old content but with different abilities to make it fresh. I expect to play about 3 hours a night and some during the day on weekdays as well but not on weekends. I think that's plenty of time to spread around my toons.
---
Alliance
---
Same player pulls the skipped pack by backing up 10 minutes later
---
&gt; Did not count autos as those can be blocked. 
---
No they can't? lol
---
But this is strange indeed.
---
İ am Horde and this server is highly Alliance populated :/
---
I'm a mage.... I also totally get the mage hate.
---
Yeah you got that right. The only thing is the numbers. So if you get 1% hit (i called it a point in the post), that will change the miss in the example from 0-80 to 0-70. Everything else you got pretty much correct.
---
I never see warriors using whirlwind in higher level content. Is there a reason why? I was in torch room in BRD and I didn’t see the warrior whirlwind once. Do they have a better aoe option?
---
oh damn
---
Because someone kindly linked this and got interested of the comments :)
---
I would say probably close to 1/3 of horde players picked the faction because of racials. There are probably 10-20x more orcs on the horde side compared to vanilla and that is literally only because of stun resist.
---
thats level restricted anyway.
---
should have rings and neck and maybe trinkets by lvl 40
---
It's a lovely name!
---
I was luck enough to be in the first wave of players on this realm, so I got all the names I wanted.
---
Name checks out.
---
Thanks, I just tried re-writing my macro and /use &lt;mount name&gt; works. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong before.
---
To eliminate spelling errors, I typed '/use ' and then just left clicked my mount in my inventory and the client auto-filled the name of the item into the macro. I bet I was just spelling it wrong before.
---
I guess i don't have it on Sap, now that you mention it. Ambush, Cheap Shot, and Garrote.
---
Feel bad for your stomach if you down that whole thing by yourself lol
---
If you can't find the hit, keep Blackcrow. Carapace will be slightly more overall dps.
---
Has anybody had luck doing the hunter pull trick where a pet (wind serpernt?) or player with a ranged attack pulls 1 mob out of a crowd after the hunter pulls. Then hunter FD , and the other mobs from the pack go home. 
---
I'm just wondering if it's possible to easily split some of the nastier packs in like strat, lbrs, etc
---
I'm with China tbh
---
Druid. Would take a lot longer without Life Tap though. 
---
Probably faster to just tank for a needy group, clear it normally, and reserve ores for yourself.
---
Everyone roll "need" unless you need it. Give it to the person who needs it only on the agreement that it will be instantly equipped.
---
Hoarder alert!
---
I'm currently level 59 and have been running many dungeons throughout the leveling process.
---
In every dungeon run ive been in every group member has rolled greed unless they are going to equip the item straight away.
---
Those that have rolled need have always asked first and explained they are going to be using the item, myself included.
---
Maybe I've just been lucky or chose a good server (Zandalar Tribe) but I've come across no ninja looters yet for BoE items, the closest to a ninja looter I've grouped with was another shaman needing on the healing staff from last BRD boss when i had just spent a good 3-4 hours healing the whole dungeon for the group and i needed the staff myself, i found that in very bad taste...but i won the roll.
---
+3% hit and +3.7% are no different so 305 vs 312 skill does nothing for hit.
---
+4.7% dmg to your white attacks is about +2% overall dmg (i do about 40% of my dmg with white attacks on a boss like Rag). 
---
I think having +1 crit and 50 or so AP would be more than that dmg increase. And thats if it actually is 4.7% more dmg having 305 vs 312 skill.
---
And you dont get any +crit from 305 vs 312 skill.
---
I believe it uses a global. But it's definitely possible.
---
l2p
---
I am not saying you are the bad guy, and at 40 there are not many trinkets available.  You shouldnt be called out on your gear if you have your main armor equipped.  
---
Also worth mentioning that at lvl 40 your gear is making almost zero difference to group efficency as you are unlike you have much +heal or +spell crit anyway.  If you keeping the tank up, you done your job.
---
I know your pain. Thought I was going to get gkick  when I told them I replaced leggings of the fang at level 50 something. I know there were better options, but I never got around to them or got a better drop.
---
Its part of ElvUi it overhauls the entire HUD
---
I don't quite follow how you're using this macro to find broken tooth
---
Absolutely not. 
---
I can't WoW like I used to. This is coming from a guy that had an 8/8 T6 rogue, Crux of the Apocalypse, with full Vengeful Gladiator set.
---
Yeah it was combustion-living bomb
---
I love these. Nice work lol
---
Should have*
---
Sorry... I know not all spriests are like this, but it’s super hard to keep aggro away from an spriest, especially bad ones. 
---
SWP dots at the start means you have to tab sunder. Hope to god the rest of your DPS is hitting the same target as the priest because you’re gonna have to taunt every time they mind blast. All that effort and they don’t really offer utility... a good spriest obviously does (heals dispels and bubble) but a bad spriest has 4 keys bound and the rest require a few clicks.
---
They are the best 19 twinks
---
As a healer, not convinced that's true. I felt like I was in high demand for lowbie dungeons, but at lvl 60 I'm having trouble getting into the dungeons where a lot of healing pre-BiS drops. The demand for tanks is on a completely other level compared to the demand for healers.
---
Ever heard of a healer who though their pug DPS was competent? You should never assume ppl are as good as yourself. And for all we know the mage could have CDs. I've saved countless idiot dps when by your logic i should just watch em die. Idiot dps is still dps. If you can save, you should, just saying how i prioritize my group healing. Letting a dps die means longer time spent in dungeon.
---
BOTTLE
---
That’s the odds if you care what the number is (for the OP it is important). But if you only care about 3 people rolling the same number, it’s gonna be 1/10,000 since the first roll doesn’t matter what the value is.
---
Grab fishing. Anything in a pool can be great. The salvage can even drop greens mats and recipes.
---
You cant teach the ignorant :D
---
Hunters were popular in the 19 bracket, they were pretty strong.
---
There used to be a website called Twink Info or something, not sure if it’s still around. But they had a ton of information and people would organize events through it. 
---
Sorry I’m on mobile
---
&gt;ask guild for any dungeons, no answer
---
&gt;look around in different channels and nobody needs a healer (noggenfogger are fucking stacked with healers)
---
&gt;solo farming for 1-2h
---
Thirteen!!
---
It would be really fucking nice if they fixed world defense channel too because at least then you'd have an idea to what's going on in the world.
---
Some good old red wine. You know, to balance out the not-so-posh pizza.

1. (of a remark, opinion, or idea) overused and consequently of little import; lacking originality or freshness.
---
It's literally in his username, don't feed the trolls, they already have Darkshore!
---
I'm glad I told myself early that I wouldn't care about Dal's.  Everyone and their mother wants those swords, and there are enough alternatives that make trying to get a group, then seeing the swords drop, then hoping to win the rolls, not worth the time investment.
---
If you have all day to do a dungeon, sure.  If I have exactly 1.5 hours and if we dont get it done in that time frame im going to have to leave then I kinda need it goin as fast as reasonably possible
---
The roll you were doing during the encounter determines your eligibility. You don’t get to flip flop just because of a drop. Go get pre BiS as a tank and come back and tank it. Then you’re eligible.
---
Mage doesn't count. Run it back.
---
So what if Teebu's Blazing Longsword drops? Worth upwards of 6000g.
---
The Rogue says he's going to use it, do you just give it to him?
---
Just because you can't use the sword, couldn't you still use the 6000g? Couldn't you use that gold to buy things that your character can use?
---
Don't you deserve a fair shot at rolling on something that valuable? Isn't everyone rolling need the most fair possible way? Other than selling it and splitting the gold equally, but that would require a lot of trust.
---
As he said: edgelord.
---
Jeffpesos
---
&gt;And thats if it actually is 4.7% more white dmg having 305 vs 312 skill
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
&gt;You dont get any +crit from 305 vs 312 skill
---
Shit, yeah, edited post.
---
Mine is Jeffpesos :)
---
A
---
Ironically so. Just this morning I got 10 for 10g. What are the odds someone else did exactly what OP did?
---
The awful recorder at the end was excellent.
---
DUDE, THATS NOT HOW THIS WORKS
---
DW generally is better for single target sustained dps while 2h excels with AoE trash.
---
Also, don’t go DW until you are yellow hit capped and have more than 25% crit unbuffed.
---
I will say also that 2H is much less viable on alliance side. Horde has WF which dramatically increases dps for 2h wars.
---
Am i the only idiot that goes to an instance BEFORE i start hitting up LFG so i'm ready to zone in straight away?
---
Thanks man. Sorry you got downdooted in the comments.
---
Bad mage
---
I actually did a dungeon and someone in it asked if I’d leave my guild for theirs because apparently it’s rare for the mage to frost nova when the other dps starts to aoe.
---
If you enjoy making these keep it up, they are really funny.
---
I’ve seen it from urok.
---
Switching from horde to alliance after 10 years is like being an atheist all your life and then all of a sudden becoming a hardcore evangelical Christian in your 40s. You were right this whole time, why did you make such a stupid decision later in life?  People are more passionate about horde because its actually cool, alliance is lame in comparison,  that's why people aren't as attached to it.
---
That's a really low sample size.
---
I reccomend running at least 10,000 attacks if you're trying to measure % accurately.
---
Oops, I forgot the last clip is w/ dagger sub build.
---
!remind me
---
It’s never worked for me.
---
agreed, and when it comes to things of value like say a flask recipe, I would expect anyone rolling need to learn it on the spot.  I have passed on 3 epic BoE's so far, and happy to do it again if the person is prepared to prove they will use it.  I will one day get screwed by some cash whore but its only money, and once you got your epic mount money has less value.
---
You posted this earlier?
---
Ok ok I’m sorry I poked the bear but sometimes I do miss some convenient features and yes I understand dungeon finder had many flaws too it but it’s nice for people with limited time
