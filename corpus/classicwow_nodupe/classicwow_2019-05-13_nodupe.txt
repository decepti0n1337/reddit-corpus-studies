sorry but what does focus even mean? i dont understand

Shortly after the beta is released, obviously.

Highborne are anachronistic scum that should have all died out in the War of the Ancients.

I think most will at least hit revered through Scholo/Strat, especially now that DM is gated to release phase 2.
---
Btw yeah always wear AD trinket in Scholo/Strat and ONLY cash in the rep coins after hitting revered, because I don't think mob kills add to rep after honored.

The early phases will be dominated by that brand of players with a desperate need to be the biggest fish. They're the ones who hit 60 after a week, clear MC inside the first two weeks, and turn honor-farming into an industry once the PvP system comes online. They only make up like 10% of the population, but for the first month they'll be 80% of the level 60 scene which can be annoying for those who hit 60 in the second wave of serious but not-ultra-hardcore players.
---
So by the one month mark, the semi-hardcore players will be arriving at 60 into the open arms of a subset of players who have been farming gear for weeks. The honor system isn't online at this point in time so the PvP isn't too cutthroat yet, but the dungeon scene is surprisingly serious and we'll start to hear the first complaints about "nobody wants to invite my balance druid to dungeons!" As more and more players hit 60 and the tryhards become a smaller percentage of the whole, hardcore player toxicity starts to wane. Most of them are finished with dungeons by now.
---
Then the honor system comes online in phase 2. The world changes overnight. It goes from a place where only a few players care to go out of their way for PvP into one where most of the playerbase is feverishly trying to farm honor without BGs. Since noone is really familiar with the process of ranking up through world PvP, there's a lot of fretting over hitting the high standings and players will go to silly lengths to farm honor in ways that will be tantamount to griefing. 
---
Every flight point that can be camped will be camped. Every bottleneck between zones, every high traffic point, every popular farm spot will be a permanent war. It's not the big Tarren Mill battles that give the good honor, although those will probably take place as well; but the tryhards will be patrolling in twos and threes, clearing whole zones over and over. Lopsided servers become nearly unplayable for the disadvantaged side, and many realm communities will erupt in arguments and fretting over having invested time in a hopeless situation as people find themselves on 30/70 realms where they legitimately cannot play the game because the 70% faction has conquered the entire world.
---
This goes on for a long time. People are quietly raiding and nobody pays a whole lot of attention to MC because it'll be as trivial as everyone feared, meaning any remotely competent guild is clearing it every week without a hitch. All focus will be on the PvP environment for months, especially once the fastest rankers begin to hit rank 13 and 14. This starts to happen after two and three months respectively, and people will realize that the 1.12 epic PvP set is in fact on par with AQ40 loot which will cause a lot of debate and gnashing of teeth.
---
Then BWL and BGs come out. This takes the foot off the neck of the servers, giving players some breathing room to do what they want while the tryhards are raiding and running premades. There's still gonna be a lot of PvP, especially around BRM and DM. The lopsided servers have become completely one-sided as months of barely playable conditions have caused most to transfer off the weaker faction or quit the game. Balanced hotspot servers will become the measuring stick for things like competitive speedrun raiding and general importance. It'll be like "okay, so you're R14, but are you R14 on one of the *real servers?*"
---
Things gradually calm down from here and world PvP eventually just becomes the usual random 1v1s and 1v2s. People mostly stop camping Blackrock Mountain once AQ40 comes out and spreads the content around instead of centering the entire endgame in one mountain. Those who were seriously trying for R14 have reached it by now, so while there are still premades in BGs, it's nowhere near as competitive as it was during phase 3 and 4. Once Naxx comes out, there's a mass exodus of players who move to (or wait for) a fresh set of realms. Then everything starts over.
---
That's a drastic exaggeration. 
---
This might be a problem during the first few months because fad, but once it dies down only the big-boys like Asmon are going to actively change a sever's pop.
---
It might be hard to track, but it's pretty much risk-free on pservers, while it will at least be bannable if "detected" in classic.
---

Always happy to spread The Good News about priests :)

Find the nearest server to Sacramento, California, please! Woo!
---
I might switch to play with a RL friend, but not sure. I prefer Alliance and have way more experience with Alliance.
---
Haven't watched the video but it makes me sad that I have to worry about this.
---
If they never go PvP either you can always try to kill all the things they are trying to kill first too.
---
undead are cool as fuck!
---
Same same but different
---
&gt;July 16 is the release date of the beta
---
This hurt in a special kind of way
---
Druids are still desired in raids. The demand for them is high because the supply of geared Druids is lower. Its probably the least played class. So while there are always more Shamans or Priests than Druids in a raid, its not uncommon for Druids to be the last thing that guilds struggle filling.
---
Uhh not really funny... but kudos on the effort put in.
---
So having an active subscription to the retail game is irrelevant?
---
If you are inviting people to see details of a product launch you are 100% having them sign an NDA.  
---
In journalism and public relations this is called a "press embargo".  You agree in the NDA to not release information until a specific date.  Thus why you see reviews for movies, video games, etc all released publicly at the same time.
---
Server imbalance for one. They always roll on PvE servers, so the imbalance always leans heavily in the faction that they're on.
---
Sometimes so many people follow them around they can just straight up ruin the zone they're in.
---
I hope its a joke (from undead perspective)
---
horde Blelf hunter on retail and will be going Human maybe Warrior for classic, not played classic ever so i’ve learnt i like swords and to bash things on BFA, also learnt i can’t stand hunters.
---
It will really only be something to think about at launch, as I think it will become less of a problem over time. Still, sucks for those that will unknowingly get caught up in it. I'd be so pissed if a streamer got me suspended for something like stealing an ore node.
---
https://youtu.be/Ev-cy000SaM
---
Just play on a PvP server. There will be no streamers, and getting ganked a few times isn't a big deal.
---
This is the only acceptable reason to play on such servers.
---
I wish there could be age restrictions. I'd love a 30+ server for guys looking to re-experience the game we played years ago.
---
Gnome Warlock or Dwarf Hunter for 1v1/world pvp? Of note is that I’m intent on rolling Ally because they are cooler than the horde :)
---
Yes that works too

Why skip over the 5% str? Wouldn’t that be better for mitigation than the 5/5 interrupt resist one?
---
get in touch with customer service. from what i’ve seen on here it’s fairly simple and a quick process.
---
what makes it unpleasant? I would love constructive criticism.
---
i like it on every race mostly because of the color
---
Rogues are one of the slower levelers? u foking wut m8?
---
Oh boo hoo. Then stop streaming and play a different character with a different name.
---
Stealth is one of the game defining mechanics of wow.
---
Main combat results will be determined, on the most part by DPS versus healing. 
---
Obviously, if you can out heal their DPS your side will win.
---
With that said, healers are usually back of the line fighters because they are generally more squishy.
---
That's where Rogues and Hunters (with increased range and pet) come into play.
---
Rogues and hunters are the best at being able to pierce through enemy lines and disrupt the healers/support in the backlines.
---
As for PvE, rogues usually are near the top in DPS meters.
---
Can someone break it down Barney-style why being on a server with people who stream is so incredibly different? I mean, there's still going to be (theoretically) a lot of people in certain areas.
---
That video is....interesting.  Its clearly intended to showoff that guys dps, yet they don't show his gear or talents, and they don't give any explanation how he achieved the high dps.  It seems like he's just playing his character normally and his white damage and crits are simply much higher than normal. 
---
The resolution on that video is the best I have ever seen for a "Vanilla" video, actual HD where you can clearly make out text.  It was uploaded in 2012 so theres no way to know when it was actually made.  It also does not look like there is close to 40 people in the raid, and zero raid frames are shown other than the tank.  Everything considered, I'd say there is about 0% chance that video is actually from Vanilla.  Its either a private server or a video from later in TBC with the TBC talent changes.
---
Anyone know how many people a realm will have? Also, will faction imbalance be a huge issue for PvP realms? I imagine for a PvP realm to really feel like a PvP realm it'd have to have a decent balance of Horde and Alliance.

And dinosaurs are cool
---
Yeah cus I plan to test my levelling route on the real data so I can make adjustments if needed, iv already done warrior 4 times so I'll be fine doing it again.
---
If I’m not mistaken they actually took hunters from mana to Agility to eventually focus

Darkshore for me.

Going to level nice and slow on my main class for the first 10 levels reading all quest text class trainer text lore etc, so on live I can speed to get ahead of the pack then slow back down once I'm there
---
Tailoring enchanting is very passive and wont effect leveling speed.
---
If you want to make the most money, maybe tailoring skinning.
---
Collectable professions like herbalism and mining are difficult to keep leveled with the zone you are playing in and can be a real drag on leveling time.
---
I'm duo boxing rogue+druid. I'll be going skinning leatherworking on the main (rogue) and tailoring enchanting on the druid for bags and enchants.
---
I'm tempted go skinny/herbalism on the main. Then do tailoring/leatherworking on the druid. Eventually I'll probably drop tailoring once I have 14 slot bags and will level up alchemy.
---
Alchemy will be very important for MC raiding early game.
---
I'd probably pick a class / race combination that I had no intention of ever choosing. I don't really want to accidentally get invested in a character that I'm not going to be able to keep. It'd also allow me to focus more on bugs, and less on "OMIGAWD I'm playing Classic!!!"

I remember trying to choose back in the day and I finally decided... Druid! 
---
Then my brother said that's what he's been playing.
---
So... Ok... Shaman!!
---
The description online then (tbc) mentioned astral recall (which sounded awesome for an EQ player) and water walking. SOLD!
---
Your old ce won't give you shit in classic, it's a new game.
---
So this is how blizzard and all of the companies answer questions. It all make perfect sense
---
Therefore 
---
&gt;I really hope there's something equivalent for classic.
---
We don't know which addons will be ported to classic, so this was just a layout to build from when classic does come out.
---
I'm trying to justify both haha
---
NEVER!!! They are coming soon, I actually think they have some of the most interesting icons. Looking forward to doing them!
---
Been a Horde player since TBC, but I'll be going Alliance for Classic.  Main reason is to experience something new, since I've never played an Alliance at all.
---
I need one!!! How much?
---
Yeah all it would take is to go where they are and find someone wearing the same armour as them.
---
Can you send me the details too please

I couldn't ever level a rogue easily, always struggled with adds
---
These are sick. I would love to commission one if youre doing that! 
---
Would be a really cool addition to my gaming space!
---
Yep, Darkshore for me too. I have no memory of leveling my warrior to 30, but I remember abandoning their night elven ass in Desolace. But I do have strong memories of the zone itself, and although I kind of hate the layout, it’s got a really relaxed vibe to it, compared to the craziness of Teldrassil and Ashenvale.
---
I normally try to weave Darkshore into my 1-10 pretty early. I’ll be sure to get my mage and Paladin there stat.
---
I don't get it either.
---
Yeah, totally going to cry about playing a 15 yr old game lol
---
Do you have a leveling build laid out? Mind sharing any tips/links on warrior leveling?
---
Who
---
Its less becoming a Scarab Lord and more having other people to make you a Scarab Lord. Its a time consuming thing that requires help
---
It seems like the effect of [Bag of Marbles](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=1191) used to be a priest spell way back in the day, probably in alpha or beta state of the game.
---
Sure I'm happy to answer any questions you may have
---
Just stay away from asmons and sodas servers and you'll be fine. I caught asmon streaming some ESO for the first time, absolute cancer. Avoid at all costs.
---
Thankfully I'll be on an Oceanic server so I won't have to worry about this.
---
They need to pull an Uber and geofence the streamers houses so they only see 1 server option and they all go there and let us mere humans enjoy the game.
---
What’s your talent layout at say lvl 20 and lvl 40? When you get slam does it replace heroic strike?
---
Playing with a healer if it makes a difference
---
They're both great for 1v1. I'd just pick whichever one you like more based on lore and aesthetics
---
I'm going to be duo leveling with my girlfriend and she will be a warlock. Should I play Paladin (for that sweet free mount at 40) or a priest (for shadow damage buff) and I want to heal many 5 man's on the way to 60.
---
Thanks
---
Exactly, I'm looking forward to messing around and seeing where things take me, and who I meet along the way.
---
Hey bro, my dogs name is Guinness. You must be a cool dude.
---
Same, I will pay premium for one or two of these.
---
Fantastic job, I assume you routed it using private servers, how concered are you about slight xp differences compared to classic?
---
It was in twitch chat.
---
What did undead do for mounts pre patch 1.4, as there is no unarmoured skeleton horse mount and its associated riding skill?
---
Having a real tough time deciding between shaman, priest or druid. Have some interesting things I want to try with all of them but can't! 
---
Gonna have to hit the beta hard.
---
Played alliance in vanilla.  Going horde this time around.
---
There will have to be one pvp and one pve server surely. I don't expect more than one of each though.
---
Fuck you thats fucking why
---
In Vanilla WoW, you could write direct LUA scripts at the command line using /script.  People would set the name of a target into a global variable, then use that to target them cast a spell and retarget their previous target all in one action.  One of the more common ones was CC casting.  When you CC'd something, you could tap one button to automatically switch back, polymorph them again, and then keep fighting your original target.
---
One script would set your CC target.
---
`/script CC = UnitName("target")`
---
The other would cast your CC on your CC target then return to whatever you were targetting.
---
`/script TargetUnitByName(CC); CastSpellByName("Entangling Roots"); TargetLastTarget()`
---
In 2.01, that /script method was removed.  However, at the same time they added the ability to "set a Focus" and created a Focus frame, like a target, but separate.  They also prevented the ability to change macros or other addon targetting, during combat, making the Focus frame the only secondary targetting method you could use during combat.
---
Then they added the ability to make macros that would cast on that Focus instead of your current target, so you wouldn't have to change targets to do something.  
---
`/cast [@focus,harm] Entangling Roots`
---
They added modifiers to the cast command that allowed you to say "Whatever my focus is, cast at it", so you didn't have to switch targets then retarget your original target.  Basically a singular version of what the scripting could do.
---
In Classic they're not allowing us to use /script.  And they're *also* removing the Focus frame.
---
A better question is what makes it pleasant, and the answer is nothing.
---
There arent any really. Maaaybe forsen but idk if he will actually play classic seriously / be on an EU server
---
Tanaris. Loved the music, miles of sand, and helping Tooga get back to his lovely wife, Torta.
---
Yeah you make  some good points
---
man, who hurt you?
---
This guy has been there
---
Wow these are incredible!! I'd love to commission one too, could you please PM me the details?
---
We never got one back in the day. If it happens I won't know what to do without constant 300ms latency!
---
Thanks a lot for the insight fam, I really appreciate it.
---
I don't think that kind of mod will be allowed.
---
Booty Bay - When i walked through the entrance tunnel and say that town for the first time i was in aww. I thought it looked so cool and completely didnt expect it.
---
too many alliance in here. my favorite was hillsbrad foothills because it was the first time i really got introduced to world pvp. 
---
another favorite was the hinterlands, for some reason i just loved that troll village. another one that i enjoyed a lot was tanaris, probably because ZF is my absolute favorite dungeon. also loved the badlands. honestly theres not one zone i disliked from classic, everything was just full of life from the playerbase
---
I always level as arms tried fury and I personally find it to be slightly worse, especially since sit critting to proc enrage isn't going to work.
---
My build goes in this order: 
---
3/3 rend 2/5 deflection 2/2 imp charge (here is where you can change a little depending on if you plan to tank dung's while levelling, I do) 3/5 tact mastery  2/2 imp overpower (this is around 20 technically 21 so you'd be 1/2 on imp OP) 3/3 deep wounds 2/2 impale 3/5 two handed spec 1/1 sweeping strikes, 5/5 axes (hopefully you can get whirlwind axe but if you are quick on fresh you won't) now 5/5 tact mastery and get 1/1 AM then 4/5 two handed and finally mortal strike for your 40
---
i don't use HS or slam pretty much ever once I get sunder armor, after that my typical rotation is charge, apply rend and spam sunder to proc a Dodge and then overpower, because of the imp overpower you almost always crit to apply deep wounds or just flat out kill the mob anyway.
---
does it look bad on undead?
---
Speaking as someone who has every CE; it does not in any way detract from my gameplay experience that other people also have those pets. I've had more than 14 years of exclusivity already, I think it's perfectly fine to let other people enjoy them too.
---
I would be disappointed if I had to purchase the pets again in Classic, but I don't see an issue with them putting them on the cash shop for non-CE owners to purchase.
---
That's a good solution
---
then you get invested and main live with a character you never wanted :d
---
Don't stress my man, I'll be playing on OCE servers (assuming they exist).
---
I want to roll a gnome, and I want to ride on a Night Elf mount. Is there a guide to do this most efficiently while not slowing down my leveling too much?
---
What's a streamer?
---
*flexes/cries in Oceanic*
---
You're right. But typically with NDAs you can't even hint that you know something, let alone hint that you know something AND hint at what that something is. If these people signed NDAs then they've breached them. Seems more likely they didn't sign anything and just made verbal agreements not to specifically state information, with exclusion from future information being the punishment if they break that.
---
Would definitely play and practice what I’m gunna play live. The burnout isn’t a thing for me, if anything it makes me want to play more.
---
im going horde again for the massive nostalgia rush. itll be fun to explore places i havent been in almost 10 years that i used to visit daily. ill probably end up making an alliance on another server but horde for life man

SPriest main, Mage alt for farming.
---
Probably. I just wish people wouldn't try to say that Warcraft is based on the faction conflict as a reason for PvP servers. It's objectively not based on that, otherwise it wouldn't need to be a choice, yeah?
---
Personally, I enjoy battlegrounds a lot, but WPvP often just degenerates into zerging or ganking lowbies, and that's not really fun for me. I'm a cooperative more than a competitive player, I guess, which is why I enjoy PvE content more.
---
14% germans
---
iirc they had the same skeletal warhorses pre and post 1.4
---
&gt;But seeing as paladins are only good for healing in vanilla
---
lol, maybe for raiding but good thing there's more to the game than raiding.
---
Darkshore and Ashenvale. 
---
When I first played I had actually encountered a max level Undead Rogue outside of Dolanaar but my first real experience of fighting the Horde was on the boarder between the two zones. Spent a few days only gaining a few levels but had so much fun doing world PvP. Even if I got my ass kicked over and over.
---
i understand it better now, thank you for the effort
---
"Slight."

Someone getting 4 hours off of world record hunter time as a warrior.
---
"Record" time on pservers being 30 hours faster than Joana...
---
Winterspring or Felwood for me
---
My ignore list was full of Chinese gold farmers who kept spamming me for mage food so they could go out into the world and fuck up the server's economy.
---
can't second this advice enough! especially the keeping your feet exactly on the ground and getting a chair that can rock. i've only had mine for a week and it's helped me so much
---
What are the best professions for making gold? If I'm leveling with a buddy, is it a good idea for one of to have 2 gathering professions, and the other have the 2 similar crafting professions (i.e. herbalism &amp; alchemy)
---
Fail.  This is TBC not Classic.
---
You unlocked the title forever by the end of vanilla, didnt you? Even so, by this being a recent screenshot he would 100% have access to warlord title if obtained. These were vendor bought with tokens.
---
Eh, it's mainly one sided tbh. Alliance don't get into the faction pride thing like Horde do.
---
You have exclusive access to the pets in retail wow, which is exactly what you paid for. Classic wow is a new game.
---
They'll both work. Priest you have to compete with gear on though, but it won't be that big of a deal
---
Maybe i shud do this too. Sounds like mad fun. How many streamers are Alliance? Because I'm Horde errrday.
---
It said that for me too, exact date and year.  I just retrieved mine yesterday and I stopped 5 + years ago.
---
Asmongold could form a 40m raid group in less than 5 minutes just to farm deviate scales on the Classic demo.
---
It will be worse.
---
Please send me your store info

I'm hoping people who have the CE pets on live will be able to get them on classic.

More on topic I missed out on some of the CEs (I still regret letting my ex buy me TBC when I'd planned on getting the CE lol) and I would definitely spend cash for a zergling.
---
Are the digital CE upgrades still available for MoP onward? If they are that strengthens the arguments for a digital upgrade for older expansions, IMO.
---
I have no clue. Mostly because that isn't what's written.
---
But to answer your question seriously, WoW has datacenters located strategically across the USA, and the world, as well. The closer you are physically to a datacenter, the better your relative ping. So you ideally want to play on a server that is hosted by the datacenter nearest your physical location in the world. Hope this clarifies things! =)
---
Yup.
---
will be leveling pala.  Endgame prof plan is to be engi + mining(?) but skinning while I am leveling.  If I'm speeding to 60 would mining even be worth having?  I feel like I wouldn't even pass copper before I move on to higher-level zones.  I am actually debating leveling with skinning + tailoring just because those mats come naturally, and the crafted gear will be worth more than just the cloth.  Plus bonus always having a healing set for the few dungeons I do run on my way to 60.
---
What do? Skin + Mining, or Skin + Tailoring?
---
&gt; WHY IN THE WORLD DO PEOPLE WATCH OTHER PEOPLE PLAY VIDEO GAMES
---
Probably for the same reason people watch other people play sports.
---
LMAO epic the lines are amazing, Oh oh oof.
---
I would also like to make a purchase
---
I'm just happy to have talent trees.
---
hashtags have been around since at least IRC back in the late 80s. they just weren't mainstream until twitter in 2006.
---
Hopefully most of them.

I think Blizzard should announce few servers just for streamers, if one is not on that they will be banned.
---
I’m out of the loop. Can someone brief me on these classic beta hints?
---
"A few times"
---
STVietnam wants to have a word with you.
---
The faction imbalance will be heavily skewed though. That can affect how enjoyable a server is for both sides.
---
So according to this paladin and shaman are going to be the most popular classes (per faction).
---
The decision to disable /run commands in combat confuses me a bit.  
---
I understand that it allows for automating gameplay, but at the same time it breaks so many addons that is from the classic era.  
---
I hope they find a middle ground. Like allow for /run commands in combat, but it breaks spell cast arguments.
---
I thought that was the case, but It's been a long-ass time since I played and I wanted to make sure I hadn't forgotten something.
---
&gt; long ass-time

Flat out, Deep Ret Spellgear with Rank 1 SoC has a hypothetical 108:03 1-60 time through grinding only. Deep ret to ~45 then respec Spelladin wins out by a few hours @ 104:45, but R1 Ret with a few crafted Red Mageweave / etc pieces is simple enough to manage (*plain normal APMongo ret leveling has hypothetical 126:37 with all else the same*)
---
Durotar the best starting zone ever made in entire MMO history. The war drums and troll village ambiance is still amazing.
---
remember spriest is only truly good at pvp, meanwhile a mage can do both pvp pve
---
This, specifically Wailing Caverns
---
The Secure Frames API that they're using is far better in terms of preventing pure botting or one button macros.  They were going to release it during Vanilla, but the overhaul was so extensive they decided to push it out to TBC's client update.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All the old Addons have already either been upgraded over the years, or can easily be.  But things like auto-target decursive or HealBot really have no business in the game, even in Vanilla.
---
Elongating your words the way you do. People on the internet like their information thrown in there face at lightning speed. Just talk faster. -Also I'm a dick so don't take what I have to say to heart, thanks for the content.
---
Ah! Forgot to mention it in the google doc! thanks for mentioning it! Heroic MC is meant to "replace" your MC lockout for the week. If you enter Heroic MC, you're locked to heroic MC for the week, and vice versa. You cant clear both normal and heroic MC in a week. I think I had the written in a section I deleted at some point.
---
Vanilla raiding is already heavy on how many raids have to be cleared, adding more required clears each week would be awful.
---
Yeah but it would be kinda lame to be opposition to that. Streamers boost faction imbalance. While the idea of a big battle is totally awesome, if people are outnumbered 20:1 it suddenly isn't fun.
---
Correct. Actually the one time I got a beta invite was when my subscription was inactive. It's totally random
---
As more people pick engineering to min max, raiders with alchemy and enchanting become more valuable to raids.
---
Is there a point where there are so many engineers that picking it is no longer the bis option for a raid as a whole?
---
I played as a warrior in Vanilla, so I have some background.
---
When you are invited to a guild make it clear that you want to stay as DPS, but can off tank if needed at times. Stress that you will not become a main tank, because once that happens you’re a tank for life. Respeccing is extremely expensive, so you can’t flip-flop back and forth for DPS for PvP and tank for PvE, but you can spec enough into prot and dps to still tear it up on the BG and off tank if needed.
---
Make sure to bring tanking gear and a sword and board to every raid. This will ensure that you get good drops for dps warrior gear by making you a “team” player when needed.
---
I will say though, I was a main tank and probably had the most fun ever. Tanking in Vanilla was like nothing else as 39 other people depended on you to keep your agro up. PvP sucked (outside of tanking NPCs in AV and getting the flag in WSG), but I just made alts to keep myself entertained.
---
Best alliance guide out there. Amazing work. Only thing I can suggest is to add the 1-12 dwarf/gnome start.
---
Good luck working on the mount! I'm trying to do [the same thing (http://classicdb.ch/?item=18902) as a Dwarf.
---
Getting this much rep will basically end up being you doing all of [the Darnassus rep quests](http://classicdb.ch/?faction=69#quests) as you level as less of a "detour for a while then back to the other zones I was in" if that makes sense.
---
Off hand, I don't know if doing all of these quests will get you exalted. We'll have to see how exactly the rep values are working - especially spillover rep. If that's the caset, you'll likely need to [collect a ton of Runecloth](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=7801) to turn in until you hit exalted.
---
If you want some saber mount options, the alternative is going for the [Winterspring Frostsaber](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13086) solo rep grind or getting lucky in a ZG for [the tiger.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19902)
---
Feral is used for tanking and DPS. Both options are in one tree. 
---
In raids most Druids are Resto, few are tanks, even fewer are Feral and those ones are usually NE for the Blessing buffs. They do okay, the don't typically top healing charts and are often brought for the utility the provide as opposed to raw output.
---
They get a bad rap imo, great class in vanilla. Easy to gear, easy to level, fun to PvP with, fewer raid spots for Druids, but because their are so few Druids the demand for them are still high.
---
Not really. You block 1 additional damage per 20 strength and most of your stats will go to stamina and intellect. So you need 400 strength just to get one additional damage blocked and you'll have at most like 1050-200, maybe 250 with T2 and T2,5. Block is mainly there to eliminate the chance of crits, not reduce damage, although it is a bonus in 5-mans. 
---
Spiritual Focus is just an incredibly useful talent to have in PvE, PvP and solo play.
---
That makes sense. Well, hopefully, the beta will be quick :)
---
You have a nice place on my pike, greenskin
---
Skulk Rock in hinterlands. stay the FUCK away from my mushrooms REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
We need to start a post about keeping your server community strong.
---
Leveling tailoring doesnt really do anything, if you plan on crafting things to sell them, youre better off with just bandages.
---
Making past tin/iron can sometimes difficult, but youre going to be leveling it anyway so you may as well.
---
Yeah but in the 80s we called it a pound sign
---
That's an argument that's used every time the subject is brought up. Watching sports is weird too.
---
Are you kidding me? Dude solos level 42 cyclonian as level 36 warrior. Reaches lvl 60 with 5days played and 4 professions at 300 and video documents the whole thing!?
---
Thank you. Needed this.
---
Or, y'know, there will be *some* people not min-maxing
---
Barrens and Tanaris. I love Tanaris!
---
Winter spring is so peaceful.
---
As a marine biologist, you are wrong. Scaling is a thing and is irrelevant to how hard gear may be to obtain.
---
Tanaris is easily my favorite zone.
---
Tirisfal and silverpine on a rainy day
---
linking an unsticked dead thread in every thread smh aint even wednesday my dude
---
I’ll be on a pvp server tho. Lore and aesthetics are the last of my worries
---
*makes joke* by retrieved you mean made blizzard return your account after you sold it for $$$$$ back in 2007* :P
---
These are amazing!! I would love to buy some of your work
---
I too am interested, PM please
---
You've been wrecked by Shadow Priests on private servers because Shadow Priests are amazing at 1v1... once that have amazing gear. Getting that gear is hard as a Shadow Priest, so by all means roll one, but know its a challenge.
---
Those would be awesome as coasters!
---
... even joana said &lt;4 days is possible, also people are trying for years now to get it done faster. Just look at some speedrun history videos its normal to break records by even 50%  over such a long time.
---
I too would love to order one!
---
We won't be able to cast the next frostbolt as the previous one starts, that's all I know.
---
Yes.
---
For the Horde.
---
I can't no life as hard as you and I'm an actual NEET
---
It's a weekly thread also posted in the sidebar. Class selection posts go there at all times even if the threads are unstickied, just like guild LFG posts should go in the weekly LFG threads.
---
Demand is actually not affected by supply.
---
I've replied to a number of these threads so feel free to check my old posts. In short though, you really need to understand what your goals are in classic. If you want to be the best damage dealer or healer or tank, it's not the class for you. If you want to be eternally useful to your guild and friends and to be self sufficient in basically every situation, Druid is the best class to play imo.
---
Healing isn't too difficult, especially as you can leverage your heal over time spells that other classes don't have. There isn't a single class that has more diversity and you are always learning new tricks and ways to interact with the world.
---
I just think the idea that Blizzard should devote resources from the Classic WoW team to try and solve this "problem" is pretty silly. What if a streamer starts playing a month or two after launch and chooses your server? Are you going to re-roll on a different server? What if so many streamers play that there is no server without them? Would you just not play Classic? 
---
Honestly, I've been waiting for Classic WoW for 10+ years. I'm not out here searching for shit to complain about before the game has even hit beta. Seems like a lot of people agree with you though so it is what it is.
---
No thanks for the feedback. I like the hard truth. this is my first video ever and i knew it was going to be bad. I just wanted to try, i appreciate the feedback,
---
Is it practical to start with mining / herb and toggle between the two to collect both resources ? There is no internal cooldown swapping them in real time ?
---
One problem I see with announcing servers in advance is that people will make plans for certain servers, but you and your friends and guildies will have to do a quick turnaround when the server you want is full or down, etc. basically negating any plans you had to begin with.  Server lists could just get your hopes up and then disappoint. I would say it might be better to just let people figure it out based on what servers are open when you log in.  
---
Regardless, whatever happens on launch day, it’s sure to be memorable.
---
I think this is putting it lightly. At any time your gameplay can be interrupted by people camping you until you log out. People already do that to the other tryhards on private servers.. They are salivating to do that to more and potentially casual players.
---
For people with limited time or those who dont find that appealing, PvE is a safer option.
---
 [https://strawpoll.com/epp953sh](https://strawpoll.com/epp953sh)
---
If it makes you feel any better my entire social life at the time basically revolved around wow, I came home from college and would sit in Skype with my friends and play till like 2 in the morning so around 8-12 hours a day depending on if my college friends wanted to hang out aswell.
---
Now I'm also a NEET so...it's probably going to be significantly more.
---
If they invite me to beta I'll roll undead rogue there. I have a desire to roll rogue alt in Horde, but knowing how much  leveling warrior is a timesink I'm not sure I'd return to the alt idea anywhere soon after release.
---
More bombs and sappers is more dps. You can't have too many engineers.
---
You are correct. But thr naming convention for "alpha" and "beta" is greek
---
What is this, a crossover episode? 
---
Seriously didn't expect to see undertale on this reddit like ever. It's been awhile since I've played, it'd be a worthy game to fill some time.
---
The end of the dread wake mount subs is start of classic. Mark my words
---
Is Kungen still alive?
---
You don't need a sub. I got into MoP or WoD beta although I believe I got in on both, without a Sub.
---
Thanks @zero\_space, Druids do seem a lot of fun to play. But since I'm only playing them in retail right now, I'm not sure that reflects how they played in classic. Appreciate the input!
---
I’m going undead warrior it was my first char in vanilla so it seems fitting
---
how would I know what's the closet? I thought EU blizzard was located in France. I live in Israel
---
You're actually arguing that people who have the original collectors edition shouldn't have access to the pets in classic. Unbelievable, but quite typical for this subreddit.
---
I like the Joana leveling guide on the side lol nice setup.
---
Perhaps more importantly we can also hope to avoid the cancer kids who have been ruining private servers for years (devilsaur mafia etc)
---
It's not an argument, it is the answer the the question. People watch people play video games for the same reason people watch people play sports...to be entertained by something they find entertaining. Competition is one of the most basic forms of entertainment and has been so all through human history.
---
100% of my time spent on beta will be math-oriented and, you know... actually beta testing... marking bugs, etc.
---
Beta isn't a "free preview" it's there to put in work to have a great game.
---
&gt; Blood elves
---
Yep.
---
It instantly discounts someone
---
Honestly I think everyone should try a PVP server at least once.  The heightened tension makes the game way more interesting. Even if you don't see another player the whole play session you're constantly watching your back.
---
Mage is better, lock requires more gear
---
Well this is obviously never going to happen but if every single character on a server had engineering then it would be a dps loss without enchants.
---
Thanks Hycran! I'm *never* going to be top DPS and that doesn't bother me in the least. Just want to help out and have fun, and Druid seems to be the most versatile class to accomplish that. I'm not going to have time realistically to level more than one toon in Classic so I want to be useful, relatively good in DPS/Tanking/Heals (doesn't matter to me which) and see vanilla for all it's glory. :) Night Elf is my favorite race, so it seems like a natural fit.
---
On the small chance that I do play if I get invited I will play paladin because I plan on rolling Horde so won't play one after release.
---
I like the Shaman 2.5 red/yellow color scheme. But a lot of the 2.5 sets are just rad!
---
It's so interesting that felhunters were intended to be summoned before imps.
---
teldrassil and darkshore
---
Barrens, Winterspring, Silverpine Forest, Hillsbrad, Feralas, Desolace, 1k Needles, Tanaris, STV, Swamp of Sorrows, ahh... to many! -\_- ALL OF THEM!!
---
They hated Jesus for he spoke the truth
---
&gt; how concered are you about slight xp differences compared to classic?
---
The XP differences that were fixed on pretty much every private server like 15 months ago?
---
So much this. Beta invites are your chance to help the developer push out the game you love with an even greater attention to detail.
---
Regardless, the demand is there and the supply is low.
---
I spilled coffee on it, now my keyboard covers the stain.
---
&gt; Someone getting 4 hours off of world record hunter time as a warrior.
---
I beat Joana's 116 hour time as a Paladin on blizz accurate servers by 2 hours. Joana himself beat his own time by 22 hours. Routes and shit have changed in 15 years.
---
Are you talking about the node trackers? That has no cooldown, you just have to toggle them using one at a time.
---
Tarren Mill vs South Shore never ending battle royal, pre-honor system. Lagged the Zuljin servers out with that.
---
I'm a Paladin. So no.
---
I'll bet a stack of arcanite bars they will
---
You must mean besides engineering
---
Alchemy and fishing!
---
Teldrassil by far. But then I also miss Darkshore, Ashenvale, Werlands, Arathi Highlands, STV ... man I’m excited for vanilla!
---
Warrior’s description is excellent. “Great class for those who like to take damage.”
---
Thx
---
Is this a poor joke?
---
Theres like 2 total streamers that bring in crowds big enough to have a negative effect. Asmon and like one or MAYBE 2 others, most plan on PvP servers anyway. Its just not as big of a deal as people are making it. They aren't some scourge, its 3 people Itll be easy to avoid those servers.
---
Spirt. You spend much more time out of combat while leveling if you can remove the need to eat or drink yoh save time and money.
---
Paladins have huge amounts of downtime due to eating and healing
---
These would make for some wicked sick discord icons for future wow guilds
---
Paladin is one of the most, if not the most boring class to play at level 60. Even leveling them is not a lot of fun.
---
Even on that small Sample its Not an AVERAGE of 30 days :3
---
30 days is Just insane, you Had to spend months of doing nothing Worth experience to delay maxlevel that long.
---
Id say its More Like 20 days (for First timer noobs Back in the day) and in the upcoming Classic wow More Like 15days.
---
Cant wait for Release though. Assuming Casual 30hours/week Gaming it would Take Close to 3 months to getting ready to raid :)
---
Started alliance in vanilla, then switched to horde. Then in later expansions I switched back to alliance. 
---
Now I want to play alliance, but looks like all my friends want to play horde. So I don't know.
---
Song of Elune is to this day my favorite bit of the wow soundtrack
---
Is blizzard "Disallowing" any addons?
---
All it is, is simply figuring out how the client works and making the addon works. Even something like DBM and ElvUI could work on Classic. Addon creators are much more advanced than they were in the vanilla days.
---
I personally think you want to enjoy classic and you are a streamer, just simply don't stream it. I think Blizzard should never go out of their way to cater to streamers but, I believe the ignore list should definitely have more slots as even if you aren't a streamer there are some really annoying people out there. Asmongold I am pretty sure only plays on one account.
---
Yikes, if this is accurate it will be easier to find a healer for 5mans then 3 dps.
---
Realized I play on EU and this won't be nearly as big of a problem, feelsgoodman
---
Guild guild
---
I mean, it's a different game dude.
---
I don't need that in my life.
---
Hardcore guilds have those sorts of professions on alts, or they'll have engineering + enchanting and have an alt with mining to support their main's engineering.
---
Westfall and Redridge Mountains. I enjoyed all those quests.
---
What next, have blizz give you a 60 because you already leveled? Classic wow is fresh, believe it
---
And they can still play anonymously off stream.
---
Never even thought of using sunder armour for levelling, it actually works out better than heroic/slam? I’m going to have to try that. Would the axe specialisation change if you’re a human?
---
I do level in dungeons a lot but what do you normally stance dance for early on? I tend to pull with a bow instead of charge because of the adds and found my tac mastery wasted. That might change at lvl 30 with berzerker stance
---
This looks very good thanks!
---
the little skull rock cave thing with the quests inside only accessible by climbing the hill beside it and jumping down (only to have to fall, curse under your breath and do it all again). &lt;3
---
Never had trouble with a pally, druids otoh, just outlast you.
---
The two best are probably alchemy and enchanting. So the most beneficial would be one a clothie with tailoring/enchanting and the other herb/alch. You can provide each other enchants and potions to help with the leveling process and I feel like they're the most profitable at end game. 
---
Other professions depend pretty heavily on rare patterns and while enchanting has some, it can make money even pushing wands in the AH.
---
Dude those are siiick! Nice work!
---
One of the many reasons I'm considering rerolling Horde lol such a good guide
---
80% off, all someones must go!!!
---
Thanks!
---
OBJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ

Dun Morogh and Durotar. I get happy feels when in those two zones. They were both first impressions and they did well. I remember my older brother angling his screen and turning up the graphics to max which I thought were really good. But even more impressive was the fact that the moon's reflection on the ground in durotar - coupled with the music. Holy smokes. So much happy feels.
---
They're European so
---
It was fantastic on my warrior :D
---
Mage
---
Devilsaur mafia doesn't work on servers without international population. NA farmers take over when EU goes to sleep and vice versa
---
It's very strong, think of it this way: heroic strike will make a swing go from 100 damage to 120 damage but you gain no rage from that swing, sunder will make your hits go from 100 to 110 but that's for every single swing so it works out as even in damage on 2 swings and obviously becomes even better the more swings you do, and you gain rage from your swings aswell which let's you chain between mobs very well.
---
As for axe on human I'd say so, the 5% crit from axe spec is huge and warriors are very reliant on getting ceits for rage and deep wounds, sword definitely isn't bad but there are also so many strong axes you can get around the time you can use axe spec that it's the obvious choice (corpse maker, whirlwind, bonebiter and executioner's cleaver)
---
Druids are the same as being a jack of all trades is in real life. Noone knows they wanted one until they had one. Druids are perfect at filling any role which means they can save nearly any kind of wipe 5 mans and raids. Throughout all of wow, being able to drop into bear form, pop tranquility or even throw some dots has saved a wipe. On paper, it seems better to skip druids and go for pure classes. In the hectic world of endgame, having that all arounder can be a serious asset. Imo, 3-5 druids will not gimp your raid. Plus the self sufficiency is off the charts :).
---
Well as a hunter you can feign death and drink, so they aren't as reliant on things like mana pots, though obviously they're a dps increase to use them. I guess I was talking about how much benefit the class gets from flasks and stat buffs.
---
I'm also curious!
---
will **definitely** not happen.
---
They've said they would be disabling things that recreate systems introduced later in WoW, like LFG addons.
---
I would presume a quest helper addon falls into that category.
---
Discord group chat, Facebook Group Chat, a text message that is forwarded to all of your friends saying "We're rolling on this server boys".
---
"Blizzard accurate."
---
Which one didn't/doesn't have fucked up exp?
---
Ashenvale maybe? That zone had a great atmosphere and you got there at a level where your character really started to feel awesome as you had access to most of your awesome abilities.
---
My friend, I'll need a lock one!
---
Makes sense, but I find it unlikely that standard guilds won't have demand for other professions.
---
I smell a druid
---
It doesn't make him an authority, but hey, it gives him some cred as an intellectual
---
Also it’s hard to tell but I don’t think there’s any plate mail on it. Appears to be entirely made from cloth
---
Dwarf Priest. Having Fear Ward ooh baby.
---
While waiting for the rabbit to wander by and give us the time, we've slipped down into a curious little rabbit hole.
---
It appears, ladies and gentlemen, this sub has gone full memeception. May blizzard have mercy on our souls.
---
I really hope the streamers all agree to just play on one server, but I doubt they'll do it. Many of them are hypocrites in that they *also* don't want to play on a streamer server.

---
&gt;don’t try to min/max.
---
Don't tell me how to live my life
---
Obviously when people are talking about scaling, their talking about two classes with equivalent gear, otherwise the conversation is moot and makes no sense lol
---
I'm not even sure what your point is OP
---
Why PvP? Many streamers are specifically planning to play on a PvP server.
---
with the time you would have to spend leveling the mage to 60, you might as well just farm on the priest.
---
Part of the thing is wow being a team effort. Nobody is inconvenienced by someone doing a no-gear Dark Souls run. Yet min/maxers dread having to sift through or carry the players that don't put the same numbers out, and casual players dread the elitism. Either side will have to deal with the other camp
---
Down rank AE to get rogues out of stealth
---
Down rank frost bolt to apply a quick slow on mele
---
ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use rank one nova.  The max rank is a literal waste of mana for like 50 damage or something.
---
Downrank fireball if you are attempting to prevent a rogue from vanishing (mostly frost mages will do this not very often tho)
---
Are you gonna argue that you should be able to copy your characters back to classic, too? I mean, you already leveled to 60 in retail vanilla, so you should have one in Classic, too, right?
---
All we know about servers, is there will be one server type per region. (Example, North America west will have 1 pvp, 1 normal, and 1 rp)
---
Guarantees are overrated. Eating healthy won't guarantee you live long, but the causal relationship is pretty darn clear
---
What a thought-out and well-cited rebuttal
---
I only leveled up horde but Shadowfang Keep and Scarlet Monastery were two of my favorite stops while leveling. Loved those dungeons.
---
I still think the undead had the best starting zone as well. Loved the story, the atmosphere, walking into Brill, etc.
---
As far as later zones go, both the Plaguelands were great for me. Great dungeons, battling the undead, and fairly easy to run through... sometimes.
---
I'll pick the same class at least and take notes on how to optimize my leveling route. I already don't like the leveling grind except the social aspect anyway. I'm not a speed leveler by any means but if I can make my leveling a little faster, even if I'm gonna play casually, I'm gonna do it.
---
Exactly so. 
---
I agree, if your struggling between making the min/max choice and choosing something you find to be cooler, go for the cooler thing. For instance some people would rather play a Tauren Druid despite hating cows because Warstomp is better and you don't ever have to fight Shamans.
---
Are Night Elf Druids unplayable compared to Taurens? No, not even close. Its barely noticeable 99% of the time, but some people want to get that extra 1% dammit
---
PVP servers are pure cancer. They aren't fun, they aren't suspenseful, they are a waste of time. If you want to be surrounded by 14 year old edgelords, or 30 year olds who never grew out of that mindset, then by all means play PVP. If you're looking to enjoy the game, play PVE.

**Kripp wants to know your location **
---
Going to try 😜
---
I have the live CE (Panda Cub is the best, FYI), but I hope they don't carry them over to Classic. Just make it entirely standalone. Sell a Classic CE or make the pets available as the *only* cash shop items, available for purchase the first 30 days after launch. Then, close the cash shop to never ever see the light of day again in Classic.
---
You will probably be able to grab the server IP and ping/lookup it
---
&gt; Which one didn't/doesn't have fucked up exp?
---
All of them since ~ Mar 2018?
---
Darnassus. My first character was a Night Elf.  Teldrassil was magical but I was in awe walking past the Ancient Protectors into Darnassus in all its beauty
---
Makes no difference. Druids want strength over agility and 9/10 bits of your gear while levelling come from quest rewards.
---
Spelladin.
---
I've never played a private server and don't follow them. Just heard this said a few times so wanted to know.
---
Right now I'm deciding between Orc/Undead Warlock or a Hunter. Most likely in beta I'll play the Hunter first because I am leaning more towards Warlock on live. Then I'll figure out what race I want for my Warlock. I'm stuck because on one hand I love the idea of the Forsaken and never really got to run around in the pre-cata Tirisfall and Silverpine, but on the other hand FemOrcs look *fiiiiine* in Warlock gear.

I think I'm going to stick with a Pally DPS or a Holy Priest. That was haw I started the game originally. I'm very curious about the Shadow Priest. Originally you could roll a S Priest and spec the DPS so you could be an off healer with how much damage you could do. I'll be curious if that comes back.
---
That used to be so cool and fun.
---
Please send details for purchasing one! I NEED to have one!! Thanks :)
---
i honestly thought about putting shockadin up but this poll is more for pve, and i think shockadins just weren't in raids and just used for pvp.
---
Wow these are well done 👍
---
For me, I didn't really like BC. It was a departure from the more grounded Medieval Fantasy of Warcraft (I honestly don't know why this is such a big deal for me), and as a "build tinkerer" there's not *that* much more to work with in BC than in Vanilla.
---
On the other hand, I can't wait for WotLK. Loved the return to Azeroth as the main setting, and not only was there a talent tree size increase but they also added Glyphs, which further distinguished an individual player from their peers. WotLK was the era in which the player decided how *they* wanted to play. There was more customization than in any other expansion of WoW, and although the gear was a bit more streamlined with less unique effects, you could still use gear that was not of your own armor class freely (unlike Cata).
---
There was quest helper addons in vanilla homie
---
I can see still smell the Warlock bias after having finished the video. I love Warlocks, I think more people ought to play them in classic, but I feel like you over-rated them for everything. The ratings are also inconsistent.
---
You state that Druids are either #2 or tied for #1 with Hunters in terms of leveling speed. Then you immediately rate Warlocks with a 9/10 leveling speed despite literally just saying that Druids were #2 who you rated 8/10 for leveling speed. These small inconsistencies are everywhere in the video.
---
Ive tested hemo at 45 and it is quite comparable to combat swords. Worse in group combat with no blade flurry for sure, but very strong grinding single mobs and much more fun to play with good stealth/openers and cp generation .
---
Method Josh is a raider from Method (which I shouldn't need to explain), Preach and Bellular are 2 of the larger WoW Youtuber channels, but I'm not familiar with T and E myself. I looked up Kungen, Preach and Bell both have roughly 400k subs on Youtube vs Kungen's 35k or so, but that's not indicative of their stream numbers necessarily.
---
Still better than retail.
---
Does the mohawk from Undeads clip through helms?
---
what are your thoughts on how weak night elf rogue is compared to the others for PVE/PVP ?   
---
I'm considering playing it because i like the animations but I don't want to if it's going to make people think I'm a noob and sub optimal.
---
Second this, would be really useful
---
This is TBC, but I didn’t realize Belfs couldn’t be Warriors originally. When did they add it?
---
Edit: Cata, ofc.
---
still relevant
---
So I was having a nostalgic romp through old WoW Machinima, and I felt a strong urge to remake the first episode of one of the first World of Warcraft Machinima I ever saw: Chronicle of the Annoying Quest. While I think the series holds up alright, it's no secret that the visuals have NOT aged well due to the improvements that have occurred with recording and computer equipment. So I figured; why not remake it?
---
Yesss please!
---
Thank you!
---
Streamer Personalities: good streamers know how to appeal to many, make people laugh, and calm people
---
Communities: lots of streamer fanbases are proud to be part of an online community that shares their interests
---
Depression-remedy: when a streamer puts on a show at a regular point in time, people who feel down on themselves take solace in watching a streamer, like Kripp, every night to cheer them up
---
Skill: enough said. People want to cheer on their favorite pro MLG streamer and relish in their accomplishments.
---
Memes: many streamers have associated memes that arouse their audiences.
---
Streamer drama: yes, whether you like it or not, people are obsessed with reality TV
---
These are as many as I can think of off the top of my head, shoot a response for any clarification
---
I forgot about running on the bank of Orgrimmar. Fuck. Every time I think I decide what race my Druid is going to be, something else comes a long and makes me rethink my choices. ):

---
Can I get a PM please. Interested
---
Just belves? I main a Nightborne Monk on retail. I'm going either Gnome Mage or Troll Mage yo
---
I'm confused as to what I am looking at. Are these rubbery coasters? or are they wall art?
---
Source?
---
They are wall plaques! about 10 in by 10 inch by 1 in thick.
---
Thanks man! Great reply and I appreciate the resources and tips. I was looking into the Frostsaber, but I heard that takes months, even if you grind the same quests over and over a couple hours a day. The ZG one I don't foresee me ever getting, so I figured I'd go for Darnassus rep. I did it on my gnome mage back in vanilla days, and it was so cool having it haha. Just don't remember much about the process.
---
At 45 sure, it's not so bad, but if you're just starting out and putting all your talents into Sub as you go it's going to make things a lot harder on you without some of the early Combat talents.
---
In another comment I did mention a couple ways you could branch out if you didn't want to go straight combat - but I really think that at least the first 10 points are essential to pick up Imp. Sinister Strike &amp; Precision until you reach higher levels.
---
Redridge- questing there at the age of 8/9 was awesome.
---
I mean the OG quest helper addon was in vanilla and was literally called Quest Helper so...
---
Maybe be a Mac OS user as there not so many of us and they still need to test it on that platform. I think that was the only reason I've got one of the earliest alpha HotS invite
---
Spelladin isn't Shockadin. And Spelladin is PVE DPS. Just today a (P3 BIS single target test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPIwKxBD16E&amp;feature=youtu.be) was published on the youtubes.
---
It's a newer build, but it's got a ton of potential.
---
they said addons such as decursive wont work this time around. also seems like we wont be able to make our own focus frame in addons.
---
If you watch to the end I mention these are just my opinions and not fact. I appreciate the comment and I agree with you on the inconsistencies. I think those three classes are all great at leveling and I should've made that more clear that a single point difference is minor in my book.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm liking about them right now. Prot Warrior has been great, and BfA has also allowed me to really get into PvP with the Arms spec, but I need something different for Classic. Thanks for the input!
---
It's every 2 seconds, not every 5. 5 second energy ticks would be miserable...
---
Well I have a group of at least 10 willing to help each other. I heard because we cannot start until pre patch we may be screwed.
---
Winterspring.  Picking my herbs, killing horde for BL spawns, and farming eye of shadow when I was bored of that.  Lots to do for an herbalist warlock.
---
&gt;devote resources from the Classic WoW team
---
You seem to be under the impression that releasing a list of server names will require the full participation of the entire dev team. I'm not looking for things to complain about. I'm trying to ensure that our experience is not ruined. If you disagree that's perfectly fine. You might enjoy a streamer's server if your idea of fun is following a streamer around and frantically typing "notice me!" in the chat.
---
Oh yeah , that ambiance!
---
I actually don't mind either way. I don't own the CE and I wouldn't buy the pets if they were made available in classic.
---
But if you intend to make them available again, make them rare - like in Vanilla (#nochanges). So limit at least the supply if they can be bought through the store.
---
But they do exist now, so I'd be surprised if they choose not to have OCE servers for classic.  
---
I'd much prefer my 2ms to OCE servers than 180ms to US servers. :D
---
Yeah, but I'll probably stop around 20-30. Might do it on the opposite faction so it won't be a straight up do-over
---
ah so it's like an onhit spell scaler? similiar to how rogues would scale poisons with spellpower and such?
---
that sounds nothing like my server / battlegroup.
---
Hopefully this time around you are on a balanced server and can experience the awesomeness. The current version where you can LOSE 1/1 frustrates me.
---
That's pretty pathetic of you.
---
Thanks sleepy.
---
When did they bring those in? I haven't played retail in forever.
---
My journey on foot from TM to Badlands as a horde
---
ugh I would **HATE** to be sent gold all the time
---
Westfall is absolutely one of my favorite zones in the entire game.
---
Aaaaand I just realized I'm gonna go ahead and make my hunter a Dwarf just to avoid those fucking Furbolg caves
---
Pretty much. Fast attacks with SoR for double proc potential, and spellpower scaling procs. Gotta farm MCPs like Feral, but Ironfoe is also a close second for damage output.
---
Those fucking Threshers
---
Bro if you think that any of those things are gonna stop you from playing classic you might as well never play on any server ever... there is gonna those types of groups regardless of streamers... Literally just finding something to bitch about.
---
Are there other places for people to find classic guilds? The weekly post that only shows up for 3 days out of the week and the discord don't really offer a whole lot for people trying to find a community early on. 
---
I'm interested in a PvE server, Alliance, US, and those seem to be unicorns from the guild posts I can find. I know there's people out there who would be wanting the same things that I do, but finding them is damn near impossible.
---
the big struggle of grinding out mcps or winning the lottery and getting ironfoe
---
Just like I did all those years ago... Disc Priest all over again.
---
&gt; but I'd really prefer to play on a balanced realm
---
This is why I am plan on playing on the streamer server with esfand/staysafe guilds on alliance and tips/soni guilds on horde. Also several big private server guilds plan on playing on this same server. The only thing I am worried about is playing on an underpopulated/unbalanced server. By going to this server I can avoid that entirely.
---
Meteoradin
---
Been horde since TBC. More than likely staying horde.
---
ya know when 100 people make characters on the opposite faction and level them up solely to form raid groups and murder you while you stream, your skill or lack of it at wpvp stops factoring in
---
Yeah it's really hard to speak about some classes definitively in both pvp and pve because of how many variables there are, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try and always learn the best we can
---
I feel like every other classes leveling specs are already solved but I always hear new methods for warriors.  Gonna try this out when I can thanks again
---
Why does playing on a the same server as a streamer ruin it for you? Pretty easy to avoid them I imagine. Besides, there’s so many streamers nowadays I’m sure every server will have a few at least.
---
Nice one haha
---
Can never please everyone either but I appreciate it
---
the streamers aren't gonna cause general overpopulation, they're gonna cause focused overpopulation which will straight up ruin areas of the world for hours at a time
---
- Druid is cool for stealth shenanigans
---
- Any caster dps, one player can CC while the other kills and the rogue can peel for the caster when needed
---
- Any healer, they can keep the rogue alive and the rogue can peel for them 
---
Really the only things I wouldn't recommend outright are warriors and hunters but even they could work fine - rogues are easy to get along with.
---
That's just like your opinion man.

I don't think that's enough time.
---
I'd love to buy one aswell (And alot of other people seem to want one)
---
It's such a simple area but it reminds me of simple, low-level quests.
---
WE NEED MORE VOTES THESE ARE ROOKIE NUMBERS
---
I don’t believe so.
---
Love running through the field towards the ocean and the lighthouse when the moon is out.
---
why must you make us scroll my friend
---
You are beta testing a 15 year old game though. Nearly all of the glitches you can find have been fixed and by the time it hits Public Beta it's been very polished. This isn't the case with most beta's but this is how Blizzard does it to get the hype train going.
---
I agree on most other Beta's but not anything Blizzard does. The only testing they may be doing is server load optimization which can be tested by just playing and doing what you want to do.
---
Yes! There are so many variables and good and bad match ups for each class which is something that makes classic wow so deep. I'm glad you mentioned that. It's not always as simple as a star rating.
---
Yeah agreed. I'm glad you appreciate it 😊
---
Everytime I hear people talk about "the extreme amounts of rogues" I just shake my head because I've never experienced that or have seen it reflected in polls what so ever
---
I never said it would stop me from playing Classic. I would prefer to play without streamers, therefore it would be convenient to get a server list before launch. I knew when I made this post that some streamer fanboys would end up here and get insulted.
---
Looool
---
Oh yeah, Frostsaber in incredibly tedious. Not something I ever want to be doing. And the ZG tiger is so much RNG / competition. I prefer the style of the Darnassus rep grind where you do it a million times and you're guaranteed to have results at the end compared to the ZG style where you could do 100 runs and have nothing to show for it, and be no closer to your goal than when you started.
---
Gnomes look sooooo good on saber mounts. I  initially started out playing horde but got hooked on sabers after seeing [Jimmy and Mojache ridin in style.](https://youtu.be/xeUhSjuhQYE?t=55).
---
You would. Imagine if all games just started you off with infinite money.
---
You didn't read the whole post, I guess.
---
Huh, strange way to look at it. Wouldn't it be closer to, you can drink the wine at the tasting, but can't buy the bottle?
---
Those that play the beta, and classic, would be tasting the wine, swallowing it, then taking the rest of the bottle home, no?
---
Orc starting area into barrens. I’m wondering if I should relive the old days or forge new memories and roll alliance.
---
Hemo rogue.
---
I leveled an alt rogue to 60 way back and he was moderately geared.  T2 + ZG.  Hemo was actually my favorite spec to play for PvP.  I don't believe it was the best spec, but it had a lot of control.  I hated combat.  The gameplay didn't excite me in the least.
---
Classic is a game from a different era that was not designed with streamers in mind. It will be absolute chaos.

---
Couple reasons.
---
First is that it's just more like the vanilla experience. Progressively changing items over time.
---
A more practical reason is that 1.12 itemization is drastically better in most all examples. This means that content will be easier. Bosses in MC and such will die faster and easier if people are better geared. The counter to this argument is that stuff will die quick and easy anyway cause its a 14 year old game that we all know how to min/max and have theory crafted to death.
---
Another is the idea of progressive upgrades. Vanilla WoW was a game that rewarded the player with feel good stuff progressively: a talent point even level, new skills every two levels, a new piece of gear as an upgrade feels good and happens out in the world and in dungeons and off the AH. One problem with 1.12 itemization is an item such as the Savage Gladiator Chain from BRD. This is an item that you can get at level 52 and you won't upgrade until AQ. That is a long time to have a single piece of gear in a slot with no upgrade considering we are getting progressive content release. (Meaning months until AQ launches) So it breaks the idea of progressive rewarding of gear upgrades.

(Most of my info comes from TipsOut video on the topic: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml2jvAm6VDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml2jvAm6VDQ))
---
Why so toxic?
---
I dont know what to do with this information but cool nonetheless
---
Agreed.
---
Very good points on the benefits of engineering - thank you. I was hoping someone would mention something like this. The time spent resource gathering makes sense. I may take your advice :)
---
Staying home within the family and working from there is still very widespread in smaller European countries as well as extended immigrant families within US cities. The big push for abandoning your family at your first opportunity is a very American thing. 
---
Please don’t generalize/shame and please don’t be racist.
---
The internet is substantially faster today than 2005. I might roll Oceanic just to play with the boys down under lol
---
Could you please clarify if it applies only to Focus or will it affect the mouseover script also? 
---
Like this one:
---
/run if UnitExists("mouseover") and UnitCanAttack("player","mouseover") then TargetUnit("mouseover") CastSpellByName("Polymorph") TargetLastTarget() else CastSpellByName("Polymorph") end
---
It'll feel just like some of the pservers I've been on then.
---
Random abilities, FFA and player item drops. Ive been playing for two weeks its super fun.
---

---
If they’re bringing in amateur media outlets (ie streamers) and giving them extra info, then they are absolutely expecting them to leak some amount of data. The constraints of whatever gag order they have are likely very relaxed.
---
Blizzard’s public relations department is top-notch.
---
I definitely am looking at becoming a tank main then for PVE primarily. For PVP I will most likely make an alt, Rogue perhaps seems to be a great amount of fun haha. Thank you for the response! 👍
---
Flasks were definitely not irrelevant in Vanilla
---
Tirisfal glades, easy.
---
The starting zone for your first toon just hits home, I still remember the feelings/adventures from those first hours, more so than a lot of things
---
Would really appreciate addition of Gnome/Dwarf starting zone! Really useful guide tho. Thanks
---
It’s not as though it’s not completely in their power to stop that though. If they really want to be left alone, they could just turn off the stream!
---
in a similar boat except worse: everyone I play with is rolling alliance but I want to play shaman. RIP
---
Orbs are mad money
---
This is PhD-level material right here. Best guide I've ever seen for anything.
---
Damn that is worse. Sorry buddy
---
&gt; Also, the Store button is removed from the Micro Bar.

But.... we had that huge thread where everyone cried and moaned and trolls told us there would be a whole shop with pets and tokens and.....
---
That can be done with a modern macro:
---
/cast \[@mouseover,exists,harm\] Polymorph
---
/stopmacro \[@mouseover,exists,harm\]
---
/cast \[exists,harm\] Polymorph
---
This will cast at your mouseover target without having to change targets.  If no mouseover exists, or the mouseover is a friend, then it will cast Polymorph on your current target if that target exists and is not a friend.  
---
Mouseover as a Unit is still in the system.
---
&gt;Modified the shadow positions for various fonts.
---
Is this fixing the damage numbers font differences from that Blizzcon beta?
---
There's nothing to stop a steamer from rolling on a different server after launch
---
Play on Oceanic realms when/if they release? Or play in the early morning on European realms. Either way you'll be dealing with a lot of latency, but it's something to consider.
---
Or find a guild that raids on Monday and Tuesday, though that's not likely to happen because of raid reset schedules.
---
Steamers don’t play PvP servers? Serious question. I know nothing.
---
Druid main, Hunter and Mage alt. Gotta level fast!
---
That is not common sense. That is something bandied about on this subreddit and other places where powergamers and hardcores are the main audience. How new a server is or how far ahead other people are in the gearing process is not a thought that crosses the casual gamer's mind - at all. Do you also think it's common sense to understand how good the human and orc racials are? No. This is stuff we know because understanding the mechanics of the game is a hobby to us. That isn't gonna be the case for most people playing. "Hey this server is the one my friend plays on! High population, sweet! That means I will have a lot of people to play with!" &lt;-- This is "common sense" and how it will work in most cases. Knowing the intricacies of gearing and it's relationship to server age is not common sense. It is knowledge acquired from involvement in a niche hobby.
---
Tanaris and Teldrassil
---
Rarely, they are a huge target. Problem is when they do play on a PvP server, every time they're killed they will cry stream snipping.
---
For some reason every time I think of classic, the first thing that comes to mind is that little lake down the tunnels that leads to the Wailing Caverns. Fishing up Defias Fish so I could make Rumsy Rum on my 19 twink was always great.
---
Beyond multiple Warcraft social media forums, have a presence on multiple servers, there is always a guild that meets your time needs. And when there is not you can make it and invite people with similar time availability.
---
I feel like warrior is the most interesting class with the most interesting mechanics in vanilla, and it's not even really close. A lot of classes gained a lot and became much more interesting in TBC but warrior was already there and didn't need much.
---
that said I'm probably not rolling a warrior (for a main at least) because I've been playing a lot of warrior lately and would like a change. You should though!
---
Welcome to this sub.
---
I like to play fury over arms due to the faster kill times and better utility, as deep wounds messes up your fear bandage combo and piercing howl is amazing for saving wipes in dungeons and world, whilst also being about the same speed solo as arms for levelling, yet more dmg with flurry.
---
And just like that, OP’s career as a class icon plaque salesman began.  He made thousands that month and doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.
---
haha. no kidding! What a weird career choice!
---
On the real, I’d pay for a rogue one that reads “Jelqgirth”
---
I'm going to remember that anology forever.
---
Guys I think the beta or release date is coming soon. Just have a feeling
---
mage is just so good in vanilla, what's not to like
---
That’s hilarious. Well that makes me feel better about my chances on not playing with one. Since I’ll be PvP
---
Good eye! I thought all races could be warriors, always.
---
Is colluding actually against Blizzard ToS?
---
Ashenvale. Traveled across the world to get there for some quest. The Music, Lighting and Coloration was such a departure from what I had seen up until then as a Human Warrior. Then I found the Talondeep Tunnel and got my first PVP kill on the other side.
---
All based off the fact that they updated the version number of every TOC in interface.  That streamer's grasp of LUA and WoW Addons was... tenuous at best.
---
You answered your own question. He didn't have a media pass and of course they don't want to support him.
---
Piercing howl is amazing true, I wouldn't say fury is faster though, especially since you won't have sweeping strikes which double dips with whirlwind or cleave which can let you basically one shot multiple mobs at the same time.
---
Damn. How many times did that low level undead rogue kill you?
---
they pretty much are considering the time per to get picked, you aren't going to see every top guild full flasking 40 guys
---
Ditto.  Would like this
---
Tailoring and enchanting at 60 which I had during  Vanilla and made plenty of gold. 
---
Tailoring and skinning leveling most likely.
---
I'm not sure what the specifics of the font issue was.  This adjusts the position of the shadow behind the font.  I can dig into whether it makes it bigger or smaller if you need.
---
Don't call me a genius but I think at some point we will get a wow classic release date. Heard it here first
---
Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles. Hell, even the elevator ride down from Razorfen gets me extremely nostalgic. The towering spires opening up into a brilliant salt flat was simply breathtaking.

I can’t play alliance, it’s too... “clean”
---
Absolutely, I've been practice leveling on a private server, but trying it out with the real thing to be aware of any differences would be great.
---
Read the whole article if you can be arsed, it really got me feeling like  it's pre-beta again.
---
If I level as a hunter and my friend levels as an enhancement shaman, will we run into a lot of loot competition issues?
---
As in those classes share gear correct?
---
I was there last year visiting a friend that works there. I don't remember seeing this at all.

If any one is interested;
---
This guy I went to high school with used this format to wickedly burn our principle back in the day.
---
The school administration went on a full on manhunt trying to find the kid who made the video, but he has eluded them to this day.
---
To this day it kills me, and I have an innate love for all of the memes using this scene because of it.
---
https://youtu.be/95ml6mvqR7Q
---
(PS. The falconry was our nickname for the school administrators)
---
Speaking of edgelords, here's one now.
---
So why does playing with streamers make a realm suck again?
---
WoWs pretty big. Even if you're on the same server, you're not guaranteed to run into them. Even when you get to the parts of the world that act like hubs for leveling (Barrens, STV, Tanaris), there's still multiple alternatives to choose from.
---
I don't get why playing in the same world that say Asmongold would choose matters.
---
Killing raptors next to Sen'jin village.
---
Hey! Awesome work! Was wondering if you could do a custom one?
---
What does "toxic" even mean nowadays?
---
People dicking around in barrens chat is a lot different from a non-stop server-wide fellation of mr. big streamer, even if you'd consider both of these things toxic.
---
I guess it would be preferable if Blizz barred all the streamers so no one would have any idea what the beta looks like if they don't get in.
---
Silverpine Forrest. Considering I would go out of my way to quest and level there with non-undead alts too, I think I never skipped it on a new toon and it’s always been one of my favorites.
---
hey, loved the video. Though, having not raided in vanilla I don't know what is considered good dps or damage done from a numerical standpoint. Does feral dps keep up with rogues/ warriors at any point or is it always something like 50-75% of their damage?
---
If they do an open beta, roll one of each and play around in Tirisfal/Durotar, see how the animations and running looks. Then you'll have a better idea of which race you want to play when the servers launch for real.
---
Disclaimer: I've mained a nelf rogue for nearly 15 years. (I've also played worgen, belf, and forsaken rogues extensively)
---
If I was gonna do a horde rogue I'd go Forsaken for the Aesthetic(tm) (and I did try one for awhile when they first made the rppvp servers before I deleted and rerolled her as a warrior). That was a lot of fun animation and looks wise imo. (Actually UD warrior have FANTASTIC animations and style points, too)
---
Troll females only really have one face that's decent. (though I love the mowhawk with braids and the iridescent purple hair on trolls). I don't usually associate rogues with trolls though, so that feels like a rare combo.
---
Orc had pretty decent animations iirc and also, you know, Garona class fantasy. I dimly recall this (female orc rogues) being even rarer than troll rogues on my vanilla server.

I don't remember exactly what it was called but i know in WotLK there was an addon that pretty much gave you the ability to put 3d markers in the gameworld wich made raiding super easy, anyway blizzard banned it so yeah, addons can be dissallowed
---
Edit: AVR? Maybe
---
I wouldn’t know how to go about recovering my account now. I can barely remember what email I used back then. I know I had the same mobile (cell) phone number so that might work.
---
Would it even be worth it? Unlikely since we are all starting from scratch anyway.
---
Nope but tanks will still be using them mostly
---
oh yeah for sure, but not like on private servers where 40 guys in almost every guild are using them every week for progression lol
---
I meant god class endgame PvE wise. I looked at private server logs and warriors seem to be neck and neck with rogues in terms of raw dps... and they are the best tank by far on top of it.
---
I'm very well aware of how painful they are to level, i've leveled one to 60 during classic and it was painful. I absolutely loved the tanking, tab sunder was my jam, and it was definitely one of the most entertaining classes in classic since prot war wasnt a 1 button wonder thing like most classes.
---
I'm still really debating, most of my classic experience will be dungeons and leveling, i dont know if ill even set foot in raids... feral druid is such smooth leveling and a great 5man tank, although not as fun as warrior and gear doenst look as good either.
---
Like a different icon?
---
I feel like they should just have a private server for streamers and then give the streamers invite powers for their friends. Just concentrate it all on one realm.
---
Back in vanilla I used to raid with a raiding alliance from australia and new zealand (Silver Hand US had a large population of them so the server rarely felt empty even at 3am). They started right around 1am my time, and I got home with about 20 minutes to spare, so it worked out /really/ well, especially if I did some raid prep before work and parked my character outside the instance ahead of time.
---
I'm sure there will be raid groups running on aussie time
---
Exactly! I used to love swimming to the tiny islands off the coast, it was the last place I logged offer before the shattering.
---
You never have to worry about how your shoes look.
---
If you roll female, you never have to worry about missing anyone sneaking past you because you never blink.
---
I am doing both. Horde main Ally alt.
---
What if a streamer starts playing a month or two after launch and chooses your server? Are you going to re-roll on a different server? What if so many streamers play that there is no server without them? Would you just not play Classic?
---
How would releasing a list of server names have any affect at all on the above scenario? If Blizzard really wanted to tackle this issue it would merit development resources, plain and simple. Solving this issue though would likely need sharding and other non-trivial solutions, which are not Vanilla.
---
Edit: also, did you just start this thread to plug that YouTube video? Or did you watch the video and immediately make this thread?
---
Teldrassil. Sometimes when I have a slow weekend I just roll a toon to take through Teldrassil and leave it there. I nenver get tired of it.
---
Teldrassil is the best leveling zone! And I've made so many friends in that barrow den waiting for those quest items to spawn on a  1 minute timer.
---
[This first piece in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvW-QTiZLQ0) reminds me of the first morning I ever played WoW on a non-trial account. My friend and I let the computer download the game overnight and logged on first thing in the morning.
---
Feralas. Back in the day, any sort of pine wood/needle smell would send me into a day dream about WoW and Feralas specifically. I still don’t understand how a smell would associate with a specific zone in a computer game. 
---
It was always my favorite zone.
---
Spelladin?! I might offspec as this, or maybe mainspec. Interesting stuff, though.
---
Haha, I remember how terrified I was of going into the water on my first toon. I was convinced one of those huge sea monsters would turn up.
---
Hell yea I hate blinking anyway. No shoes also seems very casual and fun, like I’m always on vacation
---
Know what's stupid? Buying used panties.
---
Male orc animations are so over the top and goofy for rogue. I’d probably go female orc but the appeal of the troll Mohawk is too strong
---
You have just lifted a big weight from my shoulders, knowing that at least that one streamer, and hopefully others, won't go PvP realms. Thanks.
---
jeez bro! This is mega quality
---
Every server will have at least one hardcore guild, if they are high population anyway.
---
It's the same game and I should get the exclusivity that I paid for. Unbelievable you ppl arguing it shouldn't carry over and blizz should do a cash grab. Swing off activisions nuts some more...
---
I was misspoken, the sidebar q/a had this to say about servers:
---
Will there be dedicated servers for Roleplaying on Classic? On larger regions there will be Normal, PVP, and RP realms available on launch. There are no current plans for RP-PVP realms. These plans are subject to change.
---
"Our current plan is to have RP realms certainly in the larger regions where we have a range of realm types. I don't think we're currently planning on any RP-PVP realms in particular, because that's maybe a bit too small of a niche... but, we'll see how Classic unfolds once it's out there and certainly if, you know, there's a large population and demand for that server, for that type of server, that could support it, we'd be open to adding it. But, I think at the start, we'll have RP as an available server type." - Ion Hazzikostas, March 2019 Dev Q&amp;A
---
I read this as them adding as few servers as possible to maximize population, without the need of crossrealm support (there is also talk about phasing in starter zones, which adds to blizz wanting less servers)
---
as Ion said on twitter: "To be clear, we have no philosophical opposition to setting up a Classic RP-PvP server. But our priority is making sure servers have long-term healthy populations, so we'll start with lean realmlists and expand as needed, just as the 2004 launch did."
---
I had a 29 twink rogue in vanilla.  I really enjoyed the stealth animation.
---
Berserking is a pretty decent damage boost, especially later on if you happen to be sword spec.
---
Beast slaying only really helps against druids, so meh.
---
Troll regen helps a lot while leveling, it helps you keep pace and reduces the amount you need to heal quite a bit combined with beast slaying.
---
Not much else really to talk about.  Trolls do have the highest agility out of the box tho. So that's nice I guess. Ranged weapon skill is literally useless, though.
---
Oh god I completely forgot about that
---
Maybe but I wouldn't let it deter you from playing the class you want
---
Well...yeah? I'm pretty sure that's kind of the whole point...? That's why i plan on playing my class on live imo because I know it inside and out and want to make sure things are opperating smoothly on it
---
The stealth animation definitely seems cool. I had no clue the beast slaying helped against druids, that’s a fun fact. Plus trolls get raptors, that’s a solid selling point
---
&gt; Quest mobs will be camped to no end. Basically it will be impossible to do anything or have any fun.
---
Massive overreaction.
---
It's why I've taken the last 8 months off of World of Warcraft. It helps to dull the memory of that quote unquote lists of things to do while leveling and after hitting max level that I became so intimately familiar with that I knew it like the back of my hand expansion after expansion.
---
Gearing your raid is also an important factor. If you bring too many of the same class than it takes a lot longer because they all need the same loot.
---
Stonetalon and Un'goro. Stonetalon because of my altoholic self getting there and deciding to reroll. Un'goro because If one of my characters gets there they get to 60.
---
I have to question how many of those are going to try to be shadow.
---
Both are super strong healers, can't go wrong. Both can be mundane but I hear pala can in classic can be suuuper tedious
---
All of it.
---
I know, cheesy answer.  If I had to chose, Dun Morogh, but tbh it’s all so nostalgic.  I’ve just now started on a private server and man the feels are real.  I can’t wait
---
You forgot 'meet someone and rp sneaking around the undercity with them explaining the city to your barely level 48 nelf rogue and develop a fantastic character relationship and out of character friendship that lasted for years' oh and 'eventually meet the person who'll become your wife' and I can't forget 'aimlessly wander the coastlines of kalimdor'
---
...god no wonder it took me 36 days played to get to 60
---
Latency the Time Killer, hardest boss in WC.
---
Pvp happened on a pvp server?
---
Cry more and don’t forget to toggle war mode.
---
No. Your retail title is linked to your highest vanilla title based off the feat of strength. I was Marshal during vanilla, and it's the only title I have, sans low end RBG titles.
---
This video is really bad. The guy is just trying to make something out of nothing and stretches things way too far. 
---
You'll never be able to fight the guy fairly because he'll have an army with him, but also when you accidentally kill the guy you'll get reported for stream sniping and his fans will harass you?
---
A lot of the video contradicts itself because they're just made up things.
---
Not really that significant in pvp.
---
I played alliance for 90% of classic.  Then played horde from BC until BFA.  So I have to go back to alliance for the true feels
---
Damn bro idk why youre so mad. Its objectively a different game. Idk what to tell you besides to stop being so enraged. Anyone got a tranq shot for this guy?
---
What child could possibly read these class descriptions without thinking "Oh yeah, this game is for me!"
---
Yes, your vanilla title became a feat of strength and can be worn in retail.
---
Leveling a warrior does about 35 mental damage per 100 exp.
---
Yeah, the mage one, but with atiesh and red ribbon, maybe the ghost owls worked into it somehow
---
Thanks for at least recognising the amount of work we put into written guides ❤️ See you in Azeroth!
---
Druid tank, meta be damned
---
Honestly, probably Alterac Valley.  I spent so much time in that BG trying to farm honor to get my Unstoppable Force.  Many good times were had pushing the enemy line backwards.

The fact that it isn't the entrance to the building is... disappointing.

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/MACRO_who
---
Hey, good question! NE rogue isn't bad at all. It's actually a really solid middle ground, especially if you're into pvp and pve. It's even better if you like using daggers over swords, mainly because you have the highest base agility out of all the other races, meaning NEs should perform better than all other rogue races with daggers. And this also comes with a perk, since you won't be competing against every warrior and other rogues for the swords that never drop.
---
In pvp, the NE racial is pretty much the equivalent of 2 talent points into Master of Deception in the subt tree. It's basically like you being 1 level higher than non NE rogues. Shadowmeld gives +5 stealth, Master of Deception gives +3 each talent point, iirc. Which is actually handy guarding a flag room or node in AB. So it's not "bad" just most people prefer the on-use racials of gnome/dwarf because it gets them out of jail.
---
“Navras” is my literally 13yo edgey self.  This really hits home with me
---
Did you play the matrix online by any chance?
---
I only play female forsaken for the flips on special attacks, nothing else. I don't even like pvp so WotF is kinda wasted on me but hey I love my flips. So just go with troll if you think it's cool!
---
Super salt to the rescue
---
Honestly alt-tabbing and finding where to go next in a zone kills the entire mood of the game for me, much rather questie be there.
---
Playing Alliance this time, in current WoW I was Horde all the way.
---
Orgrimmar bank roof.
---
Yeah I'd heavily recommend female orc over male for a rogue.
---
But I think (mohawk) you've already made your (mohawk) decision (mohawk)
---
Horde because of the Orcs
---
The farms in Western Plaguelands.  For me they were the first grown up farming spot where I was mostly looking for runecloth.  They had variety in difficulty, lore, and mechanics.  I spent so much time there as a fresh 60 that I ended up "accidentally" getting exalted with the Argent Dawn.
---
That meme has been through somewhat of a.... downfall

That gnome warlock looking dapper as FUCK!
---
The crossroads... And that quest where you had to team up and kill a big raptor and grab some eggs.
---
Clearly you didn't understand the video. I'm not here to argue. The post is not meant to convince you to avoid streamers. If you're an Asmongold fanboy and plan on following him wherever he goes, then you will definitely have more fun on his server.
---
Our guild handed them out to most of the raid from time to time for really inportant attempts.
---
I was alliance, rolled a druid back in 05.   Plan on going horse now.   Shaman, because I like an uphill battle
---
It's the same game. Same subscription. They're just bringing back classic servers. You think ppl who have the legit ce for 14 years should be locked out of having their ce pets and they should be added to a cash shop or new digital ce. Lmao what happened to no changes.. you ppl are delusional or shills for Activision.
---
Send me a PM please.  Mage interested
---
I'm going to play on a pve server because I want to play with people on my skill level, people who click abilities and don't use talent points.
---
I had a Dell e1705 back when I first started playing. Used it until WotLK. I know that 2.3 FPS feeling.
---
That's a relief. I'm pretty satisfied with every decion they've announced so far.
---
No problem. A lot of people have been commenting claiming that I'm an idiot for thinking having a streamer in your server is a bad thing but I suspect we're actually dealing with Asmongold's fanboys. What a bunch of parasitic goons.
---
What didn't I understand? The guy contradicts himself and makes up points that are really unlikely.
---
You lost me at troll female.   Ain't nobody got time for that.  Roll alliance please.   Female dwarf.
---
Show me statistics of "majority of the people on this sub want to avoid big streamers" then please.
---
Why not tauren?
---
Mon’s been holding that book for 12 years
---
You won't be getting into any endgame content without doing quests.
---
I did it on the off chance it increases my odds for a beta invite. Beyond that I don't really see a reason.
---
Asked belves mainly since they make up around 1/3rd of the horde population, being the most played horde race
---
Wetlands actually. Only zone I went to when my alliance characters hit 21 or so. The music is so fantastic and I love the dwarf lore tied in with Grim Batol and Dun Algaz. Is that the place in the north with the dark irons?
---
Does skinning or other professions give exp ?
---
If I get a beta key Im going to play for 2 hours, get bored and leave. If I dont get invited I will enjoy reading posts from testers who discovered some neat stuff.

https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
Here you can basically dress up any race/gender combo you want and look at their animations for yourself. This dressing room is a classic dressing room, so only items available in Vanilla will be available to try on.
---
You literally cannot go wrong picking a race for Rogue on the Horde side.
---
Troll is probably the best for increasing your DPS output in PvE content, but they don't offer anything in the way of racials that help out in PvP.
---
Orc is probably the best PvP race in general, hardiness is crazy good. It can be midly useful in PvE content where AoE stuns are present.
---
WoTF is similar in that has some actual utility in PvE content, and its amazing in PvP.
---
I thought these were cookies
---
Not that much. But even if you were planning to both roll Rogues, I'd still say do it if those are the classes you really want to play. It sucks leveling a class to 60 that you don't love.
---
I believe the ignore list is infinite, or effectively infinite now. I've blocked dozens of people in 10 minutes when idiots went on "anal ____" streaks
---
Most big streamers will start right at launch. Releasing a server list will eliminate most of the struggle. I'm having trouble understanding what your goal is here. Are you a big streamer's parasite or do you just like creating conflict unprovoked? You're taking this very seriously.
---
If you look closely, the video was added as an edit because people like you kept getting offended by the post and saying it's actually a good thing to have a streamer on your server. I saw the video a few weeks ago and was reminded of the subject when I saw some other threads about the issue. This thread is simply a solution to the issue.
---
Clearly there are more people who agree with me on this thread. You're just deliberately confrontational.
---
There isn't anything wrong with Taurens, I just think I'd give up playing one after like 15 levels. I just don't really like the whole cow thing.
---
I think they're the objectively superior Druid race in classic, if for nothing else that you don't have to ever fight a Shaman lol.
---
Its just an aesthetics preference basically
---
Just because they're hard to kill doesn't mean they can't be killed. You are clearly just a fanboy so there is no reason for me to try to convince you of anything.
---
Well choosing female dwarf for paladin -_-. Now I know why there where only a few of them :)
---
Weird, troll female is my favorite in vanilla WoW. If they could still be Druids I don't think I'd play any other race
---
Which is why a realm list would be convenient pre-launch.
---
A hashtag is specifically a twitter thing.
---
You don't have to be subscribed to receive beta invite, but, to be honest, I am not sure that beta invites are so random. I have never stopped subscription since super late vanilla and I guess it might be the reason why I got every single alpha/beta to Blizzard games since Cataclysm. I might be just lucky, but one of my friends also has never stopped subscrining and got every beta invite aswell. But yeah, the best chance to get beta invite is to be streamer/top guild player/Fan site owner.
---
Psst selling transmutes 5g /w me.
---
I remember it had a little comic in the strat guide about naming your character. The comic was talking to a friend and referred to him as "Lord of Lava Lamp". In the end, 13 year old me named my first character Lavalamplord.
---
Yes, just as others have said. Similarly, nothing is physically stopping you from walking out of your job early to go play WoW.
---
That is not a Simple Question (Sunday). But the rank of heals changes with your gear level. Google Vanilla priest guides.

Needs a ton of gear. Most Mages will be deep Frost for the first half of Vanilla in PvP.
---
I'm glad that they recognize community. In the live servers I find the amount of phasing and crossrealm support completely kills any sense of server community.
---
I find satisfaction in the mere fact that someone is actively working on it. Every git commit brings us one step closer to a release date. Amen.
---
People eager to be warrior tanks have got to know that it's a big game of musical chairs once you get to raiding. There's several times more people interested in tanking than there are slots available.
---
Does Blizzard usually do any type of summer sale for their games? I obv know about the Steam summer sale, but I can't remember if Blizzard ever does something similar. All I can remember is them doing cyber monday, even though it was weak as hell this last year
---
I tried playing a troll probably half a dozen times over the years and I always ended up deleting or abandoning him. Their aesthetic never appealed to me.   I’ve moved away from the horde on live because of Sylvanas and it being troll based. 
---
I prefer the undead for a rogue.
---
Loch Modan. Where I started really learning how to play and what the game was.
---
I hope there is a solid balance on pvp servers but who knows
---
Always been Horde but I love Dwarves, so I'll have to bite the bullet and change to Alliance for classic. I still might play Horde on a diff realm as well - my main from vanilla to wrath was an undead mage so I'll recreate him...eventually I'll have to choose who I will focus mostly on, my dwarf or undead mage
---
Lock is harder to be competent with, but both have a super high skill ceiling and are extremely useful in pvp with their cc and high dmg output.
---
That would be much better, and tastier!
---
I dont care for the beta. Also, fuck off.
---
I literally don't give a shit about streamers. The guy in the video says that they're going to have 30-40 people going around with them so I guess you disagree with him too!
---
Out of 9 classes they technically are on the bottom half as the first four are hunter druid lock mage.
---
Check PvE guides and go for the items that have stamina on em.
---
They're also above paladins, warr and pala are slow af
---
Oh man flipping my second monitor now you’re genius!
---
No it's not.
---
Dude warrior is literally the strongest class in vanilla all around, they are the best tanks for endgame content, fury is a great pve spec as well, and arms is disgusting in group pvp.
---
They struggle solo and while leveling. They are the slowest levelers, but if you can do it, do it. They are super sought after as tanks and with a healer are formidable in all forms of pvp
---
Its been pointed out, but Oceanic realms are probably your best bet. Our guild in Vanilla was Late-Night US, we raided at 2:00am CST, which was I believe 5:00pm for the Aussies during 1/2 the year.
---
Well he is really bad in his Job then. That was propably worst "analysis" about the topic i have ever seen. "Scaling isn't a thing because you might need to wait couple weeks to get gear" does not sound professional analysis to me.
---
Amazing work!
---
Nice meme.
---
There are ways, trust me.
---
Its a technical change. 20 person limit was prob only in vanilla due to database restrictions back in 2005. Now that is irrelevent.
---
&gt; then see how the population is shaping up before committing to one
---
That's smart. Didn't think of doing that. The temptation to play will be so strong though.
---
Oh man, make custom designs and you can have alllll the money. Different spec variants for each class would be super dope!
---
Yeah I agree. I started playing WoW today and met some cool people while questing... only problem is they were from another server. That's one of the big reasons I'm looking forward to Classic.
---
The bigger struggle of finding out at max level that the oils, enchants and gear procs don't scale with spell damage.. ooph😰
---
people screaming nochanges and they want literally the same classic as it was... BUT!!!!! if someoes account is classic CE flagged (bear in mind we only need an active subsription) god forbid he gets the pets he had back then. hell will break loose and people will get salty because they dont have something they did not have back then. go figure
---
i think we should get our pets, like it was, no changes right? lol... and vanilla was somehow about seeing things in game you knew you never can obtain
---
I highly disagree, I believe Blizzard shouldn't cater to a small amount of people like that as it will make people who watch their streams get a completely different "veiw" of classic. If they decide they wanna try Classic then they will not get the streamer wonderlands version they saw watching *insert big streamer name here*
---
Ah i don‘t care about streamer realms. I will be so much behind it won‘t matter 😂
---
Ashenvale. That first time I walked into Astrannar, I really felt that this was a dangerous and exciting world.
---
With a character like this I can’t imagine why you’d wait so long to get it back?!
---
I can't recall much from my vanilla days, but did the range weapon slot stats affect normal melee attacks? For example, if a warrior sees an upgrade for his ranged slot, will it increase the overall melee dps output? Or are the ranged slot stats specifically tied to ranged attacks  (and vice versa w/ melee)
---
you don't have enrage or flurry, which increase single target clears by quite a bit. the blood craze and bloodthirst healing isn't crazy but it's still something as well
---
was expecting pr0n in the stack...
---
Is it possible to get a deleted character back? Like my first character I ever made?
---
Picked up a few of the strategy guides recently, and finally pulled everything vanilla related into one place.  While I'll always love my Collector's Edition, the WoW Diary may be my favorite out of all of this.
---
What is the best Alliance race for my level 1 rogue twink/bank alt?
---
My current thinking is Nelf for quickness and shadowmeld. I don't think that stoneform or escape artist are that useful dueling anyone in a level range I stand a chance in because of limited cc and bleed/poison at early levels so dwarf and gnome are out. Human gives some extra sword skill (I'll run sword main-hand, dagger offhand) which seems pretty useful, but not as good as what Nelfs are bringing. Do people have other thoughts than that? Is there something I'm missing? Thanks
---
because I want you to start crying.
---
Stormwind. The music, the look, the tram, the old auction house, the bank and so on. Freaking love this city
---
I cringed a bit when the robot lady voice for the conference calls at work mentioned “the pound or hash sign”
---
You very rarely have enrage or flurry up though while levelling seeing as you can't force crits and you have very low crit in levelling gear, where as you can guarantee to have rage by pooling on a single mob and then pulling multiple after.
---
Then you’re definitely making the right choice. As I’ve said before, being a Druid is like being the guy who helps you move. He’s not the strongest guy or the best driver or the fastest mover or even the best planner, but he’s your buddy and he’s there for you and that couch will get to where it needs to go because hes basically good at everything.
---
Personally, I loved raiding and casting GOTW on everyone, innervating priests, slamming Warriors and warlocks with regrowths, pulling off clutch Battle resurrects, walking out of a raid and going to PvP with my buddies in my full healer gear only to run WSG as an untouchable god. The best part about Druid is that you are so much more than the sum of your parts.
---
paladins arent necesarily slow, just boring.
---
I want the one for spinebreaker so fuckin bad
---
Who didn't?
---
Most streamers are planning to play on PvP servers. I'm pretty sure all the Classicast guys, as well as Sodapoppin and a bunch of others will be on PvP servers. The only one I have seen who has said he won't be on a PvP server is Asmongold. He knows he is going to be a target. Maybe he will change his mind when the game comes out though.
---
What’s his twitch
---
Vanilla was a long time ago and I was young but I played a pala and from what I've read recently about people's projections for leveling speed they are only faster than a warr 
---
We'll see though, hopefully that's untrue as I plan to roll a paladin as my Alli alt eventually
---
our guild most likely will have a roster of around 40 man at release, would be cool to have a serverlist beforehand so we can pin the server in discord instead of meeting with everyone in voice at launch
---
I had got exactly the same deskop before 5 years
---
If you add them as friends you can still play together.
---
While my example is a bit different it shows the problem of crossrealms/phasing:
---
I was leveling a new character, when a lvl ~90 Ally decided to kill everything in the crossroads. When he chased and killed me, I swapped to my main that was in org, only to find that he was in another phase and I couldn't do anything to revenge my alt.
---
Meanwhile back in vanilla my brother and I would take our twinks (19 Allys) to the crossroads and we could recognize every other twink who showed up to play, we knew each other's names, despite being on opposite factions. (I pray for these memories to happen again)
---
Crossroads &lt;3
---
I was on Mannoroth way back in the day. May do again.
---
Mana is definitely finite for every class in vanilla. There are ways to be efficient about regen like wanding and improved drain soul, spirit tap etc. No xp for professions.
---
Classic will be very very different from retail, even at low levels. Quests don't show where to go, mouseover tooltips don't help and there are no sparling/glowing clickable items. Reading is essential. Heck, it doesn't even show you the value of an item until you open a vendor to sell items.
---
yes
---
raider... balance?? Did you offspec heal or what did you do? Serious question.
---
Same :'D
---
These are the updated bfa class icons
---
(ree)
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/418489417?filter=archives&amp;sort=time
---
start about 4 hour 50 minutes. This is the outcome almost every time he's done a raid on a Horde city.
---
the thing about speed is it's only a matter of like a day or two playtime between the classes. it's also about ease of leveling, and paladins have an easier time because they have lots of defensive options whereas warriors and rogues have none.
---
Female orc is pretty close to human on horde side. Boss racial + smooth style.
---
I miss being able to customize my desktop like that. I remember having cool transparent dark glass Sci-fi themes. 
---
Now every single person's desktop looks that same
---
That Vent symbol brings me back
---
Is frost resist not armorsmith?
---
I was a healer for 99% of vanilla one of the mains but once we had inklings of tbc and I was getting bored I convinced my GL to let me go Oomkin collect a whole heap of cloth and leather int spell gear on the sole purpose of moonkim aura in the dps group plus it was fun to run around in PvP due to some people not know wtf a Oomkin even was half the time lol .
---
This, and 0/30/21 I can do all roles... :/ Where's my checkbox for all of the above?
---
Nelf start area was my first ever experience. I had no idea what an MMO was and never really played any Warcraft before. Got the demo, tried a Nelf Rogue and I was instantly hooked. How could gaming go from simple shooters and RTS battles to this monstrous world where every quest gives you loot and you power up with skills and talents and cool and sell things etc etc etc. It was so fantastically engaging right from the start. I couldn't get off the game for a few weeks and bought it shortly after to continue past the demo cap.
---
My iMac would have exploded. I could hardly load zones at all with my 20fps lop
---
Depends on when you hit 60. It isn't rep, but you'll definitely want to run LBRS for Robe of the Archmage pattern. Timbermaw Hold has a BOE shoulder and belt with int and mp5 that should sell well, so that's a good starting point for a rep grind. And it's just killing mobs in the open world, which mage should be good for.
---
Interested for sure
---
Was going to change back to Horde because i played horde with my cousin back in vanilla...but couldnt do it. Im filthy alliance scum and I will always be filthy alliance.
---
Yup, 0/30/21 really is the jack of all trades, master of none spec, and I absolutely love it
---
&gt; Imo I don't think even someone like him would "ruin" a server. It can be nice to have someone who will usually be doing a large event that you can just hop in to.  
---
Because having a large influx of his fanbase invade a server wouldn’t cause a lot of issues for people who just want to play the game. Hell, when he or some other streamer did that “Project 60” or whatever it was they moved to an RP server and proceeded to ridicule and disrupt the people who had been there to RP in the first place.
---
If only they had a choice to get paid or not.
---
I love how it’s 1:42 pm on Tuesday. You don’t need to know the date, just that it’s Tuesday.
---
xfire
---
I can still remember the server first Azuregos and Kazzak kills. So hectic -
---
Good times - I remember us getting all the horde first kills up to nef but never getting close to Memento Mori - freaking Paladins.
---
&lt;Inspiration&gt;
---
there was the cost of shipping the content creators out to them... not expensive compared to ads but still not free.
---
Exactly. Feels good to know theres at least one intern doing the dirty job
---
well, if we have say 14% crit or so, which gives about 59% uptime if you are using an ability every attack, for roughly 17.7% AS avg, and we assume 5% base crit for the enemy to proc enrage, lowered by your parry chance and such to about 4%, and also assume an avg enemy attack speed of 2, but with hamstring kiting is whatever your AS is, which we will say about 3, so 20 hits per minute taken with 4% chance to be crit, which gives an uptime of 16%, so 4% more damage dealt. 
---
now, along with the other talents, single target wise fury dishes out more damage whilst healing some, with better saving utilities like piercing howl and intimidating shout that isn't broken by bleeds.
---
i'm not sure how to calculate out the difference between a single target burn down as fury vs a build up burst pull as arms tbh.
---
I joined a guild early and am gonna roll on whatever server they're on
---
Because you can’t have a group follow them around to try to kill quest mobs so they can’t progress as easily on a pve server.
---
Why does race matter though? Not like there's any difference in PvE between an orc warlock and an undead one.
---
Great, I'll definitely consider being a Nelf rogue. Thanks for the reply :)
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Gimme that battlefield vietnam. So much fun
---
Great video dude. Lots of fun moments, really shows what Vanilla is about
---
Moonglade. I’ve always mained a druid and this was where so much went down for my class. Now it doesn’t have much use so all of my memories with it are of old WoW.
---
That's actually a good point of consideration.
---
I'm gonna go 21 to faerie fire for pulls since I tend to dungeon tank alot while leveling and then hit up furor+enrage. After enrage, back to finish off hotw and resto for endgame. I'm going a different build, so i'll probably adjust it after I see how my rage gen and such hold up.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AATMN\_0cA\_zwBA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AATMN_0cA_zwBA)
---
XFIRE POGCHAMP. shit was lit
---
Which classes require the least maintenance at 60?
---
By this I mean which was the least grind for consumables, repair bills etc.
---
&lt;PoP&gt; is pure poison, they are not just stream-snipers but also pure gankers and campers of anyone. They will come into a zone on unbalanced pop servers and prohibit anyone else from playing there.
---
Which is fine I guess, since you're the one that picked a PvP server. But it's undeniably lame and unsportsmanlike. There's no other-realm competition for them on many of the pservers they exist. 
---
Sort of like Goonsquad of Eve, from yonder days. 
---
But whatever server they go to in classic retail will not be healthy for the other side.
---
The  BradyGames  World of Warcraft Master Guide  is actually awesome! Surprisingly useful even for a classic private server veteran. Would love to check out some of the other manuals you've got there! very nice.
---
It would take about five minutes to find out what server they're on.
---
Goes both ways unless specified as range attack. Which is why hunters need weapons with high attack stats and warriors lay claim to a few nice bows.
---
Having the hero classes be class *and* race specific looks interesting. I'd imagine each would only add 2-4 new abilities on top of the base class but it would make the race you choose more meaningful. The closest comparison we have right now is Priest racials.
---
RP-PVP!
---
The thing is fury is so inconsistent, some mobs you just never crit or get crit meaning your two biggest sources of damage simply dont come into effect, not to mention fury can't take advantage of stance dancing for overpowers until much later which is a huge amount of damage lost.
---
Arms can reliably kill quickly all the time, getting a dodge or an extra crit just raises you even higher.
---
You're also assuming there is no downtime between mobs, so much of your buff uptimes end up wasted running/healing between mobs.
---
If you prefer fury that's fine, but I honest can't see how you can say it's better when arms can kill 2-3 mobs in a couple swings in the time time fury can kill one.
---
Just roll on a PVP server. Streamers won’t roll on them because their trolls will roll the opposite faction and camp them in contested zones. They’ll never get to play. 
---
PVP realms are the way to go for true classic - imo.
---
Not usually. If the helm covers your head you wont see hair but some items aren't full coverage of the head and would clip slightly.
---
Worst case scenario you could play on an oceanic server I guess. The time difference does have it's advantages.
---
Not what he was talking about.
---
Consistent scaling isn't a thing. Consistent scaling means "there is a direct correlation between the number of weeks I raid and the power of my charakter". In a consistent model, a class that scales less than yours, will always be weaker than you.
---
In WoW Classic, you don't scale consistently, you scalte in steps, as you acquire gear. These steps are inconsistent and unpredictable. A member of a class that nominally scales weaker than you in the continuous model, could end up stronger than you for a prolonged period of time due to better RNG in terms of loot.
---
Interestingly, it’s a burning crusade description but it states shamans ability to use massive two handed weapons, which is true, but enhancement focused on dual wield in burning crusade.
---
Nice guide
---
Was hoping to get feared into the Karazhan crypts, been so long since I’ve been down there.
---
I mean, if he has a separate account to play privately on, then you wouldn’t know about it. That’s kind of the point...
---
Took me forever to realize there's a shorter way to get in. You climb up from behind much sooner and just walk into the cave from the side.
---
Strawman. Not like OP said everyone will be min-maxing.
---
I never heard of that one.
---
must have been late in the servers life
---
probably not
---
His analysis was total crap. Case closed. Chance to get gear and math behind scaling between classes doesn't have anything to do with each other.
---
ah, that's true about the uptime part.
---
i just don't see how you can say you can use sweeping strikes all the time, the rage cost is so insane, especially when you don't have flurry to boost rage gen so the time it would take to build up enough rage on a mob to unload on the 2-3 is the part i'm questioning as worth it or not compared to the higher single target dps of fury
---
Dwarf hunter wins more 1v1 matchups of equal skill level.
---
So you are arguing that Blizzard should implement some feature to allow players to be in the same place but everyone having their own mobs to kill. Maybe they could call it sharding.
---
/s
---
Blizzard usually do name revisions deleting old names in waves with many years in between. I only recall them doing it twice.
---
So your character lost its name and then the character who took it stopped playing making it available for you a second time?
---
Having a list isn't gonna lock a streamer to a realm
---
I can look into that! Thanks for the idea!
---
reeeeeeeeee indeed.
---
As I said, you build on one mob then pull 2-3 mobs after that, with imp charge you generate 20 rage (the cost of SS) purely off the charge, not even counting the melee hit you also do at the same time, which will out you around 30-40 rage depending on yourl
---
&gt; Most big streamers will start right at launch.
---
Not if Classic releases at the same time as 8.2. The big streamers planning to play both games will probably do 8.2 first and join Classic later if that happens.
---
Goldshire
---
that's true i suppose, i've seen a lot of private servers having things like storm gauntlets and blazefury medallion scaling with spellpower when there are videos of them not scaling.
---
Same to me, playing a Tauren first. The sounds and wideness of the land, just great. Then, first time up the elevator in TB was a stunning experience.
---
There are less rogues nowadays because anyone knowledgeable about Vanilla knows warrior is the best class in Vanilla. And with bonereaver's edge in Phase 1 with 1.12 stats, that will make warrior even more OP.  If warrior's dps was toned down a bit, rogues would be as popular as warriors just like in 2005.
---
&gt; -- Modern WoW always breaks up large numbers, whereas Classic never did.
---
I remember this comment being already in the demo build.
---
A UI addon this style would be great.
---
Towelie's guild will be on a PvP server, he said in his stream
---
This is a Diff between the latest Build and the Retail client.  Not the demo and the latest Build.  All the Demo changes are included.
---
ah, so charge with tactical mastery and swap to zerker before you hit and you can start with quite a bit of rage, and then can already unload a ss ww, i suppose i hadn't taken into account imp charge, that does change the buildup speed to not be so long, potentially not even needed.
---
Like I said, it would allow the streamer to tell us which server they intend to play on. I never said they would be locked in.
---
I'm pretty sure there was literally an addon named quest helper in vanilla, soooooo
---
Yes, once I finished with the videos I was planning to go back through the text guide to fix the errors, add links in it to points in the video and add the images to it. I'm not sure if its possible to format that in google.docs though so I will have to take some time to learn how to do it, but it's something I'm planning on doing.
---
It doesn't need to. Just multiply pally\sham by 2  or divide other classes by 2.
---
omg plz take my money
---
good bot
---
Will there be RP servers?
---
I always liked male orc rogues b/c they remind me of the rogues in BRS. theyre also not very common its almost all UD rogues id just say pick something that you enjoy looking at and stabby stabbing things with
---
Hit me up with a PM also. those are freaking amazing
---
This is some insanely juicy content. Thanks for all of your efforts! I'm not even playing alliance but this was definitely needed and I hope I have time to check some of it out, just for the hell of it.
---
Portals aren't really a good money maker. It's less than 5% of a mage income.
---
All of the shared quests are accurate (Read: Tanaris, STV, Winterspring) - Private servers were called out on this early on last year and started using old videos to fix it. I know they fixed all of the horde quests and the neutral quests by using Joanna's leveling guide as a reference, but I am not 100% sure the alliance only 30-60 quests give the correct XP
---
This was incredible, thank you
---
Yeah. First of all this sub do have only small fraction of people who will go to Classic. And current results show that less than 10% of subscribers of r/classicwow have voted. So yeah sure this is nice thing but has actually no real value.
---
Got a few requests for this so I'll have to get a route for it once I finish the dungeon vids!
---
&gt; Cons:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ?????
---
Main con is having to compete with 6 other mages for Tier set and 4-5 warlocks for weapons and off pieces. If raiding is what you care the most about, it's a big con.
---
Is it true that you basically need a mafia to achieve rank 14? Talk of blacklists and people getting mad at you for pvping..
---
Ppl in this thread are straight up illogical hypocrites. They say no changes but they want a cash shop for pets. Its the same game, same subscription, classic ce flagged accounts should get the pets.
---
All the title make me think was Nickelodeon  Legend of the Hidden Temple TV show when the run The Shrine of the Silver Monkey. Where you find hidden relics and assemble them. :)
---
Pm me too please!
---
I got it, it's just interesting it's still hanging on in the latest Classic build.
---
my biggest fear is blizzard allowing hunters to do the chest farm in DM... that is going to do alot of dmg to economies this time around because EVERYONE will know about it
---
Same issue with Tauren for me.
---
I love the tauren look, hate that they dont get boots because hooves.
---
Look like they could make pretty awesome coasters, although not sure how big they are.
---
Love dwarves?
---
Love duskwood?
---
Are you me?  Just sayin, i wanna know what server you roll on, cause we will be bffs and such.
---
The coaster idea is neat. These are 10 in x 10 in by 1 in.
---
There were also addons that chose the rank of your healing spell to use based  on how much hp the target was missing, and addons that chose your decurse target for you.  Those things won't be available.
---
Human's diplomacy racial is very underrated, and can save you days of /played if you try to get a bunch of reps to exalted.
---
Ashenvale, hands down. Demons, Horde, Night Elves and Nagas all duking it out in a dope-looking forest. Hours upon hours upon hours ganking and being ganked.
---
Torn between Barrens and Ashenvale, both had memorable quests and rich in PvP encounters as a newbie lowlvl in Vanilla.
---
Orgrimmar if you count cities as areas.
---
/u/dextroes what is the WoW Diary like?
---
The last time I remember seeing him was sometime in wrath I think, or maybe Cata. By that point he wasn't really in control anymore. He did have a new name either from being banned or just changing it though, I can't remember what it was.
---
Same dm please
---
do you know if for example i have the mind control cap 3 times, does that mean i can use it 3x as often? when one is on cd i equip the second one and so on, or do they share cooldown somehow?
---
Ashenvale something special about that place
---
Never understood the appeal of Westfall.
---
I always referred to Westfall as Nebraska. Boring fields, boring enemies, boring colors. VC was highly overrated in my eyes (compared to other dungeons).  Different strokes for different folks.
---
Might want to be careful selling these, I assume there are probably some legal complications you might face.
---
The hater of gnomes :o
---
Make sure you check the beta testing option on your account management page, I got BfA beta as soon as it dropped, and I'm a nobody 😂
---
Im surprised by the flight form and "scout" form. Guess Flight was too insanely good to give to just one class lol
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Would play, but I know my luck.
---
I didn't even get into BFA beta (where everyone got in lol).
---
If I do get in though, I will roll a warrior and a mage for the first 25 levels. (Want to decide between them for actual classic launch.)
---
173 cm.
---
Nothing special in other ways either.
---
Had to look for other office chairs.
---
Also, the seat on these chairs are too hard in my opinion as well, not for the first few hours, but over a longer period on sitting time, it gets annoying :)
---
I was really happy the first days I had it, but once the romance disappeared, I started to notice things.
---
But, people have different bodies for sure, and you won't know until you really try it yourself.
---
Almost took the "world and server first" bait.
---
Almost.
---
Try removing the stick from your ass.
---
Those aren't even remotely the same thing, and if you can't parse out why for yourself, there's very little I can do to help you.
---
Ashenvale, easily. First real taste of PvP in a cool as hell fantasy forest was awesome.
---
No, they would be drinking the wine(playing the beta)
---
Then spitting it out(losing all progress).
---
i was there mannnnn, those were some good times for wow.
---
It's arguably worse for some guilds on the same faction because they will lose some of their best players to the Uber guild.
---
&gt; His analysis was total crap. Case closed
---
Here is an interesting question: Why do you have a problem with people whos opinion is different than yours? You get so angry over someone disagreeing, that's usually a sign of insecurity or low self-esteem.
---
I'm in the same boat... "Hey, I'm on a boat"
---
xD gonna roll on an EU english pvp, rp-pvp server if available. altough my mother tongue is german i prefer playing in english, to improve mine and get to know people from other countries.
---
my hourly changing race/class combination i want to play stands on gnome mage atm though hehe
---
ya warlocks are hunters one weakness, no real way to break fear. Hunters arnt going to compete on the dps charts with warlock mage rogue warrior, but, you just need to be competitive within your class at raids.
---
Right there with ya mate! Started in 05 as an 8 year old, grew up with the game and fell in love with Vanilla, BC, and Wrath. I unsubbed for the first time in Cata, after a few months of Dragon Soul. If you quit in Cata, you chose the right time. Dragon soul is the worst thing Blizzard ever made, or will ever made. That aside, the game just changed too much. I played MoP for a year, WoD for 2 months, Legion for 2 months, and have stayed clean from BFA. 
---
I can’t wait to sink my teeth into this damn game again. I started on a private server about 2 years back, and I’ve enjoyed it so much. It’s also obvious that it isn’t *nostalgia*, I just want to play the game that captured me so long ago, and is still a blast.
---
What are you looking forward to most in Classic that you can’t get from the modern game? Personally, I like the forced socialization. You have to talk to form groups, get things made, or even do some quests. Not to mention the devotion and drama that comes from having servers with their own population, forming bigger and smaller guilds.
---
He played the demo so I think he's also gonna to play the actual game
---
How do they know that you are a mac user?
---
*Everbody look at me, ‘cuz I’m sailing on a boat!*
---
Would there be more people rolling warlocks if they weren’t pretty awful during earlier patches ?
---
Zyger/zygor? Has alliance ones that are great too.
---
Mulgore
---
Ok...
---
Yup! That makes a lot more sense to me now. I think what caught me up is I view progress in terms of building experience. Thank you for the explanation.
---
If you play on US servers, don't worry about it. There will be very few world class guilds. Just don't roll on that 1 or 2 server where the elite US players decided to roll on.
---
It won't have wall jumping because they're using the modern client... so the way the game interacts with the terrain will be the same as it is now...
---
Frankly it's a crippling blow for me. One of my favorite pasttimes in vanilla was exploration around the areas not meant to be seen. Like the smiley face under karazhan, or some of the new little doodads left on the tops of mountains otherwise unaccessible. Not to forget old Hyjal. 
---
Good times...
---
But then your gaining calories/weight by not choosing to spit it out. So if I wait to no-life on Classic, I’ll gain more weight... I think we’re on to something here.
---
I'm in a similar boat.  Really want to play Druid, but not sure what faction.  First character I ever rolled in Vanilla was a NE Druid, but I've played Tauren Druid since TBC.  (I also recognized your name from the OWL sub; OWL fans love Druid apparently).
---
Ahhh I remember when my ret pally was allowed to loot zinrok (because fuck you, that's why)
---
Night elf female warrior looks super badass especially with large pauldrons. You can feel the impact when you charge into someone! Their animations are strong too
---
I’d like to point out that if you’re planning to pvp, shadow priest was a complete monster while it had mana.
---
Tonnes and tonnes of Retardins running around making a bad name for us, but the ones that were actually allowed to raid were usually extremely good players that spent so much money of potions and consumables.  I was a mismatch of leather, mail, plate and looked a clown, but I held my own.  The sad fact is if you're a good Retribution Paladin, you'd be a star on any other class.  But, fuck that shit.  FOR THE LIGHT!
---
What second cycle of server releases? They'll be merging servers in 3 years, not adding more. 
---
Appeal to casuals? Casuals will rarely see the end of AQ40, let alone naxx. They're also probably not going to switch to a fresh server. The trend I\`m seeing here is people that have damn near burned themselves out on Classic private servers trying to come up with some way to extend the game for themselves. As far as we know Blizzard is redoing Classic wow and seeing how people react to it, the mix of \*Retail sucks\* and \*Classic was better\* might have them questioning their design directions. Maybe if classic does really well the next X-pac will be a return to form of sorts. I sincerely doubt Blizzard is going to do anything to classic. If they do, it will be TBC then MAYBE Wrath. Or perhaps some light balancing to fix Hunter scaling and make Paladins/Shamans/Druid useful as something other than a healer in raids.
---
It is not about opinion, it is about false analysis. Math is not a matter of opinion.
---
Wow that sucks, I had plans to hang out at the lake above Northshire.
---
No bugs or exploits should return. But they should leave alone any "we decided to change this" stuff until the appropriate phase.
---
Start of warlords of draenor, so maybe six years ago?
---
I honestly don't remember.  I used it on our epic PVP attack on the horde cities.  After we reclaimed Lordaeron from the vile Banshee Queen, we turned our might to Kalimdor and annihilated the Orcish capital and I said it after we cut Saurfang down.  The gnomes.... their dancing on his corpse was a step too far imo :D
---
(I CANT WAIT FOR VANILLA)
---
That’s a weird way to spell ‘pussy’
---
Mean no ill intent buy saying what I said.no bait there so take it as you wish.  I have the stuff to backup my claims.
---
Aside from that I'm really looking forward to getting back to the classics of wow and enjoying the holy priest as he was intended
---
As long as there isn't streamer favoritism by Blizz, that would earn him a mute at least. Sodapoppin (one of the streamers who admitted to not care for the RP rules) got forced name-changed on the server for rolling a non-rp name.
---
A blue quote "The blame is not on the Project 60 community itself and most of the people running it have not endorsed any harassment and have been encouraging the opposite. I would attribute any sort of harassment/negative behavior to be an outlier and someone that would probably be doing it anyway even if it wasn't for the Project 60 influx. If you encounter this please just report it so our Game Masters can look into it." 
---
There are always going to be bad apples. Something like this will happen with or without streamers, and I have seen equally terrible things happen to streamers. People can be assholes, and I bet in Classic WoW, assholes will find out very quickly being an asshole, especially in public on a recorded stream, will lock you out of other groups very quickly.
---
&gt; You can be certain that the dominating guild/faction will have constant raids ready at them though.
---
That remains to be seen. Devilsaur mafia was a thing only on a few pservers. Don't think every server has a big enough population and enough organized no-lifers to control Devilsaurs 24/7, especially on US servers, I don't see it happening. USA doesn't have a big NEET population, servers tend to be dead at night. In order to make the mafia work, you need to control it 24/7, 18/7 won't cut it.
---
Getting underneath Stormwind or wall running into the bank?
---
Definately miss the sense of server community. Non of this cross realm crap. We all felt like a baws back then when a guy fully decked out in raid gear talked to us.
---
Would of been better to use Ligma disease
---
I think Blizzard has asked some of these community members to hint at an update in order to raise the hype levels ahead of the upcoming bluepost. There is no chance any of this would fly with a normal NDA/Press Embargo.
---

How viable is feral druid dps in raids? I played warrior back in vanilla as my main, but might want to try something different. Gonna be leveling mostly solo so I like the idea of druid. What does the feral rotation look like?
---
&gt;deleting or abandoning him. 
---
Well there's your problem. Female troll is best troll.
---
You can try. As long as the account still exists. Blizzard never really purges the old deleted characters, they just kind of exist in limbo.
---
Love the custom desktop theme! I remember having that and as a 12 year old it felt like I had customized my computer to be an ultimate battle station... part of the nostalgia of having something that was truly my own for one of the first times
---
The argument that "we had something similar in vanilla" doesn't mean they will allow the same thing again.  
---
Seems likely they will disable mods that would replicate functionality they are specifically removing from the game client that was added later.  That seems to be what they implied with their mods that replicate LFG.
---
can i create multiple of the same engineering item to not have to wait xy minutes to use the one type again? create 5 rocket hemets and equip another one when one is on cooldown?
---
Probably, though the playstyle turns many people off.
---
I hope we'll get some servers with rulesets that have a no streaming ruleset. Its classic wow - so back then we also did not had that kind of distruptive community component.
---
You want these changes, someone else wants something else changed. Another guy wants a few more things tweaked.
---
What if, instead of you getting the changes you want, blizzard changes things you like but other people want changed? Wouldnt you say "this is bullshit, why change it?"
---
That is why, for the sake of everyone who asked for vanilla servers for years, nobody gives a flying fuck what changes YOU want.
---
\*But this aint Sea World... this is real as it gets, I'm on a boat mothafucka don't you ever forget!\*
---
The only way a ranged weapon would increase melee attack damage is by the stats on it e.g. strength, agi, attack power, crit, hit.
---
How's the chair? Been thinking about one of those :)
---
Gotta take this into account IF there are oceanic servers too. Might be hard to find a US server based Oceanic raiding guild if they have their own servers.
---
Really excited that this is (almost)done now! Saw this when you posted the unlisted videos a couple of days ago. I watched pretty much all of them. Tried out the earlier levels.
---
Thank you so much for putting all this work in. This really is the exact kind of guide for me. I won’t be able to spend a lot of time playing and I want to not spend it wandering around aimlessly. I love that you cover many quests and aspects of the game and even include dungeons.
---
Planning to follow this in classic on a gnome warrior. I will probably play more dungeons and mess around with a DW arms spec before 40, but this is so great.
---
Joana has all the starting zones covered so you might use that
---
Just purely due to how many tanks you need vs how many dps more Druids will be feral dps than feral tank.
---
Probably took this screenshot while waiting for the servers to come back up from a particularly long maintenance.
---
yeah, the reality of the try harding that one needs to do to be successful at these offspecs is vastly underestimated.
---
How garbage is single target frost mage leveling? Not a fan of boring aoe grinding. I feel like I’m susceptible to ganks. Spamming frostbolt on one mob is boring as well. Lock leveling sounds way more fun because they get to utilize a wand better as well. With that said I feel like I would prefer mage at 60 over lock
---
Yepp Microsoft decided to do an apple and take away almost all customization in win 10, and now it looks like crap.
---
There won't be a second cycle. Either it'll be so massively successful that it'll influence retail WoW and it'll just be "the game" or they'll turn it into BC classic. 
---
There is a huge demand for BC classic, and if this is successful I can't really see them ignoring that.
---
I'm goikg male night elf rogue first, but I will absolutely get a frost mage as well for stuff like this. It's just too satisfying!
---
The sacred texts!
---
Lol sounds like me and planetside until they removed support for dual core.
---
Female trolls have really cool hairstyles
---
Would love the pally one, you selling?
---
There will be both new servers and BC, in my opinion, assuming Classic is successful. People like fresh servers and without them, new private servers will be played again.
---
The roof of Goldshire’s Inn
---
ohh damn... I love that sword
---
That’s the stupidest thing I’ve heard all day, thanks for that.
---
I would bet for an open beta, but only for people who have active subscription.
---
I don't have at the moment but my body and my credit card are ready!
---
Did fist weapon effects work in cat form?
---
I still think it’s fun to see.
---
As I'm reading rumours about announcements and betas within a week I'm thinking "*what if I just do everything tonight? Then I can play and also not flunk out of school!*"
---
I hope I don't get an invite or an opportunity to get one until after the 5th.
---
A friend of mine had CE but I hardly remember him using his useless pet. Back in vanilla, we had more important business to manage ;)
---
r/ClassicWowCirclejerk
---
As much as I'm an alliance guy, wow is a very social game and I'd go horde if that's what all my friends were going with.
---
I've just killed cthun with nightfall wielding enhance shaman
---
Wow that’s really ugly ! Love it !
---
You're obnoxious style of forming sentences is a dead giveaway that the post you just replied to is written by yourself. How pathetic can you be?
---
"World Quest refresh neutered."
---
It's beautiful.
---
Looks like polishing. Is the end(game) nigh?
---
Please explain why engineering ?  
---
I looked multiples guides, they all says engi is the best prof but without explanations.  
---
The only 'good point' is the little mechanical dragon trinket?  
---
Beside that i don"t see why it is so good,
---
please help :D
---
Never played classic but I did start playing when the original zones were still intact so I'd probably have to go with Elwynn Forest/Stormwind. Walking up to those gates was and into Stormwind was such an epic feeling.
---
You know it's funny, but it seems warriors have always been cry babies.
---
Back in Vanilla they were crying about PVP, but certainly not about the levelling and they would have been laughed at if they did.
---
I mained a warrior in Vanilla (actually I levelled 3 to lvl 60) and I still don't see it difficult. Apart for the ultra geared one, PVP was a bitch though .
---
Will names from current WoW be available? I didn't realize anyone could be this stupid...
---
If there was one place in all of the World of Warcraft that I would want to retire it's Mulgore. I found a park in boulder, CO that looks so much like it it's crazy. Great place. Can't remember the name.
---
Its highly likely because its not an "exploit". You can solo tribute with no cheating involved.. But I kind of hope they change it so you can't.
---
Well done, they look really good. The shaman one looks especially stellar.
---
Thanks! I'm not sure what makes the shaman one look so good, but it definitely outshines some of the others.
---
all of those desktop customisations murdered fps in your games lol
---
Is that fucking egg still around? Last I heard about him was like 1.5 years ago
---
You got the exclusivity that you paid for, for over 14 years. You are *not* going to get it now, because this is an entirely different *service* that Blizzard is providing, and you can't have things from a previous service carried over to a completely different, new service.
---
You still have your exclusivity, in the original service you bought it in. Log in and feast in your exclusivity - because you're sure as hell never going to see them here.
---
The way I see it : spriest is not playing the class specialty (priest == healing). 
---
So itemization is not adequate, group (raid) will be harder to find, you'll have to beg / lie / steal for DPS gear.
---
Mage is a DPS, nobody will bat an eye with you needing DPS gear, you'll even get priority in a loot council.
---
It's very taxing to always have to justify needing gear for something else than raiding.
---
Could be but I personally don't think it'll happen.
---
I recently did the 1-60 prot pally in a pserver, and tanked some of the preraid dungeons. Here's what I think:
---
- Tanking while leveling is amazing and very fun. You probably won't have any problems unless you're underleveled.
---
- Tanking level 60 dungeons is A LOT harder. There's multiple bosses with knockup abilities that drop aggro.
---
- Mana is not such a huge problem. Spam low level mana potions and you'll be fine. They're very cheap and useful.
---
- Use blessing of salvation on geared dps people. Ignore their cries. It'll make your life easier.
---
- You recieve A LOT more damage than a warrior. Not having defensive stance and not having a defensive cooldown makes you very squishy. I played the whole time with my GF (who was the healer officer in my guild at the time) and she had massive problems keeping me alive in some pulls with her druid. I was undergeared, but still, I was raped multiple times by angry mobs. At one time, a leather fury warrior put on a shield, spammed shield block, and actually received a lot less damage than me on the DMW dog boss (that boss drops aggro). It was very depressing to see.
---
So yeah, it's possible, but if you're going for the pre-raid gear, I would probably spec 20/31 early on, and switch to 30/21 later on when you have gear. Don't expect to be a beast at any point, just expect to be 'ok'.
---
I met a lot of people who claimed to be the best preraid tank, until they added a lot of missing aggro resets in preraid bosses. I expect classic to be even harder.
---
on pservers there was a lot of drama on top rank grinders, they'd queue dodge and do all sorts of shady shit that was unavoidable because it is 1 server.
---
it's not gonna be possible for the most part with classic since there's likely gonna be cross realm pvp.
---
still you need a dedicated group to premade with you and there's gonna be a lot of competition for ranks, expect 18+ hour days.
---
Try levelling without gear from your main or with shitty droprates til rfc or deadmines. A fucking boar can 1v1 your ass, even if you harmstring kite, because --&gt;miss, miss, dodge, parry.
---
Don't come off like a tough guy, tough guy, I know warrior is not that hard, but while levelling you get fucked over more often than any other class. 
---
Oh, you're too slow in killing mobs and the first ones start to respawn behind you. Better finish off the one that you've just pulled and pray to Jesus, that you have enough rage left to kill the 2nd respawn, or have enough health left to run away, but wait.. dazed.
---
Almost like becoming popular can be damaging to you and everyone you come in contact with if you don't know or have the ability to control your fans.
---
Played Alliance up til MoP before I quit.  First on Blackrock for Vanilla, then Kilrogg from BC on.
---
Battlegrounds always felt that Horde was better coordinated.  It felt like alliance just be getting steamrolled match after match.
---
Will probably go Horde this time around, simply because Shaman very quickly became my favorite class once Alliance got them.
---
mage
---
Internet is faster, but the speed of light through fibre optic cables isn’t. You’re still gonna eat a lot of latency.
---
If the monk icon were to be made I would seriously consider a purchase. 
---
I began WoW in legion, and am super excited for classic, but monk. Brewmaster will always hold my heart.
---
better off twinking your bank alt at 30-39 bracket because you can get access to higher stuff in professions like alchemy and use that to do transmutes, etc.
---
Well bollocks.
---
I'll be NA PvP as Dwarf.... Something.  Because Dwarf master race 😛
---
i'd rather wait for the game to come out and make friends in game and go from there to be honest. i always found it more rewarding finding guilds in game than trying to apply to a guild out of game.
---
Pm me aswell
---
As someone who has also created a [1-60 alliance guide](https://wowleveling.fandom.com/wiki/Dun_Morogh) I truly respect your dedication and the amount of work you put into make this. Respect and thanks for sharing!
---
Look up his post history. He's a grown man with a family, writes like he is from the ghetto and cries like a baby
---
it could be possible, you could probably macro it actually. it's probably not worth the aggravation though.
---
Very nice work! I like the shaman one. And the priest look real crisp. And I like how the warlock hand sort of pops out from the shadows. Ok I love all of them! Just take my money already!
---
But you still have your exclusivity in the original service that you bought it in. You're not entitled to shit in Classic
---
Would you please link your desk?
---
Oh my god Xfire.
---
Dwarf racial is great
---
Not bland human
---
There is really no Horde race that is clearly favorable above the others for a rogue.
---
I personally like the male Troll melee combat animations. Can't comment on the female animations.
---
Just play the race you find aesthetically most appealing. Log onto a private server and do some levels on each race.
---
I'd personally go for Troll because Trolls tend to be the least common race of the horde + they look cool.
---
Just go on a PVP server, problem solved. No fucking way will a popular streamer go into a PVP server and get rekt all day every day by stream snipers.
---
Darkshore.
---
MadSeasons is the gold standard in classic content.  Which pretty much guarantees that Blizzard won't invite him.  They'll just invite all the shills that will suck Blizzard's dick regardless of what Blizzard shows them.
---
He doesn't like anything.
---
Get an Aeron or Embody instead. "Gaming chairs" are trash in comparison.
---
So sick of strawpolls
---
I disagree, I think it is likely. It will be a strong way to retain subs, imo, and for little-to-no cost. I don't think they will release as many as at 2019 launch, but there will likely be 1 or 2 per region, I'd assume. I mean, whats the point of going out of the way to put 6 content/pvp phases in, if phase 1 and 2 will only ever be experienced for a couple months each, once and never again?
---
That, and BC, and later Wrath, seem like the most cost effective low risk methods to keep all their playerbase happy and retain that monthly sub income.
---
The issue with most of the most used guides is they're designed for hunters, there are things that a warrior can't or just shouldn't bother doing which a hunter will have 0 problem with. 
---
So a specifically Warrior guide is good because literally any class can do it.
---
human
---
Everything you said is wrong and you seem to not understand how damage reduction works, especially if you can heal. If your damage reduction is 1% and you add 1%, then your effective hp increasesby more than 1% also due to heals being more effective. To extrapolate, if your damage reduction is 98% and you add 1%  you double your effective hp without putting any toll on healing. That is why tanks have shields. But you are beyond reason, OP can choose whatever answer seems more convincing, the internet is free.
---
Would love to buy a few of these for me &amp; my mates. Please PM me with the details.
---
It is a problem thats why you see more Warlocks on Horde than Alliance on PvP servers. It is sub-optimal no way about it, however don't let that discourage you from playing the game the way you want if you're not interested in squeaking out every small advantage you can.
---
The upside for Warlocks on Alliance is because of Paladins you can kind of just go hogwild in raids. Warlocks generate a surprising amount of threat with no way to really mitigate it
---
I'm the exact opposite. I played a Holy Priest in Vanilla at launch up to BWL then switched over with my friends to Horde and played a Resto Shaman and cleared most content. 
---
This time around I'll play a Hunter (torn between Dwarf/NE but leaning towards Dwarf despite Shadowmeld being strong AF).
---
Currently on pserver pretty low level, when I see others I'm looking for buffs/dispels/heals etc but then I realize I can't do that anymore! It's a bit hard as I've always been a healer/support, in literally every MMORPG I've played. 
---
I'll try and stick to it for a change! I'm aware Hunter DPS is subpar and has a high skill ceiling but it's a very interesting class and levelling so far has been a blast!
---
I think that overcomplicates things. Casuals and hardcores shouldnt have to pick out a specific server to suit their needs. Most casuals would likely just stumble randomly into a server, not realizing most people would be in T3 before they got their noob ass to 60.
---
I'm not a tough guy, I think you're exaggerating the difficulty.
---
You know why i won't play a warrior in Classic ? 
---
- PUG groups that generate a lot of threat on everything, while you're rage starved and trying to generate threat on all the mobs without much tools for that.
---
With the rush mentality that is even more common nowadays, that's going to be even worse.
---
- being a free kill in PVP if I don't outgear my opponents and don't have a pocket healer
---
I'd take a 4 times harder levelling in exchange of more relaxed tanking and more mobility in PVP, but that's just me.
---
As someone who lives in the UK I can tell you it's not hard AT ALL to find the full sugar versions. There is far more choice now for everyone. MrGM is just overexaggerationg. 
---
Sweeteners are not great, but they are better than sugar by a long way.
---
I know you disagree.
---
Love the lock one! Can you PM me the details? (Seems everyone wants these! Well done!!)
---
Yeh, he really does, you typically advance in a career, here he doesn't have too much room to grow, sounds dangerous. 
---
I am not sure if I'd like to do that everyday for my job, even though I am basically doing it, but my job is not dependent on it. 
---
What happened to Athene? Is he still streaming?
---
Silverpine Forest .. simply beautiful
---
Its not the streamer, its their "fans" thats the problem. They want screen time, aka either suck up to the streamer by giving them shit or following them, essentially creating a wrecking ball thats only purpose is to make life either as easy OR as hard to the streamer as possible.
---
If they would be in a PVP server, this would be HORRIBLE, but i think biggest streamers will go PVE anyways.
---
Omg DM me! Do you do EU shipping? Much love :)
---
Xfire was so much fun for that time! I remember it said my friend was playing wow Beta
---
Probably charge you for it
---
Remove the capability to make/use LFG addons
---
Now make a horde one please thankyou
---
XFIRE!
---
Gold farmer alert
---
Being a high end raider or pvper usually gets you one as well but not sure if they will do that for classic.
---
Heya, may I get a PM as well? Looking to grab myself the warlock class symbol.
---
Disable it.
---
That taskbar is dope!
---
Yeah, in the end, nobody knows for sure. I do hope it goes that way though. Personally, I could definitely see myself playing both a fresh Classic, alongside BC.
---
Can't remember exactly when as I wasn't playing either, but I think it was around WoD.
---
Looks good!
---
Is no one going to mention the empty Morning Glory Dew Recycle bin?
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/mikepreachwow
---
Good read. Although the amount of negativity in it is astonishing. Nevertheless, at least well written and structured negativity.
---
They would, but considering there was next to no fist weapons in the game I wouldn't worry. Also remember all weapons for druids when shape-shifted act as stat sticks. Damage/attack speed is irrelevant.
---
I liked the point he makes about classic wow server discords. The discords themselves function as an LFD tool with channels devoted to each dungeon, raid, BG, trade, etc. so players would just go there looking for people to form groups. 
---
But, this is exactly the type of socialization we as a community want, right? While I’m spamming in general or whatever looking for two dps and a healer I’m also sitting in a discord channel for my server asking other players if theyre interested in my group. 
---
Shit becomes muddy when assholes start trying to sell runs. I’m personally of the opinion that all forms of paying for runs should be against ToS and those caught get 3 month, 6 month, and perma bans as punishment.
---
It’s been there for years actually! It’s in an area that tours don’t go to. So really the only way you see it now is if an employee walks you by it. It’s next to two areas you typically don’t want to take non employees by. Mainly because they aren’t “interesting” from a tour perspective as well as not wanting to disturb people who are working. 
---
I would never take group tours there but maybe 1 or 2 person tours I would.
---
Asmongold is my favorite streamer, but I just know that whatever realm he's on will be plagued with retards spamming twitch emotes in tradechat while never leveling past 25. An army of baddies talking about Pink Sparkles' implants.
---
You are totally right though. They need to give us the names beforehand. That way the realms can basically be quarantined from the start. If they don't do that, it will cause chaos. People will all join the high-population servers, then if a streamer like Asmongold joins the same one, tons of people would leave that server for who knows which server. Then the faction imbalance starts affecting the highest population realms on day one. With more people leaving/staying depending on which side the streamer is on.
---
It would normally balance out pretty evenly. Whether you are Horde or Alliance, you basically choose a realm blindly with no faction population incentives. Imbalance usually only happens slowly overtime in normal circumstances.
---
Dun Morogh, first ever interaction with World of Warcraft was watching my cousin level a dwarf in Dun Morogh.
---
That's exactly why I'm going there. Let there be blood. I'll have more fun getting in those fights than I've had in modern day wow in years.
---
It’s hidden away! Not really. Most employees just forget it’s there since it’s an old school thing and most employees, outside of those that work in that building, rarely ever walk by it anymore.
---
Depends. If you're raiding it will be a healer by far. All dps classes need to spend far more on consumables than healers. Healers don't need to flask or do anything really apart from some mp5 food and maybe one stat potion.

What are some of the best items to grind for gold are once you hit 60? Maybe it's worth taking some territory and pvp on it for resources? :)
---
I would love info on them too to possibly buy! Thanks \^\_\^.
---
Totally agree on it. Don’t worry about item competition and focus more on whatever class you’ll enjoy the most. The real tier items won’t class anyways
---
The beta will be a demo where you can do everything
---
I'm sorry this doesn't jive with your experiences, but it's true.  I played Paladin through BWL when it was current tier, and had 8/8 tier 2 before AQ dropped.  That character is still mining/smithing all these years later.  We didn't clear all of Naxx, but then, most didn't.  I was lucky enough to kill a few bosses though.  I didn't raid at all in BC, maybe the professions thing was a bigger deal then.  It certainly wasn't in Vanilla on Tichondrius Alliance.  Can't speak to other servers personally.
---
Wrong. I was in vanilla WoW open beta. I was sad that I didn't get into closed beta because I missed all the fun when they dropped infernals and such in Stormwind at the end.
---
Nothing beats Org tho.
---
They are rewriting the game in current tech language. Most bugs will be fixed, new ones might apear.
---
Dwarf Hunter is really strong iirc
---
You absolutely hate pvp and have no intention on ever doing pvp content, ever? Troll. 
---
You going to do equal parts pvp and pve? Orc. 
---
You going to try hard pvp? Orc. 
---
These are obviously just my opinions, but I also operate off the mentality of “if you plan on doing PvP equal or greater than the amount of time you plan on doing end game PvE, and the class you want to play can be an orc, then you go orc.”
---
Discord most likely. No Ventrilo or Teamspeak these days
---
Although you are correct, I'm sure there will still be plenty of bugs only because they chopped and gutted, new engine etc. It'll mostly be very small stuff the hardcore will find or VERY simple very obvious stuff people find on accident however most the game will be polished. 
---
I feel the same way you do if we do get a BETA it'll more than likely be a stress test - wouldn't it be nice to be dumped in Westfall with a giant super sized boss to kill once more? like the 7.2 stress test with Nomi lol
---
The fastest dungeon groups will be melees with WF totem - warrior - rogue -rogue - rogue - shaman
---
Hmmm, it’s totally possible that I missed it, and it was just something he didn’t show me.
---
This looks great, hope you are able to clean up the text version some as the videos can be hard to understand you sometimes. In Joana's guide there is a way to check off steps as you complete them, I think something like that would make it a lot easier to follow along with this guide up on another monitor.
---
Not much they can do. A LFG addon uses very basic parts of the API. Disabling or breaking them would destroy a lot of crucial addons in the process.
---
We as a community however can choose not to use such addons. If we prefer to spam /trade to form groups that's what we will do.
---
A LFG tool is only successful if it's a clear improvement to see a list of all groups forming on your group and filter that list instead of keeping an eye on the trade chat scrolling. I don't think it's an improvement.
---
&gt; Im hoping the classic version of wow will have wall jumping 
---
Me too, desperately. It was incredibly fun and added a whole new dimension to the game in exploring. But it had too much gamebreaking affects too for PVE and PVP encounters, so it's gone. (as seen by the demo client from Blizzcon)
---
any more details on that spec?
---
Darkshore
---
Yep. Asmongold couldn't even play ESO because there were so many people following him and killing everything. Classic would be like that for him except worse since kill credits aren't shared.
---
You won't have an edge in STV if you stay Lvl 30, people will be ganking you on their mains for weeks if you do that while you cry in lvl 30
---
In my opinion, "porting to classic" will not happen on a large scale. People will create new addons, specifically for Classic and probably inspired by the few influential old 1.12 addons. But I think the skins are going to change completely - being honest, if XPerl came out today, nobody would use it, since it is hideous. I think this will be the case for many 1.12 addons.
---
PM me as well please :)
---
Thing is
---
It would still be only for the players on one server plus you wouldn’t be ported to the instance
---
It would be very weird for blizzard to change those to deviate from how they were working back then. Wolfshead helm was actually used back in TBC, you can still find some old threads about it. It was definitely stacking with Furor, but just wasn't discovered yet during vanilla era, probably due to Ferals being so rare anyway at that time and only very few people seriously trying to theorycraft it (Tangedyn for example).
---
If, for some reason, Blizzard decided to change Pummelers, for example giving it a cooldown instead of the current charges, that would be very bad news for feral spec as a whole. MCP is one of the main sources of higher dps capabilities for cat while being also the main source for very high TPS for bear.
---
Think of it like a multi-boxer running around on a realm with 100 accounts. That would be something you'd want to avoid.
---
To build on what the previous commenter -- "On-Equip" effects and stats "work" in shapeshift form, but "On Hit" procs do not. This also goes for enchants; crusader will get you nothing as a druid.
---
you mean warrior warrior warrior warrior shaman ?
---
rip firefox.
---
Enchant is kinda garbo imo unless you are THE guild enchanter who gets funneled all the good recipe drops from 40mans. Even then, it's mostly only lucrative at the beginning of a patch cycle when demand is high for the new enchants. 
---
For leveling I would stick with two gathering professions (make one of them skinning, very easy money even if you just vendor) and drop one at 60 for a crafting profession.
---
My guess is bugs that were possible to due the terrain will still work though, like getting under karazhan &amp; getting to the IF airport.
---
Bugs based on abilities like blinking through portals &amp; fearing through gates (eg kara crypts) won't work.
---
So I'd wager you can still duel in that position in IF, but you won't fall through the floor into old IF.
---
I think it's mostly all the routers in between. Light is pretty quick.
---
the druid is the most mana efficient healer and has the best lock out of stealth ability  -  **Faerie Fire** .
---
Its  a tank with stealth and healing.
---
These windows xp skins were not officially supported by microsoft and if anything there's more customization now with support for changing window colors and stuff. Windows XP without using classic mode only had blue or olive to choose from.
---
Looks like you're always losing interest between level 30 and 50. That's not unusual, because that's the range where you already got most of your important skills and nothing "new" comes. 
---
Why don't you try out shaman and priest aswell? That would be much better than rolling class "x" in classic because some random guy from reddit told you so....
---
I'll be taking skinning until 60 but just vendoring all leather. Normal leathers/hides don't sell much higher than vendor price and have a high AH deposit. There's a great breakdown of the profits from skinning while levelling [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/). At 60 I'll check the price of bars and either farm gold to buy bars for engineering or farm mats with mining then drop mining for Goblin Engineering. My second profession is Tailoring which handles itself.
---
Awfully large amount of world first people about.
---
A world first raider wouldn't make this banal shitpost.
---
And you could guarantee it happens at the back of a cave. Resulting in multiple corpse runs with all red gear or res sickness.
---
agreed- run selling should be insta ban
---
Hah, love the recycle bin!
---
&gt; Try levelling without gear from your main or with shitty droprates til rfc or deadmines. A fucking boar can 1v1 your ass, even if you harmstring kite, because --&gt;miss, miss, dodge, parry.
---
Not true at all. Leveled 1-18 last week on _a server_ without any prior chars and this is just flat out wrong. If you do encounter an unfortunate miss/parry/dodge combo, you still have the mob under hamstring. Just run away. If it catches up to you, swing and hamstring again, run away again.
---
1-20 is not a big problem for a warrior, I did 1-10 in 3hours3minutes /played on a populated realm, with 2 deaths because I am a scrub. Still fast.
---
&gt; Like the smiley face under karazhan
---
I think many places like this will still be possible to visit, since doing that only required you fall into a hole in the map. That hole existed until the cata revamp so it will still be there in classic unless they specifically fix it.
---
I think most people know they were not officially supported by Ms. You have less customization now, since you cannot even change half the things you used to be able to do (I'm not talking about built in features) . You can change color scheme, wow big woop. Microsofts intention since win 8 has been to limit customization in order to streamline it, and it's pretty clear even for the avarage user.
---
Just grab [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) and you can do a [ton](https://youtu.be/ro4v8R05VwQ?t=251).
---
I'm aware of that it might look like I'm simply loosing interest (my initial post points into that direction) but I've also decided not to 'destroy' the end game quests (attunements and such) as I never done them as horde. I want it to still be fresh when I eventually get there 😎
---
Wtf, Young goretusk boar in westfall will def. be a tough cookie to nibble on on the same lvl. +1,+2 lvl it's even worse.
---
If you're higher, of course it's easy. Also: gear.
---
it's going to be very difficult depending  on how populated the realms  are. Even on a lower pop pve sever it still requires  an incredible  amount of time. higher pop pvp servers people would have to pay gold to the top players who put in the most time to be allowed to get enough honor for the rank.
---
I know players who switched off with  roommates to make sure there toon was playing and pvping  24/7
---
warriors cant cc and cant clear threat like a rogue
---
Joana said that he's making an alliance guide that should be ready by classic.
---
Pretty sure people would still spam chat and friends lists for group recruitment, even if the addon took off.
---
BF:V was so good
---
Yeah I agree
---
There is a addon called vQue that a large majority of vanilla Pservers use. The UI is a large window with side buttons of  level brackets 10-20, 21-30.  Then any one says a key word like “Ubrs” or “AQ40” it takes that sentence that the person typed “lf4m rdps AQ40, inspects on IF bridge. And puts it in the tab and has a button that slows you to whisper the person who typed it. 
---
Fantastic addon.
---
Death by 1000 cuts.
---
/s ?
---
No changes
---
40-45 is usually the nadir of my motivation in levelling.
---
Change your expectations.
---
On beta I'm going to try out the all the classes I can't decide on and go through and take my time read all the quests and explore that way when it finally launches I can rush through the first 10 or so levels on the class I know I want to play
---
probably  already mentioned but don't  get rid of anything in bank and bags until you see the ah price there are some very valuable  items no longer in the game that only old accounts have. that people want and collect.
---
 you can sell some of these  the AH for a large amount of gold. even something  that has turned grey you might not think much about.
---
I really need someone on r/unixporn to recreate this
---
Played priest in the 2004 beta
---
Played priest from classic to WoTLK
---
Will play priest again ;)
---
What’s wrong with Firefox?

I would really like to get into karazhan crypts or the caverns of time again

There's hardcore and then there's ultra no life hardcore though

i recovered my 2006 account also,High Warlord Orc Rogue, the master flag defender.

Ya the guide is top notch. This time around I have a career and responsibilities as opposed to being a college student so I really gotta make the most of my limited time :(
---
Yes, watching instant karma and people "getting whst they deserve" etc is so fringe sick fucks all of them. Might as well be nazis
---
Is it hard to get to lvl 60??
---
I think he might still, iirc semi recently there was controversy with him as usual with some scam of his cryptocurrency
---
I made absolute bank being an alchemist when the big raiding guilds were fighting over server firsts. (Well, that and being a cloth wearer with a small repair bill after a night of wiping)

as which class? a mage?

Traitors. All of you. XD

You're the best

Rip scales indeed 6% of AP per combo point, until 24% of AP. So 4 and 5 combo Rips deal the same amount of AP as bonus dmg. However, Ferocious Bite reaches it in dps very early if your guild uses all armor debuffs and especially if you have access to world buffs. Optimally, you should never use Rip to consume a debuff slot because it only replaces another dmg ability, so the actual dps increase is comparison between Rip - Ferocious Bite. It is much more worthwhile to use that debuff slot for Corruption or something else that actually does not replace something else, but adds something completely new and pure dmg increase.
---
Feral dps is definitely viable, but it requires some practice and effort to execute powershifting efficiently, and using consumes optimally.
---
If you somehow manage to get into a group where shaman gives you agility totem, you should be able to reach similar dps to Alliance feral. You will experience slightly more mana problems, but still can get to almost the same numbers. The problem is that Windfury totem is air totem just like Grace of Air and most of the time you will not get it.
---
But even without Agi totem, horde cat is not trash, but it is less competitive than alliance with pala buffs then.
---
Ret palas and other meme specs are great in dungeons though...
---
I think they scale well for healers and do OK at tanks, poorly as DPS.
---
 In pre-bis you'll likely find that druid healers lag far behind priest/sham/pally in output and utility. Once they start to get a decent amount (5/8) of T2 though they really begin to shine. And their T3 set bonuses are honestly the biggest upgrade for any healing class. 
---
By comparison, a pre-bis bear tank in many situations makes a better tank than a pre-bis warrior. They pick up some very sick upgrades in the AQ patch in particular. By T2 warriors have started to gain ground and by T2.5 and 3 the warrior might be come out on top in some situations, but overall a bear tank is pretty useful throughout the timeline of vanilla. (I should note I don't really mean in a permanent MT 440-man raid capacity, more talking OT and farm MT content)
---
DPS druids hit their stride around BWL (and can have some insane parses with MCP up) but lose major steam in AQ and beyond. The less tank and spank a boss gets, the more cat dps suffers. Their competition also pick up some insane upgrades compared to the moderate ones ferals receive. Because of the intense mana requirements of powershifting ttoo, the longer a fight runs the worse the feral dps' output will be.

Great guide my man just watching a bunch of hours of it already. Do you happen to have the timestamps for each level you dinged at? This would help with seeing how were doing in comparison to you and use as a reference to know how long it would take to level on average. Of course it wont be a linear increase because of quest hand-ins but just to get an overall idea of how many minutes/hours in the big picture as were leveling. Something like this https://imgur.com/a/UzZf7Bk would be great, doesnt have to have the edited version just the unedited times for each level would be awesome information :) Thanks for making the guide my man
---
&gt;I'm aware of that it might look like I'm simply loosing interest
---
&gt;Shot up in levels and reached 44... After that I lost interest
---
&gt;This project stranded at lvl 37.
---
It sounds like you're losing interest because all of your language suggests that you lose interest.
---
 This depends completely on fight/content that we're talking about. The shorted the fight, the higher Warriors and Rogues get due to their very powerful cooldowns. Most of the vanilla fights are relatively short (0:30 - 1:30 mins) and since feral lacks all kinds of cooldown abilities and only gains so-called cooldown via use-trinkets, it is inevitable that warr and rogue will parse higher if they are any tryhard.
---
The average dps of feral cat can reach really high numbers if you just play your consumes, trinket-uses and pummelers optimally. However, you may destroy you own dps by using consumes at a wrong time, especially mana consumes and then running out of mana way too early.
---
I've personally been able to beat warriors and rogues in dps on many occasions, but on average it's just not possible most of the times. Twin Emperors is a fight where I was always in top3, Prophet Skeram as well. My best achievement was getting #9 average dps of all the rogues on the server in Blackwing Lair. It's important to note that i had half green and half blue gear at the time when all the top rogues were pretty much in their BiS gear for that patch.
---
It's difficult to say what would be an average percentage of dps that feral deals of warrs or rogues, because it depends completely on your guild's kill times, encounter, your role etc. We still don't have enough ferals in top guilds to make conclusions. But for example on 0 armor target I've been able to hold 1600 dps for 4 minutes, on 700 armor target 1400 dps for 4 minutes.
---
This is 100% vanilla, no TBC. The video was posted originally in Nov 23, 2006, it's [on the website](https://web.archive.org/web/20070106011518/http://www.decimation.eu/) that is advertised at the beginning of video. It doesn't have TBC talents like rampage used, and its made even before the time those talents were available.
---
It's not a mystery what type of gear and talents you need to do this DPS. I'm not sure why you feel those are necessary?
---
As for movie quality, videos back then were uploaded to warcraftmovies where you could view them in very good quality. Someone had simply saved the video and reuploaded to youtube, which means no quality loss.
---
Have you set your beta profile on the battle.net site to actually get a chance at beta invites?
---
More likely a Beta Soon™.  If you pay attention to the content creators and streamers, they're all hyped and being cryptic.  Its not summer yet, so no release, but likely they're prepping it so that it can be used by non-Employees.  Whether that's a Friends and Family or Closed Beta.
---
To answer your question there: druids will start off weaker than sham in Phase 1 but will win the "Most Improved" Award by the they get their T3. Hell even their T2 represents a huge upgrade.
---
I mean you can do way more now if you're going third party.
---
That's what the above user was saying.
---
With just baseline windows you have a lot more.
---
Windows 10 is actually a pretty good user experience.
---
TBC leveling was so great.
---
Could also use rain of fire as a lock right?
---
I mained a spriest for years, its my OG love in wow but I'm afraid I won't get into groups for dungeons and having to end up respeccing every day (thus farming for an extra 2 hours like every day). Is there any way to handle that?
---
&gt; I want to play with Scandinavian, **(maybe?)Russian**
---
You think you do, but you don't!
---
How is the secret lab chair? I got an DXracer atm, curious if i should switch or if they are basicly the same?
---
are you able to access the data on these and could you play on the characters that were made if you loaded the information into a personal pserver?
---
It was a given when I started playing in 09 that I would be Horde. Since then though, I've kinda swapped sides.
---
Now I just don't know. I kinda play both factions. Never had a strong faction identity. 
---
If I'm to play classic I'll probably go for something boring like a Human
---
Why would you need to know more? That's all you need in order to know whether it is raid night or not.
---
BEST PALADIN IN THE WORLD
---
Sadly not. If you’re plannin to solely pvp you will probably have to respec for pve, needing more grinding
---
Current LFG addons (Call to arms and vQueue) are in essence chat filters with a fancy UI.
---
The notion that anyone will be farming Naxx, let alone that it'll be happening for months...
---
Barrens
---
MSN? Xfire?? Vent??!
---
I want to go back
---
Sameee like I’ll log on to see the difference in graphics, maybe play around making a character, level that character to 10 or so, maybe make another to get to 20 or so just to see how fast I can do it. But other than that I won’t play it.
---
&gt;I think most people know they were not officially supported by Ms.
---
Well, then it is not really fair to compare it to only the official features of win 10. And if you count non-MS features, then it is not even a competition - win 10 win rainmeter alone kicks anything xp could out of the park.
---
Are you trying to start a [[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of Windseeker]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) comment chain?
---
He is a jerk though.
---
What would be the best profession for money making? Also are certain classes great for money making, for instance rogues ability to lockpick or certain classes ability to solo farm dungeons?
---
The Barrens - must have music enabled.
---
Why do you want to CC and clear threat when you have 4 ultra tanky DPS with big 2 handers bouncing threat between each others plus the best "aoe" healer of the game ?!
---
You just need one of the warrior to equip a shield and "properly" tank big damages bosses but that's it.
---
Ashenvale
---
Paladin - Healer.
---
Played Mage and Rogue back then. Didn't start my "healing career" until TBC (and have been healer since), so now it's perfect chance to "rewrite" my vanilla experience. :)
---
Rainmeter can make changes to explorer, Taskbar and start menu as a few examples? I'm not comparing it only to them, you are missing the point. Afaik ms locked a lot of things, making some that were previously possible to modify (not officially) not possible anymore.
---
Generally yeah, it's not a big amount of hp.
---
However warriors have an absurd scaling off spirit. It just regenerates way too much health.
---
There's people who carry a second set with full spirit to heal between pulls. I think the bagspace is too valuable to do that, but still, there's some items that are unexpectedly VERY good for leveling a warrior.
---
Example: http://classicdb.ch/?item=1975 very underrated warrior leveling weapon that's usually very cheap.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Health_regeneration
---
There you can see pre-BC warrior was WAY above all other classes when it came to spirit hp5 scaling. It's insane.
---
&gt;Why don't you try out shaman and priest aswell? That would be much better than rolling class "x" in classic because some random guy from reddit told you so....
---
aren't you a random guy from reddit ?
---
I’m tossing up between an ele Resto Shaman and a hybrid spec Druid so this is good to know. Thank you for your time and input :)
---
If you think there aren't big streamers in the EU, you are mistaken. People like Unge in Germany get 10k viewers+ and are purely German. For a chance ti play with them personally, people are willing to do a lot.
---
Less than in the US? Probably, but they still exist.
---
In a group perhaps but the reason for mage is the group cc and slow. A lock with no help will just get overwhelmed and killed attempting to aoe them down without slows.
---
What stick? 
---
Classic is vanilla. TBC is not vanilla.  Therefore TBC is not relevant to classic.  How hard is it?
---
German streamers Unge and Gronkh get a lot of viewers, both play WoW, might wanna watch out for that.
---
Great idéa and useful! I have bookmarked this and will check this for updates/when we get more info of addons.
---
The only new experience you traitors going from horde to ally will get is death.
---
I'm not saying you can do everything you used to, but you literally said 
---
&gt;You have less customization now, since you cannot even change half the things you used to be able to do (I'm not talking about built in features)
---
But you *don't* have less customization, you have more. Sure you might have lost some things, but you gained more than you lost. Might not be what you want, but you still have more customization now than previously.
---
Also, I'm a bit curious as to which features you lost that you would want back? Personally I actually don't miss any customization from xp, but maybe I missed some things.
---
&gt; So really the only way you see it now is if an employee walks you by it.
---
So a content creator was walking with a Blizz employee in an area that normal tours don't go through.
---
**Interesting**
---
What have you heard went to him over a more deserving player?
---
Not Spanish.

http://paladinsucks.blogspot.com/2005/08/interviewing-what-fangtooth-doesnt.html
---
How so? Back then I honestly did not even know what FPS was, so not fully sure how it would work, but a static visual would not really tax the GPU or CPU. I assume it could somehow increase the amount of RAM used for the OS, but I can't imagine it would be "murdering" your FPS.
---
So its been 14ish years since I stopped playing my priest during naxx near end of vanilla so I could be wrong and I am sure it doesn't match up with private server min/maxing.  Distilled wisdom I viewed as pointless because most fights your mana regen mattered more than your max mana and between downranking and interrupting overheals you very rarely pushed your mana to the limit.  The only fights I actually had issues with mana were dispel magic heavy fights (chromaggus surprisingly, was horde so no cleanse bots).  Mana pots + demonic runes I always carried but past MC I almost never used (see again mana conservation).  Mageblood + mana oil I both used always.  Again anything that buffed int/sta/spirit I rarely used since for stamina that means i need to be taking significant unavoidable aoe dmg, and int means I need to be spamming stronger heals than usual for a long period of time (enraged Huhu, solo healing tank on Nef while everyone else is feared,etc)  So it wont hurt to have them but it will hardly make any impact on your healing performance.
---
Hunter I agree with not having as many consumables as long as you dont count ammo and you are not doing that melee joust in your rotation.  Otherwise as a rogue you need a laundry list of any consumable that buffs sta, agi, str, ap, crit, dmg.  So basically almost everything plus any health pot/protection pots.
---
I guess we just disagree though which is fine as everyone gets to choose what they bring in the context of their guilds requirements.
---
You could change the Taskbar in precious versions of windows, explorer and the start menu (afaik the only way to change these(explorer + start menu) now is with classic shell that runs on top of windows). You could also choose which updates to install before even installing them. So no, you don't have more customization in the current windows version. Having a custom interactive wallpaper is a poor trade off for losing the previously mentioned "features".
---
They used to have an application (beta profiler or something) that you have to download for your OS for them to detect the hardware. Nowadays I wouldn't be surprised if they receive that data from Battle.net desktop app
---
Faction banners!
---
it required a third party app called stardock that sucked resources like a mofo
---
Lmao awesome. I had the same skins when I was teenager back then! Totally forgot about this.
---
As far as I know Firefox is currently the fastest browser, generally it is better than Chrome, but most people are used to Chrome at the moment because it used to be better.
---
 I think its laughable that folk think Naxx will be "on farm for months". The gear progression needed for naxx is huge. The full 40 man raid will need to be in full T2/T2.5, to give Naxx ago, without having it anywhere close to "farm". 
---
I doubt many guilds will have Naxx on Farm in less than 2-3 yrs. Yes, hardcore raiding guilds may....just may have cleared naxx. But in vanilla wow, Naxx was released 18mths after release and 7 mths before tBC was released, and very few guilds had actually killed Kel'Thuzad. None had Naxx on farm status, it still took a lot of consumables and well geared players to raid Naxx.
---
I'm in a similar boat. I work 3rd shift on the east coast. And by the time raids start in NA I'm leaving for work. So I found a guild in EU and I'll be playing with our brethren across the pond.
---
Totally agree, folk are massively underestimating what it takes to down bosses in naxx.
---
It's fairly understandable to know who Kungen is, but not the others if you played early wow and haven't kept up with the scene.
---
Thanks, that makes sense.
---
Stunning, Can I also get a PM about details such as price?
---
Crossroads &amp; STV
---
Under karazan is still possible To visit at the same time u can see old zulgurub
---
Saved.
---
Did I tell him he should play a specific class?
---
Every server is gonna have a streamer, every faction, hell even every guild is gonna have a streamer, its not really anything you can do about it. I get the hand full big ones you might want to stay away from, but streamers in general and their drama you don't get to escape.  
---
At least that's my thoughts on it. Oh and btw non of the BIG streamers would ever tell what server they were gonna play on. There is a lot of people that wants to steal character/guild names from them.
---
Bloodfury&gt; zerking for DPS In pve, especially when using daggers
---
I got a little question regarding professions for a paladin.
---
In the end, I will probably be Herb/Alch but...
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
While leveling and at 60, might it be smart to go herb/tailor just because tailoring will help me with good healing cloth gear? When I'm done I could just reroll tailoring to alch.
---
Thanks in advance
---
From a purely cosmetic/feel-y standpoint, I favour (female) Orcs. Their animations fit rogues all-around: The run, the strikes and finishers, the sneaking. Femtrolls have a nice sneak animation, but their finisher animation lacks power for me.
---
Femtrolls also have only one not perpetually angry face (yeah, the cutefase), while Orcs have a few more options to choose from.
---
Troll rogues will probably the least played combination, though, if that is of concern to you.
---
Personally, in case I decide to roll Horde, I am favouring Orc Rogue at the moment, but I will want a Troll as an alt of a different class somewhere down the line, because trolls are just all-around cool. On the other hand, both Troll Regeneration and Berserking are nifty for rogues, and since I don't PvP, Stun Resist is relatively low in value for me. By the Warchief, this *is* a difficult decision. Hm. How about having my female Orc be a Shaman, and the Rogue a troll? That could work, mon.
---
Well, I both agree and disagree with this.
---
Rogues have a few defensive options, and a few methods of escape. Paladins might be the safest class, but unless you bubble+HS then you have no way of escaping suddenly overwhelming odds.  Rogues can always fall back on vanish + sprint.
---
Unpopular opinion but I'm planning to avoid reddit servers. With retail it seemed to attract the wrong type of people.
---
I don't see myself having too much trouble though as I'll be rolling pvp.
---
rogues are pretty good because they can pickpocket farm dungeon.
---
warlocks can solo bosses in mara to get a nice chunk of cash
---
hunters can do the same as locks and also do solo dm tribute runs thanks to feign death
---
most classes with AoE spells can farm dm east lashers
---
mages are the kings of dm east farming though, and the kings of aoe farming in general. a lot of people will roll a mage purely so they can feed gold to any other toons down the line.
---
for professions pretty much everything can make money but the standout to me would be herbalism/alchemy for pure money making.
---
Best Battlefield game along with 1942. Fucking loved those games!
---
paladins can heal and are self sufficient, rogues cannot.
---
Interdasted. Please PM :)
---
Use. Rainmeter.
---
It's the classic way! 300ms is pretty normal latency for 2005 standards, atleast was for me.
---
Interdasted :) Please PM!
---
I see. Thank you very much for the insight!
---
It's not an exploit though, never was and never has been.
---
432 Pages !!!
---
Did you make this thread just to tell people they are wrong if they disagree with you?
---
Might I suggest a PVE server
---
No, I think you worded it properly, and I agree with that point.
---
I just felt it was necessary to point out that the added survivability comes at the cost of not being able to tuck your tail and run as well as a rogue :p
---
Eh, if they want to reintroduce a "Classic CE", so more people can display those pets on Clasic servers, no skin of my back. The only thing that would disappoint me was if the people who *own* a CE of original WoW would *not* have those pets available on Classic servers. That would just come across as petty, mean and greedy.
---
Blizzard support in general is no nonsense and efficient. Forgot my password, changed my phone number and moved to a new place while my mail acccount got hacked, blizz fixed all of it in like 10 minutes.
---
This is one thing they've always had and hopefully will always have. Top tier customer support
---
One More Try represent
---
&gt;You could change the Taskbar in precious versions of windows, explorer and the start menu
---
You can also do that in win 10. As for the updates, that has nothing to do with customization. It sucks, but it's not relevant to this discussion.
---
&gt;with classic shell that runs on top of windows
---
You mean like in win xp you had to run poorly optimized third party software as well?
---
&gt;So no, you don't have more customization in the current windows version. 
---
So yes, you do. You might not be aware of them, but there are many more ways now than in xp. Try to look up some of the crazy shit people do with rainmeter - some of it does not even *look* like windows, the taskbar is completely redesigned. and the wallpaper is animated to interact with the OS so things like date or the weather is an *active* part of a wallpaper. Xp is not even in the same *league* as win 10.
---
Yes, there will be RP servers.
---
RP-PvE will happen, RP-PvP is unlikely.
---
Hopefully multi-boxing will be banned.
---
On release day I took the zeppelin from Orgrimmar to Undercity on my tauren druid (I wanted to try leveling in Silverpine Forest because Barrens was too full). The moment I arrived I saw an absolute shitload of Forsaken coming up the tower to get to the promised land (Barrens).
---
Silverpine Forest was pretty much empty. It had a reputation of being a shitty zone (especially in comparison to Barrens) but it ended up being much better because not every mob was permanently camped by literally dozens of players.
---
This is what peak performance looks like in 360p
---
It's no different to selling an enchantment. They have the "pattern" (gear), to be able to carry someone who can't pull their weight. They sell the service to someone with gold. BUying gear won't make people good at the game, and they're still going to get dunked on by everyone when they don't dismiss their pet for a jump and wipe groups etc.
---
As a person who is unsure if they want to roll alliance or horde, and is also unsure of what my first main class will be i will use the beya time to try out diffrent classes and find the one i want to play
---
As someone that used to be in that guild and was in it for years, that's exactly how it is.
---
LET ME IN
---
It is pretty easy.  
---
Pick a PVP server.  
---
Asmongold would not risk to get camped on streaming and get trolled so he will choose a PvE server for sure, hence why PVP servers are the choice.
---
Would love to be able to join Argent Dawn-EU again, with the hope that previous friends/guildies would have the same idea. That said, it's a new adventure, even if I remake my old characters with names etc.  
---
If anyone out there reads this:  
---
My characters are Sterm (Human Warrior) and Sorten (Human Warlock of Affliction)
---
Love the guide, I could never use a guide like this for my main, but for leveling alts i'm sure I'll lean on it. Thanks for all your work.
---
Also, welcome back Hakurai, Hope you stay active, always loved your videos from BDO.
---
Jesus, Teamspeak takes me back to my UT99 days.
---
If they decide to do a closed beta akin to Hearthstone's closed beta with its beta keys given out by streamers, this subreddit might quickly become the most hostile place on the internet.
---
The amount of people begging for closed beta keys on /r/hearthstone was so high that if you sorted by "New" you'd only see soon-deleted threads begging for a key in varying desperation. People on Twitch would say they were giving out a single beta key to followers via raffle then tell their sudden, rabid crowd that "they'll give out the beta key soon!" for 30-60 minutes.
---
not true, I played as a mage on everyone, even at the start with 8k-12k the first week, rush to 23... get wetlands icecle staff, and just grab pulls of 3-4 melee at a time.. you can AoE anywhere, people just know those popular spots, but there are dozens and dozens that hardly anyone visits.
---
well yeah, that's +1 to a rogue, but you still gotta sit and eat after every pull while the paladin can just throw a heal on and keep on truckin'.
---
I assume you are talking about selling for anything other than in-game currency right?
---
Otherwise I cannot agree with you, if someone is willing to pay X amount of in-game currency for a service rendered to them in-game they should be able to.
---
Although that's not exactly the same thing. Most big streamers attract sycophants who treat the streamer like some kind of god that must be defended against any blasphemy.
---
The Forsen Bajs are more like a benevolent cancer. They'll break the game in all sorts of hilarious ways while acting like complete idiots, but so far in other games it has usually been an improvement over the regular gameplay loop.
---
I asked you before but you never answered if you could change the Taskbar with rainmeter or explorer. And if you ask me the best os to date Ms created still is win7. Both in terms of customization and privacy, and yes being able to change how updates behave is customiztion. I guess you only care about rainmeter, which is not the answer or solution  to Microsofts design decisions. Unlike you I do not prefer to cluster fuck my desktop with widgets :)
---
yes :)
---
Why rip? Everybody I know is still using it. Best browser imho.
---
We have so many "what class will you play" charts now, someone should make a chart over the deviation of all those charts.
---
nope, just specualtions all around.
---
But wouldn't those 100 would-be gankers first have to go through the 200 fanbois protecting him?
---
Thank you. Rogue/lock/priest are the classes im currently divided on. Atleast two of them can make some good dough then. I think ill go herb alchemy as you suggested.
---
It will take away the interaction of having to talk to people and if it is an auto-match feature you could be auto-matched with a known toxic player or Ninja.
---
No thanks.
---
Elwynn and Duskwood. Just amazing.
---
*DM
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see a bunch of hunters forming a dedicated Flare squad to unstealth rogues before they can get to Asmongold.
---
You're absolutely right, but I still rank it as my top most nostalgia area in WoW. I think it represented the full potential of the world. You're slowly leaving the security of your home city and entering this huge world full of different dangerous places. The transition from Elwynn to Westfall is so fuckin nostalgic. More than any other.
---
I think most of it will be done over discord and the like these days tbh
---
no
---
In Wrath, mage could use "spellsteal" to gain a buff from the mobs in Naxx and solo entire wing there. Not only was it fixed but the mage was banned.
---
It really is completely arbitrary and there is no rhyme or reason to what is exploit, what is not, and what even is bannable..
---
STV
---
Yes, vanilla WoW, back inn 2005 and 2006. No idea why I am being downvoted, just for having a different experience than other people.
---
We can now open the gates and go home.
---
I wonder why nobody said Azshara till now... It's one of the most iconic zones with it's Fall-like charme.
---
priests can farm dmeast lashers with holy nova too.
---
Ashenvale was always my favorite zone, it was the first time I experienced world Pvp, and it just always seemed so mystical to me. You could finally feel the horde vs alliance conflict, and of course blackfathom deeps
---
Hm, probably Elwynn, or walking through Loch Modan to Wetlands.  
---
But really, it is all nostalgic. The Tram as well. Nothing really sits much above the rest. I can't wait come home.
---
Over 3 hours is generally not fast anymore. Pally /warrior can push sub 2 hour 1-10 runs. Warriors suck to level, don't be a hard ass. Unless you are lucky or fortunate enough to be given green  2H weapons
---
In terms of making hold, how does dmeast stand in comparsion to the dungeons farming of the lock?
---
&gt;I asked you before but you never answered if you could change the Taskbar with rainmeter or explorer
---
Well, technically you didn't really ask a question, you made a statement with a question mark. I did not understand that was actually a question for me, I thought it was either a retorical sarcastic question or a statement of a few things, which was weird as it kind of contradicted your later comment.
---
&gt;And if you ask me the best os to date Ms created still is win7
---
It's fine if you *prefered* that, but that does not change whether or not win 10 can be customized more.
---
&gt; I guess you only care about rainmeter, which is not the answer or solution to Microsofts design decisions. Unlike you I do not prefer to cluster fuck my desktop with widgets
---
Not really, I don't use rainmeter myself because I like a much cleaner look (like win 10 allows as standard). You seem to take this quite personally, but I'm simply stating the fact that you still have more customization in win 10. You somehow seems to argue that earlier versions had more by ignoring most of what win 10 can do just because *you* don't like it. This does not mean win 10 has less customization, it means you just prefer something else. This is not something subjective. You can't just not count widgets and rainmeter because *you* dislike it - it is still customization.
---
But hey, who need facts or logic - I guess it is easier to just assume things and act smug, right?
---
I hear in Classic that you need to buy weapon skills in different major cities at level 10? Also that they are expensive. As for example a human paladin you can only use maces at the start. How do you decide when to buy weapon skills and which to prioritize?
---
After months of doubt, I finally decided to go with UD Warlock. Now my friends suddenly decided to roll Alliance. Dwarf paladin it is then...
---
deviate hides, but they will start to tank in price after a while so you gotta capitalise.
---
certain recipes from vendors which have spawn timers are also good to camp and mass purchase, waiting for later phases to sell.
---
Sorry but my post was not about classes or warlock vs Paladin. That quote was from one of those streamers whining after losing a dual during classic demo.
---
Where is the porn folder?
---
Pre-BIS is damaged optimized. In PVP you want more survivability, more STA.
---
All the good trash talk took place on realm IRC channels
---
who knows, not really relevant to classic wow though since it's going to be a monthly sub thing not a game copy purchase.
---
Ah I see. Makes sense. IIRC, there was a destruction talent that gave a chance to stun, so that could work
---
I’ve sat in a couple dxracers and they were ok. Def like the secret lab much better but idk if it would be worth swapping since you already have a Dx.
---
I think it's more likely we'll see unofficial Discords and maybe unofficial forums or subreddits (but with Discord being the main hub of activity) rather than official forums.
---
The early 2000s were still in the heydey of the internet message board. These days they've fallen from prominence.
---
Having been to a few game studios for playtesting pre-release, these people 100% signed a massive fuck-off sized NDA about everything they saw. The last one I signed was about 20 pages long and covered specifically what I could talk about. I was also told that I could talk "generally" about what happened, whether I enjoyed it etc but no specifics.
---
It's almost certain they signed this NDA which stated that they could "hype" the beta, without releasing any actual dates.
---
Just imagine  6,5 - 7 feet tall 400 lbs orc sneaking in the shadows  trying to sneak behind your back lol, look so silly and funny. I would never choose and orc male rogue. just my opinion.
---
Yeah, Yeah... But it's kinda hard to keep the motivation on top when you know it will all be over in a month or two. 😁 Didn't discover pservers until just recently, and I'm using them as prooving grounds, eagerly awaiting the release of the official classic servers.
---
Cleaner version? And you still prefer 10 over 7? I'm sorry but you just lost all credibility with such a   ignorant statement. Have you taken a good look at the start menu in default win 10? Or all the bloatware that the os comes with? And you are talking about facts, good grief...
---
400 lbs is 181.6 kg
---
it's fine once you get the hang of it. you have to use your weapon throw to pull mobs out from a pack. you rarely ever use stealth to open on targets to be honest and i think that's where a lot of rogues fail, because they open with stealth and then get swarmed by other mobs that patrol and aggro.
---
I have a secretlab omega too and love it. It’s really comfortable and has some good adjustment options. Lumbar pillow is really comfortable too.
---
I'd take this list with a grain of salt there are items that won't be available in phase 1.
---
 Flarecore Leggings  [https://itemization.info/item/19165](https://itemization.info/item/19165) were added in patch 1.6 so probably phase 3.
---
This is almost certainly correct.
---
Blizzard will say "here you go, you can do the 1-20 or 1-30 experience and let us know how it goes". It's quite likely we'll see the ability to create level 30-60 characters towards the end of the beta to test the last few zones.
---
What they _won't_ do is just say "hey, here's the _entire game_ for you to test, have at it!".
---
I watched the video version of this guide and I was blown away by the detail and effort you put into it. Easily the best alliance leveling guide (especially for human warriors) that I've seen so far.
---
&gt; Youve never heard of Mikepreachwow?
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; He does Youtube and Twitch and has been giving Blizz loads of shit since WoD for design choices. He pretty much praises raiding and M+ but shits on everything else.
---
&gt; He also does a stream and youtube series called Dramatime where he reads drama that happened over WoW and other MMOS, a lot are from Vanilla-WOTLK era.
---
Because it wouldn't be fast if the shaman rests every other pull for mana
---
Amazing. Thanks.
---
Farm Cobalt Mageweavers in Mazthoril, Winterspring. They drop the pattern for Robes of Winter Night. They will be pre-BiS until you're able to get your hands on Robes of the Archmage.

Weirdly I thought exactly the same!

FUCK! I had this once upon a time. Does it work on Windows 10?

---
I made it before Itemization blue post, so you need to adapt it a bit. 
---
It sacrifices a lot of AP to get STA. You should reach about 4000 HP with it, it's the bare minimum for early PVP imo.
---
Anyway the tier 1 gives a bit more STA and massive load of AP and crit compared to any blue items you can gather, it's really worth it to find a raid spot as a hunter !
---
&gt; There is a huge demand for BC classic
---
There is not much players in TBC servers, relative to vanilla. They're only making Classic because how huge it is on pservers, the same cannot be said for TBC at all.
---

They will more or less force people to interact

MS never offered much first-party customization in the first place. Windowblinds still lets you do [crazy stuff](https://skins18.wincustomize.com/43/21/4321310/1/9088/preview-1-9088.jpg).
---
Best of luck dude
---
Where's Athene now ? Haven't heart about him since those days.
---
not sure, though I'd say a warlock could farm faster than a priest doing dm: east lashers.
---
You got a point, but I'm not sure such a team would take so much damages. To be tested !
---
Alright so I see a ton of people giving high praise about this guide and honestly I'm quite jealous. I only play Horde and although Joanna does have a Horde Hunter guide I play Warrior. Unfortunately even if I somehow convinced myself to play Alliance my friends would never go for it.. so I'm hopeful someone will craft a guide if this caliber on a Horde Warrior.
---
I still plan on watching this entire guide however!!
---
I remember using this same WoW skin around 2007-2009 too.  
---
2007... when WoW wasn't shit yet and when Firefox wasn't shit yet too.. xD
---
Best program ever made
---
Could be true, I just can't see somebody like Asmongold playing on any other account then his main, he would lose his gear, transmog, mounts, pets, toys, bank, guild. Pretty sure he just doesn't stream if doesn't wanna be bothered in WoW.
---
Not since version 4.x when it started its journey to become a Chrome clone and version 69 Quantum when it became a full-fledged Chrome clone, but like a crippled Chrome clone that has piss poor website support.
---
Thank you very much for answering.
---
One more thing. Is it possible to have a spammable macro for Ice Block/AoE spells? I tried it on the private servers and wasn't able to make it work.
---
Like:
---
/cast !Ice Block    *(makes it so the second or more presses of the Ice Block keybind don't cancelaura the Ice Block)*
---
or
---
/cast !Blizzard *(makes it so the "toggle" for placing an AoE spell doesn't disappear when pressed for the second time)*
---
or even something like
---
/cast [@cursor] !Blizzard 
---
I know [@cursor] was added only recently (Legion?) so I don't expect it to work but I didn't catch it in the list of removed things.
---
Sorry to bother you again.
---
Yeah, im pretty hardcore at times, but FFS im not going to follow any stupid guides. Done numerous levelups before, so got some kind of idea what to do. Even if im not efficient, i will just grind more. Its not uncommon for me to hit 60 without doing much in winter/wpl/epl/(silithus).
---
Best guide of all. Go to a quest hub. Put your HS to that town. Take all quests and go complete all of them that are in the same general area. Kill everything that you come across that is in your xp range. Ill just brute force the "working" majority (if i dont have holidays left).
---
MC gear is mostly so horrible that you dont miss much if you start raiding bit later. The real endgame is AQ40/NAXX.
---
I'm very excited for this. Especially on a pvp server. It was the one connection to the opposite faction and was always cool when you got called out for owning someone or when there was juicy drama. Hopefully the discord aspect wont diminish the use of the forums
---
Not faster than Chrome and the only thing superior about it is the **about:config** page. Other than that it's a piece of shit compared to Chrome. Considering how with each version they limit customization more and more, I won't be surprised if in a couple of year Chrome has more customization than Firefox, which at this point will have less user market share around the world than that piece of shit Vivaldi. xD

**&lt;Credendum&gt;** **EU \[PvP\] | Alliance**
---
*Are  you from Norway? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children?  Career? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious  guild without any obligations.*
---
**Guild Information:**  Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who’ve  matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities.  Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids,  going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your  microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept.  Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other  way around. It doesn’t matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week,  there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be  hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature  individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We  probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the  kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace  that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members.  There will also be a signifcant amount of PvP with premade guild groups.  Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.
---
**What we expect from our members:**  In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want  it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more  "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully  prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected  to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if  you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like  Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.  
---
**Officers (Class / Raidleaders)**: Will be chosen as we go along based on interest, activity and capability.  
---

I have two that stand out strongest in my memory, and I'm sad I'll never have that youthful ignorance ever again. I'd love to play WoW over again with no memory of it.
---
The first one was reaching Dolonaar for the first time. Or I think it's Dolonaar: the first questing village in Teldrassil outside the level 1 starting zone.
---
First village I ever arrived at without spawning directly in it and without knowing what was going on as a result. Me as a level like 4 or 5 or whatever you were at that point, seeing the first load of players significantly ahead of me. I remember seeing someone run past in what I know now is the basic first armour set for Leatherworkers, and thinking he looked *so put together* and his gear must be awesome as a result, compared to my shitty hodge-podge of mismatched rags.
---
The second memory is Ashenvale, as it was my first experience of open world PvP (on a PvP server). The Astranaar-Splintertree Post war of attrition (TM-SS's lesser-known cousin!), fighting and tracking people through the forest (STV's lesser-known cousin!), and counter-raids into the Barrens. It got me hooked on WPvP and it remains by far my favourite aspect of WoW and what I most look forward to experiencing again in Classic.
---
Lastly, not so much a single area, but another memory I clearly remember and want to share: the first time I ever made the trip from Auberdine to Ironforge. I'd been told how to do it, and off I went. I remember trying to dodge the Level ?? mobs running through the Wetlands, I remember running through Loch Modan and stopping there briefly to repair and being something of a local event: I got the game at launch so all the people questing there at the time hadn't seen a Night Elf player before. I remember running up the mountain pass into Dun Morogh and being amazed at how big the game world was and how awesome the many different types of scenery were, I had a real sense of ascending up into the mountain stronghold of the Dwarven people, going up the mountain passes on a quest of my own making. I remember seeing the gates of Ironforge for the first time and how amazing it was.

FOR THE HORDE
---
The real MVP program here is MSN, the good old days
---
Changing factions on "FREEEESH" does mostly the same. But i think ill cut down gaming on private servers for bit pre-launch.
---
Damn dude. UD lock is such a great choice too. Come roll with me and my homies as we know how to pick the right faction :)
---
&gt;Cleaner version? And you still prefer 10 over 7? I'm sorry but you just lost all credibility with such a ignorant statement.
---
You just assume how I use my PC and you call *me* ignorant?
---
&gt;Have you taken a good look at the start menu in default win 10? Or all the bloatware that the os comes with?
---
I do not *use* the start menu. It does not matter how it looks, it does not impact me in the slightest. I have all my software neatly organized and easy to access without the start menu. I have used this method across many versions of windows and it is just my preferred way. Win 10 looks cleaner and more minimalistic in the taskbar.
---
&gt;Ever tried to uninstall all the Xbox overlay apps? And you are talking about facts, good grief...
---
Why yes I have - I don't have any Xbox bloat on my computer. Besides, this has literally nothing to do with facts - I did not say anything that is wrong. I'm starting to really question your intelligence (more so than I already did when you somehow managed to not know the difference between a statement and a question). You seems to just throw words around to try and be sassy.
---
is this updated for the final item progression?

---
i usually buy the training when i receive a big enough upgrade that deviates from my current list of weapons i can already equip.
---
For me it's Stonetalon peak. I was playing my first char, a nelf druid, and I was questing/grinding/exploring w/e you did in the game as a 12year old. So I was running through Stonetalon and mobs got higher level the higher I went up the peak. So my stealthy catform helped me a lot here, and all of a sudden I got to the top and there it was this green filled place with fellow druid and night elves who were all friendly to me.
---
Same. Thinking of going shaman and havent played one i ages ( well got like a level 5 on private server ). So need to refresh some aspects ...

* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**

Feel free to ask questions in the comments or come and join our Discord - https://discord.gg/JDHrnU3

---
you could possibly do that, but i'd prefer goign herb/skinning for that extra cash, then dropping skinning.
---
Remember shaman is horde only.  If you combine shaman and paladin it's the top category.  
---
Windfury was pretty heavily nerfed by the time 1.12 rolled around (could no longer proc on itself and the AP bonus was reduced.
---
Def go shaman
---
This exact addon already exists on private servers, it's called [vQueue](https://github.com/christoabrown/vQueue).
---
It is functionally the same as reading chat to find a group and then messaging someone, but it organizes everything in a single window to make things easier.
---
If you get added to a group with a player you don't want to play with, you still have the option to leave the group, exactly as if you had joined a group without vQueue.
---
I honestly have no idea what Asmongold is trying to say in this video. How would finding groups through Discord be more in spirit of the game than finding groups through an addon? Does he really think that an addon would have the power to invite players cross-server and teleport everyone to the dungeon? What exactly is his problem with vQueue? He never really explains it.
---
I tanked dungeons with 2 warriors and an enhanced shaman and I can confirm it was op as fuck. I ended up using a 2h too because stuff was dying so fast. This was from lvl 30-40 dungeons so obviously higher level is going to differ
---
:D
---
You seem to be ignoring that full world buffs and consumes put someone in prebis ahead of someone who is T2.5 but not using those buffs and consumes.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/)
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

We are prepared for this and hope to revive it :)
---
A text version, you are truly a hero.
---
Who we are: &lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual. We are serious about clearing content but can’t dedicated our lives to playing all day any more. We want people who are serious, on time, and want to clear content in a timely manner. This means when we raid at a certain time we are all in the raid at that time. Not all logging on at the time.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. For three hours a night. Currently looking at Tuesday and Thursday 7/8-10/11 EST. For loot we run Loot Council. We prioritize giving loot to people who are actively trying to help the guild. This includes showing up to raids on time, attend raids regularly, help other guild members to get them raid ready, contribute items to the guild, listen to directions, etc.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. You can check what we are looking for on our website linked below.
---
If you have any questions you can message me on discord @ frail_#3482
---
You can find our app at: https://boaf.enjin.com/
---
There a big difference in time zones across oceanic so that’ll help. I’m in the similar position that daytime mon - fri is my free time for raiding.
---
The way any add-on that doesn't exist yet since classic isnt out works on a PServer with old APIs is not indicative of how an add-on that hasn't been created yet will work in classic.
---
No automation.
---
Great for him. But still a bad guide.
---
Damn, that’s respectable
---
Rogues can’t learn swords until level 10 in Vanilla/Classic.
---
Can you PM me purchase details please mate, amazing work!
---
Before it became windows live messenger even.
---
I did not assume anything, it's just fact that win 10  is filled with bloatware that makes the start menu a horrid cluster fuck. Yes you do because you cannot uninstall it all, which makes you a dirty lier since it's integrated into the os itself. How does the fact that win 10 is filled with bloatware that spills over the gui had nothing to do with facts? You been doing too much shrooms or something?
---
playng during night/morning is one option, if one has the possibility.
---
It's awful...
---
... I love it
---
**[NA][Alliance][PVE with a dash of PVP]**
---
**Semi-hardcore player, with a hardcore mentality, looking for a guild**
---
**Other/misc details:** 
---
* Warrior (DPS preferred)
---
* 30 years old, work a 9-5 job, can raid in the evenings
---
* Eastern (EST) specifically
---
* Primarily a PVE player however I do love PVP as well. I made it to rank 10 in the original rank 14 grind and hit 2400 in Legion.
---
* Was a hardcore raider from the very beginning days of Molten Core and cleared everything to Sapphiron in Naxx.
---
For now, I can really only commit to semi-hardcore playtime. I would absolutely love to go hardcore but sadly I am no longer in highschool and have other obligations. While playtime may have suffered a bit I have maintained my hardcore mindset over the years and it has never waned to this day. I still raid even now. Full heroic BoD and CoS cleared for current content (Mythic doesn't interest me much due to the current state of the game), and I have raided in other games such as Final Fantasy XIV.
---
I can be reached here on reddit or via discord @ Arte#4321
---
Thank you.
---
The thing about Westfall is, that it really grounds the game. It actually makes the game seem lived in. It seems peaceful, but there are roving bandits around. I wish more MMORPGs focused on making zones like this, it really strengthens the immersion.
---
Damn as a German these unfortunately do not really work :(
---
And what about playing and streaming with a delay, like an hour or more ?
---
I would be careful in regards to what secondary profession you chose. Not all go well with investment banking. With Herbalism you can create those hard blunts that help you with the harsh realities of Stromwind action house. You will get lots of suspicious looks from engineers so don't bother taking the same secondary professions like mining. Skinning is a good choice because you usually skin people of their money but with this you will be able to also skin animals of their pelts.
---
If the add-on is global and allows you to find people from inside a dungeon rather than having to go back to town then no.
---
You'd get people kicking others for being new and a little slower in a 5 man just because you wouldn't need to run back to town to find a replacement.
---
Being global completely changes the dynamic.
---
I remember feeling so proud i made my account there in 2005 :D
---
Yea they should give us the realm names... That way we can create communities in advance and avoid communities we don't want to have on our realms,such as streamer realms, realms with huge population of one nation etc...
---
Westfall.
---
The place where your toon get high enough level to get the feel of identity
---
Oh I, by no means, meant it was "fast" in the speedrunning-community sense fast. I just meant that it was a perfectly viable time to reach, without practice.
---
But you are given green 2H weapons. You get the Axe of Orgrimmar at level 14, and from there it's not too bad.
---
Nothing confirmed - multiple streamers hinting at a possible announcement about beta this week.
---
I want my panda.
---
You could ask in the thread everyone was talking about it in? Why make a thread to ask about another thread?
---
If its a "gaming chair" is anywhere from fucking horrible to almost as good as any office chair.
---
There is no confirmed date.
---
I did not know they made a battlefield Vietnam.
---
@MrGMYT no idea maybe he is just cockteasing
---
&gt;That's what I was thinking. Someone will surely do this.
---
What is it that you actually want it to do?
---
For the really famous streamers, just knowing charakter name and realm will be enough. Its easy to find them via /who
---
How do you retrieve an account?
---
Because i scrolled around here and i could not see it, i apologize
---
Are the level 100 bosts automatic?
---
I did Horde, so I have limited experience with Goretusks, however, I did Zhevras, Raptors and Plainstriders all roughly my level and did not have a problem, in the slightest. I could usually chain one or two mobs without any regen to preserve rage. Young Goretusks at level 12 (which you should be upon entering Westfall) shouldn't be a huge issue if you hamstring kite.
---
Also: gear. Obviously you have to manage gear. That's why I said I did not have any prior chars on the server, no feeding.
---
Don't mention the war
---
Okay. And. So? If some streamer gets a bunch of free shit from suck ups it shouldn't really upset anyone. They got a rare thing. So? Worst case scenario is that they get to be the Scarab Lord. The effort they need to get there is so large that really anyone who puts in the work deserves it.
---
If they're griefing the streamer, so what? The streamer is getting a rough time. Anyone at any time on PVP world's can decide to make things a living hell. It's part of the game. At worst, if leveling in that area is miserable: go somewhere else for a while.
---
It's such a silly thing to care about. At most it would cause as much of a minor inconvenience as a guild that decides 'fuck it, were fucking up Booty Bay today' for fun.
---
Well that's not really true, vQueue is a very simple addon and the functionality will be able to be replicated easily within any addon framework.
---
What automation are you referring to? Again, addons don't have the power to invite people cross-server or teleport them to a dungeon. If you believe that, this conversation may not be for you.
---
vQueue doesn't really automate anything, it just takes information that's already available in the game and organizes it within a window to make it easier for the player to navigate.
---
I'm not arguing in favor or against the addon, but it will absolutely exist in Classic, and there really isn't much that Blizzard can do to remove it. And like Asmongold mentions, even if they were able to remove it, players would just do the same thing through an external application like Discord. Asmongold thinks this is better for some reason, but players using an external tool to find groups as opposed to something in-game is definitely more opposed to the spirit of the game.
---
There's just so many bigger things to gamer rage against if you wish to gamer rage against something, than an addon that could have been created within the scope of vanilla WoW. There will be many addons that *could* have been created in 2005 that will be created for Classic WoW - you will never get "addon purity." If you really want to be a purist it would make more sense to crusade against 1.12 talents or no progressive itemization or any number of things they're actually changing.
---
Props to a nice guide and a warrior one to boot. How do you plan to work around Silithus not having a hub from the start though? The 57+ will turn out to be a bit of a grind fest.
---
# [H] &lt;MERCENARY&gt; U.S. East ||RP-PvP (crossed fingers)|| 
---
**Focus:** Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, lowlifes and no-lifes
---
**Schedule:** Raids currently planned every other week on Tuesday and Wednesday, 1930-2100 to take advantage of two lockouts, leaving the rest of the week free for PvP, farming, and general tomfoolery
---
**Loot:** DKP
---
**Leadership:** Last played retail at the start of Cata. Adults with no tolerance for wasting the group's time
---
**Membership:** We seek people with a goals-based mindset who want to be in Azeroth to escape all the real-world and political nonsense that seems to permeate every nook and cranny of our lives these days. We do not care one single little bit about your real-life situation or what you think about some elected official or who won sportball last night. Can you get out of Rain of Fire and cast your spells in something resembling the correct order? Nice, you're hired.

**Discord:** [**https://discord.gg/BDbpfjq**](https://discord.gg/BDbpfjq)
---
Come on in and give us a try. If we can't play the beta this week maybe we could do something in some other game!
---
I never mentioned casual gamers or any subset of gamers, you're the only one bringing that up. I only mentioned that it would be a factor for *some* players, probably not even a majority of players, but it is still a factor.
---
I think people who buy carries, whether with IRL money or in game gold should face punishment. 
---
To me it’s the principle of the matter and I’m willing to be heavy handed in the matter.
---
Fair point. I just hate the feeling of being 8 levels above my weapon.
---
Doubt it.  Though I would play shaman again for sentry totem god mode
---
Yep. When I think of Vanilla, first thing that comes into my mind is Westfall. After that, Darkshore.
---
No I think after I quit I let my friend use the account as an alt and he may have leveled him? I’m not exactly sure.
---
Mozilla and WOW.  Respect.
---
Yea im thinking of buying a "regular" office chair instead. Since its a more saturated market with higher competition. Would i get more "value" for my money?
---
Are you planning or know anyone who did this to horde? That would be really helpful.
---
Just keep in mind you won't be able to do it on the same realm. Blizzard announced this a while back that you will only be allowed one faction per realm.
---
It's pretty brutal. But it really depends on your playtime. You can get it done pretty fast if you can grind it for 8+ hours a day :P
---
Thank you, it was a brutal grind to Grand Marshal.
---
Launching games through xfire was the only way my stupid 12 year old self could get around my firewall back in the day
---
Lol what, Vietnam was by far the worst one.
---
lol yeah checked over and over again.
---
100 minions, even few not stunned is death. What locks do with smaller packs (DM) is voidwalker into rain into sack for shield into second rain and that must kill stuff or you die. Other option is outhealing the damage taken with multidoting.
---
There's even a part 2. Still really fun to play
---
I would argue that it takes longer. If each Winterfall Intrusion takes oyu 15 minutes on average, it will take you roughly 98 days by playing 2 hours a day, or 73,5 days if you play 3 hours a day. And I think the average of 15 minutes is a little too low compared to how it will be like on live servers with potential ganking, waiting for respawns etc.
---
And my axe... (please PM me)
---
Well... still no Brexit so guess they count as EU....? Why would they have their own community btw?
---
Okay but what about the fact that at start, on a fresh server, if you wanna follow a streamer, you need to have a character that is strong enough, right ?  
---
A level 2 character will not be able to follow a level 35 streamer questing in Desolace. If you wanna follow a streamer you need to be the same level as him, or higher. So yeah those streamers will have a lot of followers in the game at first, but as soon they will hit level 10 and will go on zones with higher level mobs, they will aggro eveything and die.
---
I am missing the ICQ icon on your desktop ;)
---
Not a good time for me to try and track down the exact statement, but IIRC previously Blizzard has stated their intention to forcibly break add-ons that -reproduce modern functionality". This sounds like it would fall under that banner to me.
---
Even with Full T2/T2.5 from BWL &amp; AQ40 - well geared players will need world buffs and consumables for Naxx. 
---
I have never heard of any raiders not using consumables, unless they totally overgear a place (like still farming MC for T2 legs for players, while doing BWL. ) Guilds can rush MC without consumables, if they are already at Chromaggus &amp; Nef in BWL.
---
What is the unit frame addon used in this video?
---
Almost as good as pet damage on orc warriors.
---
&gt;They have said that Classic is only a preservation project
---
I'd like a source for that one
---
I would love to see this return, however, I have my doubts. 
---
Server progression threads ftw.
---
Why does it say rp PvP on there
---
They need to announce it, i would be even happy with one day before launch.
---
Good bot
---
Nice. Hunter is very fun. The pet system is one of the coolest class features in all of Classic. Mastering the art of kiting is also especially satisfying.
---
I'm not sure how the hunter DPS issue will play out in Classic. I expect it'll make it harder to get a spot in the very best guilds, but they'll still need hunters. Average guilds will almost certainly favor competence and attendance over class and, to a lesser degree, spec.
---
In PvP, hunters are an absolute blast. Dwarves are cool and stoneform is nice, but, as you said, shadowmeld is so strong. I chose Night Elf because my brother told me to. I am glad he did. So many fun ways to use shadowmeld. It's ridiculous in WPvP especially.
---
Female troll horde BiS
---
generally speaking across most games there is an English speaking GB community, it has nothing to do with the economic/political functions of the EU, so not sure what Brexit has to do with it?
---
For me it was wetlands, trying to get my level 10 night elf to westfall and getting eaten by a crocodile.
---
Druids are pretty great 5-man tanks, probably my favorite. You can raid as a Feral tank, but its a bit more work but its super doable. There are usually only 1-3 Druids in a raid, so the slots available are limited, but Druids are often the least played class so its not super duper hard to find a raiding guild. Its not uncommon that Druids are the last thing a guild is seeking out.
---
A raid will take as many resto Shamans as it can basically. Totems are super powerful.
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For Classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be run on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.
---
**Current Activity**:  Currently, the guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content,shake the rust off, and to have fun with our newest teammates.  We also have guild Jackbox party nights each week for fun while we wait for classic.  If you are tired of waiting for classic but don't want to burn out leveling on a private server, come join a great community and start earning your core raiding spots now!
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up my Vice Guildleader **discord:  XvK#7740**
---

They specifically said they would disable addon functionality that would allow this type of thing.
---
That person has no frame of reference. He was out of line. He needs to shut the fuck up. 
---
100% of you will not understand this comment
---
Can you elaborate on the prinicpal? I don't see what is wrong with investing X amount of time to generate Y amount of gold in order to buy a service.
---
As long as everything is in-game it is part of the world economics, I am however interested in your reasoning for it because I am always open to change my mind. But you have not really explained the reason why people should be punished for spending their in-game gold, for in-game things/services, the way they see fit.
---
I did this mentality on a pserver around the initial announcement with Druid, now my class decision is even harder cause I found out I love Druid
---
The log-in screen
---
Same here, dude. Cant wait for you guys to show up at our capitol :)
---
Stv
---
The music eeeeeee eeeeeee eeeeeee
---
If you could make our schedule, 9pm -1 am EST Wed/Thur/Sun, shoot me a message, I'd love another old school raider on the team :)
---
I'm here /wave. Was based on Hellscream Alliance side in classic, will have to wait for the new server list to decide home this time around.
---
No. The only exp you’d get from skinning is from the killing of the animal.
---
I will be there!
---
No stabled pets are in limbo. Don’t forget though, they gain neither levels nor loyalty stabled.
---
Yeah, you are right about that.
---
I. Love. Feralas.
---
&gt; Would i get more "value" for my money?
---
Absolutely. First of all, you can ask yourself, why is a racing seat only used in racing cars if its the best most ergonomic chair design available ? Like all other gaming products, id say they have like 50% premium on the product just because its "gaming".
---
So you can buy same kind of quality for half the price or spend the same amount and get much better product.
---
I leveled a druid and shammy in vanilla. To be honest, I didnt get much past 5 mans on my druid. It was fun to level, but didnt enjoy tanking as much. 
---
I leveled a shammy as enhance, till I got to about 55, then went full resto. Loved it. Was great in raids as the raid healer, and also in BGs. I loved doing AV (especially AV weekends), and the healing was brilliant fun. I found I was quite hard to kill too, and would stick with a couple of well geared players and heal them. 
---
My main was a hunter back in vanilla till Cata, but this time I'm starting a Shammy as my main, and will level as ele till 55, then full resto.
---
Im not so hardcore to raid right when the right is out. Im kinda between casual and hardcore idk if theres a term
---
They have integrated the old game files into the current engine. So probably not.
---
But where do i start? How do i know what brand/site i should start looking at, there is always a million options and modells with these chairs... 😵
---
Troll is OK.  Their racial is pretty good, but it's not as good as it is on Mages where it's a straight 10-25% dps increase, or Warriors where the aspeed translates to rage to dump.  
---
Orc is great in PvE because Blood Fury is a great DPS cooldown, and they are really solid in PvP vs other rogues, as well as warriors / druids / paladins with their stun resist. 
---
UD WotF is really good in PvP and is decent in a couple PvE fights.
---
Stormx for PvP 👍

Yup, I'm in Scotland. I played since 2004-2012 (played on US servers first with my brother who lived over there). Then rerolled in 2006 on the EU servers. 
---
Cant wait for classic.
---
I heard leveling as ench is easier tho. U can also heal if u have +intellect gear in your inventory. U might consider that
---
Never heard of any of these except Kungen and Josh. And Kungen I think doesn't stream, at least not a lot, and he's not that big anymore. Josh will go NA. There's also Anniefuchsia in Europe, who will also go NA. See that's the beautiful thing, all the big boys are in NA so the EU guys go out of their way to play on NA even if they live in Europe.
---
Just use Alenyas even better guide for alliance lol

Of course! Was based on Silvermoon in Classic, no idea where I'll end up this time.

&lt;Informal&gt; (alliance) NA - PvE server - Progressive - MORNING EST
---
INTRO: Welcome to Informal, This is a brand new guild being made from the ground up. With some old school management I hope to turn this off hours guild into one of the very best on the server. Pushing content all while having a great time doing it.
---
Guild EXPECTATIONS: I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave.
---
About me: I have been playing warcraft since vanilla and have had years of experience both in raid leading and in managing guilds. 
---
I hope you all are willing to take this journey with me and produce one hell of a guild.
---
SCHEDULE:
---
RAID TIMES - EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST
---
RAID DAYS - TBD (will know the exact days closer to release)
---
Discord https://discord.gg/Dzb9rj5
---
&lt;Stoked&gt; will be a hard core PVE focused raiding HORDE guild on PVE oceanic servers.
---
A number of people have contacted me about the guild but would prefer PVP servers. I would change with enough interest. Feel free to contact me.
---
**Main goals:** 
---
	To have fun enjoying wow classic.
---
	To push our class and raids to the limit.
---
	To clear all content efficiently.
---
	To clear Molten Core in week 4
---
**Raids Schedule:**
---
Progression raiding: up to 4 nights per week.
---
When content on farm: one to two nights per week.
---
Raid Nights: SUN/MON/TUES/THURS
---
Raid Times: GMT +10 (Times to be decided)
---
20 man raids will be on off nights or a night when no 40 man raids are scheduled. 
---
Example: 
---
Onyxia Sunday night, Molten core Monday night, Onyxia Thursday night
---
AQ40 Progression Sunday and Monday night, Molten Core and Blackwing lair Tuesday night, Chill 20man raids Thursday night.
---
**Member Expectations:**
---
	
---
Members are expected to be willing to learn their class and role. To be willing to change when needed and and become a better player. You do not have to have hard core raiding experience or Vanilla wow experience. These things are of course welcomed but not essential. Members need to behave in a mature, professional, team focused manner. I want to foster a fun-loving gaming environment where every member is important and not just a name on a roster.
---
**Loot System:**
---
TBA (possibly loot council/DKP hybrid. Will be decided closer to launch)
---
**Contacts:**
---
	http://stokedguild.com/
---
	https://discord.gg/tUfPHBB
---
	Planks#3257
---
Except most streamers tend to congregate on the same servers, so they won't be on all servers. Esfand, Staysafe, Tipsout, Josh, maybe Asmongold, maybe Soda, all gonna be on the same server.

Shaman
---
&gt; But seeing as paladins are only good for healing in vanilla
---
Found the guy who didn't actually play vanilla
---
Another Brit here. I was on Hellscream horde side but didn’t start till WOTLK.
---
&gt; I have never heard of any raiders not using consumables
---
That's true in the game now, played in 2019. But back in the day (2006) they did not use world buffs and consumables. For example here is video of warlock killing kel thuzad with zero buffs and consumables https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acb1rs0AC0A .
---
He didn't.
---
Free 20k too
---
life was good
---
We started getting regular updates after they laid off almost all of their CS &amp; CM staff which felt, to me, like nothing but damage control (since they fired the classic CM).  We haven't had a blue post since the 2nd which is more than normal if you discount feb/mar/apr/.  We haven't had a meaningful update since long before that though (I won't split hairs about how long though, since not everyone will agree on what "meaningful" means).
---
Xperl in my opinion.
---
Your English is perfectly understandable - I doubt you could say the same for my Russian however
---
no changes
---
Is it odd I still use this for certain situations?
---
Hillsbrad foothills for sure *Tarren Mill is under attack*
---
You asked why there is an EU-community but no Brit-community and I said those things aren’t mutualy excludable since GB=EU. Feel free to build a GB-community if you like or participate in one if there already is such. In the Classic-guild I’m in there are plenty of britts even though it’s a ”EU-guild”
---
Couldn’t have said it any better myself. Especially the part about endgame.
---
Everyone knows it but only few skilled people can actually pull it off in a somewhat efficient way. Most Hunters will horribly die tryin.
---
I doubt it will get nerfed since theres many other gold farm spots for other classes which they also have to nerf.
---
For some people, sure. That's why I made the point to mention personality. For me, beta is not enjoyable.
---
It's like... Having tons of great sex with a hottie in high school. And then... Not having sex for 15 years. A couple months before getting it on with the woman of your dreams would you get a hooker or would you wait? ;)
---
(Also, some people genuinely like helping test and finding bugs and those people I appreciate!!!)
---
But... It sounds like you're going to play it ;)
---
We all know you got the gear at the end of vanilla when the pre-TBC patch happened. Don't go trying to lie to us now.
---
I agree. I'm sure there will be addons that fulfil everything 1.12.1 ones did and more. Hell, there are even vanilla addons released in the last few years that do stuff we couldn't have dreamed on in vanilla (like having dot icons/timers built into nameplates)
---
I disagree on Perl classic being ugly though, i can think of many i found uglier/more out of place with the game. Pitbull, ElvUI, Luna to name of a few.
---
I guess it just comes down to how I view raiding, how I learned to raid, and the similar experiences the majority, and im willing to bet on the majority, of raiders have experienced. 
---
You join a guild, you put in the effort to adhere to a raid schedule, you clear the raid, and when RNG calls your guild leader hands you your well deserved loot. 
---
It’s like waiting in line. You queue in the line properly. Eventually you get to the end of it and you feel that much happier when you get your piece because not only do you have that piece, but you also have a shared experience that you can relate to other raids to and bond over. 
---
People that buy carries just skip this line. It’s not earned and is a hollow victory. It’s about the journey and not the destination. And I don’t view farming gold as putting in the effort. 
---
If I had to put a tldr it would be; buying a carry means you didnt earn your shit. 
---
There will be people that argue that all that matters is that they have the best end game gear and to that I say go play retail. Because taking shortcuts and mindlessly zerging for that purple you didnt earn is what retail has been about for years and that’s the exact opposite that we should be trying to achieve with classic wow.
---
I'm searching for the Winamp icon :)

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
In which pixel is your name located?
---
Thats when you make a horde rogue, outlevel them and just camp them in STVietnam
---
In the blizzcon panel it sounded very much like they would kill such an add-on.
---
Sick guide. Quick question though. Have you checked how much Darnassus reputation this gives? I dont know which version of the mount patch we are on for actual classic, and if we are on the first one, then i wanna get exalted with them before i hit 60.
---
Rip xfire
---
That's crazy! Rogue seems pretty good too. I wonder if the rationale was that since they don't get to regen mana, bump up hp regen with spirit or something.
---
Thanks a lot for providing numbers with your argument! A lot more convincing than "spirit good" :)
---
lol Winzip..........rip. I loved Winzip, took me FOREVER to go to winrar.
---
Dat a good choice mon'
---
Whats the addon that shows how much dmg your abilities will do
---
I've been the guy commenting on your vids, you're a God amongst men. Thank you for making this it must be a fuckload of work.
---
And another edge lord. These are the people you get to interact with on a PVP server. 
---
&gt; Hurr durr level 60s camping lowbie zones is legit fun! PVP is the best!
---
I guess your EU guild has many English speaking members then? If you take a look through the EU guilds recruiting on most boards they seem to be predominately single language speakers that aren't English. E.g Norwegian, SWE, FR.
---
GB maybe a part of the political/financial EU institution for now, but again that has nothing to do with playing online vidya that i can see...
---
English horde PvP here. There was always a lot of British on my old vanilla sever, think it’s just good old classic British reserve. Bet there’s thousands of us keeping quiet and refreshing Reddit
---
At the end of the day this is a video game and it's about having fun, pick the race you like the most. In BGs you have 5% increase dmg against druids too so thats neat since ur goal in BGs as a rogue is to kill the druid.
---
What were they playing? Wouldn't be a mage the most efficient gold farmer?
---
Waaaaah? Nooo... what gave you that idea xD
---
I think he's saying someone could make a new add-on that is just 1 button LFG, that auto searches/joins 5 people together in a party. The new API and what we will have in classic wow is stronger and similiar to mordern wow compared to old private server API.
---
I'm in an EU guild hoping they don't kick me out for brexit :D
---
Otherwise UK based but don't see a reason to go to a UK guild
---
There is a [MSN Messenger private server](https://escargot.log1p.xyz/)
---
Go full blue/green +fire dmg gear and pom pyro ppl for fun!

&lt;Summerlin&gt; Hardcore Raiding Guild
---
North American Horde
---
West Coast / PVP Realm
---
**Goals on launch:** We are now recruiting members with a hardcore mentality for Classic World of Warcraft. Our first goal is to level quickly and claim a World Top 5 Ragnaros, as such we are looking for people looking to level quickly and dive into end-game content as soon as possible. You should be confident in your ability to get to 60 in 4-5 days played.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Sunday-Thursday 6pm-Midnight PST, the amount of hours, as well as the time we raid, will be dependent on a number of factors. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with waking up early for new content releases, waking up at odd hours for world bosses, and being able to attend 20 man raids on off days.
---
**Requirements:** For long-term members we will have three primary requirements: Two raid-ready characters for split runs, Rank 10 PVP on your main raid character, 300 Engineering on all raid characters.
---
We will also require you to have one summoning alt for world bosses, and one additional level 35+ character for transmutes.
---
**How to Apply:** If you're looking for a hardcore guild and think that this might be the experience you are looking for go ahead and send in an application: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link
---
Also feel free to join our Discord: https://discord.gg/edxudZ
---
If you're not quite sure that you can be this dedicated to the game but still want to be competitive, feel free to send me a DM with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
Reporting in. I'm still looking for people to play with on release, so if anyone is in the same boat, let me know.
---
Planning on rolling Night Elf Druid.
---
Login to the website and go to character transfer for a list of all your available characters (and the realms they're on).
---
Having fun as a PoM Pyro mage when it's dmg optimized is quite fun though :D You'll die, but you'll see them big crits.
---
I kind of get what youre saying, but I think buying runs for gold should 100% be allowed. While I would never buy a run, some people might see that as their goal in the game. Make a bunch of gold and then hire more seasoned veterans to carry you through a raid/dungeon. 
---
The best part of classic/vanilla wow is everyone can play their own way, with their own goals, in their own time. As long as everything is earned in game,  I think it's fine.
---
Maybe rainmeter? Definitely google that. Idk if it's possible to customize windows 10 to this extent
---
What official customizations were there before? It was almost all third party and you can still do tons with third party. Even officially supported has more theme options than the (3?) presets XP shipped with.
---
I think [this](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2561) is the clip.
---
Not hard, just incredibly time consuming
---
Winterspring. Because I pissed people off by accident gathering a node.
---
Found a clip somewhat talking about it [here](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2561). We will have to see what Blizz considered harmful to the authentic experience.
---
That is exactly the clip I was thinking of, thank you
---
Didn’t Blizz say they would break any add ones like that?
---
Darkshore for me aswell. I leveled a crapton of nelves and always Darkshore. Its not practical though considering how long it is in actual length, top to bottom. BUT I LOVE IT.
---
Ok, go play with sodapoppin, i dont care.
---
Are there many english speakers? I just checked the recruitment threads and again the majority of the EU ones are Norway, SWE, FR etc
---
i was looking for this too!
---
It is probably in some video/audio interview because it's ungoogleable. The only thing I find when googling is people referring to it but not the original source. E.g.
---
&gt; What we know as of now is that Blizzard views classic WoW as a museum piece
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aw4jey/potential_changes_for_classic_wow/ehk0yyh/

Could a Rogue get away with a PvE/PvP mix spec that has a few talent points in the sub tree like 5/5 Camouflage, or would they have to simply pay up and respec?
---
Oh man, I am looking forward to everything.
---
One that stands out is Feralas. It is so green. It reminds me of the woods in the rural northeastern us in spring. I am also looking forward to the mechanical chicken quest.
---
Westfall holds a special place in my heart. It is where I first started to understand the game all those years ago. I remember grinding crabs and really getting comfortable with my character. I also like the Defias storyline, though that spans across zones.
---
WPL is another that springs to mind. I am looking forward to doing Alas Andorhal and associated quests again. I spent a lot of time grinding in that area, too.
---
PM me too please!
---
Did the survival specc increase melee range? I had a hunter too but can't remember. In the dead zone you could not use any weapon ...

Then it comes down to naming snd shaming those players and kicking them from groups.
---
the only big streamer i've heard not playing a pvp server is asmongold and i think he's even been talking about going pvp lately... if you want to avoid all the big streamers pick a pve server.
---
Offline
---
Oddly. I'm not sure lately. I haven't found a use for it yet. My main games have a browser or fullscreen window. But from 3 years ago, it was working 100%.
---
What's this timer for??
---
So, full disclosure, I really want to see what times other people can get following this guide, my run was -horrible-. I died 4 times in Elwynn forest alone. I counted my deaths, 81 in total, 14 were pvp related and 15 were on purpose to spirit res.
---
So 52 un-necessary deaths. I also forgot to set hearthstones 5 times that made me run 10~ minutes each time. I also forgot quest items in my bank, and I forgot to accept a quest altogether and had to run back and pick it up (You can see this happen in the redridge-duskwood part, I don't turn in the legend of stalvan at the logging camp and have to run back after hearthing.
---
I had my mauradon group lose 2 members halfway through. The server restarted during my stockades run and forced us to start again. The deadmines group wiped 3 times because of hunter pet aggro on the boat, losing about 45 minutes alone. The uldaman group tried to push to the last boss and it went horribly wrong, we lost a member and kept going.
---
TLDR: My timestamps for each level are bad and you should -DESTROY- my time if you follow my guide, because god knows I didn't follow it properly.

You have to run third party applications in win 10 to change anything other than the colors, and you cannot change the Taskbar itself, nor remove all the junk on it. You also have all the bloatware, some cannot be Uninstalled (like some of the built in Xbox related ones) and a lot of them comes back after major updates to the os, even if you had them Uninstalled. Another fun example is the fact that you cannot set your login screen. You have to use the lockscreen, something can only remove in the register, but means you won't be able to have you image of choice as login screen no more. Don't tell me you have the same or more choices in 10, that's just simply a lie.

#Pertento#
---
**Alliance | RP-PvP | EU**
---
*Semi-hardcore raiding with a social atmosphere*
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
*Note: We will play on a RP-PvP realm if it's made available to us, if not we will opt for a PvP realm.*
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**What we provide:**
---
- An active, well-organised, and strictly toxic-free Discord.
---
- Experienced leaders; with a history of hardcore raiding and PvP in vanilla.
---
- The possibility for Socials and PvPers to thrive in the guild too, through social raids and BG premades.
---
- RP events in between raids for those interested (meaning less raid logging!).
---
- Community-driven members, with initiatives such as Vanilla Friends made possible by us.
---
- IRL meetups.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun + Monday (for progression) 20:00 - 24:00 CET
---

Omg i had the exact same skin for my windows xp around the same time
---
Again, modifying lock screens was not officially supported lol. Bloatware I agree with but you can hide it which is visual, which is what we were talking about. My windows setup is very minimal. You can change colors and themes and transparency, just the same as you could in 7. It’s pretty much the same.   
---
If you want to change unsupported things then use third party software. If you want more customization options beyond what you can find for third party software then make it yourself or use a different OS, but windows is still windows.

I will never forget the moment when I just started the game as a complete noob and arrived in Darkshire. A couple of horse were ganking and this GM Ret Paladin arrived and smashed them. Truly epic.
---
Make a guild then

I’m not really into cryptic notes by people with a vested interest. I’ll continue to remain cynical for now.

Depends on what you intend to do. I want a group of tryhards who really wants to push for server firsts, so having that group mostly formed and ready to go before launch gives a massive edge.

I'm an experienced raider/raid leader full swapping to classic after it comes out, and am looking for a guild that intends on pushing hard to be realm first. I started raiding heavily during MoP, and have pushed Heroic/Mythic level content since Siege of Orgrimmar on live, all the way through Uldir where I stopped playing BfA. Currently, I am playing/leveling on a vanilla server to get myself very familiar with the Classic world and challenges prior to launch so I can hit the ground running after release.
---
I am looking for a guild that has a competitive mindset, with players who seek to improve each other as well as themselves. Classic is definitely about community, and I hope to find that community with a guild of people who also want to do everything they can to push ahead of the pack. Getting 40+ people online together is no easy task, and I hope that any guild I'm joining respects the time that everyone else is putting in for raids by coming prepared, or asking for help if they need it to be ready as an individual. And most importantly, I'm looking for a group of people who wants to have fun while they do it! Just because you are serious about progression doesn't mean you can't be having a great time with friends while you go.

Literally everything that uses the internet can be described as 'a chat filter with a fancy UI'. Except that most of the chat is in binary. 
---
How it works doesn't matter, what it accomplishes does. 
---
Imo they can combat people developing such functionality by just limiting what the API can do.
---
If, for example, they prevent the API from sending whispers at will (replying could still work to prevent stuff like DBM from breaking) they would effectively prevent the type of free communication that an LFG type addon needs to work.

**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server - Early Weeknight Raids!**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are actively looking for all classes and roles, so now is the opportunity to join at the ground level and help build something special.  There are open leadership positions available for qualified individuals.
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Tank, Feral DPS, Heal)
---
* Hunter (BM, Mark)
---
* Mage (All Specs)
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Priest (Heal)
---
* Rogue (All Specs)
---
* Warlock (All Specs)
---
* Warrior (Tank, DPS)
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

You sir, have my utmost respect.
---
Ah ok.  I don't know any streamers other that that asmogold skeleton lookin dude, because I watched some of one video and now it won't stay out of my suggested!
---
Man I dont like towellie... first he rags on vanilla lile shit, then he goes and hypes it. (If that what its for) all for the views
---
Ventrilo was the bomb. I refused to use anything else for such a long time. Brings back a lot of memories.
---
*Lord Bison wants to know your location.*
---
Honestly I've done it before, and it's not hard at all, it's about memorizing a path.
---
Even for an average hunter like myself it was absurdly profitable, and unlike most farming spots, the gold comes 100% from vendoring.
---
That being said, I think DM as a whole has too many easy, instanced farming strategies qnd Blizzard should take a closer look at it.
---
I don't remember half of my server solo-farming the same dungeon back in vanilla, but it does happen in pservers.
---
Yes i am coming back,looking for a good pvp uk guild for laughs and banter.
---
Lock screen is a new thing tho before you had login screen and that was it. Third party applications are still limited to what windows can do. Personally I think Linux will be the future.
---
But you will be missing out on the best fishing rod in the game!!!
---
I'm not familiar with the specific addon. But if it sends whispers automatically to other people who have the addon, and then parses those whispers, essentially using the whisper system as its communication protocol. I would definitely call that automation. Such powerful functionality should not be a part of the API imo.
---
Imagine watching towellie.
---
That link you provided does not have any video in it.
---
The question still remains, why was his dps so high?  If anything you are disproving you're own point about everyone 'applying themselves' by saying that this guy played incorrectly yet still had insane dps.
---
You also seem to say its not a mystery what type of gear you need.  Ok then, where exactly is the secret sauce?  If skill doesn't matter, gear doesn't matter, then why didn't every scrub warrior on every server do this?
---
I challenge you to find any other video from Vanilla with this video quality.  I already looked, they don't exist.
---
Too bad Alliance WallStars in AV ruined your fun.
---
Engine bugs like wall jumping and moonwalking will almost certainly be fixed as they are using the new engine as the basis. I'm sad. I loved wall jumping my way around Ironforge back in the day, but the benefit (security, compatibility, maintainability, etc) are worth it.
---
Oh yes, Towelliee, great.
---
You mean the guy that self promoted his stream in other channels in the Justin.tv days and spammed the general WoW forums and mmo-champion with links to his "HD" stream?
---
You mean the guy that has been on the forefront AGAINST Classic and Retail shilling forever?
---
You mean the guy that, once classic was announced, said "I have my connections, and you guys will be surprised at the amount of changes that will come. You guys have no idea, haha".
---
You mean the guy that realised Classic has a huge folllowing suddenly was interested in Classic and trying to ride the hype wave for more exposure?
---
Don't bother trusting an obscure timer from him. He just wants the attention.
---
Avoid? I’m trying to get on those servers. Idgaf what all those youtube vids say. It sounds fun as hell and a massive server is awesome. Am EU though so it hardly matters anyway I guess
---
It was just the feeling like it was real when I was a kid. I could play most when it was summer and when it was warm and dry outside. When you run through the fields you could hear the crickets chirp on a hot summers day.
---
vQueue doesn't work like that at all. If someone writes in chat "LF2M SM" then the addon registers and logs that to the Scarlet Monastery category. Then you can see who posted it choose to whisper them for an invite.
---
You can't really limit that, or else you disable anti-goldseller addons in the process.
---
normal-ass chair, normal-ass monitors, no mountain dew aesthetic, I give it an adult/10.
---
You're not supposed to use the text guide, that was just a reference he made for himself. You're supposed to use the video guide, which details everything
---
I most likely will play on a German Server, so I don't have that problem.
---
Nah that goes to 2142 I think. I liked Vietnam but I was also like 11.
---
Adding to this, do multiple goblin jumper cables share cooldown or have it separate?
---
Dun morough or bust, I remember waddling around to eventually finding the gnome mount vendor and shitting myself when I realized I could ride a fucking robo chicken in this game one day.

I'm not familiar with vqueue so assuming you're right, I have no problem with it. If it just literally displays chat messages in a different window that's relatively innocent I think. It's when addons start sending whispers around an use that to automate stuff that I have a problem with it.
---
Brit here /wave patiently playing the waiting game ....
---
The all seeing eye, bro i just cum. MOHAA days.
---
I'm still getting at least one +10 in every week on my BM hunter for the chest. It is fun, but the game is garbage in general. I've heard their changes on PTR are considered "good" according to my guildies that have tried it, but I am skeptical. Can't wait for Classic. Getting more hyped by the day.
---
I like vqueue (on private servers), i can check past /LFG messages from previous 5 minutes (while still having to do the social connection, like in vanilla).
---
Its not really a LFG addon, more like chat extension.
---
I’m from Newcastle and have lost touch with anyone who I used to know back in classic so will be looking for a server come release. Looking at rolling a healer, played a dwarf priest back then!
---
Some streamers will go only to a pve server.

Tired of r/classicwow to tell you that you won't get into any raids as a spriest/non-resto shaman/feral etc?
---
Feel free to join us in our adventure to clear the entire of classics raiding challanges while still maintaining our identity!
---
We will raid 2-3 nights a week and won't require too many consumables.
---
Everyone is welcome so feel free to PM me for the discord link!
---
These are amazing, is it possible to buy one?
---
Un'Goro was very cozy. Great atmosphere. Just always keep a lookout for Gankasaurus.
---
He is probably talking about 0-30-21 (HotW / NS).
---
User name checks out ;)

Based in the Toon here as well. Also a Priest Healer, although i draw the line at Dwarves.

Teldrassil and Starbreeze Village. The sounds and tranquility, the overall positive vibes of this place were so freaking amazing.

\#FOR THE HORSE

If dps isn't that fun for you then why main a warlock?

I'm afraid that if I chose a french server the pop will drop down after a coupe months and will peak at 500

Aye. The only problem is muh weaponskill. Which means muhthreat.

I've had https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90289172/ that for ~10 years now. Finally its starting to show wear (small tear in front of the seat). And guessing the bearings have some slack.
---
Seen some good comments about https://www.autonomous.ai/ chairs.
---
Shopping for a new seat to my new flat too, eyeing a Herman miller atm, but lets see if i can pull the trigger.
---
Horses are always ganking in Goldshire.
---
You forgot the fact he just uses his stream chat as a voice assistant because he's too lazy to Google shit, as he knows fuck all about the game - on top of actually being awful at it.
---
He just said in his new video he wasn't invited anywhere
---
Any hints as to why tomorrow will be big? I'll even tickle your balls!
---
&gt; That link you provided does not have any video in it.
---
It's not supposed to have any video in it. It's the original page where the video was originally posted in 2006. If you scroll down the page you'll find the post.
---
&gt; The question still remains, why was his dps so high? If anything you are disproving you're own point about everyone 'applying themselves' by saying that this guy played incorrectly yet still had insane dps.
---
He didn't play to the maximum potential, but reasonably close to it. People doing much lower dps are simply playing further away from maximum potential, without videos of them as well the mistakes are hard to point out. The point of the video is just to show that the game mechanics didn't stop people from doing good dps.
---
&gt; You also seem to say its not a mystery what type of gear you need. Ok then, where exactly is the secret sauce? If skill doesn't matter, gear doesn't matter, then why didn't every scrub warrior on every server do this?
---
I mean in 2019 it's not mystery. We now know what stats and talents warriors (and all other classes) need for max DPS. Watch a fury warrior guide if you need to know. World buffs, consumables, proper itemization, having enchants, proper potion usage are all known now but were not known by 99.99% of people in retail vanilla.
---
wow streamer shows interest in classic  
---
/surprised pikachu  
---
Towelliee is huge in the wow scene, and has been for years. He has a good relationship with Blizzard compared to most wow/ex-wow streamers. So when it comes to news and foreshadowing he is a pretty reliable source.  
---
That his content is bleh, or his interest mostly lies in retail, doesn't affect his credibility.
---
I mean. Who hasn't been in that situation??????
---
Realm Drama on the forums was great.
---
Avalast, Rohhaan, Snackers, none of them have played since... well, Avalast was the last one to go back in Wrath. I haven't heard from amy of them since. Danny, Bobert and Joey have both moved on with their lives and have no interest anymore.
---
Real life or ingame, my friendships from those days didn't last. We got older and just went different directions.
---
I'm going back into vanilla solo. I might make new friends, i might get tired of questing alone and leave as soon as i hit 60. No matter how much hype i try to pull together, i know it won't be the same.
---
I suppose I'll just try to make the best of it.
---
&gt;That being said, I think DM as a whole has too many easy, instanced farming strategies qnd Blizzard should take a closer look at it.
---
This is probably part of the reason why DM will not be in the initial release phase..
---
Great work!
---
This sub really  hates  Towelliee  it seems\^\^ chill  guys. At least it´s not Ninja.  
---
But  back to the Timer. If it  is  CLassic related, and  it´s  like  90% gonna be  Classic related (given he made  a "secret" trip  to blizzards  HQ with other  content creators (asmon declined the invite is  the word on the street of Dalaran) , strongly hinting  a classic beta release this week(end) - so Release of  classic  begin of  July?  2nd week of July maybe?  
---
Only thing  that might interfere with the CLassic  release would  be  the 8.2 release (yeah i know retail is bad yada yada) imho.
---
Wasn’t there a challenge to get to 60 killing nothing but boars? 
---
You absolutely can get to 60 without questing (I don’t recommend it, but it’s an option) 
---
Vanilla didn’t really force you to quest, you could do them, or skip them, with only a select few being essentially required along the way. (Class, weapon, attunement, etc.) Not like the current iteration of retail that forces you through painfully easy quests full of cutscenes and dialogue. Even if you die midway through you just respawn like 9 feet away and you’re back in the fight.
---
I happened upon a chineese farmer and befriended him in vanilla, he mostly farmed ZG crocs and stratholme service entrance. (he used 2 mages with fairly shit gear to perma slow)
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Ikea chair ? I think i have the same model, lasted me a cool 10 years now. Time to get something new now tho.
---
Cause im healing since wotlk. Ive always dreamed about staying back not worring about keeping lazy ass people alive. Especially in a "no dps counting" expansion. Just want to keep it simple
---
Teldrassil. The music is so soothing for the soul.
---
Yeah, i leveled last time as enchance, and it was a lot of fun. will see how I  get on, quite fancy doing it ele as I havent played that before :D
---
Well if I group for a PuG that /roll the list order and /roll a 1 I'm definitively leaving the raid cuz I'm not gonna spend 2h raiding and be locked-out of that raid for a week when I'm sure to have zero loot.
---
If it's with the guild it's another story.
---
Middlefinger is more than perfect for me
---
I think most exploits will be fixed. It was one of the reasons they wanted to use the current game engine and graft the old data and context to it.
---
There may be new exploits though!
---
And Hyjal as well. Kinda doubt they are adding back wall jumping.
---
The bedroom upstairs in goldshire inn....
---
Wow I just asked people's thoughts on mage aoe leveling spots the other day, this would have been handy lol. Good work!
---
Plus he's been a fucking asshole to Asmongold forever.
---
Towelliee is a piece of shit nobody, end of story.
---
Hah yes either love em or hate em!
---
Hunters, at least in my expierence
---
Indeed. Seems sturdy and feels comfy
---
Retail Class descriptions:  
---
Mage: Deals "damage" with a frosty, fiery, or arcane spell effect.
---
Warlock: Deals "damage" with purple, green, and fiery spell effects. Has more demons if you press the "Demonology" button.
---
Min max-ing is just easy mode. Any race is able to MT just fine. :)
---
Yeah. I'd no love to see the Alliance side of things in quests, lore etc. But I would hate to not be Horde.
---
Please...i Wanna purchase one too! How do I give you my money?
---
Nice to see another Geordie!
---
The classes didn't go through any fundamental changes that would affect this list.
---
I'd say this is more accurate to vanila since paladins are god-tier dungeon and trash tanks and druids are also competitive tanks.
---
Created by Fathertimejr#9360 in the Mage Classic Discord. They wanted some exposure to the website because it wasn't found on Google.
---
They are the worst seriously. Especially the kind climbing on the roof
---
I plan on playing on the server with the main classic crew. Turns out it's a pretty decent split. I'm expecting that server to produce some of the best wpvp.
---
Let's get it on!
---
One minor typo correction I noted when I glanced at it.  Green Hills of Stranglethorn you need chapters 10,11, 14, and 16  (you had 11 twice and did not list 10)
---
&gt; I challenge you to find any other video from Vanilla with this video quality. I already looked, they don't exist.
---
Here's quite many https://www.youtube.com/user/TheClassicWoWMovies/videos
---
95% of guilds on English-speaking EU realms are English-language, multi-nationality guilds. There is an argument that a Brits-only guild on an English-speaking realm has a tinge of xenophobia about it.
---
When possible, add in possible loot as well.  Knowing where to go to farm wool would be useful.
---
easily the best guide ive ever seen - good job. i wish there was something like this for horde
---
PM me your store info!
---
No idea if this video was from vanilla or on a pserver. 
---
Also, looking at the lock, he has 6.5K health and nearly 7K mana. That means he's rocking tremendous gear too. Also world buffs dont last through death. So 1 bad pull, wrong move etc and the buff is gone. 
---
The point I am making is that so many players are underestimating how hard it is to get into Naxx and kill the bosses. This vid you shared said it was a "server first". Meaning this was most definitely the top raiding guild on the server. 
---
Average raiding guilds will take a very long time to get into naxx, nevermind clearing it.
---
Bravo.
---
These are F'ing awesome!
---
\+ flowers. Someone did a lot of growing up, that´s for sure.
---
It's between Orc and Undead. None of the racials really do all that much for you in raid DPS so it does mostly come down to PVP. Want to be better against warriors, paladins and other rogues? Go Orc. Want to be better against priests and warlocks? Go Undead. 
---
I'd give the slight edge to undead if you do both pvp and pve since WotF is more useful in pve than stun resist.
---
The quality isnt even bad wtf
---
Do the only logical thing, get a new job!
---
&gt; From those of us who experienced .....  a 10k online pserver 
---
Yeah and i played on a insta lvl60 Pserver, maybe add those as well.  
---
oh and i even played on a Pserver where i could get 1 item / gear per day , maybe add those as well.  
---
you see the problem there..... those are private servers, which have been tampered with.  
---
Its not Vanilla or Classic., and in my opinion they should;t do that, only because its not the vanilla experience, but the Pserver experience.  If you want that, you should play Pserver
---
The game was not designed to allow that many players, resources and mob spawns would have to modified but more importantly the game client is not able to play well with many concurrent players in a specific area even with sharding.
---
Is this a Faulty Towers reference?
---
Clearly, Alliance has the best druids.
---
Dam, I had a ton of fun in 2142. What made it so bad?
---
Also [that](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bmj8zs/classic_content_creators_were_invited_to_irvine/emymxbo/)  comment.
---
I remember when I woke up after the blizzcon ceremony and saw on reddit that classic was announced. I was so hyped for classic and despite spending hours on r/wow I didn't even realize that there was a new expansion until like 2 days later
---
You're literally a brainlet if you think that's why people dislike him lmfao.

Probably Azshara. We all know how it got ruined, and it's true. That place had it's own atmosphere back in the day, and I also remember having my Azuregos scout alt out there and all the times my guild was lucky enough to be the one to nab him when he spawned.
---
Currently 8 EU guilds recruiting english-speaking members in the LFG-thread and 1 guild non-english (norw). I know there is a finnish guild and 1-2 german guilds as well but at least in this subreddit I wouldn’t say it’s predominately non-english speaking guilds. Might ofc look different elsewhere. 
---
And I agree that belonging to EU or not is a non-issue. But tbf it was you who did the distinction in your post so just answered what you asked... My guess is that britts would rarely have the need to exclude other nationalities, except ”for fun”, when forming a guild since the language-barrier just isn’t there so britts go to all kinds of guilds depending on play-style, raid-times and what not

Not sure when blizzard usually releases betas, but isn't it weird if they release it outside the working hours at the Blizzard HQ?
---
This is the most 2007 I've ever seen
---
I am, although currently down under. I'll be home for Classic though!
---
Then don't attend gold bid runs. If you're an active raider you won't have to go to gbid raids. It's for the people who can't attend a regular raid schedule. Let them get the gear in their own way. It takes a lot more farming to get an item in a gbid run than in a normal raid. So either you grind that raid 20 times until you finally get your item, or you grind gold for a month or two, attend like 20 or so raids until RNG let's your item drop and if you're lucky you have the most gold and win it.
---
It only becomes a problem when your guild mates actively skip your raids for gbid raids, that imo is a warning then a gkick.
---
Teamspeak and ventrilo.... this guy games
---
Sheffield boys report in.
---
Caln down fatty.
---
I did not but I played enter the matrix back in the day and loved it.
---
Your argument skills needs some polishing.
---
So just bcause he isn't crying about a problm that doesn't exist, like you are, then he's clearly a fanboy? WTF
---
Played a rogue in vanilla too, I liked them how they were, although the super slow stealth is something we’re going to have to readjust to 😂
---
Scotland too! Lok'tar ogar
---
I don't necessarily disagree with you (technically I prefer MMOs to have no addon support besides basic UI tweaks), but I guess my question would be where do you draw the line?
---
Because there's a lot of addons that are totally accepted by the community that I feel are also way too powerful and ruin the experience, like addons that track threat and tell you exactly what to do during raids that you haven't participated in before.
---
I will NOT sit here and watch you write that shit in norweigan!
---
Its swedish!
---
Vi sitter här i venten och spelar lite DOTA!
---
I would rather see realm subreddits than discord. Discord is too much of a chat room and not enough of a forum.
---
hmm, yes, but it's worth like +15% damage on 40% of your white hits on bosses. That's a pretty big deal for threat. Obviously if you're in a casual guild where salv'buffed dps's aren't anywhere near your threat anyway, it won't matter at all.
---
&gt; i played on a insta lvl60 Pserver, maybe add those as well
---
that's a pretty extreme example. 
---
The thing that spurred this demand for Classic was, in part, the crazy success of Pservers where people experienced the excitement of high pop.
---
And high pop servers modify nothing but the player cap. That's not a tweak to any WoW game mechanic. Comparing to a free item a day server is not the same ballpark
---
I was hyped for bfa i thought maybe blizzard will redeem them selfs after wod (legion was good but the wounds still havent healed) nope we get good story content but everything else was boring (endgame barely existed) so im hyped for classic as well
---
Battlefield Vietnam.  Those were the day!
---
I really hope there's a guild that makes a good efort to getting "scarab lord" (the mount, I know there's no title in vanilla) and ruin Asmongold's chances of getting it in the proccess.
---
Would be epic to watch.
---
Wasnt he against vanilla?
---
I was able to rename him Kaloko since it was obscure enough no one on that server picked it for 12 years ha
---
Definitely agree, 10k might be too much. Between 2k and 10k online would be the sweet spot in my opinion.
---
Players going here would ideally self-select and know what they're getting in for in terms of competition for quest mobs and stuff.
---
Very clean. I like it.

---
Mulgore for sure. 
---
First character I ever created was a Tauren Warrior and dear god this the music and the view make me fall in love with the game.
---
I feel more nostalgia as a whole for the human starting zones (Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood), but having to pick up forces me to choose Mulgore.
---
Why does everyone post pictures of 2 monitors now? Why isn't 1 good enough anymore?
---
Maybe I'm just an old man...
---
fake plants from ikea so you don't have to water them
---
All those @NameHere forum posts were gold, especially when it was back and forth between 2 avid PvPers.
---
No ally side? 😭
---
if you can't stand hunters when bashing things with your sword in BFA, you are going to have an even worse time with hunters as a warrior in classic. good hunters literally run circles around warriors. that being said, if the warrior manages to catch the hunter, he's done for in seconds.
---
Can someone translte it for me ? -_-
---
Really enjoy it, but the bottom right corner part of the map not being symmetrical across both monitors makes me uncomfortable.
---
Download Vanilla Guide, it has a similar alliance Guide.
---
You don't want to heal and you don't like dpsing? Why not go tank then. If you roll a druid you can try all three as long as you are dedicated enough.
---
I would be interested in purchasing a couple (at least) as well!  Thank you!!
---
Yeah, I’m curious if there’s an updated horde leveling guide that isn’t Joana’s.
---
*Brits

awww man, i remember having this back in the day
---
Can we stop posting this trash streamer on here? I can tolerate Classicast but this guy is just too much.
---
Brit player here, Skullcrusher EU originally.
---
Been around since vanilla beta, waiting patiently spending every spare min I get planning and reading about classic WoW
---
Wut
---
Didn't watch the video but how reliable is it for the average player to be able to kill the cyclonian in the same method?  Is it a hairline fight where it could go almost either way but his practice + dedication pulled through or is it basically a push over as long as you follow the strat + consumables correctly?  Pretty crazy either way ... if you told me back in vanilla a warrior was going to solo an elite 6 levels higher than himself I would have called you insane.
---
&gt; The game was not designed to allow that many players, resources and mob spawns would have to modified
---
If players want to play on higher population servers without modified spawns why not let them?
---
&gt;the game client is not able to play well with many concurrent players in a specific area even with sharding.
---
Private servers have proven this to be wrong, the only problems would come from whatever they've fucked up with the modern client which might plague the normal servers anyways.

**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** [H] [NA] *(Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST)*
---
🔺 **INTRO** We are known as FREE HUGS! (Yes, we give free hugs.) We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend a lot of time raiding and obtaining those sweet epic and legendary items! We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for World of Warcraft Classic.
---
🔺 **RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting any core classes such as: Priests, Mages, Hunters, Druids, DPS Warriors, Warlocks, Rogues, and Shamans. Although we are small now, we hope to grow into a powerhouse guild that prides itself on our close knit community.
---
🔺 **SCHEDULES** We will raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We will begin raiding within a reasonable amount of time after release, allowing for everyone to level/gear up. We are open to bending the raiding times based on our communities input. We will be doing dungeons, farming and pvp on our off days.
---
🔺 **OUR GOALS** We will clear all raid content through naxx at our own pace to ensure our quest for legendary items and epic quest chains. We aren’t as hardcore as some other guilds out there; we won’t be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their pve and pvp goals !
---
🔺 **BONUS** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced classic verterans in the guild with a passion for teaching all things WoW! We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious classic adventure.
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614 and I will personaly welcome you to our family!
---
Youtubers aren't life-changing people dude. You make a lot of money but you are not as important to the world as you think you are lol
---
# YOU HAVE UNSPENT TALENT POINTS
---
Imagine being a Towelliee white knight lol
---
It's doable. I'd say it's more practical if you use the gatherer addon which can show the node locations on the map without tracking. You won't get the little yellow dot without actually tracking the specific resource, but you'll know in advance that a node could be in that specific spot.
---
I see it as an adjustment, to the base game.  
---
However a population change to 3k or maybe 3.5 shouldn't hurt to much.
---
But going for 10k is just nonsense IMO
---
How do you deal with Free Action Potions as a mage? Cant use frost nova, frost bolt snare, blast wave or anything really :/ polymorph seems to be an option or running away (maybe with a swiftness potion)?
---
Try 2 monitors and you'll probably understand lol. It's just too nice to play a game and also have the page you always alt tab to, just already there to view.
---
I will tank 5 mans probably. I love bear form. But idk if it will be viable for raids later on
---
When facing a typical hunter, you would get into their dead zone and they would usually try to back up to shoot you rather than melee you. He’s saying that if people would do the norm here, he would ran at them and melee them unexpectedly.
---
WoW, more excited than for BfA? Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn
---
I'm not the guy you've been talking to, but Windows 10 absolutely has the ability for you to make your taskbar much cleaner and functional than Windows 7 was.
---
Now, by default, the taskbar (and start menu) are 100% a cluster fuck... but you can do a lot of super great customization without any outside software if you take the time to do it.
---
Great thread on customizations available through a simple store app: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3fjah2/my_blizzard_heavy_windows_10_start_bar/?st=jvmbwkv0&amp;sh=eef10036
---
As a closing piece, people aren't ignorant because they think something has a cleaner look. Looks are a subjective thing, and I agree that the Windows 10 taskbar is a much cleaner experience if you spend time to customize it.
---
Ignorance is
---
&gt; lacking knowledge or awareness in general; uneducated or unsophisticated.
---
Please don't throw terms around so loosely.
---
In for later
---
Man I dated a girl with 3 fingers (both hands), I mean it was weird but damn, that was the best thing ever, troll ftw
---
Did someone say Gamespy Arcade..?
---
At risk of paraphrasing J Allen, they think they do, but they don't. These uberserver players don't understand the number of non-vanilla changes to how spawn rates work that makes the larger populations possible. This change goes deeper than just tweaking some constant that determines how many concurrent players are online, these servers would need totally reworked spawn code.
---
Maybe it was supposed to be the way it is, and originally they had flipped it by accident, and just left it cus there were more important matters
---
It wasn't, but a lot of people at the time disliked the progression system, and they never really managed to fix the Titan battles being laggy and glitchy as heck.
---
The thing many people don't realize who never even played vanilla live is whatever Blizz was doing at the time worked just fine, and that 10k servers have such a watered-down community you may as well implement sharding and cross server while you're at it.
---
Asmongold is an asshole too though
---
Here's the issue:
---
- Vanilla servers were, either by technical limitations of the time or deliberate design choice, generally capped at around 2.5-4k players online at any one time. There's proof somewhere from an old Blizz Dev interview that they generally used ~2.5k but could push up to as much as 4k if required.
---
- Classic Devs already adhere to #nochanges, as does a very vocal subset of the community, so selling a change to player caps risks "it's not a faithful recreation!" backlash.
---
- *If* they want to up the population substantially, they need to rethink spawn and drop rates for pretty much every mob and item in the game. How do they do that? Sharding? That's retail. Dynamic spawns? Not Vanilla. Just double or triple the spawn speeds for everything? Low pop realms will be overrun with NPCs: imagine cave quests with 3x the number of mobs inside but with a normal 1-2k population online.
---
- Adjusting spawn rates to accomodate more online players also violates #nochanges, and risks backlash along the same "it's not a faithful recreation!" lines as above.
---
In short I reckon it's almost certain that we'll get realm caps that probably sit around ~2.5-3k concurrent players in most cases.
---
As an expansion on that: I've heard the number of active pserver players is usually given at around 100k, with around 10-15k active at any one time (pservers are global in nature so it's 100k worldwide with ~10-15k online at any one time), which means Blizzard will probably be opening at least 10 servers on day 1, but it'll be spread across all their various regions: a bunch in NA, a bunch in EU, etc etc.
---
BFA does not make that cinematic justice, that was so bad ass and I was for the first time really hyped about a WoW expansion. But =(
---
I'm hyped as hell for Classic =D
---
I will try playing Shaman but I'll end up rolling a druid anyway I think.
---
Man I never liked the vanilla pvp gear on Trolls, specifically the helmet always looked too weird for me. It just looks like a massively oversized bucket compared to the otherwise lanky physique of darkspear trolls.
---
If you make some Horde ones into coasters I'll buy them.
---
My guild might suit your schedule, raid times aren't 100% confirmed yet but raid start times of 2 or 3 or 4 am (EST) seem likely so far!
---
 http://www.guilded.gg/Nightshift/
---
Teldrassil, that's where it all started for me
---
In what way is it cleaner when it has more objects on it that are hard wired into the os and cannot be removed tho? If people are only referring to its colors, shade etc that might be a different story, just like some prefer the new hip flat ui design. Iv spent my fair share of time trying to clean win 10 of things that imo should have been optional from the start. Personally I prefer classic shell when it comes to the start menu at least.
---
definatly, i'm 100% sure when i enter it and the music starts playing i'll be having goosebumps
---
PM Please. I'd like to buy one!
---
Wow what a manchild.
---
Yep
---

---
Indeed. I used to aim to get them and got a great sense of pride and accomplishment when it did happen
---
It was quality to see some guild drama spew out of gchat and trade chat into the forums.

I'd quite like bartender, but don't need it. Auto sell junk and quartz are the two I really want.

Very clean, "Less is more philosophy", props for the plants in the corner. They are good for the oxygen since you ain't gonna get out of that room for many days straight.

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done. https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903

---
There are 16 people from the UK in my (English speaking) guild. It's an international one. We organize based on what we want from the game. :)
---
I get what you are saying from your personal point of view the experience and sense of achievement, but not everyone will share that view. Essentially it feels like you are telling other people how to experience their game.
---
You can also look it it from another point of view; Raiding costs costs, wiping -&gt; repairing, consumables and that for 40 people. When guilds are selling runs it is usually consumed content, selling runs can fund the guild which allows them to progress in their current progression raid while covering some of the cost.This is where it becomes a part of the economy and this will allow people who don't want to or don't have time to raid to still acquire gear. 
---
If you can't commit to raid schedule due to commitments like family, you can still farm gold when you do have time to play. Then when you have acquired enough gold to be able to afford a run where you have **a chance** to get new gear that is an upgrade it will give this person a sense of accomplishment just as much. 
---
Farming gold = time, raiding = time. I find it weird that you feel that you are the authority on what is deserved and what is undeserved. You can have your opinion, but when you are asking for outright bans for people, you are presenting yourself as an authority on something which really is just a personal thing, 'sense of accomplishment and achievement in a game'.
---
*" If, for some reason, Blizzard decided to change Pummelers, for example  giving it a cooldown instead of the current charges, that would be very  bad news for feral spec as a whole "*
---
But that would be weird. If they deviate from '#nochanges' by changing that item, which is basically a crutch for ferals, they might as well do some '#changes' so ferals do not need said crutch ;-)
---
I got a beta invite for BFA, It was the first beta invite I have got throughout my 13 or so years of wow. I deleted it an moved on. 
---
If I get a beta invite for classic I will likely soil my trousers. This shit is on another level.
---
Upvoted to bring back realm forums.
---
Looks amazing
---
People can still use the /who list or the global LFG channel to find people.
---
Besides its not like people are going to kick newbies out, invite someone and wait for them to walk 30 minutes to SFK.
---
Actually the bigger one is fake and I am not quite sure if the little one alone manages to keep me alive haha
---
Marmite
---
What are the best talents for just tanking?
---
I was going to make the same point. You have to add Pally and Shamy together because of the faction restriction. This makes the class spread even more balanced.
---
it's also for the Alliance, Alliance gankers interrupting horde AoE mages.
---
idk man its probably for new WoW expansion
---
go away, annoying self loathing streamer
---
I wonder how many previously sold accounts are now being stolen back by their original owners in preparation for Classic.
---
I feel like it’s more possible than some suggest. Wow still has a very lively forum culture. Yeah the realm forums suck, but you still see the regulars in the warmode forum and classic discussion. 
---
So there is definitely an appetite for it, we really just need the infrastructure set up by blizzard and I’m sure they will devolve into quite the hive of scum and villainy we all remember so fondly.
---
Was a reply to someone about dwarf priests, my apologies!!
---
This.
---
Also: very convenient for doing work/studying (typing on one monitor, research on the other)
---
Bet he's even worse at cricket than you as well
---
While obviously not ideal or ever topping the damage meters
---
Can elemental shaman be viable at the very least? If I drop totems for my group and use lightning bolts and flame shocks? 
---
Wondering because I’ve never played vanilla and I’ve played a ele shaman since I started in Cataclysm. I’d love to play ele even if it isn’t top. 
---
I’ve read that you absolutely have to heal or maybe you’ll find one token enhancement. Could a ele ever sneak into a raid?
---
nice !  
---
Which program you use, to setup different wallpapers, per monitor, if i may ask ?
---
Oh wow, that's high-res indeed kek
---
Tahnks for the link!
---
&gt; And current results show that less than 10% of subscribers of [r/classicwow](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow) have voted. So yeah sure this is nice thing but has actually no real value. 
---
10% are more than enough to be statistically relevant. In fact, the 8500 people polled are enough for basically any amount population to be statistically relevant - assuming the people are randomly chosen, the poll wasn't manipulated, etc. I expected warlocks to be a lower amount, but otherwise that's a chart that I'd have guessed based on the popularity of classes.
---
Non-Brit staying in the Toon. You Alliance scum disgust me.
---
But he admits it
---
Windows 10. Just control click several images, select them, and then right click set as wallpaper. You can then right click the screen and cycle through the images.
---
Nothing against the guy but I very much doubt this announcement is anything he claims to have insider information but has been exposed so many times, he is also notorious for viewers. The timing doesn't even make sense
---
A lot of these players also played on Nostalrius which launched without anything like dynamic spawns or sharding.
---
They only added dynamic spawning later when server pop started to eclipse 10k at primetime.
---
Also none of this really matters unless we define what an uberserver is. 5-7k? Sure, I might be willing to sacrifice competition for mobs and resources for the server to feel a bit more lively. Beyond that, yeah it starts to become a bit more problematic. There's a pretty big gap between a traditional 2-3k pop server and the 10k+ pops that some pservers attained at their height.
---
I mean, does this really quality as being a white knight? The amount of hate this sub has for some streamers/YouTubers is astounding.
---
How fast are you planning on jumping into raids? Would I be able to take a more casual approach to levelling like running dungeons and such, or are you planning on starting them up as soon as possible?
---
What do you mean exactly? The right monitor is slightly tilted
---
What screens are you rocking there
---
But you will mostly never see same person ever again on 10k server. Parties will never last more than one quest or dungeon. On smaller server you have much higher chance meeting same person every day. Forming parties that will do more than just one quest togather.
---
I fear they're going to have the same thing as when I visited in WoTLK where it'll teleport you just outside the demon area in Winterspring anyway, might be able to eagle eye to the tree though!
---
Hey! I’m in Whickham right next to the metro centre. Great to see more northerners!
---
Classic is NOT Vanilla.
---
The date on my birth certificate tells me I'm an adult yes, but my brain and the way I spend my leisure says otherwise lol
---
I remember being 14 and feeling the same thing!
---
The two monitors are just LG flat panels. The middle monitor is a viotek 144mhz curved gaming monitor. PC is a thermaltech lvl 20 GT with an Asus 470 pro, ryzan 2700x, 32g ddr4 3000mhz ram, GTX 2070 GPU, thermal flow riing CPU cooler, and 3 Samsung Evo 860 SSD.
---
As much as I love wall jumping I'd have to agree that it did ruin WSG for me a couple times, whether being on a winning side or not
---
Yea I’ll probably log on for the graphics/ui changes. Probably level a class/race I have zero interest in, like a Forsaken Rogue/Warlock to get to lvl 10 or so.
---
What an absolute fuckwit you are. Fuck off, no one likes you here.
---
I'll be there.
---
I actually never noticed the Shaman icon was all bloody. I thought it was fire. Although I'm probably misinterpreting tons of Classic icons.
---
Last server I played on it magically dropped on the first Rag kill together with the plans for Lionheart helm. The point remains regardless.
---
And so am I. What's your point?
---
These are really cool!
---
I had a 60 undead warrior before him but I got might shoulders and an arcanite reaper then retired him!
---
Yeah that's how it is supposed to be. That is how vanilla worked.
---
So it's just a coincidence that Mn has insane gear every time I've seen him on a new server?
---
Shut up towelliee. You were ripping into the classic announcement so much at the start. Now you are all on board with it just to get some views
---
Same, PM please
---
Technically, no.

So all in all, the game is bad now.

 **&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; \[A\] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP**  
---
**Intro**
---
Frozen    Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we  are   targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post  is   completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything  that   is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
**Meistä**   
---
Frozen  Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu lähinnä  MMO-pelejä pelaava suomikilta, joka sen jälkeen on muodostunut  massiiviseksi pelaajayhteisöksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat  erittäin vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi  pienestä Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan  kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in,  Lotron, EVE Onlinen sekä monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista  näistä peleistä pelataan vielä, toisia enemmän ja toisia vähemmän, ja  tarkoituksenamme on myös jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien  pelien pariin. Tällä hetkellä killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final  Fantasy XIV:ssä, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons  Online:ssa.  
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu Azerothiin ISOSTI, sillä WoW  Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteisömme isoista peleistä, jossa pyritään  saavuttamaan merkittävä status tulevan Classic WoWin maailmassa.  Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja menestyvin Suomikilta alkuperäiseen  Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean MMORPG:n yhteisöllisyydestä ja haasteesta.  Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni myös perheellisiä, eikä meillä ole  välttämättä aikaa enää raidata viittä päivää viikossa, mutta me teemme  kaikkea contenttia aina raideista PvP:hen sillä ajalla, joka meillä on  käytettävissä.    
---
**Mitä tarjoamme?**  
---
Pitkäikäisen  ja menestyneen pelaajayhteisön, jonka riveissä SINULLA on mahdollisuus  pelata juuri niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat, mutta silti saavuttaa  myös menestystä pelissä hyvällä porukalla. Me emme halua pakottaa sinua  mihinkään - saat pelata täsmälleen sitä hahmoa jota haluat, täsmälleen  niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat. Toivomme ensisijaisesti uusiksi  Frozenilaisiksi sosiaalisia, hurttia huumoria omaavia ihmisiä. Se,  oletko nopea tai hidas levuttamaan, ei ole tärkeää. Tärkeää on se, että  sinulla on järki päässä ja sydän paikallaan. Meillä ei ole  osallistumispakkoja, vaan osallistumismahdollisuuksia. Meillä on  kuitenkin yleisen vapaan ja rennon toimintatavan ohella myös  mahdollisuus pelata ryhmissä, joissa on korkeat tavoitteet, ja näihin  toivommekin ensisijaisesti aktiivisia ja pitkäpinnaisia pelaajia, joilta  löytyy tahtoa toteuttaa asioita.

Tällä  hetkellä suunnittelemme, että Classic WoW:ssa tullaan raidaamaan 2-3  kertaa viikossa inhimillisellä aikataululla. Alustavana tavoitteenamme  on kuitenkin clearata kaikki PvE content pelissä, mutta maaliin ei ole  kiire. Tarkempi raidausaikataulu toteutetaan yhteistyössä koko killan  jäsenistön kesken lähempänä julkaisuaikataulua.  
---
**PvP**  
---
Killassa  tullaan myös järjestämään organisoitua PvP:tä. Myös korkeampaa PvP  rankkia metsästäviä killasta löytyy ja tahtoa saavuttaa suuria asioita  myös Horden nirhaushommissa.

**About us**: We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
**PvE**: We would like to clear all PvE content in time and hopefully step foot into naxxramas when it launches.
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we would like to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and some battlegrounds later on.
---
Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!
---
&gt;*One of us is being ganked by that annoying undead rogue in lakeshire?*
---
&gt;**Go and help him out**
---
&gt;*One of us is short a tank for a dungeon?* 
---
&gt;*You need help with a difficult task?*
---
&gt; **We will help you out!**
---
**Goals/Hopes/Dreams**:
---
- become a big guild with a friendly &amp; mature playerbase
---
- keeping the guild chat/discord alive
---
- PH4T L00TZ
---
- enjoying Classic together

**Recruitment**: We've started building our main raid roster and so far it looks like we only really lack a few warlocks and rogues. Nothing is set in stone though, which is why we're still recruiting all classes/roles (except main tanks). We also accept Socials, Casuals and Non-raiders!
---
We do not enforce nor encourage min-maxing and rushing but we do expect our future members to be experienced (or at least a little familiar) with classic wow.
---
If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!

***In any case, HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER!*** :)

This is amazing.

Problem is that people play on high pop private servers with 10k players online with MODIFIED or Dynamic spawn rates for nodes and mobs.

They'll be crushed when they realize they'll play on a server with 10k players online and everyone will be poor as shit.

I was sort of the same. Got him to rank ten I think then went on holiday for a week with my family, and it disheartened me a lot when I had down ranked quite a bit. Also GCSE’s were happening from what I remember. No wonder I got shit results looking back haha.

how can an english guild on an english speaking realm be seen as xenophobic? If it was French guild on a French realm would that be xenophobic?

**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.

This is my favorite one by far. Its clean, simple, yet nice display and looks comfortable. I like the Lotr frames above too, all in good taste. Hope you enjoy!
---
Oh fuck yeah Duskwood. 😊
---
Sorry for that weird English in the first post... On mobile and that juicy autocorrect. 😊
---
If people want a 10k realm with dynamic spawn rates for mobs and nodes, I'm all up for that. I'd play on it with an alt because it's quite cool.
---
But it will kind of ruin the real vanilla experience, but encourage great W-PvP.

Fair enough, I was in a mythic+ group yesterday that consisted of 4 belves and then me. I'm here to throw a dash of purple-gray onto a world of sun-kissed beauty!
---
Had an ud female rogue and i loved it.
---
A level 60 legendary has 8.5 dps?!
---
Whats the dps of your level 1 starting weapon then? 0.03 dps?
---
Same people that improved wow over the years to the current state are now developing classic. We will get many improvements to the classic as well dont worry.
---
Do most big streamers play ally?
---
Question that may seem dumb lol, how well will.this guide work for other classes?
---
Warriors are the slowest levelers so will this guide be pretty comprehensive for Alli or should I look up a lore class specific guide when the time comes if I want to get to 60 as quickly as possible?
---
I love it because it's so simple. There's some farmers that need help and there's a gang doing sketchy shit in a cave. Love
---
those old articles feel like im readings ancient texts of a long lost civilization
---
I would not say "bad" generally, because there were a lot of people playing, quite possibly enjoying and obviously even paying money for that game. So it cant be that bad xD
---
Its just so very different in every single, fundamental design decision, compared to its original state ... and i personally liked that state way better.
---
Hey I have 2 question on hunters and feign death.
---
1) Does feign death interrupt casts of enemy players?
---
2) What does feign death do in combination with shadowmeld (night elf racial)? Does it make you invisible in-fight? Does it interrupt casts (if 1) doesn't already)?
---
This is taken wayyyyyy out of context lol
---
4k tops, 2k on each faction. Would be perfect imo :)
---
0.9 i think :D Cant say for sure because i switched it immediately.
---
Hi twitch chat!
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Wednesday is when they tell us there is no BETA and they launch the live version on 19th of may.
---
Anytime I try retail again to see new content I always have the line from the Godfather in my head
---
"Look how they massacred my boy"
---
Is he insinuating there will be stuff in the patch notes or we’re just getting the full on release?
---
&gt; Between 2k and 10k online would be the sweet spot in my opinion.
---
That's... a massive difference between numbers. Might want to narrow down that "sweet spot".
---
I guess if you want to be the last 60 on your server then following a video guide is for you.
---
Ah shit, this repost again
---
Ugh, dirty hobos. We all smell em
---
I hope that its at least a different development team with a somewhat different mindset / design philosophy. Hope dies last. Of course the upper management will be the same and that's problematic.
---
&gt; how can an english guild on an english speaking realm be seen as xenophobic? If it was French guild on a French realm would that be xenophobic?
---
It's because of the difference between a language requirement and a nationality requirement. A French national-only guild that simply refused to accept Belgians or Swiss would be weird. Just as a British only guild that refused to accept Irish (or Dutch or German or whatever) would be weird. The reason most realms have a Swedish-only guild (for instance) is because there are Swedish players who don't speak English and there's no localised Swedish realms.
---
As far as numbers, I'm basing my 95% figure (which may be low) on decades of experience playing MMORPGs in Europe. If you're seeing a lot of threads of (say) Norwegian guilds, it's probably because that population is very small and they have to work hard to recruit. There is usually one guild based on each Nordic language on every server, but generally no more than that. A drop in the ocean compared to the total population.
---
I must of missed the memo since when do we use vertical screens? And when did they become so poular all of a sudden?
---
Thats exactly what came to my mind when i saw the DPS Numbers of the 60 Weapons. Thunderfury 8.5, Ashkandi 11.7, ...
---
"Look how they massacred my boy" :D
---
&gt; 1) Does feign death interrupt casts of enemy players?
---
It does.
---
&gt; 2) What does feign death do in combination with shadowmeld (night elf racial)? Does it make you invisible in-fight? 
---
Feign death will put you out of combat, then shadowmeld will stealth you.
---
As far as the taskbar goes, what can't you remove? Mine is completely clean except the programs I use, and I can fully customize what system tray icons show up.
---
Thats actually my birthday so I could take it! :P
---
Anyone who says "it's ya boy" at the start of a video should he avoided at all costs. 
---
I don't know if he does that anymore, but the one video I saw of him a few years ago used that cringey intro.
---
if you only went 1-17, technically you were playing Cataclysm, not Battle for Azeroth. the only thing that got added for BFA to the Cata low level zones is those random item upgrades from quests and dungeons.
---
and what realm were you on? on Moon Guard, Ironforge is completely dead, people only go there to buy heirlooms...
---
Half of them will probably be DPS warriors. The poll probably should have Warrior twice to see the DPS vs Tank split.
---
You played mohaa?!
---
Doubt about that, they will probably cover the 'new remastered game' before an update. Even if it is a remaster it is something new for consumers and content consumers.
---
In a casual raid who are more concerned with filling slots than optimization, possibly. Ele is the least likely to get a spot though, for sure. That said, they're a great choice for PvP at 60.
---
Tell that to sodapoppin, or one of the other streamers which will all roll on PVP server
---
well, there's Joana's guide for horde side: https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
No bgs at the start means plenty of time to get that twink ready
---
“Don’t know where to go from there. A free legendary at 20?” 😂 this got me
---
So you aren't in a guild or doing endcontent but rather do content which most people do basically to relax a bit (yes twinking is considered mostly brain afking).
---
And based on that you make an opinion... That's imho a bad way of doing so.
---
I logged into BfA last night as well for the first time since release day. Waited over 30 minutes for a bg queue, nothing happened so I logged off.
---
Oh yeah, those were the times!
---
Walk slowly and carry a poisoned dagger
---
From what I've read / seen, Ele's biggest issue is going OOM very quickly (like the "oomkin") for enha this is less of an issue due to a lot of damage and utility being free or low cost in mana and thus usable throughout a fight.
---
Uh-oh
---
Polymorph is the prime solution, yeah.
---
    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times) 
---
While wanting to relive past  heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress  at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our  raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to  maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have  minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and  coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of  skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week  raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be  spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course,  doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to  burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming  consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over  rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders  of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership  experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)  Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP! 
---
    Loot Council 
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment. 
---
**Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)  Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)  Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

---
Also in my 'decades of experience playing MMORPGS in Europe' i've yet to experience a SWE who couldn't speak English, i therefore reckon at least 95% of them speak English.
---
I've never favourized any faction over the other, but I ended up mostly playing alliance, with a short stop on a tauren druid in BC. Went back to the blue team as a spacegoat warrior in WotLK, and after that Deathwing got all emo and shit, and destroyed the Warcraft that I loved.
---
This time I will be playing horde, not decided what class yet buy I've boiled it down to either a Tauren warrior or shaman, or an Orc warlock. Classic horde endgame is a blank space on my map and I really look forward to the Onyxia attunement questchain - finally Rexxar will be of use to me and not something you need to run around in big circles to prevent Misha from ripping me a new one 😎
---
pretty much, I'm considering unsubscribing until Classic is out. bored of BFA
---
Well a lot of deatils were added to the World, even after Legion (the pass between Anvilmar and Kharanos is blocked now, forcing you to fly straight there insted of walking / making your owm way for example), Animations changed, Character designes, ... were new as well. 
---
But of you are correct: Most of the mentioned points are in for quite some time now.
---
Nathrezim. European (German) PvP Server. But put together with at least 3-5 other ones. So there were at least 40-50 Players in IF last Evening.
---
Just about every area, except Silithus, I didn't like that, brings back wonderful memories - starting in Teldrassil, making my way via the Rutheran Village to Darkshore, moving down to Ashenvale, taking the boat to Menethil Village, getting chummed by a random rogue through the Wetlands through to the incredible bustle of Ironforge for the first time, then the Deeprun Tram to Stormwind (forgetting to get the flight point first time...rookie mistake), finally getting through Elwynn Forest and finally making it to my first instance in the DeadMines.

&lt;One Up&gt; Semi-Hardcore NA-PVP Alliance

About Us: One Up is a newly created raiding guild with a small core of players who have cleared all classic content and have a vast understanding of the game. We are fully committed to being as efficient as possible.We are seeking motivated players who are looking for a fun and competitive environment. Our focus will be on clearing content quickly and improving weekly. Our goal is to be one of the top guilds on the server we choose to play on.
---
Raid Information: Raid times will be 8:00-11:30 EST Tuesday/Thursday. We firmly believe that all 40 man content can be cleared in two days. With that being said we may add a third night to progression weeks in order to speed up the farm process if necessary. 20 Mans Will be done on off night weekly. Our loot system will be loot council that will take rank,performance,and attendance into consideration.
---
Recruitment: We are currently accepting all classes
---
Feel free to message me with any questions on here or at outcastcloud#6996 on discord
---
They'll be blocking API Calls that will help create addons like that.
---
Well your evidence is 'I saw some threads' which is far more tenuous. 
---
We'll have to agree to differ, but I think it's irrational to think you'll be hard pressed to find an English-speaking guild on English realms if that's what you're after.
---
AE spamming
---
you can't prove him wrong though
---
Haha, it makes me chuckle like a little kid again just by the thoughts of someone remembering the video by this description. I'm going to give it a try!
---
I personally think that some players who have never played Classic/Vanilla will try it and find the game play to be fun. I believe that in life people enjoy a challenge. That is only overshadowed in retail by the nagging feeling that you are not experiencing the game unless you are max level and the pressure to hurry through it. 
---
I think with that pressure removed that people will find it refreshing and find themselves discovering things they never knew existed.
---
&lt;**UNITY**\&gt; \[**OCEANIC**\] \[**Alliance**\] \[**PVP**\]

**Introduction**: We are an Australian based guild, with a few others around the world in our time zone. We welcome anyone who will be playing Classic Wow as an Alliance character. 
---
**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs](https://discord.gg/TWnNpEs)
---
**Realm** : Oceanic (realm TBA once the list is available)
---
**Realm Type**: PVP
---
**Faction**:  Alliance
---
**Region**: AUS - Oceanic
---
**Time zone**: Australian Eastern Daylight Time
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
**Loot Rules**: Loot council.
---
**Raiding Times**:  Weekends and some week nights - Again not set in stone but more than likely 6pm-12pmish. At the moment there looks to be multiple raids due to numbers. We will not restrict classes until after launch
---
**Intention**: We prioritize raiding and dungeons, PVP is secondary but will still be promoted.
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: Standard Non-Harassment Rules.  Just try to be respectful of the guild, have fun but not at someone else's expense. 
---
\*You don't need to be a raider to join either, while some of us will be taking time off at launch from work, many of us promote a work life balance especially those with families (myself included). If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
Paladins. Just bubblehearth away while you laugh at the scumbag rogue trying to gank you.
---
There were also new people (most had heirlooms, but some didn‘t) that level for the first time, also without a guild.
---
And seeing that there are 120 Levels to go through its quite an impotant factor. Only looking at the endgame would also not do it justice i think.
---
We’ll start them as soon as we have sufficient numbers but don’t feel like you need to rush. There’s only one opportunity to enjoy leveling to 60 with the masses on a fresh server so I’m encouraging members to play at a pace they enjoy

---
An ambitious redditor have compiled alot of guilds in here. 86 guilds recruiting in EU and out of those I think I counted 23 that were not ”English”. So roughly 60+ guilds that are for all english-speaking or about 2/3 guilds. Which makes sense imo
---
I'm mad they took away Gladiator Stance from Protection Warriors. I think that was in Legion? allowed you to DPS with sword and shield. people complained it was OP so they removed it.
---
also they took away the ability to dual wield single-handed weapons in Fury. now it's dual two-hand only. which is dumb. dual wielding 2 zweihanders makes no sense. if you want to have 2 short swords now, its rogue or nothing.
---
Strong arms warr with overpower, priests and warlocks.
---
Ooh another bday, someone else had theirs the 26th. Mine is the 21st so happy birthday in advance to all of us! Let's hope classic is out by then. ;P
---
If you're referring to world pvp where a Rogue stealth up to you and blows his CD load all of your unsuspecting body, then I'm sorry but nothing really counters that in Vanilla.
---
In a fair fight lots of classes can fight Rogues though.
---
nice. now i just have to get from SW to feralas again to continue questing. but he didnt kill me. that will teach him a lesson!
---
Joana's guide is great and I personally use it, but the issue with it is that it's tuned for the Hunter class. I feel like there's situations where it would be more beneficial for less solo-friendly classes to grind and out-level content before doing.
---
Orc Warrior
---
Orc Hunter. Let that hardiness do its job...
---
Xfire and winamp.
---
You have 119 of levels to go through until you reach the endgame. Don't you think over a \*hundred\* levels ought to be enjoyable? If a game is absolute shit until you hit the end, I'd never play it
---
Do you know if we will again be able to FD to drop combat then battle rez with jumper cables?
---
That was actually my desktop foreground for pretty much all of 2007
---
Are you sure it interrupts the cast? I thought it just untargeted, so when the cast bar completes the spell fails to cast.
---
that doesn't just apply to BFA.
---
half the posts on this sub are about how people are gonna take weeks off work to speedlevel to 60 on Classic.
---
People would flip if there wasnt any notice a couple months before. Their target audience is a working class adult most likely. They need to take out vacation. Would be stupid af of them.
---
What did it say?
---
Shh shh shh shhh
---
Any class can use it, the only thing it doesn't cover is the class specific quest outside of warriors

They are excellent in group PvP if played as a support class as intended.

I wonder if it would be quicker to go auberdine -&gt; menethil -&gt; theramore -&gt; run to ratchet -&gt; BB -&gt; run to guru
---
To be fair, I resigned over the weekend. I’ve still got buddies in the mythic raid scene. So they take me into some m10s and the current raid on heroic. 
---
Sure my damage was garbo and I was certainly carried. But it was actually pretty fun, while in combat. Mechanics, when playing from ilvl 360, are real. Heroic BoD is like mythic bod at 360. 
---
Tldr had a good time, will likely keep playing causal, getting gear and maybe even raiding mythic—at least till classic comes out and I can level (my first love).
---
Gonna b streaming i assume
---
Trade chat was never productive. Don't kid yourself. It will still be meme city and renewed Chuck Norris and anal jokes.
---
Right, class quests are always kinda fun to figure out by myself anyway, plus there will be tons of class specific content a bit closer and on release. Thanks for the quick response.
---
Orc Warrior should beat a rogue every time.
---
Could it be chronicles of the gold farmer?
---
Except polearms (which cost 1 gold), they're all 10 silver. Which isn't a huge amount, so I wouldn't worry about it. Just make sure you have the appropriate weapon skills leveled (i.e. the weapon skill of the weapon you're using) before you enter a dungeon. Paladins start with 1-handed and 2-handed maces, aye. 
---
If you are concerned about it, IIRC the most efficient leveling weapons for Paladins are mostly 2H hammers and 2H swords, so all you'd have to do is spend 10 silver for the sword training. Perhaps pick up 1H swords too, if you plan on tanking lower level dungeons (much, much rougher for Paladins early on than Warriors or Druids though). Then if you get an amazing Axe later on, that 10 silver won't really be a big issue.

nelf for alliance, undead for horde
---
Wasn't the last blue post last week? And today is Monday, so . . When did they 'just stop' with no warning?
---
You'd have to look it up by google or something. Though I think the only server/datacenters in Europe is Paris and Frankfurt, which probably doesnt make too much of a difference from Israel.
---
Now that's a name I haven't heard in ages.
---
Wrong maps but otherwise pretty nice
---
I like how the priests have different deities they get their powers from. Nightelves have Elune, I'm not sure about dwarves though, maybe it's also the Light or perhaps one of the titans? I'm not well versed in the priest lore hehe.
---
If it's your first time or your used to retail 1-20 &gt;# probably close to a day of played time

---
**🤝 How to join**
---
Contact me through Discord! My handle is : Strift#0812
---
*Au revoir,*
---
Yes, that will be possible.
---
Yeah I see what you’re saying. Looks like I’ll be healing 5 man’s until I can get yank gear that outgears the content.
---
In a scenario where a rogue can actually get the jump on a hunter, the rogue will probably end up winning unless he can trinket, intimidate stun, and then wing clip to safety. But the main reason a hunter will counter rogues is due to having many ways to catch a rogue out while stealthed. Flares, traps, DoTs, aggressive pets, hunters mark and track hidden, and I may be missing others. Tldr; hunters have a large toolkit to make a rogue have a hard time.
---
I like tanking. Is warrior the best and only option?
---
I was curious if there was more context to the quote, so I looked into it:
---
Before he made the statement in the OP he said:
---
["Tomorrow we do have something big \[...\],it is classic wow related but it's more to do with me... me and the stream"](https://clips.twitch.tv/SlickGiantPeppermintPartyTime)
---
Followed by the statement from the original post:
---
["If you are in the EU, tomorrow, on WoW [...] the words 'Classic WoW' will proabably be on your launcher."](https://www.twitch.tv/mrgm/clip/TubularCrackyPoultryFreakinStinkin)
---
Then he reiterated that it's not what most people think by saying: 
---
["It's not quite what you think though."](https://clips.twitch.tv/EphemeralSwissShrewTheTarFu)
---
So don't expect a beta start for tomorrow just yet. 
---
If I'd have to guess based on the statements he made, I'd say we'll probably get an update from Blizzard regard a beta next week. The update will appear on the official launcher and streamers like MrGM and Towellie might do some beta key giveaways.

Hardcore | NA | Horde PVP

Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST. 
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.  
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

---
Loot Council / DKP Combo
---
Recruiting: A Couple Officer Positions / All Classes / Absorbing Small Guilds
---
\*\*Intro:\*\*
---
Not the Face was initially created in 2007 as a semi-troll / PVP guild on Destromath-US. A server wide forum post was made claiming that NTF, as well as many other PVP Guilds, were incapable of progressing in high end raiding. As the servers top PVE Guilds were just closing in on Illidan NTF combined with many other pvp guilds and tore through ALL of the TBC content in a matter of weeks. NTF is now reforming for Classic WoW in 2019. A Horde Guild with an overall goal of PVE and PVP destruction; NTF plans to accomplish everything that Classic has to offer. Our goals include everything from acquiring all legendary weapons to running 24/7 High Warlord grind teams. Scarab Lord titles to camping STV to farm angry posts on the server forums. We plan to accomplish our goals by providing structure and guidance for what would regularly be a rag-tag group of washed up has been wannabes.
---
\*\*Expectations:\*\*
---
We require a 90% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. 18+ / We swear, drink, laugh and have a good time. Not a good place for children. Please have a plan for leveling. Requesting days off is not required. But is recommended.
---
\*\*Schedule:\*\*
---
We raid PST evenings generally starting at 5pm. Raids will be 3 times a week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. These times are subject to change during progression.
---
When honor is released we will be running a 24/7 premade for HWL farming. We have a few no lifers whom want to accomplish this goal for some reason. Though this is not required by any means.
---
If you have any questions feel free to talk to us on our forums, in-game or on discord (oheyspun#1337)
---
Imagine starting a sentence with the word 'imagine' in 2019
---
Back in vanilla, our raid druids ran downranked Healing Touch specs for raiding.  Including me.  HoTs were mana wasters, rarely used in our raids.  Healer mana drained faster in original vanilla it seems and innervates were literal mana from heaven for raid priests.  The DPS levels on private servers seems so overscaled and broken that healer mana levels aren't the issue they should be...
---
It should interrupt the cast immediately, at least I recall getting chain lightning interrupted with it on a frequent basis. It was one of the abilities more prone to lag though, that's for sure.
---
as someone who works 3rd shift this is really appealing. but im only capable of certain days. Iron out your raid days so I can hopefully apply!
---
Yup! That should be possible.
---
Yes, i think so too. Challange makes it more rewarding. 
---
If you have to sweat your way through a 1.5h Ragefire Casm run with 2 wipes, just to get one blue item then you will treasure that item and actually feel like you acomplised something.
---
If sou sleep your way through a 20min RF run with one guaranteed rare drop, one reward at the end and one updates to epic even, for no reason ... there is no semse of pride and challange what so ever. Participation Trophy. Eceryone gets some.
---
I wouldn't care, so long as it was clearly marked, because I absolutely do not want to play on a wtfbbqmegaserver.
---
&gt;If they decide to do a closed beta akin to Hearthstone's closed beta with its beta keys given out by streamers, this subreddit might quickly become the most hostile place on the internet.
---
That's an understatement. That would be a really, really bad idea.
---
You can't counter it at the beginning of Vanilla when you don't have enough HP to not die in his stunlock.
---
But once you reach 4500+ HP you have a chance.
---
I am planning to main hunter on live with a warrior tank alt and a holy priest alt, all on Alliance.
---
If I get into beta, I might play priest or tank, just not my main.
---
Hi, /u/domlebo70
---
That’s awesome, another thing you could rewatch is the Myndflame videos like illegal danish. Classic.
---
But are you alliance or horde...  ?
---
For me I think it was just that I was constantly lagging. It seemed fun, but it was hard for me to get into cause I was either disconnecting or just not able to see what was happening properly.
---
you sound like a salty scumbag
---
After 1.7? 1.8? it couldn't be interrupted by players anymore, but it can still be resisted by mobs. Which is at least the case until WOTLK, I think in retail it still can be actually.
---
This desktop theme used to just be on the wow website, i had it too. It was kinda hidden in a media section of the site where you could download wow themed wallpapers and stuff. Idk if it’s possible to get it now for windows 10 but I’m sure someone could figure it out if they haven’t already.
---
Trust me I googled it too lol.
---
A little bit, aye!
---
huge guide, very helpful.
---
Hopefully you make one for the horde as well! :)
---
Running away isn't a counter lol
---
Battlefield Vietnam.. Dope..
---
Only Josh but he’s already said he’ll be playing on a NA realm.
---
skipped ahead.... if I understood his rambling... he from lvl 33-37 ish he opened 161 Junkboxes and gained 25 gold....
---
Clearly its Telrasil &gt; Darkshore &gt; Ashenvale &gt; Barrens &gt; Durotar &gt; Grom'gol &gt; BB
---
now if only you could avoid being murdered by guards constantly.
---
Teamspeak. Still the best voip client around.
---
how would Blizzard even enforce that though? this is why streamers are hated, there's no way to stop them if they infect your server with their radioactive AIDS cancer. you either have to deal with it or find a new server.
---
Depends what you're looking to get out of it. Arguably, Druids make for the best dungeon tanks as they generate more threat and damage. Their issue is capping defenses for raids, so most will end up going with warriors for raiding. It is possible to get an Off-tank spot as a Feral Druid, depending on your guild, but the safest bet for raid tanking is undoubtedly a warrior.
---
Did someone say [Close to 10 DPS] 🤣
---
BiS confirmed.
---
If u want money go brd or dmn or east

\#nochanges
---
this, we can beg for #NoChanges to the game all we want, but the (real) world changed, and there's no stopping that.
---
Mmmh Barrens-&gt;BB seems quicker and less of a pain, boat from ratchet.
---
I could follow the coast from theramore to ratchet but it involves lots of swimming and I'm not sure that it's quicker
---
(It was a joke, I dont think taking a level 10 alliance within shitting distance of the horde capital on launch day is a good idea)
---
That looks very similar, but going by the voice in my memory this is coming from a different uploader, but thanks for the tip. I will watch his series as well!
---
Not sure how tall you are but those monitors look low for the seat height. 
---
You could end up with back/neck pain from looking downwards all day
---
Is that chair comfortable
---
Like Swifty. He has half a million followers and he's known for warrior PvP. Wtf is his server gonna look like? He's all about his fans. Blizzard sponsors his silly gaming house so he can invite fans over for gaming fests and shit. They should just give him his own server and they can all fuck off to it
---
Why would you be hearthed in SW if you're questing in Feralas?
---
none of that matters i won’t even be touching anything related to PVP. only questing and dungeons to 60 and if possible in the future raiding.
---
Wrong era WoW map too
---
Probably running to Ratchet, as you only need to run across 3 zones: Darkshore, Ashenvale, Barrens.
---
The other route would have you running the Wetlands, Loch Modan, Dun Morogh, Elywnn Forest, and Duskwood.
---
Booty Bay places you closer to Gurubashi Arena than entering into northern STV does, too.
---
Question, as I haven't played WoW in a very long time: can't you just get yourself killed in Darkshore and Wisp your way either to the closest GY to Ratchet, or straight up across the ocean and to the nearest GY to BB, pay the res sickness, and do it that way? Makes you a bit faster as Wisps move faster than normal ghosts.
---
Lok'tar
---
Fucking Alliance favoritism. Cant kill us with your own Ret Paladins?
---
These lotr paintings look gorgeous!
---
"emerge from the shadows" 😂
---
Could you apply this to a human mate this guide ?
---
nice link!
---
He's only asking for a few servers not all of them. The dev team already said the population they picked was because of technical limitations. By the end of vanilla there were servers with higher caps than the originals. 
---
It's actually blizzlike to have servers with different caps.
---
A lot of people have a active subscription and only a few get beta invites. I know for BFA I got a beta key from Mr. Gm. I just hope classic will have a open beta for the stress test.
---
I'm so jealous of all you guys.
---
Yup, Omen is enough and even that you don't need for the first several hours of playtime
---
Playing on EU servers would probably be your best bet. Midnight pacific time is like 5 PM on the European realms which gives you a little bit of prep time before raids.
---
This isn’t accurate though. This rogue used every trick he could possibly think of in order to get him to pop cooldowns or make a mistake. 99.9% of rogues won’t be able to do this
---
I used to play on a medium/high pop server during vanilla and really don’t see any reason to increase server population. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? It will require additional tampering with respawns, mob density and other parameters which will alter the experience.
---
Low level items can titanforge to epic? I thought they could only upgrade to blue. That's craziness. Epics really lost the value they used to have.
---
Are you sure it was on Youtube and not the more popular video.google service or warcraft movies?
---
What, no gamespy and link to quake mod folders? Def not my desktop back then.
---
I just got my SL Titan last week.  Best chair I've ever sat in.  Things ganna be great for classic poopsocking.
---
White Rabbit blaring while on the loading screen. Also Jimi Hendrix, what a soundtrack!
---
&gt; upgraded from rare to epic (I know, this sounds made up but it really is true).
---
Yeah, it is. Basically any item that you receive from quests and system rewards can get an upgrade - I've had green rings turn into epic items. It's like the designers don't even understand why items had such a draw in Vanilla: They were items with a story, a personality, a quirk: They were unique (going all the way from Doan's Robe to Atiesh), had some kind of idea behind their creation (even if it was a silly one, like the Six Demon Bag). Having them meant having some small piece of the history and lore of Azeroth, even if the item itself wasn't perfect from its stat allocation. An item isn't interesting just because it's purple.
---
Two blue daggers!
---
A Rogue that gets a fair drop on you and pops CDs to kill you is probably going to kill you either way. If you know the Rogue is there then Hunters are the best anti-Rogue class.
---
Lol I haven't played since WoD but I can't imagine people were excited for that xpac
---
Man, Name is a REALLY popular name in Azeroth...
---
Did the R13 helmet give paladins blue eyes or have you converted it to a DK? :d
---
Wow glad to see you are doing classic content, I remember watching your TERA videos like 8 years ago "boop!"
---
2142 was amazing, get outta here
---
Assuming they recreate the resurrection logout bug, then yes as long as you log out and back in at some point once you’re dead.
---
Everyone will prob. get in Beta.
---
&gt; FAP/LAP potions every time u face classes that stun etc, and its on a 2 min cd.
---
Do keep in mind this doesn't remove any existing effects. So if a rogue cheap shots you, for instance, you can't remove it. Additionally, a Mage could Polymorph you or a Rogue could Blind you to have it run its course for instance.
---
Playing on the insta 60 server Druid’s can handle rogues decently. That’s even with prep and all cool downs being used, but this is assuming the rogue opens on you in bear form. But it’s also assuming that every rogue CD is up and they have improved sprint.
---
Lol, our prized blessed blade has fallen so far....
---
&gt; The point I am making is that so many players are underestimating how hard it is to get into Naxx and kill the bosses. 
---
I actually think a lot of players overestimate how hard it is to get into Naxx and killing bosses.
---
Technical limitations ended up informing aspects of the game, like spawn rates. More players means higher spawn rates for everything. 
---
I'm not saying they won't, I'm saying the safest play is to keep it to the pop caps that governed Vanilla's lifespan, which was generally around 2.5k for normal times with a limitation of 4k if necessary.
---
Even if they do opt for bigger servers, I strongly expect they'll just opt for the higher ends of Vanilla's days, not 10k megaservers.
---
Store info please!!! PM :)
---
Mods delete please, to much good information I need to keep to myself.
---
If hunters attacked me first it was a 50/50, but if I could attack the hunter first it was more like 90/10.
---
As a Rogue, I'd say Orc Hunter or Orc Warrior was the toughest. Because of the resistance towards stuns.
---
Horde, but both banners were sold together so i couldn't not hang them both.
---
Now that you mention it, I believe it was [video.google](https://video.google). They had [this](https://www.gabrielserafini.com/images/blog/Picture-26.jpg) grey interface at the time, correct? That means it was on Google yes!
---
You are to quick, I was about to post this for you!
---
&gt; So it cant be that bad xD
---
I don't know. I subbed for a month or two, and the only thing I really enjoyed were the visuals of the new zones. The "things to do" were pretty much like a job - log in every day to do your Emissary, because if you don't, you miss out on that sweet rep (so, relying on FOMO). Churn resources through my garrison for those still-competitive Hexweave Bags. Use the daily CD to turn Herbs into Cloth, etc. etc.: It was basically busy work, finely tuned so you basically *had* to log in every day for an hour or so.
---
Point being: I think a lot of people play not because they genuinely enjoy the game; They play because they feel they would lose out if they *stopped*.
---
Well, it's not like paladins are much easier with freedom cleanse and judgement of justice on their pocket warr
---
Wow, will definitely be using this with the fiancé to power lvl , that is if this guide is efficient with duos as well? Very well put together and easy reading.. thanks!!
---
&gt; experiencing the current state of the game again      
---
No, you experienced what is about equal to 1-5 in vanilla and not really anything concerning bfa.      
---
Say what you want about Your experience, but that's not what a new player would experience, without heirlooms/pets/mounts/knowledge etc.
---
I actually had a lot of fun leveling in bfa, mostly because it was new and shiny content, my fun grounded to a halt when it got repetitive at max level.
---
There's atleast 6 from the UK who have announced it. There is people from all over EU.
---
Everyone speaks English in chat though.
---
Well this was a unique idea for a video
---
Were you otherwise tied to only being allowed to Spirit Res at the nearest GY to your death?
---
Those were in WoD. I mained Glad Stance all the way through the expansion and a couple bosses into mythic HFC, it was a lot of fun. Same with Single Minded Fury, I preferred 1H swords since I got an uber warforged 735 Dalrend clone from mythic UBRS. They removed both because they didn't want to spend extra time trying to balance them. :-/
---
you come back with a hunter friend and find that dude! he's prolly ganking someone else so if you put out a call you'll get an idea of the rogue's whereabouts
---
thats the wonderful thing about a rogue, though. Due to stealth, a rogue needs never engage when it isnt an advantageous fight. 
---
A rogue should win most fights he chooses to begin, and honestly should lose most when he gets jumped. 
---
So sure some classes he would have a hard time with, but he can always just not engage--or wait till they are 50% hp.
---
But thats being a rogue, not allowing yourself use of your toolkit and asking "what am I strong/weak against" is fucking dumb, rogues are strong vs all classes because the rogue chooses when the fight starts (this is for real pvp, not dueling...that said what class is always dueling? rogues)
---
That's the one. Unfortunately most videos on here are now lost.
---
Google merged the content onto Youtube eventually but many videos have been claimed by copyright and without account holders to login to old video.google accounts to amend videos for publishing most will remain lost.
---
Ya I don't support many mega servers but if they made one and all the try hard pvpers and streamers all went there, wouldn't you like that?
---
It's not. It was made specifically for a certain software which the WoW website gave a link to. 
---
Basically was an all in one config tool that auto set all yours stuff like the old win 98 themes. But third party instead.  
---
The software was never ported to anything except for what it was made for, which was XP and as the Windows OS' that came after were different you couldn't just install it and have it work out of the box.  
---
I tried getting it to work on 7, 8.1, and 10.  Its possible if you can track down the software you MIGHT be able to get it to work by manually tweaking it  but I could never find a guide for it and was unable to get it to work when I tried.
---
Yep - I have the cloth one. It's super stable for reclining too if you just want to watch a movie as well. I get a good amount of buyers remorse on products but the chair is totally worth it.

I'm not rolling on an RP server so my main's backstory will be: "he spawned as a level 1 after being made on the character screen".

---
What big private servers guilds? Because 90% of them are EU not NA
---
I'm not pretending to know the perfect sweet spot.  
---
What I do know is how quiet a 2k online server after the initial rush has died down and everyone hits 60. Levelling zones are dead quiet, people raid-log, it's sad.
---
a 10k online was personally what I loved but I understand if others wouldnt want to compete for quest mobs and such. 
---
I think in general players would appreciate some middle ground
---
Auch :-(.

I'd prefer they recreate Vanilla as faithfully as possible. I don't agree with "Almost vanilla, but please include my christmas list of changes I feel would benefit me".

It's probably just a regional/country issue. I have never heard of gaming clubs at the universities I studied at over here, for instance. Well, except things like chess. In fact, as a current psychology student of 4 years I think I've met a grand total of 3 people who even play video games. Different crowd, that's for sure. On the flipside, when I studied biology gamers were very common.
---
I'd wager more people are pumped about Vanilla right now because of pservers growing the playerbase. And those who played both, in my experience, the diehard fans, love the 10k experience. Watered-down community is your opinion not everyone else's
---
As a classic player who keeps dabbling in BfA I kinda feel what you mean.  The game is different to what it was at classic.  That's probably the end result of years of expansions, but even then some changes like the random equipment upgrades just feel... wrong.  It's basically RNG on top of RNG.  Because of that there's no sense of gear progression.  No going "well I need to run this dungeon now for this upgrade" because you're relying on a cache to drop the right, titanforged piece.  
---
And don't get me started on how antisocial people are.  Even random groups for world quests barely speak.  Final Fantasy XIV is nothing like this.  People create linkshells (chat rooms) for various things such as reporting hunts.  All the cities are bustling.  It's not like what classic WoW was, but it's still miles better than current WoW.
---
The only time people seem to speak in current WoW is to have racist/sexist/homophobic tirades in trade chat.
---
Having 10k available for people to self-select into wouldn't hurt anybody else
---
Warrior to 60 in 5 days /played with 4 professions maxed?

That's a huge (X) Doubt from me, considering that the WR in vanilla leveling on a Hunter, the fastest leveling class, is 4 hours short of 5 days even without professions.

Yes, the official Classic forums have a bunch of posts. They're mixed in with other discussion posts and it's a busy forum so they get moved quickly, but just scroll and you'll find more. Definitely a bunch of good guilds posting, there.

If you do not want to heal make it easier on yourself and do not play a healing class.
---
&gt; Last but not least: [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] has 8.5 DPS in the current version of the Game. That was the point at which i stopped playing ...
---
Should not matter at all to you, since its still the highest dps of all vanilla swords - they've just scaled everything down because else numbers in BFA would be in the gazzilions by now.
---
Unless, well... you are just looking for nostalgia.
---
Don't you get a free character boost up to 110 though when you buy the expansion as a new player? At least I did in legion. Leveled from 100 to 110 and really enjoyed it. 
---
Tried leveling from 0, and that was pretty booring like OP describes.
---
From my research it appears their rotation is simpler, and they are easier to hold threat with in lower level dungeons. 
---
I think they’re perfect for a casual.
---
Your high pop servers modify spawn rates for nodes and mobs. The nost core that the large pservers use even has custom node spawns. So yeah they modify nothing but player cap.
---
Mkay?
---
PM me too pls :)
---
We're getting "almost vanilla" talents, items, and spell/boss mechanics. I'm not saying use that as an excuse to fudge more stuff but if it helps the average server put then great.
---
If you've ever ranked up to R10 on a private server you would have met some of the rankers. Im fine with paying with these guys I'm just gonna point out that the average player isn't going to want to be anywhere near them. I actually don't think a 10 k server is good for that server. It's good for all the other ones.
---
I was hoping for more of a rally, but it didn’t happen haha.
---
You have plenty of goals you can do while leveling. For level 80 it could be the achivement herald of the titan, for level 89/90 a maxed out farm in pandaria, for level 99/100 maxed garrison etc.
---
But you don't need that much time to level anyways. If you do it chilled you can do that in like one week and still have the enjoyment of some well written questlines and exploring the world's.
---
What about raiding though?
---
Thats so true! And an item is not valuable because its purple, it gets value if it is actually hard and challenging to get ... not just if its a random upgrade on an already good item, that is easily available.
---
Sorry I edited my post to answer that!
---
I was hoping for more of a rally,  but it didn’t happen haha.

Hmm Strange that nobody metion a Frost mage.
---
Blink Gets you out of stuns
---
IB break every hard CC ( Blind included)
---
Nova to pin him in place
---
Cold Snap to get those 2 back 
---
Plenty of aoe to get the rogue out of stealth 
---
FireB rank 1 to leave a dot so the rogue can't restealth 
---
FrostB rank 1 to kite ad vitam eternam (remember no shadow cloak in vanilla)
---
Sure that's a lot of CD blown to deal with the rogue, but rogues are also heavy reliant on CDs 
---
Bonus: Throw into the equation first aid with the anti venom dispel and the rogue wouldn't be able to even stuck to you 
---
And Inge (but both could have it)
---
&gt;there were a lot of people playing, quite possibly enjoying and obviously even paying money for that game.
---
So you think this because the world is populated around you even at low levels.  Like hey the world isn't empty there's so many people playing here!  But then remember, it's possible that literally every single person in that zone playing in your entire region is who you're seeing.  We're used to seeing people and going "wow that's a lot of people" because it's just your server.  However, now the game pushes you together so you can feel like there are other people, but how many of them were on your server?  Probably very few to none.  
---
I don't want to join in on the retail bashing because I'm still playing BFA and enjoying it a lot actually.  However, the leveling experience in the game is horrid for new players like you're saying.  There's no adventure!  I don't mind the leveling process as an experienced player because hey I just want another 120 right?  It's easy and fast and I'm jaded already so it doesn't bother me.  But as an introduction to wow?  Fuck that.  I tell my friends to use the boost and just start at 110.  Even that is poor but it makes a lot more sense as a new game.  Starting at level 1 for new players is awful and that's not a good thing for this type of game..  It's a hard line to strike from a developers POV, I get it.  There's 119 levels for these people to get and way too much world to show them and if you make it too long of a process most people will be missing out on where you spend all your major development hours.  But the game does suffer from the lack of leveling and adventures.
---
Same.
---
Np man, i appreciate it. Thanks
---
Using Perplexity as an example is ridiculous, considering the things he can do... I'd wager 99.5% of all Classic players would never be able to do the things he can. AND, this is against an incredibly skilled Warrior too.
---
Average players, Warrior should do quite well against Rogue.
---
&gt;BRD - can't be AoE farmed other than some dogs
---
[No you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGyF-wV-IFoNo)
---
[Those](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8894/anvilrage-medic) guys are the reason so-called "arena farm" won't be available, [those](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8890/anvilrage-warden) are famous net guys in the circle right after you enter the dungeon.
---
But, as you can see, [Guardsmans](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8891/anvilrage-guardsman) and [Footmans] (https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=8892/anvilrage-footman) doesn't have an ability to somehow interrupt you. Just farm those.

Stormwind

Just a mercenary who hates his ears so he will always wear a big ass helmet to hide them. Very picky about work due to strong black and white morals. Prefers two handed axes.
---
Some guilds have offTank BearTanks.  
---
But mostly 1, and maybe 1 on the reserve list.  
---
Try to get that spot, within a Casual guild.  
---
Or else you will be doing PUGS and i wish you good luck on that. it will be tough, with 40 people on a PUG  
---
(im glad i already have a guild and i wont have to PUG, thank god.) MC is kinda PUGable not so sure about BWL tho.  
---
If you don't intent on joining a guild, you will have a hard time i guess.
---
Very clean
---
Don’t tell me how to feel.
---
Also love Feralas. The green as you mentioned along with the wildly varying terrain. I feel like there was a lot more height and depth to the area making it different. Still remember a random horde warrior seeing me struggle to solo the chicken quest (I was ally and on pvp server) and helped me get that thing all the way to the coast. Still one of my best vanilla memories.
---
I honestly don't think that you have somewhat around 5000 gold when you first start WoW to have a heirloom set for your character.
---
I see that 120 levels are a big deal, I feel the same as you (currently leveling a priest and druid).
---
And since wotlk wow was about endgame content. At least from there on most stuff was unlocked at max level.
---
In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing.
---
Mannnn I was all about that team snipers!
---
I havent been in a guild for like 3 4 years now. Best advice on how to get a spot in one now?
---
No! B-but... private servers bad! :(
---
I’ll have to check that, I think they do though.
---
Yes officer, this comment right here.
---
Faction Fluid Player looking for a guild whose raid time align with my awkward availability. I live in the US but am willing to play in any region. I have no realm type preference, really and my availability is as follows;
---
Oceanic- Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 4pm-10pm aest 
---
Eu- Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 7am-1pm cet 
---
US- Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 1am-7am cdt
---
I may be able to start a couple hours sooner, but these are times I will 100% be ready to start the first pull of the night. 
---
I’m willing to roll Druid as long as I can feral tank, otherwise I’d prefer Warlock. I’m willing to be a little flexible, however. I wouldn’t mind playing Mage or Priest but it wouldn’t be my preferred class. 
---
I know my availability sucks, but it doesn’t hurt to try, right? Anyway feel free to send me a PM for more info.
---
Once a Warrior gets decent gear he will steamroll pretty much any equally geared Rogue, no matter who gets the jump. It's pretty much the anti-Rogue class.
---
A good Hunter, which there were almost none of during Vanilla, will also have a strong chance of beating a Rogue that gets the opener.
---
Mages and Warlocks also have strong cases versus Rogues, but aren't as heavily favoured as the other two classes. If they are played well and efficently they will be able to outplay most Rogues.
---
0/10
---
You got a free 100 boost when legion released I believe maybe that’s when they did it
---
Yeah it's a decent chair... Got the faux leather one because we also have a dog, and that dog claims things.  Figured it'd be easier to wipe down than the cloth one.
---
I also tried out the free trial that lets you play until 20. Now keep in mind I haven't played since the end of Cata. I rolled a human warrior and started the same, set path that you mentioned. However, the biggest killer for me was that there was no sense of danger. I came around a corner in Elwynn and was face to face with about 5 defias members. In my mind I thought I was done for, but I cut through them without even dropping below half health thanks to self healing that now exists on a warrior. That was when I was done with retail wow. In vanilla you would have been as good as dead with that encounter, but in retail there is no danger and no threat of dying.
---
Well the problem is that they have confirmed summer 2019, and that is very close. People just want a release date so they can take time off work in advance. It could be the very last day of summer, but people would be happier knowing in advance is all, I think.
---
But I agree with you, there is a massive problem with the quantity&gt;quality business model that has been so heavily present in recent years, where companies feel the need to rush out incomplete games and then add on extra dlc later to further pad their pockets. It’s definitely a cancer on the gaming industry and it would be nice to remove that tumor.
---
That being said, release date when? 😄
---
I wish i could have that theme in Windows 10
---
Really like your bag-end LOTR picture. Where did you get that! Also, love the desk. Also ALso, I have that IKEA chair too. It's great! 10/10 would buy again. I don't need a race car seat. Look tacky IMO.
---
At this point I think I'm going to end up having to make my own, I haven't seen 1 guild that matches what I'm looking for.
---
It really kicks the Llama's ass
---
Oof you like to live dangerously?
---
Retail bad.
---
do you need this kind of Power house computer to play classic wow lol? shouldnt it run perfectly just on a 970?
---
I checked a few noteworthy 1H swords between vanilla and retail to compare the itemization smash.
---
Forsaken Shortsword is an early white quest item. 2.14 dps vanilla, 1.05dps retail.
---
Feral Blade is a green sword that is available in limited quantity in Crossroads, usually it's the first easy to get upgrade you can have, since it requires level 8. 6.92dps in vanilla, 1.7dps in retail.
---
Legionnaire's/Protector's sword, available from the WSG vendors. I used the level 38 version. 29.2dps vanilla, 6.2 dps retail.
---
And then Thunderfury. Big ol 53.9 dps in vanilla, 8.5 dps in retail. wah wah

---
I really, really hopeful of one.  But on the other hand, I've been playing the shit out of Mordhau and really getting in to it, so another few weeks to binge that game is okay with me, too.
---
If you wanna be a main/offtank for a guild thats a requirement of being there a majority of the time/fully consumed etc. Unless you've found a guild to roll with i wouldnt get hopes up unless you wait for some pugs to start.
---
&gt;design decision
---
It wasn’t though
---
Yup pretty much this.
---
Nice
---
Felwood. 
---
Between Jaedenar and Farmington satyrs at 60 you spend some time here. Also, Felwood marks the beginning of the end. When you get to Felwood you’ve got Winterspring, EPL, WPL, and odds and ends in ungoro left to go. 
---
That and I’ve always loved the gloomy feel.
---
This is like writing "I'm okey with Pedophilia and you should be too.." No one will agree with you man.. 🙍‍♂️
---
I was flipping through the guide a couple months ago and there are references to the other classes for unique quests and important items and stuff. Which does help a bit
---
MrGM posted a picture of a Vanilla Coke on his twitter and said he was going to have this on Wednesday this week.
---
This isn't just pserver vs live, it's a difference within pservers as well. Most of those players over on the rhymes-with-sonos servers say one of the reasons they play there is to avoid the shitshow of Blights Nope.
---
I don't really want a beta either, but a release date would be nice, if you really wanna play the early lvls just go on a vanilla private server, it's not like there will be new content like the beta of new xpacs and playing the first few lvls over again when it actually release isn't that much fun.
---
I really like it and I’m envious
---
Do you really wanna downrank CoC though? Isn't it pretty eficient in terms of dpm and a nice instant aoe blast in tight spots?
---
You can always realm transfer if you find yourself on a realm full of streamers... im sure Blizzard wont remove the ability to do that just for Classic as it makes them $$$$
---
&gt;and all the try hard pvpers and streamers all went there
---
I'd love that so i would be sure not to have those guys on my server !
---
vQueue is mostly used on modern pservers to scrape the General/World channels and organize the LFG spam by instance. I have no problem with that because it helps me avoid staring at the chat window for long periods of time. I don't consider staring at a small chat window in hopes that there \*could\* be something relevant to be in the spirit of vanilla/classic. 
---
The other aspect of vQueue is that a group leader can somewhat automate the process of organizing a group, and provides a "wait list" for people to list themselves as interested - to me, this aspect of vQueue goes beyond the spirit of vanilla/classic because it replicates functions the player can take care of on their own, maintaining lists for each role etc.
---
Dwarves were taught the Light by Humans. The Bronzebeards, at least. The Wildhammer Clan is shamanistic in nature.
---
I may agree, however I'm not saying anything else because I don't want to trigger people further and I don't want to be attacked by impatient fans.
---
Nobody is going to buy your boe on a fresh server..
---
EU, Horde, Normal server, Athens/Bucharest time zone, looking for a spot in your raiding team and also im looking for friends.
---
I wanna play druid feral tank, im softcore lets say, im at university so during summer time im free as a bird. Just wanna tank dungeons and raids, help out new players (ive played since wotlk) and make friends.
---
You can PM me for more info, theres no problem.
---
Peace bois
---
They do.
---
I agree.
---
hype died for me anyway, so they should at least finish it properly.
---
Any mage will have an easy time with a rogue.  Unless the rogue outgears outleveks you enough to one shot the mage
---
Welcome to the club buddy.
---
Doubtful since it's legal in Retail. I am with you but I don't see it happening.
---
Can't exactly say for the pvp -side of things, but atleast for PVE, a lot of the gear you'd want as a healer, only have +healing, so they wont be all that great for when you're playing shadow.
---
That's not to say you cant use that gear, its just not as good as it could be. Some gear will have both +healing &amp; +damage, so those would work for both - they just often are weaker than pure healing or pure damage items.
---

---
For the first, no, you can't do the spam key, AFAIK. For the second, I'm not sure.
---
Kkona!
---
oh, I thought everything was +dmg/healing, thanks for the info
---
Definitely the best - clean, and no BS.
---
**Eminence** \[NA\] \[H\] \[PST\] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we’ve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
**Loot:**
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP based loot council loot system in order to provide the most fair and streamlined loot in raids.
---
**Recruitment: (Experienced and Dedicated Warriors Needed!)**
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through  discord). We are 40+ members strong!
---
**Raid days and times** (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!

Yeah, doing some raids and M+ is pretty fun, but everything outside of that (or arena) is basically just a lobby where you wait until you can get in to your next instanced content. The world itself has no real impact on anything.

Fulfilling the Horde dream of being a heroic warrior. They are doing it for the honor of their friends and family.
---
Each class has only a single pvp set, which can be pretty obnoxious depending on your class. Sometimes its awesome, for example pvp druid gear is some of the best itemized hybrid gear in the game, where pvp shaman gear heavily leans to enhance. In the case of priest, the set is heavily towards shadow, stacking only int, sta, and spell damage. For pve healing you will want to run with various dungeon and crafted pve gear which will drastically outperform the pvp set when healing.
---
The big problem you will run into is that when raiding you'll be in competition with the warlocks and mages, and possibly even a dedicated shadow priest for gear, since unlike some other hybrid specs there isn't really any gear that screams shadow spec priority.
---
You definitely snuck in a Scholomance run too, judging from your [attire](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16686). :p
---
You won't be swapping between shadow and holy too often unless you farm gold on an alt to support your habit!
---
Also - you'll have a lot less gear than you're used to in retail - you won't have many pieces to swap between and your best pieces will be your best for both pve and pvp until you've logged a lot of time at 60. At that point you'll be answering these questions for yourself.
---
Dope
---
Beta: meh.
---
Release date: yes please!
---
I don't think you can to this extent sadly. Unless someone has already done the work for you to import whivch I doubt sadly. 
---
Can always try doing it yourself though.
---
Thanks, Matt Ferguson was the artist of those prints ;)
---
He's a multi-millionaire. Doing more than fine. It's one of the few cons that comes with the job
---
in that case, warriors are great
---
"y'all" downvoted
---
Yes really. That video is garbage and cuts a million times. An Orc Warrior with all CD’s should beat a Rogue with CD’s  9/10 times. 
---
I would absolutely dominate every rogue that faced in Classic. The only class that was scary was Warlock or a great Frost Mage and that was only when I couldn’t 2 shot either one.
---
Just a thought, but when my warrior got ~55 in vanilla I started spamming dungeons as a tank. It was slow progress on experience, but I got a lot of good gear. Most groups were so desperate for a tank they took me even though my level wasn’t ideal. When I hit 60 I basically had almost all blues and was ready to step into MC without being a liability.
---
This simultaneously warms and crushes my heart. I had this XP theme, too. It makes all the folders look like Runecloth bags, right? Does this exist for modern windows? I'd pay money for it.
---
I like the vibe and styling of those Wallpapers but not the actual content haha
---
&gt;He estimated there were close to 100 people following him at one point.
---
WTF?  Why?  Do they do it just to fuck with him, or to "play with him?"
---
Yes it was. I've posted this proof more times than I can count. Google my name, reddit and 2500 if you're interested to learn the truth which I assume you're not since it won't fit your narrative.
---

haha, on my phone so getting the proper Swedish was kinda hard. I think the point came across :P
---
I edited it so I don't trigger more people :P
---
What.. our writing styles aren't similar in the least. You need help. God forbid someone agrees with me.
---
The only must have addon imo for leveling would be coordinates.
---
If you end up having to ask for directions, or try to meet up with somebody, or go somewhere for whatever reasons, players are unlikely to tell you "Go east until the big rock, then head north through the cave and follow the road until it turns south again."
---
They will just tell you the coordinates.
---
No I shouldn't. What a bs
---
Oh yeah bro all those views same as I've always had
---
If only! I ran a Blood Elf-only guild (RP server) back in TBC and not having warriors sure made raiding a massive burden. Sure, Prot Paladins got massive buffs compared to vanilla but were still often a questionable main tank choice. Had to team up with a similar race-exclusive guild to figure that out.
---
Sorry, this has been removed as a post largely unrelated to Classic (focusing on BFA without significant comparison or discussion to Classic) and/or circle-jerky.
---
&gt;If you are inviting people to see details of a product launch you are 100% having them sign an NDA.
---
Is there a law stating you need to do this or something?
---
The timing of it, a week before the Beta, seem to suggest Blizzard just want to spread some rumors and get people hyped.
---
It would make perfect sense to not have anyone sign any NDA's.
---
Sweet list of rogue gank spots. Thanks, OP.
---
It helps for sure, but the issue still arises that you may start tackling zones a few levels below their recommendation. 
---
For example (and IIRC) you first go to STV at 30 to start doing the Hemet Nesingwary quests. The first few kill quests the mobs are around level 30, but he has you finishing off with the first part of the Raptor mastery and they're level ~34. Easy for a Hunter, a nightmare for rogues and warriors.
---
I think a guide for the weaker leveling classes would focus a bit more on grinding, doing dungeon runs, and hitting certain quests later when they're all green to yellow. Having those few extra weapon levels on mobs really, really helps the melee classes.
---
Ironforge because it was the first city I visited and it was where my guildies and I spent the most time just loitering around.
---
You provide nothing of value to classic or retail if we’re being honest. You want to do a litmus test? See how many people would find you entertaining if you weren’t using someone else’s art to entertain them. Stop trying to further this narrative that content creators are some important team of people.
---
It’s the colors too, that purple haze, hot female guards and their “I wanna sex you up” voices too. It’s just A+++
---
Preaching to the choir.
---
&gt;I would not say "bad" generally, because there were a lot of people playing, quite possibly enjoying and obviously even paying money for that game. So it cant be that bad xD
---
Lots of people like Iggy Azalea, does that mean she's a good rapper?
---
Popularity =/= Quality. Just because lots of troglodytes like something doesn't mean it's good.

I started playing Vanilla around September 2005. I played a Warrior, Hunter and Rogue to 60 before clearing BWL several months before TBC was released. I played TBC at a relatively high level, quitting the game after clearing BT (before the release of Sunwell Plateau). Since then, I've played a little during every expansion however none of them have managed to keep my attention for more than a few weeks. I plan on rolling Hunter, however I'd be open to playing either Priest/Rogue/Warrior for the right guild. I'm 27 years old, work full-time as a web developer, and I'm from the UK.

Good advice below but I want to add that for characters that haven't been logged into for a while, they will not show up on the armory. So you will have to log into them for even that to show up. So I'd suggest just paying the $15 to buy a sub for one month and get the info.
---
&gt;It really doesn't work that way. Unless you sign an NDA
---
Well, there's absolutely no evidence that any NDA's where signed at all.
---
There’s multiple people who played mohaa? Boyyy all about those Brest days with a kar98. Remember freeze tag?
---
You said the sweet spot "in my opinion". That's what I'm replying to. You're saying the sweet spot is between 2k and 10k *for you*. That's a huge discrepancy and it doesn't clarify your stance in the discussion at all.
---
By the way I'm almost certain that ce flagged accounts will get their pets in classic. You selfish, jealous nerds will eat your words on release.
---
The Furbolg quests on launch are going to be such a PITA.
---
I, too, thought about running an alt to the arena on day 1, to log in every 3 hours and try to grab uncontested chests.
---
Then I realized there would probably be at LEAST 10 other players on each server doing the same thing, and decided against it.  Instead, I'll just get my bank/AH alt set up, and enjoy the launch.
---
But a streamer blinked three times and coughed an hour later... beta has to be confirmed to release in 3 days.
---
5 min CD
---
Honestly, and even I'm not perfectly happy with this, I (personally) would be happy if they came out with an almost September release date.
---
I live in what is normally a winter wasteland for 7 months a year. Would be fine to enjoy the summer then get into the classic grind when you don't want to be outside anyways.
---
Thanks CNN
---
Give me PVP or give me death.
---
thanks, exactly what I wanted to know, I will only pve as holy so I dont think competition for gear will be a real problem and the fact that there's only 1 pvp set is just easier as I dont have to make a choice
---
Terrible place for a funeral, though.
---
Yup. I think we were. And also people didn’t have good levelling builds for locks in actual vanilla. It was only pservers where I found to get Voidwalker threat talent and things like that, learned how to micro multiple mobs *while moving*. it can be pretty high skill cap but there’s nothing more satisfying than kiting 4+ mobs and watching them trickle off and die like nothing. Warlocks are beast!
---
Mulgore is one of the most peaceful zones imo. I'd even put it ahead of Teldrassil. Though it's close.
---
&gt;Cigarette packets in Europe carry somewhat harsh imagery to discourage their consumption and "quit smoking" campaigns, support, and alternatives are widely available. You can of course still opt for the cancer sticks if you wish. To probably shouldn't, but you have freedom of choice.
---
Trying to force people to be healthy doesnt work. My country stopped selling packs of 10 cigarettes in my country to make people smoke less, so now all you can get is packs of 20.
---
I used to smoke a pack of 10's in a week, thats about the time when the cigarettes went stale. Now I smoke 20 in a week because thats the only thing they let me buy. So dumb.
---
Reck-Bomb Paladin, choose to interrupt the stunlock at any point with bubble then slam the righteous shit out of em.
---
Ya that's what I'm getting at. If the pops are all the same the private server rankers/streamers will probably pick certain servers to group on. Most players won't be trolling old premade discord channels so will just end up rolling the dice. 
---
Just because toxicity existed and is technically blizzlike doesn't mean we need to encourage it on more servers.
---
Thanks, ive made a post. Wish me luck :)
---
Because Lok'tar ogar! Thats why

Right, I just meant i’m sure that with programs like rainmeter someone could, in theory, recreate this or something close to it on new versions of windows.

If the rogue is running somethings like this with daggers; [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R)

It's super super hard for the mage. Think about it. Sprintx2 to remove slows/freezes, same with vanish, couple that with two blinds and some iron grenades and a pvp trinket/net-o-matic/goblin rocket helmet and the mage is toast. Super hard fight to win, it's definitely doable but the rogue has to make mistakes to lose that fight.  
---
Open with ambush, force the mage to not blink &gt; if he doesnt blink, tea and put 2x backstabs into him while he's waiting for your kidney, if he blinks, blind, if he IB's and u lack distance, pop a sprint to break out of nova or get closer. Vanish + cheapshot or ambush will force 2nd IB/nova, pop prep, ready for second sprint out of nova or blind mage again after second IB &gt; restealth, open with vanish, if he doenst die and gains distance, sprint again.  
---
Ive 1v1'd some good mages on hh and believe me, this spec counters mages super super hard. Especially if u also have tidal or nets, they have to pretty much rely on instant casts only.
---
&gt;Wasn’t there a challenge to get to 60 killing nothing but boars?
---
I don't think there was ever a challenge, but somebody did it back in TBC and someone recently spoke about it in a YouTube video &amp; they plan do do it in Classic.
---
If you imply in any way that vanilla was different than private servers, people will automatically downvote you because they feel it invalidates their achievements on private servers.
---
Almost every speed leveler, including joana, has noted differences between vanilla and private servers but the truth is still hard for some people to accept.
---
All of that sounds really nice except that i just got told to lock in my vacation days for the rest of the year...
---
The person, or more typically multiple people come with you while it’s set to master loot. When the item drops they pay you and you give loot to them. Typically only rogues or hunters come, as they’re the only ones who can stealth make it to princess, but also the ones who benefit most from the items so there’s always a decent market for it. Mara prices are usually ~15g. Not bad for that ring

ESFP - horde - priest - healer - pve

That being said, I have been playing;

And

---
In vanilla.
---
Edit: Added history from retail.
---
Hey we had nearly the same background!
---
This is exactly right. Stick with holy/disc and just do the best you can PvPing. Expect to drink a lot, get polyed a lot, and viper sting into oblivion...but it’s still fun! Use your Mind Control and dispell magic both offensively and defensively as much as you can, and drink at 1/2 mana even to stay full. Stay back, watch your positioning.
---
You're saying monkeynews is garbage? He's known to be one of the better warriors to play vanilla, it's definitely debatable but if you believe he's anything lower than top 99.9% you're mistaken. I'd love to see how you would play a 1v1 vs perplexity, also known as one of the absolute best rogues vanilla has ever seen.
---
Took me about 2 hours to map it. Everyone uses the same route for efficiency pretty much.
---
Sure those two are the same
---
If you want to tank, as any class, be prepared to show up for every single raid without fail.
---
Tanking is the most contested spot in every guild by far, because it's the most important role. Investing guildbank gold into gearing up a tank with FR gear, NR gear, craftable items, flasks and all that stuff is not cheap, and you want to make sure those tanks stick around long term.
---
That being said, you can play feral tank and have no issues finding groups for any 5man, ZG, AQ20 or even Molten Core pugs. But dont expect to tank any content above this unless you can put in the required time and effort.

Sad that he passed earlier that year :( what an actor!
---
Really surprised no one has mentioned shadow priest, especially human or dwarf with the instant heal.  Tested this out multiple times on a naughty server and my winrate in shadow v rogue duels was insane.  Probably the easiest class for me to beat with even gear levels.
---
Everyday that goes by I start to actually believe they meant Summer 2020 or are at least planning on pushing it back to the fall/winter.
---
Huh. Im the USA and its pretty common, at least at all of the colleges around me.
---
You can take the airship as a ghost and Rez at the spirit healer in STV, iirc.
---
Didn't they confirm the beta would be family and friends?
---
So, reaching way back into my time machine of a brain, I can tell you that Druid were viable for tanking, however they were not able to build the required amount of defense skill to not be crushed (For T1 and T2 gear, I'm not sure about beyond that).  
---
You should be able to find a group or people, but I'm not sure about how many will be accepting of a bear tank :(
---
Also, is healing as shadow viable in lvl 50ish dungeons ? thanks again
---
Honestly I don't get why people are so excited about a beta, it isn't like most of us will get into and even if we did it won't be the full game. The beta will just be a teaser for streamers to use to hype the game, if you really want to scratch that classic itch you can just play on a private server until the actual release.
---
Depends of the rogue, if he know how to kite you cant win.
---
If you want to save on respec costs, then you can run a Disc/Holy build that heals reasonably well in raids and uses Power Infusion on Mages and such, and in PvP can provide small controlled burst with +crit Smites and such. It's not optimal, but it will save you 100g per spec rotation.
---
In Classic, healing gear is separate from damage gear. Damage gear gives +healing, but full healing gear gives two to three times as much at the same "tier" of gear, so there isn't really much overlap between SPriest and HPriest gear. But you also underestimate the time investment it takes to even get to Rank 12 for epic SPriest BG gear. On top of it not actually being in the game at launch, a Rank 12 grind will often require guild premades running around 8-10 hours a day every day (12 a day for R13, and 14+ a day for R14, though my memory may be faulty as to the exact time requirements). It's a *massive* grind. You'll get good MC PvE healing gear long before you can even think of PvP grinding if you're a remotely competent Priest, since any raiding guild will want a lot of them.
---
Where does most of a mage's pvp gear come from? It seems like they don't really use much of their tier sets for pvp, so what does the grind look like for gear that doesn't come from raids?
---
&gt; Point being: I think a lot of people play not because they genuinely enjoy the game; They play because they feel they would lose out if they stopped.
---

They are starting to teach in schools in California that Pedophila is a sexual orientation. What is this world coming to
---
Just saying. If you want to casually raid it is just easier to play a highly sought after class/role. I think if you want to play Bear druid you should. It is just harder to get into the group. You may not want to spend your more limited play time with a casual schedule looking instead of actually doing the raid content.
---
If you have a group that utilizes crowd control and a warrior tank you'll be ok. I'll level as shadow and do instances along the way then swap to healing spec at 60.

I'd often farm Swifthistle on my alliance warrior and wave to all the horde passing through. I love the trees and the haunted aspect of it. The elite Sons of Arugal who would patrol the woods. It was more welcoming back then and then expansions made it feel exclusively horde.
---
Winterspring is my second favorite place. It's so solitary. It takes a great effort to get there, and it's so remote you won't see many out there. There are so many hills to hide in, and so many great farms out there. It's like being on another planet.
---
Good point. But i really enjoy the idea of bear druid :((( sad reacts only
---
Hey if my lolret is expected to carry full int/healing gear, the least a warrior can do is carry (and level) a 1h and a shield and put sunder and taunt on their action bar!

Ironically enough, macOS has a better out of the box dark mode than Windows does now. That is, when you switch to dark mode, *all programs* turn dark, whereas on Windows only the metro apps turn dark, murdering your eyes when you alt-tab to an “old style” Windows app at night.
---
It kinda baffles me that MS ditched the great theme engine they had in Windows 7. I don’t even use Windows all that often, but I used to sometimes boot into it just to try out a cool msstyle I found on DeviantArt.
---
They said nothing of the sort. In fact they've explained that it was purely driven by design.
---
The debuff limit and spell batching however were technical limitations and they're putting those back in.
---
If they start changing core design philosophies they might as well cancel the whole thing because the game will be dead on arrival.
---
#nochanges
---
I like Lock vs Rogue, you have like 2 choices when jumped that don't requier you to use the PvP trinket. 1 Sac Voidwalker mid gank for bubble then fear/dot/heal till it is dead, 2 use a succubus and suduce him mid gank then fear/dot/heal till it is dead. As long as you don't F up during their initial rotation you should beat any rogue 1v1 as a lock imo
---
What exactly are you saying? That the op has correctly identified the covert racism in Leeroy Jenkins? Or that Leeroy being a racist video is absurd.

For point of fact, I’m arguing on behalf of the latter.

The guide literally says BRD is not possible, why are you mentioning BRD?

Regardless if server populations were a design limitation or technical limitation, pop caps were a limitation whose implications flowed through the entirety of the game and impacted how the whole economy was balanced.
---
Blizzard acknowledged that there is a Internal Beta going on, for BLizzard employees.  
---
Therefore, people claim that there will be an (open) Beta, for all us somehow.....

Somehow, i have a feeling wednesday.thursday, will be an important day for some more info.  
---
We'll wait an see
---
PM me also plz, these are sweet as!
---
thanks, I couldnt remember about the healing / dmg gear and I know about the R14 grind I was R12 on my hunter back in the day, I probably won't aim for rank 14 anyway mostly rank 10ish more or less depending on how long it takes to rank up
---
Minimalist, clean and classy. Very nice! Nice lotr artwork! Who is the artist?
---
Indeed!
---
2142 is top tier with Bf2/3
---
Nobody developed such an addon for pservers I doubt they will for classic. /lookimlngforgroup will be a global channel as it was in 1.12 and that's more than  sufficient for forming pugs.
---
It seems logic, mandatory even to beta test a game.Every company does it, not to say " Hey, everyone does it, so will I ", but because you need to check that your game works in the environment that it's intended for.
---
I can't see Blizzard of all companies shipping a game, moreover an MMORPG, without making sure it works as it is supposed to be. And what is the best way but a Beta test?
---
Required time and effort means what exactly? I can play like 3/4 hours a day minimum. There might also be days when i cant play at all or when i play like 9 hours. Whats the required amount of time?

Spirit Res mechanics is sadly one thing I've totally forgotten since my Vanilla days. Maybe don't make the run as a Wisp then!
---
Good stuff!  Would have been perfect for a #throwbackthursday post.  :p
---
Love that wall art. I have a bunch myself. Its more rare than you'd think with battlestations. Everyone and their brother just drops $220 on "nanoleafs(?)"
---
I enjoy these simple setups much more than the flashy stuff. One issue I have with this is that neither monitor is straight in front of you. I like to look ahead at one monitor and look on my right for the second, otherwise pretty nice, might need a little more character maybe a bookshelf or another plant or something :)

---
Pretty indepth guide on feral tanking. Feral CAN tank, but it really depends on the fight.
---
You also mention being a casual player but wanting to raid past bwl.  Are you looking for a guild that will clear naxx? Not generally regarded as casual-friendly.  If you're looking for a more casual guild that still raids you should have no problem being a feral tank or OT.  Just need to apply to a guild that will let you play that spec.
---
Druid being a true hybrid also gives you the ability to spec to feral tank as well as heal so you can do both with a gear swap as opposed to a talent swap to do more roles but if you're adamant against healing there will just be some fights you'll have to DPS on instead of tank due to utility of a bear vs utility of a warrior (i.e. fear bosses) unless you're alliance with fear ward.
---
No problem, release this wednesday incoming! :D
---
People flok to play alongside them, making the server far busier than normal. Some streams are so powerful they can take down a server simply by having their viewership congragate at a single point in the game.
---
Usually a night elf rogue.
---
Ya I love how everyone is so sure about pure speculation lol chill
---
that's just the angle of the photo + the monitor being titled.  I'm 99% sure (as sure as I can be, without seeing it in person) they are symmetrical.
---
What’s the difference between chivalry? I was thinking about getting it but I was having a hard time deciding if it’s worth it.
---
Just standard deep feral, something like this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxgLsc0dtV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxgLsc0dtV) a few points can ofc be moved around based on preference.
---
Hi, /u/og_on_a_stik
---
D2 is my favorite game of all time, hands down. So disappointed with "Diablo"3. Cannot wait for this Blizzcon.
---
&gt; Is there a law stating you need to do this or something?
---
No, but it's a very standard business practice.  Thus why we haven't seen people who were invited release detailed videos of what they saw and what is coming.
---
If it's ready, what did you change?
---
"Content creators" and "influencers" are garbage. They are a bunch of fucking hacks who want e-fame and riding Classic hype is the the way they build their brand. Their 10 and done videos are often clickbait top 10 lists or a long winded facecam discussion to pad for time on a subject that can be fully explored in 2 minutes. If you often find yourself searching the description or top comments for a TLDR, you may be watching a content creator by mistake.
---
Enthusiasts on the other hand make fun videos with ACCURATE information, learn to spot the difference between someone who does it for love of the game rather than someone hoping to leverage it for more money. Support those people instead.
---
Dead on arrival because the population caps are a bit different on different servers? I think that's a bit of a stretch and the actual blizzard servers had different caps in original vanilla. They had added newer hardware later into the game. 
---
One of the original devs said they would have adjusted populations differently if the hardware had allowed for it.
---
The top of the monitors are supposed to be at, or slightly below, eye-level.  Not sure how tall this dude is, but that looks about right to me, based on the height of the chair.

Have also played as Resto Druid (Horde).

When do you think you'll post the results?
---
the terrain physic is different  so i guess no.
---
Classic and Wrath, the only 2 CEs I don't have. The only 2 CE's I should have bought without question. The only 2 CEs I'll probably never have given what they sell for now.
---
Nice setup. Do yourself a favor and unplug everything and put it back together one by one while hiding cables. Purchase some cable wraps/tie wraps or somewhere to hide the cables.
---
It will take you maybe an hour and you will LOVE it. For as much time as I'm sure you spend sitting there its worth.
---
There's nothing wrong with playing a bear druid casually, but you'll struggle to find a consistent raid spot. Druids *can* tank, but:
---
* they're sub-optimal compared to warriors 
---
* there are relatively few spots for tanks for most raid progression 
---
* warriors are plentiful
---
Unless you distinguish yourself early, you'll have a hard time getting a spot when every guild will have a dozen warriors in line for the role already.
---
Hard to solo that instance as a shaman idd, try a paladin
---
What's crazy is the low pop blade servers were going for $300-400 when they went up for auction directly from Blizzard.
---
ISTP-A Horde Rogue DPS Equal
---
Main character from Vanilla to the end of Cataclysm was Undead female rogue.
---
I will likely not play Classic due to adult responsibilities, but if I do it will be with a solo focus as a mage or warlock.
---
Edit: added identity and background.
---
Damn it... now I have to clean my desk :)
---
Don't see why people mention orcs. I was beating rogues way more geared than me on my tauren warrior. Rogues have a tough time with warriors

You can run the whole distance (at least in theory).  If memory serves, most of the trip should be simple.  Only problem with running it is right at the border from Barrens to Dustwallow, cause there's a large nest of level 35-40 murlocs camping out there.  But if you can swim around or corpse-run through them the rest should be mostly smooth.

Lead &lt;big tiddies raidin cities&gt; the only NA fem-dwarf-only hardcore PvP guild
---
We got big tiddies and we gon kill every undead, orc, and troll, focusing 50-60. female Taurens will be spared for obvious reasons (them mommas got milkers)
---
There are no Elite mobs either. At least i have not seen one for those almost 20 Levels. Everything is designed to be solo-able ... and like you said, danger is gone completely, because of that.
---
So far so good. Not much overclock room on the ryzan buts it plenty fast enough stock.
---
Im not making plans on what raids i wanna clear. As many as possible is my plan, with as much fun as possible. I will surely have heal and tank gear, but i wanna tank more than I wanna heal (i can accept dpsing or healing during some boss fights, im not a douche). Idk what to add more than that. I wanna do dungeons and raid as much as possible while also having fun, playing not just effectively (farming stuff 24/7) and tanking while also helping my team mates with some heals, dps when needed.
---
pvp servers ftw
---
No fun allowed
---
That's great if you're high level.  What if I want to farm wool or cooking materials?
---
Because AOE at BRD isn’t possible so it’s put in the dishonourable mentions under the gold farming section
---
Show me that proof then because I have a clip of the fucking team lead saying that realm caps were entirely driven by design.
---
So, I’m completely ignorant on vanilla wow and this is a genuine question. I thought all casters struggle with mana consumption, why is ele remarkable in that reguard compared to like a mage
---
Fuck the beta let's begin now! My gf is out of town so no way I can get aggro.
---
I work IT security so I view a lot of lists and code. The vertical is actually functional for me lol.
---
Yea, it wasn't until BC that Blizzard worked on Bear tanks, kind of a bummer.
---
It's honestly amazing
---
so do u think as a medium tier filthy casual player who has a respectable knowledge of wow that a warrior would be good for me to play? idk if it will be Fury DPS? also i’m thinking a human char are they good for warrior?
---
There were some customizations that had the opposite effect. For a while I had my younger brother’s XP machine set up up with an ultra-light alternative shell that let you quit Windows Explorer (the normal windows desktop and taskbar), which freed up a decent chunk of resources and squeezed out a few extra FPS in WoW.
---
haRISY
---
this. 💯
---
Right, but how are you pulling Guardsmen and Footmen without pulling the Anvilrage Wardens? They're all around the first room.
---
I haven't seen a single person claim there'll be an open beta tbh. That's just not something Blizzard does, ever.
---
they hated him, for he told the truth
---
The current "beta" is indeed family and friends, but it started a few weeks back.
---
don’t want a beta either.. just get the game out plox hopefully like July time.
---
Oh I plan on it. It's basically just been put back together. We painted the walls. Have to manage cables and hang artwork.
---
Try playing the e devil's advocate and skeptic  while watching this, and you'll realize that the video is really just baseless fearmongering.  It helped me imagine positive qualities for servers with popular streamers.
---
I was impartial before, but now I want to play on a realm with a streamer.
---
Because a beta basically instantly answers whatever remaining questions there are.

---
Mark Kern? He said that they adjusted the game due to hardware limitation. Not that they had reached some magic number they wanted to hit and stopped. 
---
Cross realm BGs are blizzlike too so they should put those in as well. #NOCHANGES
---
No, I want to book my holidays. IDGAF about some bugs or whatever, these can be fixed.
---
Pretty big assumption, they could be Holy players
---
Yeah that's mine. People are definitely allowed to not like vanilla the way it was and want big changes to the game, Blizzard on the other hand should under no circumstances ever listen to those people.
---
Barrens.
---
Thats immaterial to my point? 
---
If anything it just expresses it further. This guy is on a pserver not using half the consumables the content creators say you “need” for naxx.
---
&gt; Your high pop servers modify spawn rates for nodes and mobs
---
They don't have to, and they certainly should not. No one in this thread is advocating that.  Simply allowing players a high-pop choice is what we're talking about.
---

---
I play a LOT of vanilla feral. The answer to your question depends on your definition of casual. Pre-raiding you will run into no problems, Druids are arguably quite a bit stronger than warriors until their gear starts to max out in the end game.
---
Druid tanking takes a lot of work, a lot of time outside the raid farming consumables, and a ton of reputation farming. You can do this as a casual player if you're not in any hurry, but it will take you longer to become raid-tier than a lot of classes.
---
You also can't play feral at a high level unless you're willing to heal sometimes. The whole draw of bringing a feral to a raid is its versatility, and if you aren't versatile you might as well be a warrior. That means a tank set, damage set, and healing set, minimum. Again, all of this can be done casually, but it will take a lot longer to get that gear since you have 3 sets to build.
---
Finally, all of this means jack if you are playing in a properly casual guild, where you're just here to have fun and fuck around. You can go into MC as a half-assed feral, but make no mistake, your group will be carrying you.
---
Someone already linked it but I'm going to repeat: 
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/22/treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla
---
This is an excellent, in-depth source on vanilla feral written by (quite arguably) the GOAT. It is very detailed on how feral works and what you need to make it happen. If you have more specific questions I'd love to answer them.
---
ahh yes a game should be designed around sodapoppin and asmongold having a big community and being able to report people easily is not allowed
---
I will do my best then
---
Darkshore/Westfall for me can't decide :)
---
Essex resident here, you want some!
---
I understand this very well brother, I appriciate the info
---
Show me, not tell me. I have him saying it was a design decision.
---
And yes cross realm BGs was in vanilla so they're well within their right to add them. They were also not in vanilla for a long period of time so whatever they pick is fine.
---
The Swe and Norway ones should speak english though.
---
Family is from Whickham! Washington here, let's gooo
---
I don't know how much this matters but bear in mind that this is a private server and numbers may not be accurate compared to classic.
---
Yeah, it might be a short one, but they have no reason _not_ to do a beta. It's great marketing, and there is really no better way to find bugs than letting a couple of thousand players onto a server, especially as all of them have different hardware profiles which may cause problems with the "new" graphics.
---
A single critical issue like an item dupe or a wonky loot table generating way too much gold could have very long-lasting effects on the game's economy. Why take that risk? It's not like there's any new content they need to hide.
---
You should let the people who take the poll see the results
---
Why not pick whats most fun to eahc individual, instead of going for whats presumably the easiest? I have most fun with warrior, even though leveling isnt as smooth with it.
---
Hi - I would love to join the list of purchasers!
---
I guess I could clarify, as far as the info we get from the beta that is interesting in itself, but that is just something we can read about. It won't answer all of our remaining questions, but it will answer some remaining ones.
---
Clean until the entropy of ~~gaming~~ life yields shit everywhere there's open space!
---
I hope they just to a quick stress test.
---
Classic already bringing people together!
---
&gt;Will post results in a **day or two**!
---
I don't even.
---
&lt;Midnighters&gt; is looking for players to come own with us.
---
NA|PvP|Horde|PST Raid times: Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST
---
Tue a possible 3rd day if wanted/needed.
---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message.
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.
---
We are currently full on:
---
**Druid**
---
**Hunter**

I never played Chivalry, so I'm not the best person to ask...  As I understand it though, a lot of people are happy about weapons having turn caps to prevent spinning-nonsense.  You can still execute drags/accels, but there's a bit more balance applied.  No backswing hits either.
---
Basically they got all the old Chiv pros and worked with them for like 2 years to get the game to a great state of balance, and it feels like it to my inexperienced eyes.  Lots of newbies complain about shields and spears and rapiers, but once you learn how to deal with them I haven't seen anything that feels particularly OP.
---
You probably want to factor in age as well... but that may require too much work.
---
to avoid streamers, choose any pvp server
---
Why isn't it possible? I know people who did it to level on privates, once you get to a certain level.
---
Shadowfax is the lord of all horses
---
Yup that all sounds familiar! I see what you mean.
---
this is HIGH QUALITY stuff, i laughed throughout
---
OP seems a bit questionable, if he comes to r/Classicwow and asks if he should play bfa or classic, like what does he expect
---
We have since learned to just stack so much HP that we can eat crushing blows.
---
Dunno if you care for suggestions at all, but if your space allows, you may wish to turn the desk perpendicular to the wall so you can get some daylight on your face.  I find it's refreshing, but that might be just me.  I do enjoy the simplicity.  Also the keyboard/mouse mat.
---
Man skip to 40 minutes in to that pod cast and listen to him again.
---
He says it was design at the start and then it was technical. They actually I creased the caps later on.
---
well whats more fun to you?
---
Do we have any info if the arena chest will be there on launch? It was added in 1.4 iirc
---
Seems like people are going to be well into their 60's... might even have full epic gear by the time you see any trinkets from there... Gurubashi Arena will not be in until Phase 2 as per Ion's Tweet about content patch 1.4.
---
Because private servers are totally 100% correct.
---
I just want in to learn about the limitations of the new macro system.
---
I will read that article and i will surely come back with questions
---
And my definition of casual is kinda dumb. I think a casual player is a player who does not play for the end product only, who wants to have fun, make friends and someone who wont play 10 hours a day for the entire summer. Who will be able to have an alt lets say
---
Had a buddy spend ages getting to GM. Gets there and like a month after Blizz made ranking up super easy or at least much easier. My buddy quit right after due to that.
---

---
On a small server finding a group for quests and dungeons can be brutal.
---
On a 10k server, there are always groups running Deadmines or Wailing Caverns.  
---
I don't understand this idea that you need to *recognize* the same people every day. Having large pops makes for an exciting and bustling world. Remembering every person you encounter is not Blizzlike you'll need an extremely small server for that.
---
Hi, /u/Altnob
---
I had this same theme for awhile.  Loved it!
---
I agree you should try it at least once (especially before you start sharing your opinion on it).  From my viewpoint, I resurrected my blizz account last week... Looked at my 45 rogue that I gave up after being on the hard end of a week long gank train in STV and remembered why all the rest of my characters are on PVE servers.
---
PvP and zone completionist doesn't mix well.
---
this meme was relevant 2 months ago, not now
---
Pop caps were increased as time went on, and as actual vanilla progressed, servers with larger caps were released as tech got better.
---
They started with 2k due to tech limitations even though they intended, and achieved, higher pops as time went on.
---
It is blizzlike.

**Real Men of Genius**

**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**

**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST Wednesday/Thursday
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for **all roles** if you are an exceptional, dedicated player. 
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: [https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)
---
**Contact**: Here's how to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before applying:

&gt;Got my account back
---
&gt;my friend use the account as an alt and he may have leveled him?
---
Lol...you sold your account. It’s okay, you’re not alone.
---
Streamer guilds and stream sniper guilds clashing in Blackrock Mountain in huge laggy clusterfucks. 
---
Reminds me of the good old days lol
---
Where did you find it?
---
Yes they picked a cap at roughly 2500 based on design, they later found out that a technical limitation of 3500-4000 existed but that didn't matter since they had already picked a size much smaller than that. There are discord screenshots of him confirming this.
---
Always been horde, and I'm keeping it that way

I'm a human irl, now I can play a faction which stomps on humans, and play cows and Orcs :)

lok'tar ogar
---
&gt; It will require additional tampering with respawns, mob density and other parameters which will alter the experience.
---
No, it won't. No one here is advocating that. Simply allowing players *the option* of joining a 4 or 5k online pop server doesn't affect your gameplay at all.
---
If all the streamers and tryhards went there wouldn't you be happier?
---
The only thing you need is 16+ hours a day to play. Or 8+ hours and friend willing to share your account to play another 8+ a day :)
---
ISTJ - Horde - Rogue - DPS - Both equally
---
Higher than 2k Blizzlike, sure.
---
10k uberservers a la Nost, fuck no couldn't be less Blizzlike if they tried.
---
Discord? Listen to him talk about it. He even goes on to talk about how great nost was and how good of a community it built even with a larger cap. He's basically praising them for the higher pop
---
roll on things you both want and have fun
---
All valid except this isnt a new game with design framework that is new or expecting updates they dont know about. We are frustrated that a billion dollar company is jerking around, and not communicating about it. They are being the guy in the bg that knows what everyone needs from them and then just afks. They are the hunter who nobody expects much of but we really hope that tranq shot comes from, and they too are afk. They are the role player that talks about how marvelously wonderful they are; a mage pouring through countless tomes of magic with the kirin tor, yet when it comes to listening to anyone else they apparently cant read.
---
INTP - Horde - Warrior - DPS - Both
---
Note: I'm a blood elf fury warrior, i chose against the tauren and orc path

---
I say fake, the inactive text is normally orange.
---
Alpha
---
Not beta
---
I saw in another comment you said you were planning 3-4 hours a day, I think that is more than enough time investment to maintain consumable farms etc, and gear up at a decent pace.
---
Sentences begin with capital letters.
---
the value of enchant is that you can de and sell the mats
---
I’ve been playing this too, fantastic way to spend time until Classic drops. Highly recommend, and I never played games like chivalry. I’m a noob and having a blast getting my head chopped off and returning the favor every now and then.
---
Where do you think this guy is testing these spots at?
---
it'll come when it comes. begging for a release date will not make it come faster.
---
and if you are actually mad about not knowing when to take off from work to no life a video game, lmao @ your life
---
Oh really. Good for me then
---
Sorry what?
---
I do not remember the blue daggers being as common in original vanilla as you recall (but I could certainly be wrong or I picked the wrong pockets). What you got in this video feels far more accurate to me. Did you say you had spreadsheets from actual pre-BC Blizzard servers for the dagger drop rates from junk boxes or was that from different private servers?
---
Doesn't have to be 10k. 
---
4k or 5k online would be great
---
Matt Ferguson
---
Well, this is really easy to fake.
---
I've gone from single monitor to 2 to 3 to 2 to 1 and now back to 2.
---
Two monitors is definitely the shit.  Multitasking without taking up too much desk space (like 3 monitors).  I think 3 could be cool if you mount one on the wall though.
---
I don’t see a shit bucket -1
---
Prediction - it'll be some kind of streamer access bullshit, which nobody will care about because we're all shit sick of repetitive classic content creators
---
https://youtu.be/x-nH7z3SzpY some weird editing in the video but I think you’ll like what you see as far as tanking
---
Lol
---
Will I how to get enough responses for it to be meaningful. Going to be hard to compete with all the memes and rigs!
---
It’s like a remastered chivalry with far more customization, better mechanics, and great netcode.
---
I’ve had an absolute blast and I have a few hundred hours on chivalry.
---
Can we get a link/invite for the Mage Classic Discord? please and thank you.  Edit: saw the invite further down.
---
I thought Allen Brack requested these Blade server back, when they kinda announced Classic WoW  
---
Now i know why its taking so long, you haven't returned your Blade :) :)
---
The problem is mainly that you cant get proper gear, bc theres no dedicated leather tanking gear with the defense stat. This means that raid bosses will do crushing bloes, and crits to you if i understand correctly, which is why they arent so good. But imo bears are great tanks in dungeons and i love to have them
---
Will check that out and come back with more questions if there are some
---
Rumor, and just mentioned on Toweliee's stream that "something" may be happening in about 5 hours from now.
---
Yeah have fun with shadow whenever you have the 100g to respect to and from. It’s definitely fun. I burned out on it because it’s such a mana pig and got cognitive dissonance watching teammates die, so I ended up healing a lot in shadow spec popping out of form a lot anyway.  Healing is huge in BGs
---
Yes and no. There was a blue comment made last week, but not an actual thread.
---
It just depends on whether or not that bug is recreated - it’d be well worth it if it is!
---
Seriously, people need to be patient. Companies get enough pressure from investors who are the biggest issue with this. Their consumers should chill out.
---
Im 6ft 2 and yes, I might put them a little higher now you mentioned it - thanks

a bit about us: I'm a 31-year old Vanilla-to-WoTLK vet chasing that same nostalgia that I'm sure a lot of you are. For the past 4 years, I've lead a tight-knit bunch of young, working adults through numerous other games and MMOs. With the impending release of Classic, many of us, newcomers and vets alike, will be teaming up for what I believe to be one of the best experiences gaming has ever offered. We're not elitists. Whether your goal is to play casually or no-life the game, you're welcome here with us.
---
Goals: Initially, our focus as a guild will be leveling, experiencing the content and teaching the newbies all they need to progress. When a large enough number of us are ready, those who wish to do so will transition into raiding several nights a week. Those who don't are more than welcome to continue to enjoy the game however they choose.
---
Rules: Be excellent to each other and excersize common sense. We don't police language or humor, just be respectful. You're not required to be on at X time or X number of days per week. It's a game. If we have a movie night, you can come or not come. Your standing in the guild is based on your attitude in and out of game, not how many hours you've logged or how high your DPS is.
---
If you're interested in joining or have any concerns, don't hesitate to PM me directly here or DM me in Discord. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

---
Doesn't matter when you 2-shot them with overpower, there won't be enough time to kite.
---
Warrior is rogue hard counter.
---
Outside Ironforge. Where Dueling happens.
---
My only suggestion is include what level ranges those grinding spots are viable.
---
Yet another reason not to do it :)  Thanks!
---
His personal opinion on nost isn't really relevant. The fact is that it was a design decision and as such shouldn't be changed. Heck even if it was a technical limitation it shouldn't be changed.
---
The debuff limit and spell batching were technical limitations and they're putting those back in.
---
Hell yea I do! Me and my clan had a rifles/sniper only server and competed a few times. I was in PoA - merideus*n1k. I still remember quite a few people from back then
---
HAHA
---
Funny thing is by posting this "S" tier locations become the worst as when people make these guides the hordes of autists gather.
---
o, what kinda gay shit is this? i just want all the loot. fuck a backstory you filthy Rpers
---
How challenging is threat management as a Fury Warrior? Warriors are typically trying to gain threat, so I'm wondering what the general strategy is to avoid grabbing aggro as a class that generally doesn't have threat reducing tools?
---
I'm considering playing a rogue alt but might go Warrior if it's flat out better in the end.
---
I don't know anything about a Classic Beta, nor do my affiliates and or clients.
---
Click the link if you want to see a video on the subject.
---
Btw, here's a teaser for next episode that i already started working on ;) https://youtu.be/IPywuhDyB5c
---
Worcestershire - Ravencrest, Horde Side. I was a sucker for punishment. Me and my friends convinced ourselves that the higher the alliance pop, the more world pvp there would be for us, and we were right. 
---
Played from 2006-2012
---
Well, the most notable gap in knowledge (other than release dates) is the server quantity, population cap, name(s), types, data center location, etc.
---
It is something that blizzard probably should have decided by now if they’re actually launching in the summer, but we’ve received little information. It would really help communities and individuals plan if they provided that information.
---
As long as they release a realm list, we ahould be fine.
---
ENTP - Alliance - Warlock - DPS - PVE
---
It's literally on the CDN and people are still doubting it.
---
I don't even know what to say anymore.
---
I think the larger issue is some of the mobs references are super easy on private servers because they are missing some or all abilities.  I have trust issues with private server-initiated guides as a result.
---
That said, this is a great starting point but I suggest making sure to update it for Classic when it hits beta (hopefully we get a beta soon) to make sure the priority lists for farming mobs is still optimal when we get real  deal.  Thank you for this!
---
Is it literally the worst pve spec?
---
Blizz: We're launching Classic today!
---
Everyone with a job: WHAT THE FUUUUUUUU
---
Look up „skarm“ on youtube and watch his deep dive
---
You're right.
---
I'm just pretty sick of the way this sub thinks of actual vanilla.  According to this sub everyone playing Vanilla literally sucked at the game.  
---
I am eager to look at all the people hitting 60 on their warriors in 5 days /played in the first week though.
---
I know this is a little late here, but I haven't seen this listed yet in anyones comments.
---
There is a pretty big disparity between playing a tauren druid and an night elf druid.
---
Both have pretty large pros and cons to be honest.
---
Pros:
---
Night elf druids: Benefit greatly from paladin blessings to the point where you will miss them if you ever played a tauren druid in a raid and know what you're missing.
---
Shadowmeld is pretty underrated in my opinion. In larger scale bgs or even large scale wpvp it comes in pretty handy. You can eat/drink in shadowmeld form so it's a good way to somewhat safely regain your mana in a large scale battle. You'll be able to blend into the crowd and just shadowmeld and hopefully no one will see you. This drops off significantly when 1v1ing though. Still I think shadowmeld is underrated.
---
Tauren druids: You don't have to deal with the druids bane of existence: Shaman. Honestly, as a druid, shaman are the worst. A good shaman is the most annoying thing to a druid. Being able to purge 2 beneficial spells sucks for a druid. You want to throw out rejuvs on your team? Yea good luck, those are getting purged. You want to buff your team? Purged. The burst of a shaman will kill you. Being a tauren means you don't have to deal with, what I believe to be, druids hardest counter. (I know a lot of people say warlocks are the hard counter, and they kind of are, but I never cower as much as when I see a shaman as an alliance druid. 
---
Also, not having to deal with Orcs. Try feral charging or bashing an Orc. You will have the worst time ever. Want to try and get off a bash and a money heal? Not if the Orc resists that stun and your next stun.
---
Cons:
---
Tauren druid: You pretty much get zero benefit from shaman totems. Or rather, I should say, you get zero benefit from the most used totem: Windfury Totem. So you'll pretty much only ever be benefiting from two totems, a water and an earth totem.
---
Night Elf: This was stated back in the tauren pros, but having to deal with shaman. Generally when I see a shaman as an alliance druid I just run. It's honestly not even worth it. The purge spam, the burst, it's just better to run away and wait for backup. And even when you do have backup don't even think about using regrowth or rejuv cause that shit will get purged in a second.
---
Dealing with Orcs. Come to think of it, all of Taurens pros are mainly the fact that they don't have to deal with their faction.
---
I've played both a Tauren and a Night Elf druid. While I prefer the Night Elves as a race, I prefer the Horde as a faction and I still like the Tauren. When classic drops I will 100% be playing a tauren druid mainly for the reasons I have stated. I'm pretty PvP oriented so I won't miss the paladin buffs when raiding, so I don't mind missing out on that.
---
Just to add: a nice thing about druids is how versatile they are. I don't mean this in the fact they can take on many rolls, I mean this in that they have so many different talent builds that are viable that taking the time to see what build you like to play best is a lot of fun just messing around.
---
I know a guy who knows a guy. If you want in feel free to PM me, but know that the cost will be **great.**
---
Didnt they literally said they will have a beta period lol?
---
Don’t do 3/3 blizz if you are AoE grinding. It will override your CoC slow and mess it up later levels.
---
I don't even either. Clearly I am a retard. Sorry /u/pahbert.
---
Dumb question: Are these spots farmable with Holy Nova as well?
---
Crazy they took all your spells away!
---
I played very hardcore in Vanilla/TBC. My guild had a lot of server firsts. I played 60+ hours a week.
---
Now, I too have kids and can't put in that effort. But you bet your sweet bum I will be raiding.
---
Gonna play from 8pm to 10pm most nights and raid 2-3 times a week 8pm to 12am.  Server firsts, probably not, but we'll do all the raiding before it becomes "irrelevant".
---
You don;t have to be chasing world/server firsts to be in a good/successful guild. Just need to find like minded people to play with.
---
Although if you can't dedicate 3 -4 hours at least twice it week, it might be hard to find a group to raid with.
---
Clearly most people on this thread agree with me. My goal is not to argue with one commenter. There is no point. If you do not understand the subject, watch the video. If you understand but disagree, then you may choose a realm with a streamer. Don't let my post offend you guys. Do what you want.
---
INTJ - Alliance - Mage - DPS - PvE
---
I mean, the actual answer will probably substitute Horde but that's because of friends.  Left to my own devices, it'd be Alliance!
---
Lmao
---
I hope you have fun!
---
Fake. Would have been easier to inspect element and edit to screenshot and fake.
---
This is way to easy to fake. you can add just about anything to a webpage you want via the browser console, then take a screen shot. No photoshop needed and all the CSS matches perfectly.
---
Me too
---
Why did you change the color of the text now? This is one of the worst attempts i've seen.
---
I just got here and thought the joke at first was that the swedish and norwegian version of that sentence are identical.
---
Paid for it, im eager to see it when it drops
---
Personal experience (this is based on pserver economy though) is that the mats go for less than vendoring the greens/blues would in the first place. Sometimes LBS and nexus crystals can make a profit (and occasionally eternal essences but that is a gamble, generally you make more selling the weapons) but the margin usually isn't huge.
---
Dude, remember when ppl streamed on xfire? Also, good ol' classic ventrillo.
---
He's basically saying at first it was design, which was a mistake because bigger servers had a better community anyway, and when they did go to increase it they ran into technical limitations. How could they have run into technical limitations if they hadn't decided to increase the caps? So the actual population caps were different depending on which patch and time you look at..
---
Remember we aren't talking about making all of the servers have higher caps.
---
EU (Dutch/Holland) Horde 
---
PvP &amp; PvE
---
Will most likely play warlock
---
LF Guild that strikes a nice balance in requested commitment. Raiding two evenings, max 3. Obviously willing to farm mats, within reasonable limits.
---
Who am I? Vanilla veteran (played from open beta way into wotlk). I've raided MC, ZG &amp; BWL (got carried there tbh). I'm working full time and have a social life. This means my Fridays and Saturdays are most likely for friends &amp; family. The best raid days would actually be weekdays for me. 
---
My perfect guild: although I would prefer to attend every raid, my guild would have to accept that life happens and a 100% attendance might be difficult to achieve. My ideal fellow guild mates would be ones with humor, they make me laugh during the tedious moments, they are capable of having a grown-up conversation about work, talk about politics without fighting and have an honest interest in eachothers lives. 
---
Well what else is there to say. Shoot if you have any questions. Suggestions for guilds are greatly appreciated!
---
I heard it was just more of the same. Though, I haven't played either one.
---
Ive only ever played alliance, and my buddy who I will be playing with said I have to go horde...
---
So call me a traitor, but im going horde this time around
---
I hate my Herman Miller Aeron at work.
---
I had immediate flashbacks to thousands of hours spent playing PVK2 when I started Mordhau, it's been great.
---
That's some gourmet wallpaper
---
We know the spots work based on the confirmed mobs back in 2006
---
I'm not sure what you're asking, but if you're asking about what we will do with the list, we will be able to choose a realm that hasn't been chosen by a big streamer.
---
I'd say you're pretty accurate in your assessment here and a big part of it comes down to the type of guild you're in. Guilds that are at the very top have higher expectations from their healers because consumables allow those guilds to optimize their raid composition. If all of your healers are constantly comfortable with their Mana that means the raid is bringing too many healers. With proper consumes you should be able to uprank your spells to put out more hps and utilize more of your resources. At mid tier guilds there's more of a willingness to bring 13 or we healers and say fuck it.
---
My perspective is also skewed because my most recent experience was based on private server that was way way overtuned in terms of boss health and damage. Bosses put out more damage and had way more health meaning maintaining higher hps for longer.
---
Still think 2nd or 3rd Hunter in a raid is the ultimate slacker class though.
---
Exactly.
---
Where's the third monitor for *ahem* Paladin Leveling Strategies?
---
while we wait here is some footage of flight paths and i will slowly document 19 things to expect which i learned from playing private servers in anticipation all these years
---
So close to Radiance!
---
i don't think giving us a release date would be considered "meeting unrealistic goals and deadlines" considering they said summer 2019 a while ago and its not like its a brand new game. most people wanna plan their vacation time and i understand why they want to get that date asap. 
---
if blizzard needs more time they should just be upfront about it and say "hey we know we said summer 2019 but it looks like we need some more time so we're pushing it to fall"
---
I think it makes more sense to focus on making youtube videos than live streaming classic. You can make quality content and people won't be able to follow you around 24/7 because they don't know where you are outside of doing a /who and finding the zone. Personally I have no interest in live streams and prefer watching edited youtube videos so I may be biased.
---
Thanks man :)
---
Yeah, thats Xperl!
---
Since I am 100% Horde I can spare it ;)
---
Idk, you do have the ability to go to your battle.net profile settings and check off that you are interested for upcoming Warcraft betas... but that counts towards all Warcraft products, not just Classic. 
---
Honestly, I don’t want a beta, I want the game to go straight to release.
---
Some actual quality content not just low effort meme shitposts
---
The name "Asmongold" will be taken on all realms within seconds of launch.
---
Buy a 1-year subscription to World of Warcraft and get into the Beta promotion, go! ;)
---
Can someone explain the appeal of rolling human?
---
True
---
&gt; That's just not something Blizzard does, ever.
---
[Uhhh...](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overwatchr-blizzards-biggest-open-beta-ever-97-million-global)
---
So dumb question, or Simple question. 
---
Will the old loading screen and launcher be back?
---
This guy gets it
---
Just trying to figure out how easily possible this could be. I'm a software engineer, so building something simple shouldn't be too difficult.
---
However, how do you confirm the authenticity of the "big" streamer?
---
 **TheoryCraft** :)
---
It's from vanilla. I'll probably make a vid on it after retail releases and I've gone through the grind. Sadly the best moneymaking dagger (Assassins blade) is not junkbox farmable.
---
No, the client is labeled as beta. I would actually be kind of worried if they were only in an alpha state at this point.
---
Internal beta =/= public beta
---
We've just all been part of a 15 year beta test.  9000 IQ move on Blizzard's part.
---

---
The social aspect of Horde on my Vanilla server (Silvermoon) was fantastic. Ally was particularly childish on there, iirc. That being said, you will have both good and bad on both sides. My guildies and I are thinking the same to roll Ally, this time, just to experience something new.
---
Freeze Tag was my home for awhile, I miss it so much lol
---
I definitely rocked this windows theme for a while. It came complete with some UI sounds from the game as well if I remember correctly.
---
I don't think they've said there will be a public or open beta.
---
It's a kitchen-countertop sawed in shape (left side is thinner than the right) with tucked on stands basically
---
not if u can use fap or even restorative potion
---
fookin kneeler
---
You said you did not want to heal. Also, your saying that you will tank until the boss gets to hard. Then the group will use a better tank. Why would they not use the better tank the whole time and you go to a healing spot. This is the issue that you will face.
---
Edit: after reading more comments I also wanted to say, don't worry to much about your class choice. Maybe you wont be the most optimal tank. Maybe you will have to heal to do Naxx. That's all part of the fun in vanilla. I say roll druid and do what you want to do.
---
Is this your first time opening the Chrome inspector or something? Try harder next time
---
Was it WindowBlinds?
---
They overlap dude. Did 100% of the game change from one to the other? No.
---
I remember them saying there will be a beta at blizzcon 2018
---
Ah dang. I was so close, thanks for clarifying that for me.
---
Then it's the perfect opportunity to level one since you don't have to slowly autoattack your way to 60!
---
As someone that played on a low pop server for a while in vanilla this is actually a problem. You only had a couple of guilds even doing MC and could never find groups to do end game dungeons. I had to completely reroll shortly after hitting 60 on my first character since it was so bad. The next server had a bad horde/alliance imbalance, but outside of horde raids camping outside MC/BWL it was still much better than the low pop server.
---
People take shit too literally here man. I didn’t take your post as baiting at all. 
---
Im stoked as well man. Don’t let the haters get to you.
---
My god stardock. I used the hell out of that.
---
my only interest in Beta is that it may also include a release date for classic launch.
---
With equal skill, even if a rogue gets an opener it's pretty much unwinnable for the rogue. The exception is if the rogue uses skull so they can skip the scatter trap combo. Then it's pretty hard for the hunter to win.
---
Why not twink it at 60 when I have access to raids and top end gear? Better off that way right m8?
---
Shadow priest is not really good in BGs, it is very good in world PvP though. You can do BGs just fine with your raid specc as a priest (not optimal, but good enough. If you are actively raiding, respeccing for BG is a waste of gold in my opinion).
---
Blizzard white knights in full force in this post. Honestly if the game releases late August/September with no beta prior... my hype will be eviserated and prob won't be as bothered to play. But hey.. it's blizzard they take 9 fucking years to do anything.
---
They will likely say it on stream. Ideally someone woild make a spreadsheet with the streamer's name, follower count (if that really matters), and the server they intend to play on.
---
Wrong.
---
I was able to test TBC  and  WOTLK before ever getting there myself. Blizzard does have Beta tests.
---
ENFP - Horde - Shaman - DPS - PVP
---
Well because some bosses are less dangerous for a raid with a bear tank and some are not. Considering that, you can say that same thing about a prot warr and u wont get anywhere. This is how i see it.
---
ISFJ - Alliance - Rogue - DPS - Equal Focus
---
Entirely. I straight up told my buddies I’d play to get my gear caught up. But then I intend to raid log. 
---
If they need me I’ll raid tues/weds but I’ll be on classic the rest of my video game hours.
---
If you’ve got the means to raid log mythic or can get FnF in a real guild for easy access to high m+, retail is fun. Everything else blows.
---
I’d say raid loging live mythic raids and then spending the rest of your time on classic is ideal. Will certainly make spamming frostbolt all night in classic raids more manageable if I can do some challenging raid content elsewhere.
---
Loch Modan is my favorite zone, love it!

---
That's a respectable amount of gold in vanilla, I barely could hold a thousand :O
---
That’s not an open beta bud. Open beta = open to literally anyone who signs up
---
What you were a part of was a closed, invite only beta
---
So you're admitting the lower pop was a design decision.
---
You sound like everyone else spouting #notchanges when it suits them but reasoning why just that little bit you want changed is ok.
---
Myers–Briggs personality type classification is utter bullshit and pseudoscience.
---
did they replace some of your items? those look like random levelling greens (the trinkets, rings, belt, neck , etc)
---
Except they were? Unless you mainly did pvp.
---
His UI will make up for it, gotta make it like vanilla to get the full experience.
---
You make it sound like stream snipping isn't a thing.
---
Actually I did not drop it, but it was rendered as a header.
---
Blizzards leave it open for anyone that wants to test it.  Only requirement is an active WoW account. 
---
Not sure where you're getting your info from. WoW hast been like this for years now.
---
Vanilla had a (semi, might of only been for people who preordered) open beta though.
---
Everyone has been saying for the past month “there will be info this week just wait” and nothing has happened. Getting kinda sick of waiting, at least tell us the release date
---
Confirmed!!!!!
---
Let us not forget about airlifting a tank into a hotspot with the helos while you got the radio blaring. So much multiplayer fun

# &lt;Quest Failed&gt; [EU] Alliance PVP Guild
---
Quest Failed is a hardcore PVP guild that is looking to recruit the **finest players of the alliance**. We aim to be the top PVP guild on our server by proving ourselves as a formidable force of highly skilled players. While PVP will be at the top of our agenda, **we also look to fill our ranks with raiders and casual players** as it is important to us that we provide a functional and pleasant community for all of our members.
---
Typical weekdays within Quest Failed will usually include:
---
* Raids (We will be using Suicide King DKP in order to provide the most fair distribution of loot)
---
* Contesting world bosses
---
* PVP nights
---
* Social farming nights
---
* Duelling tournaments
---
It doesn't matter if you are a veteran at Vanilla World of Warcraft, or if it is your first time playing. We are accepting people who are looking to dedicate themselves to the game and learn to play at the highest level while also creating a community of friendship.
---
If this sounds like a community that you would like to be a part of, feel free to join our discord server and fill out our short application form so that we can learn a bit more about you.
---
Our dates and times will be decided once we have collected enough data from our members so that we can accommodate as many people as possible.

Haha, I like Luna a lot, our style tastes are probably just a 100% opposite, while our goals are exactly the same, this is my "dream UI" that I came up with for my WotLK client and that I will try to replicate in Classic:
---
https://imgur.com/a/7OdqMgC
---
Similar general idea - clean elements, important stuff in the middle - while in combat - and faded while out of combat. I am glad I will be playing Warrior, since druid was a nightmare because of the dual mana bar lol.
---
Honestly it would low-key be a good idea to launch on a Monday without notice so all the non-workers get in to play, get through the starting zone, and then it's more cleared out for us employees during happy hour.
---
I'm not serious at all, but it would at least stagger the starting players a bit?
---
Europe to Oceania *in a straight line* is about 14k km.
---
At speed of light (300km/ms) the Round Trip time would be ~105ms.
---
But light in fiber is slower (200km/ms) and that alone brings it up to 157ms.
---
Of course you have to add all the hardware latency in between, but even in perfect conditions we wouldn't know how to break the floor of 105ms.
---
Undead mage dinged 60 in the eastern plaguelands.
---
I would immediatley start vomiting and go home.
---
Hashes have been, it means number usually. Hashtag is specific to twitter, and literally means a tagged with a hash.
---
Tbh it’s been that way since bc. 
---
Bc added quests to dustwallow marsh. Every other piece of content was for level 70. 
---
It was inevitable when they chose the two expansions after vanilla to not take place on the OG continents.
---
Lol no. PTR is open beta. 
---
Expansions are NOT open beta. You opt in and if you’re lucky they select you. And no, it doesn’t require an active account.
---
In hellfire ramparts.
---
I was 55isch when TBC arived. Wasted to mush time walljumping and exploring.
---
I have decided to roll druid in classic, but I am still undecided on what profession to choose. I want to pvp and pve. I hear engineer is really good for pvp, but unsure on how usable this is for a druid (since they cannot use bombs etc in animal form). Alchemy is another option I consider, as pots are always useful for when healing/tanking.
---
I dinged on the right balcony in the Emp's room in BRD.
---
The alpha/beta labels are mostly meaningless. You can't infer any specific information from them aside from alpha roughly comes before beta which roughly comes before release. The fact that Blizzard called it an employee alpha and the client build is labeled beta shows exactly this.
---
Sounds like someone is going to kite a giant demon to a major city.
---
Your home is on an island, doesn’t get more relaxing than that buddy! 🌴

I think this means Half Life 3 though? Not sure if the cough changes the meaning though, I am only at lesson 3 in the tinfoil-hat usage course.
---
Yes it's labeled beta, but the blue post said it was an alpha.
---
Mages have many tools to deal with mana: mana grms, passive mana regen from talents/mage armor and Evocation. Warlocks get Life Tap. Shamans have nothing except their totems (which everyone else also benefits from). 
---
On top of that, eles have Lightning Bolt/Chain Lightning’s cast time reduced by a full second from talents. It makes their spell hit much harder because of the SP coefficient based on default casting speed but also puts their mana cost through the roof. For an extreme example, imagine a mage somehow casting pyroblast at twice the regular speed. They would do tons of damage but go oom extremely fast. 
---
On top of the massive mana issues, eles suffer from resistance issues in raids. Warlocks have curses that reduce shadow/arcane/fire/frost resistances and mages talents that help them go through resostances as well. There’s no curse that lowers nature resist, and shamans have no talents to help them get past that either.
---
might very well have been a problem with the game's layout as well. not everything in the world is finished in vanilla, stormwind for example is all smoke and mirrors etc. with flight, they'd have to design everything like they did in the cataclysm revamp
---
&gt; I am only at lesson 3
---
Coincidence? I think not.
---
hello from the norf
---
&gt;  raid bosses will do crushing bloes 
---
As long as you don't have 100% avoidance you'll always receive crushing blows. Warriors can mitigate this by using shield block, druids that don't reach 100% avoidance passively will always receive crushing blows as long as their gear doesn't become literally perfect. 
---
Fun fact: rogues could actually reach 100% avoidance in late BC and were able to tank certain raid bosses such as Gruul or Mother Shahraz.
---
INFJ - Alliance - Hunter - DPS/Crowd Management - 5 Man / Occasional PVP

Human warrior, dinged 60 in Winterspring whilst farming for the Frostsaber mount.
---
Does it matter? Even if it was a technical limitation does that make it okay for them to change it? 
---
In that case the debuff limit can be safely removed and spell batching reverted back to BfA levels since both of those were actual technical limitations that they wanted to change.
---
It's a slippery fucking slope if they start changing the game. Deliver it the way it was 14 years ago and nobody has any right to be upset. #nochanges
---
Winterspring
---
Do what we used to do.
---
Go to wowhead (a few days after release) and look at wool cloth drop stats. Pick the mob with highest spawn count and highest percentage chance, and go to town on them.
---
Ditto for cooking materials.
---
Honestly not sure I’d even play a beta. I know i’m gonna sink so much time into this game. Might wait until the real thing is available.
---
What? I said the population cap was different depending on what time period you look at. They "designed it" at one value nd then ran into technical difficulties trying to adjust it. 
---
It won't be blizzlike populations either way. The server had a constant influx of players as the game got more and more popular. It's more likely to have a large influx of people at the start and then slow declines. If the cap starts at 2k peak then in 6 months we could be looking at server xfers or merging dead servers.
---
They did...once long ago. In vanilla they ran an event with a max level 19 private server for wsg. Supposedly the guild with the most honor at the end of the event would get into TBC beta. Well the event was such a success they gave TBC beta keys to everyone who participated. It was an awesome event. And....I'm pretty sure they never did anything like that again :(
---
60 Paladin - Eastern Plaguelands at the little crypt SW side of map. Was just grinding there. - Azgalor name was Alfiey

So it's actually the same exact thing, but you're being pedantic.

Cmon now.

It's very challenging on Horde, less so on Alliance. You don't really have any threat-shedding mechanics like rogues -- the most you can do is back off on dps / switch to abilities that generate less threat (which usually amounts to less dps).
---
As far as your rogue/warrior debate goes, I think you should ask yourself what kinda of playstyle you're interested in. Rogues generally have more combat utility (as in, varied abilities) and PVP tools and will beat out furies early game before furies get some gear (this might change though with 1.12 itemization on items like Savage Gladiator Chain and BRE). Furies are a bit more straightforward in their role (debuff boss, do damage, occasionally try to save guildie being assaulted by a stray mob) but generally have a more complicated playstyle (especially on Horde with windfury proc fishing) and will outstrip rogues across the board for melee damage as they (the furies) get more geared up. 
---
Both are viable options -- I'd say go for rogue if you want to be a bit more varied in what you do in and out of raid, and go for fury if you straight up want to boom stuff in pve.
---
They are so thin, it looks a little wonky on them. Then again, stuff like the Naxx set, the high warlord set look so good on undead that were kind of spoiled.
---
Mana is important to manage, and you have to manage it as any caster, but some casters have way more tools to conserve/regain mana.
---
In a Mage's case, they have mana gems that they consume to gain mana. They can "craft" them (you just use mana to create them) before the fight and can then use them during the fight to regain mana. More notably they have Evocation, which is a strong, channeled mana regen that scales with Spirit.
---
I plan on getting as many mistakes out of the way as possible during beta (if I get in)
---
I haven’t played vanilla since vanilla, so there is very likely a lot of big and small mistakes incoming 
---
Among class and race decisions that I have ideas about, but not sure about
---
Winterspring I believe.
---
A *lot* of private servers didn't add the abilities/cast AI for the dwarves at the start of BRD. Like half of the dwarves there are meant to net you but don't.
---
I don't want them to change all the server caps. I want them to make a few larger servers to attract the premading PvP tryhards to one giant toxic server.
---
Parking my undead rogue in menethil harbour to gank all the alliance lowbies
---
No, it’s not the same thing. WTF. You said it’s open to anyone who wants.  It’s not.
---
cool idea man
---
mages have an easy time with bad rogues, yeah, high-end rogue is the only actual counter to mage in all of vanilla, it's winnable but it's still really one sided in favor of the rogue
---
bad rogues will get eaten alive all day though
---
So you don't think this database is worth having because wowhead exists?
---
there are elite mobs in legion and bfa, they're usually questbosses that you're supposed to group up and kill during the last quest of a quest hub 
---
I played a few hours of bfa, made it to level 116, and solo'd them all with ease. I played a death knight though idk if other classes are capable of that as well (but they probably are.)
---
I still remember about the exact spot where I dinged 60 on my first character, it was in the south western part of EPL, slightly NW of the crypt but south of the main road. I think I had somewhere around 10-20% left of the level once I entered the zone and I just grabbed the first quests I saw and killed all mobs I came by.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

INFP - Horde - Shaman - endgame heals - PvP/PvE
---
&gt; I don't understand this idea that you need to recognize the same people every day
---
It was part of their design philosophy. They wanted that small community familiar feeling. Who are we to demand that they change the game to go against their design philosophies?
---
For raiding? It'll be fine for dungeons, but in raiding it's definitely at the bottom yes.
---
Not many people know this really because they are the least played class but Druids are actually amazing against Rogues. And even if Rogues try to escape and reset fights. They can't. Druids Faerie Fire. GG from there. Druids will out heal and out run them to catch them by a mile.

Well what do you know..

It said 5 hours and some change when I checked at like 10AM EST.  Now his stream says 23 hours and 20something minutes.  The dude is a joke, just going to ignore this and assume it is bullshit.
---
&gt;#***Only requirement is an active WoW account.***
---
Priest nova spam is not a bad farm. With 6k mana you can farm DM:E,  with herbalism you come out with about 10-15 herbs per run. Iirc you could run 4-5 times an hour.
---
It’s not nearly as effective as a mage with all their different AoE farms. But it can get the job done especially early on.
---
It doesn’t even require an active wow account. Jesus Christ can you read?
---
Black Rock Mountain was my jam. I raided a ton and I was a rogue, so on off nights I raided raiders. It was beautiful and I miss it.
---
same PM plz
---
im pretty sure he didnt have that much gold back then, he got it from quest rewards while leveling most likely ( OP mentioned that he let his friend use it as his alt )
---
Rush for Consecrate (get it at 20), then Paladins have it easier than Warriors early on.
---
:shakespeare gif:
---
At least back in the day, you would 100% die through the vw sac before the stunlock was over to a naxx geared rogue.
---
I see this sentiment repeated a lot that sl somehow survives, it wasnt my experience at all back then.
---
Timer on channel is now fixed and coded properly. See you fine lads tomorrow

"hey guys tips here with another video on classic, today will be talking about lakes in the game!"
---
I used rainmeter to make my laptop look like the Skyrim menu back in 2011. Slowed down my computer a ton but was amazing. No regrets.

Damn, yeah this one is getting me. I loved leveling as undead.

&lt;Get of Fenris&gt; - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
**What’s it mean?**:
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.  
---
**Our Philosophy**:
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.  
---
**So what about loot and stuff?**:
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.  
---
**What Gets us apart**:
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such ***we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).*** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!  
---
**A Brief History**:
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.  
---
**Raid Times**:
---
TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)  
---
**Guild Priorities**:
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).

I know this was not the question, but is the repaired chest piece the same vendored price as the almost broken chest piece? 
---
So before selling, repair or not?
---
Winterspring, somewhere in the vicinity of the Shy-Rotam quest.
---
Warrior singer in Burning Steppes. I vaguely remember it. I had run out of quests and was grinding away. I’m sure I didn’t get them all, but didn’t know where fresh ones were and decided fuck it, it’s a level and a half. Popped an audio book on and went at it.
---
Was my only 60 prior to TBC (which I largely skipped, didn’t hit level cap again until Wrath).
---
forsenE ?
---
&gt;they've just scaled everything down because else numbers in BFA would be in the gazzilions by now.
---
why though? after their what, third itemsquish(?), they should've learned their lesson by now. 
---
If a level 60 legendary weapon has 50ish dps, why can't they just make level 120 items 100dps? item progression worked in vanilla from 1-60 so it should also work for 1-120
---
Going to Westfall at night has to be one of the best experiences ever. You leave the lush and dense forest of Elwynn and encounter organized bandits, ghostly pirates, harvest constructs and sand devils.
---
Then you enter the Brotherhood's stronghold and put an end to your first big menace. Bonus points as a mage for getting that sweet Emberstone Staff.

Oh I know Jared.  He landed somewhere? Didn’t know he could fly in the first place.

Sanguine is a casual raiding guild organized by vanilla veterans with an emphasis on community and cooperation. For us, WoW is a social platform for shared challenges and shared victories.
---
**Raiding**
---
Weekly raids start on **Saturday at 1:00pm EST**. We will add a Sunday afternoon raid when progressing in new content. We use a modified version of the "Suicide Kings" loot system. For details, visit the About the Guild page on our website.
---
**Recruitment**

And I don't want them to change the game at all. 
---
You're well within your right to advocate for #changes but I don't think that Blizzard should listen to you.
---
Resist :]
---
I tried, but it was taken. My nemesis, we meet at last.
---
I'm excited for the RP possibilities in Classic. just being able to RP like the Third War (Warcraft 3) is a recent memory, without all the increasingly ridiculous lore baggage of 7 expansions.
---
not sure of my character's backstory yet though.
---
Engineering is very good for both pvp and pve (:
---
&gt; Who are we to demand that they change the game to go against their design philosophies?
---
Who are the *you* to demand that every server, everywhere, *must* subscribe to some population cap that you deem sufficient because of something you read about design philosophy that a couple devs held at one point in time?
---
Pop caps were raised as time went on during vanilla in addition to bigger server launches still during vanilla. We're talking blizzlike - THAT is blizzlike because it actually happened. Not what you're describing. Let's stick with Blizzlike here as we can all agree on.
---
There's nothing wrong with allowing *a few* higher pop servers. Doesn't affect your gameplay at all.
---
&gt;It doesn’t even require an active wow account
---
 Yes, it does.

Nope.

INFJ - Horde - Shaman - Healer - PVP focus

I was in a UK based clan called &lt;|BdD|&gt;. (First time I’ve typed that in 15 years). We used to compete in a European league. I really want to say ESL lol. It was multi-game league. Had a CS, CoD:UO, UT2004 and BF42 ladder. Good times man. What was that map with the bridge and the clock tower. You know the one.
---
INFP-Alliance-Druid-Healer-Equal focus
---
Well the queue dodging shady shit won't be there with cross-realms, but there's still going to be collusion at the top. IMO, it's not that shady, but rankers will 100% set an unofficial "honor cap" so they don't have to grind so hard and will take turns getting Grand Marshal.
---
aggressive was in vanilla?
---
Great setup man. Your quality IKEA stuff and clean and classy style in general tells me you're swedish. Am I right? ;)
---
Also, I'm super jealous of your LOTR-posters. Wow!
---
ISFP-T - Alliance - Priest - Healer - PvE
---
No. Mage AoE farming works because you keep stuff perma slowed and don't get hit. It is not a feasible strategy to just facetank and spam stuff to death.
---
16 July?
---
I am heading for a LARP event on the 19th. One and a half weeks without internet. My poor heart...
---
I still can't decide between warlock or rogue arrrrhgggghhh
---
While i played my human rogue to rank14 the biggest enemy was a geared orc warrior/hunter. 
---
Usualy i could beat them 1v1, but i needed all of my cds and even then... i needed to run if they resisted a few important stuns.
---
My horde rogue friends always told me they cant really do anything againts reckoning bomb paladins, there was one rank 13 with Sulfuras (Ragnaros legendary mace) .. he could beat them 100/100 times
---
This why I rolled a druid at launch.  I wanted to be like the druid of the talon in WC3.  I thought for sure we will get flight form at some point and it will be boss!  And I did in TBC; which was awesome at the time.

ISTP-A -Horde-Mage-DPS-Equal Focus
---
Holy shit you’re challenged. 
---
Let me lay it out for you. 
---
Open beta: literally anyone who wants to can join the Beta. See Hearthstones beta, which had 9.7 million players. See Minecraft. 
---
Closed beta: invite only. You must be picked to participate. See WoW. 
---
Active sub required? No: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/13272427306
---
Definitely hunters. 
---
Rogues did not have the tools to ever close the gap. They couldn't get away either. 
---
Even as a lowbie hunter you still could solo max lvl rogues, since ranged weapons would still hit and do their normal damage despite the level difference unlike melee and spells(which would be spam resisted.)
---
So I've seen this play out in a casual guild; a tryhard ele at lower levels (MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20, etc) will beat out other DPS for sure. You can easily be middle of the pack or slightly better if you're gaming as ele. That said, they scale horribly into content above that and rip TONS of threat.
---
Honestly with respect to your mana question, there's not much more to it than "the spells are expensive for the amount of damage you do and the frequency with which you cast them." Like shadow priest, your shit just costs a lot of mana, and in order to do any kind of viable dps you need tons of uptime which = lots of mana.
---
My advice is to go ele if you think you're gonna raid casually, but you'll generally have a hard time getting a raid spot as top tier endgame raiding goes along and will have difficulty snagging one with the hardcore and semi-hardcore raiders. You might have a little easier time as Enhance in those guilds but generally the more competitive an environment you put yourself in, the weaker Ele becomes.
---
Very true. Ours was a Initial Release server, so before Oceanic Realms existed, and actually had enough Late-Night population to support 2 raiding guilds. We had about a 50/50 mix of US members and New Zealand / Aussie members.
---
We later transferred to an Oceanic realm as Late-Night US population had dwindled with the release of Oceanic. 
---
The largest problem I saw with raiding from the US with Oceanic was the daylight savings time changes in the Spring/Fall, and that some of the Australian Territories dont observe them, but they're opposite the US daylight savings, so in October, their clocks go Forward 1 hour, where ours go Backwards, vice-versa in the spring.
---
Hearthglen
---
My thoughts are that wednesday they will have an announcement, but instead of having the beta the 19th of may. It’s actually the launch!
---
There's a vocal minority out there that hate the Aeron for sure. It's still a marvel in design and comfort *if you get the fully loaded version.* Generally speaking people don't get the fully adjustable variant which completely defeats the purpose of having an ergonomic chair. Most complaints (from what I've gathered) is about the hard outer rim on the seat-pan which sometimes cuts off circulation to the legs. If one isn't sitting properly or the chair is the wrong size then this would obviously exacerbate the issue. If someone is used to "lounge type gaming" they're not going to enjoy any ergonomic office chair because it forces you to use good posture.
---
That being said, I've got the newer remastered Aeron at home and I don't have any issues with comfort. I've sat in the Embody and much prefer the former because of the mesh.
---
Priest. Just make sure to have inner fire on. If you can survive the initial damage, you can just outlast the rogue.
---
Same prop they posted on May 3rd, seems to be a permanent fixture. But exciting!
---
Remember you need enchanting if you plan on using Smoking Heart of the Mountain, although I guess you can drop it after you've made it.
---
Winterspring!
---
Are you me?
---
Show me proof of them changing the concurrency caps then. Mark Kern has confirmed that the caps were more or less 3k in vanilla and that the servers couldn't handle more than 4k.
---
Show me proof of that ~3k cap changing.
---
I know your pain bröther
---
I dunno.  Streamers need people to play with.  You can't have 12 streamers on an empty server, not a good look and it doesn't actually do anything for a beta.
---
Bfa was good till it revealed repition ad naseum via the world quests, mythic + and Azeroth grind. 
---
The endless treadmill sucks. It feels artificial.
---
Grinding gear from 5 mans, getting the key to ubrs, getting into mc. The attune for ony. Then to bwl. And zg. Start the war effort while gearing up to then go into aq and finally naxx. It feels natural. 
---
I do Champions of Azeroth world quests, because if I don’t the number on my necklace doesn’t get bigger and I get “behind”. 
---
The reward structure feels off. I feel punished for not playing, vs rewarded for playing more. 
---
That said, I just came back and getting carried through 410 content at 360 ilvl makes everything a mythic raid fight in terms of mechanical deadliness.
---
Winterspring, after a day at 60, created another toon.
---
You're bringing up stuff that isn't even related to what we're talking about. I never said anything about the debuff limit. The server pops were different from server to server and the caps were raised later in vanilla. We're talking about something that was fluid during the original game. We aren't talking about something like spell batching.
---
Make, gnome, warlock
---
Mining / engineering
---
Grand Marshall.
---
Mcfurbbly the destroyer is on a mad search for power, hopefully to attain enough gear to one shot players on battlegrounds.
---
It was good for farming coin. You could get about 1g in silver per large pull of spiders In an area I can't remember what's it's called. Take about 2 hours to get 100g. That was a big deal at the time.
---
Pretty sure you're just wrong though.
---
only on pvp servers
---
it can be streamers getting to do Deadmines etc. Something canned and controllable.

INTP - Horde - Rogue - PvE
---
warriors are considered to be one of the best dps classes in vanilla. I never played one at 60 myself, but from what i've heard they're great fun. 
---
If you're thinking PvE dps, fury is the way to go. Regarding race, just pick what ever you think looks the best. The racial differences are minuscule. 
---
It's worth mentioning that due to their gear dependancy, warriors are one of the slowest lvlers. You're gonna be eating a lot and struggling with bigger pulls. But i've heard and read that it's equally rewarding and worth the troubles when you hit 60
---
Winterspring and I hated the zone.
---
I am ok with no release date. But i am not ok with being told its gonna be summer and then month before summer still not knowing anything exact. At this point they have to know if they are releasing in summer or not.
---
I agree with you, but seeing a smaller number on an old item should seriously not have any impact on how much you enjoy the game now.
---
Goalposts = moved
---
Hmm close to it. Kinda tied with Ret Paladin and Boomkin. I've seen spriest and feral (cat) druids do OK DPS in AQ and Naxx but never seen a ret paladin or ele or boomy do anything less than dead-last (less than the tank even!) DPS at high high endgame content.
---
Farming DM was a big thing in Vanilla. Hunters/Mages could do it and make good gold, but not all classes could. 
---
Not sure what Bliz can do outwith redesigning the instances again, in which players will just find ways round it.
---
I honestly hope they skip right over beta because knowing myself I will want to start playing the beta and all my progress will be lost. I'm totally okay with a mediocre launch if it means I can start sooner.
---
You make a compelling argument.
---
No changes.
---
&gt; but instance solo farming was almost non inexistant in Vanilla so it's not really a change 
---
That's not true at all, especially for Diremaul and BRD. Not sure why you would think otherwise, if you had played Vanilla back then.
---
Burning Stepps, grinding on dragonkin.
---
Dwarf Paladin, or Mage, both hard-counter rogue pretty well.
---
Almost nobody knew it and it wasn't as optimized as it is now
---
Can you provide link to chair (if you would recommend) - looking for a normal looking comfortable chair
---
I think it was called ... bridge?? 😂 had the bombs underneath where you planted the bombs? I remember when CoD came out, what a game that was! The games now a days just don’t have the same feel... and that comment officially made me feel 30
---
Not what I said at all.
---
Just saying, the database for best wool drops already exists (or will, right after release.)
---
The amount of people I know that raided with Aussies is too damn high.
---
why? ge isnt going to play on more then 1 or 2 servers lol
---
The usual guide isn't really a "super hardcode leveling guide". Leveling in Vanilla is a pain in the ass and those guides just make the whole game much more enjoyable, at least for me who can't play the entire day so best thing to do is to be efficient with your time. Otherwise it's going to take a month to level up to 60.
---
8/10 for situational relevance.
---
3/10 for using an Office gif with lack of dog reference.
---
Ok, Overwatch had an open beta.
---
And if you're Dwarf, you can Stoneform if the rogue tries to blind you and run away. (works like pvp trinket)
---
I need this but for EU :F
---
I'm on the fence. I won't know until the day I log in.
---
&gt;The problem is mainly that you cant get proper gear, bc theres no dedicated leather tanking gear with the defense stat. This means that raid bosses will do crushing bloes, and crits to you if i understand correctly, which is why they arent so good. But imo bears are great tanks in dungeons and i love to have them
---
Not even Warrior tanks really care about defense. It's not that important when you have armor cap and 13k HP. Probably should take the whole debate about Druid viability elsewhere though, as my point was that playing a tank requires a certain amount of effort.
---
That doesnt change whether you play Warrior or Druid.
---
Of course private servers had broken economy when gold was farmed literally 24/7 due to time zone differences... They are usually a mixed server after all, every region and their grandmother plays on them.
---
Regional servers will be different. Besides, not everyone will invest in dungeon solo farming since only a few classes are really efficient at it.
---
Mind providing me a link with proof of them changing the caps.
---
Mark Kern has said that the caps were more or less 3k by design and that the servers could handle 4k at most. If you're calling him a liar you should have proof.
---
Doesn't his double negative make him technically correct?
---
Prot is better than bear hands down so you cant "say that same thing about a prot warr."
---
The community is never going to be the same as it was in vanilla. We know things we didn’t back then and we’ve gotten a lot better at the game. Should we change vanilla then to make it harder? Should they make raids harder? In vanilla it took people forever to clear Naxx, on pvt servers it was cleared the first week. 
---
But even with changes, you’ll never get the exact same experience as in vanilla. The best they can do is make a mechanically accurate vanilla WoW. Including stuff that may be OP.
---
Wasted?
---
Higher pop realms were a thing in actual vanilla, and I don't know if anyone is asking for a 10k online realm. 
---
Providing a few higher pop realms for players simply as an option doesn't negatively impact anyone.
---
Any post that asks "Should blizzard nerf / Change" and then is followed up with Read first instantly gets a downvote.   
---
Stop trying to change things lol.
---
You can always go back to the quests you miss and do them at any level so there's no fear in missing out 
---
Play what you find the most fun not what other people tell you to play
---
So if I can get a dev to say the hunter deadzone was a design mistake we should change that too?
---
 It was different depending on what period you look at it so we should remove it completely no?
---
NE Rogue in the one of the bottom floor rooms of the last are of scholo with water on the floor and above ground crypts.
---
I'm not calling him a liar. Skip to 40 minutes into the por cast where they talk about this. He talks about how at first it was a design and when they later increase it, it was a technical limitation. 
---
So logically speaking it was set low (respectively) at the start... And then? Higher later on to hit a different kind of cap.
---
This pretty much. You kind of just farm it until you find yourself in MC.
---
There was a beta it started in 2004 you probably missed it.
---
what Vanilla dungeons would be realistically soloable at level 60, if you were the right class/had the right gear? at what point is the cutoff to "not possible to solo the dungeon to farm gold"?
---
Imagine thinking that pservers nerfed it cause it ruined the economy. Not because it cut into their gold selling profits.
---
One major difference is in Morhau if you try that whirlwind shit your hit will glance  for around 7 damage
---
Better, but not perfect. Thats my point.
---
Yeah, that one was kinda weird.
---
That's... So out in left field it's literally a completely different topic. The deadzone change youre talking about was in a different xpac
---
You won't miss out on anything and can do those quests later. Obviously you won't get xp if you are higher level by that point and the rewards won't be worth much either.
---
There's literal evidence of him saying this on the podcast and then you go and dismiss it because at the very beginning he said the word design.
---
You're not looking at the information, your cherry picking parts of it to support your personal preference.
---
By my recollection, Druids had specific quest chains that led them to Moonglade which would not show up if they did starting quests elsewhere. However, most other classes had interchangeable zones, since their skills were gated only by class trainers (so a Forsaken Priest, for instance, might not be well off going to Mulgore because there are no Priest Trainers except in Thunder Bluff, but they weren't actually cut off from skill-granting quest chains themselves).
---
It all becomes a lot less relevant after level 10 or so, once the different races are expected to intermingle with cross-continent quest chains, main city class trainers, etc.

Der anstehende Classic-Release (Soon™) ist für uns eine erneute Möglichkeit wieder in das World of Warcraft einzutauchen, das wir alle lieben gelernt haben.  Obwohl der Content nun 14 Jahre zurückliegt, wollen wir diesen noch einmal erforschen. Dazu suchen wir erwachsene Spieler, die bereit sind in überschaubarem Umfang das Möglichste aus sich herauszuholen. Wir sind eine Gruppe von Spielern, welche neben Vanilla (2005) und Privatservern, auf einen fast 15-jährigen Erfahrungsschatz zurückgreifen können. Unser Fokus liegt, wie schon immer, auf dem PVE-Content und hierzu suchen wir tatkräftige Unterstützung.
---
**Worum geht es uns?**
---
Wir wollen eine Community aufbauen, die sich in einer angenehmen Atmosphäre mit maximalem Einsatz durch den Content bewegt. Hierzu gibt es zwei Raidtage in der Woche, welche dann auch mit ausreichend Vorbereitung (Pots, Food, Line-Up-Optimierung etc.), in moderatem Tempo, bestritten werden. Uns ist eine „gute“ Laune im Raid wichtig, wobei dies für uns mit dem Verständnis einhergeht, den Content auf bestmögliche Art, schnell zu clearn. Dieser Semi-Hardcore-Ansatz (wobei das Hardcore mehr von der Mentalität, als von dem Aufwand bestimmt ist: keine fünf Raidtage) spiegelt sich in unserem Verständnis von „Spaß am Spiel“ wieder. Umsetzung:Um diesen Gedanken umsetzen zu können, haben wir ein DKP-System mit eingeschränktem Lootrecht eingeführt. Dies heißt, dass auf gewissen Items eine Klassen- oder Specrestriktion liegt, um ein „verschwenden“ zu vermeiden.
---
**Was suchen wir?**
---
Wir suchen alle Spieler, die sich mit der beschriebenen Philosophie identifizieren können und gerne ein Teil davon sein möchten. Wir sind bereits mehr als 50 Member!
---
**Raidzeiten:** Montag &amp; Mittwoch 19:00 – 23:00 Uhr
---
**Kontakt:** Solltest du jetzt Interesse haben melde dich unter [***https://discord.gg/dUkCVqU***](https://discord.gg/dUkCVqU)
---
How many Naxx geared Rogues are going to be running around. Fuckall.
---
Lock vs Rogue is a fairly even matchup in vanilla. Locks probably have the advantage in low skill fights.
---
SL/SL was a TBC thing, not in vanilla.
---
You make an argument based on an assumption that people will ONLY instance farm. Being that it's only a few classes/specs that can even do this I'm going to say you are wrong in your assumption.
---
Everyone wont only make max lvl alts to instance farm and hence not interact in the persistent world, as you said your ultimate fear would be.
---
People will have their mains and maybe a few other alts MAYBE at max lvl. They all cant farm DM or BRD. Instead they will have to open world farm or do grp runs or whatever hundred other ways you can make gold.
---
Male human Warlock. Comes from a long line of arcane scholars and great mages. He was exiled from the house for researching shadow magic and demons, which is thought to be too low class and dangerous for the prestigious arcane family.
---
Rolling a tauren might help me tho
---
Still requires a lot more game knowledge and more reliance on a solid team, I'd say. Paladins can't effectively ranged pull (except against Demon/Undead targets) so they have a harder time pulling to a safe position which means they either face pull or let a party member do it and lose some threat. 
---
Paladins have mana management while rage management is far less of an issue. Paladins don't have a taunt for situations in which something goes wrong. 
---
They also got to be far more specific in the type of gear they hunt for than a warrior, IIRC. 
---
They can absolutely be dungeon tanking beasts, but I'd say it definitely requires more effort and is a lot more difficult to consistently pull off for the average player let alone pugging.
---
Relevant content, lakes sometimes have treasure chests in them.
---
On command?
---
Level 60 dwarf Hunter named Gerginy, I dinged in eastern plaugelands.
---
&gt; a 10k realm with dynamic spawn rates for mobs and nodes
---
no one asked for 10k
---
no one asked for dynamic respawn
---
It's ok to have a few 4k - 6k servers for players to self select if they want. Doesn't negatively affect you at all.
---
It existed in vanilla just like selling runs through instances to lower level players did. I also think it is a relevant way to make money that sorts itself out naturally in the AH.
---
Hmm ok. Thanks
---
So a human rogue going to Dun Morogh right away wouldn't present a issue, correct?
---
Hm, I might still disagree. The demonic rune / dark rune farm is necessary and extremely tedious because those shits are EXPENSIVE. You also rack up a decent bill mana potting -- and that mp5 food you talk about is also super expensive. I would also argue that most occasions "requiring" mages to flask also require healers to flask. Sure, having more SP will always be beneficial in a way that having more healer mana won't (like farm content) but it's generally not necessary at that point, and even hardcore guilds will probably not do that any more with the non-private-server-black-lotus-spawn-rates in Classic.
---
For sure though melee consuming is far more expensive than caster or healer.
---

Clean look. I like it.

Molten Core.  Started healing raids at 58, mostly because I had no clue what right looked like.

Half life 3 beta confirmed
---
Rogue, farmed Tyr's hand elites :)
---
That's why the first link was attached
---
You don't do first room like most videos related to this shows, instead you go for shortcut and AoE the room where Shadowforge Lock is. 
---
You can also farm the tunnel where Lord Roccor patrols. There is also guardsmans/footmans, along with fire eles, dog packs and the Roccor himself. Getting there as lvl 60 shouldn't a problem either, you're be able to avoid all the unnecessary mobs by having a massive lvl advantage.
---
Grab 3-4 packs at once and pull them into the arena, but avoid stepping on the middle for obvious reasons, though.
---
Life is much better just assuming the game isn't coming until late September . 
---
Y'all should join me.
---
Never really considered a mage a "counter" to a rogue. It's basically two glass cannons. Whoever gets a good opener wins, which ends up being the rogue a lot of the time...
---
Dying if I mess up a pull and pull more than one or two things at a time.
---
Human Paladin, I'll be questing in (in order)
---
- Dun Morogh
---
- Teldrassil
---
- Dum Morogh
---
- Elwynn Forest
---
Am I the only one who think it's weird that we have no release date yet despite they said the release is in summer? I mean that's like what 3 or 4 months?
---
 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Orc BM Hunters
---
Arms Warriors
---
Dwarf Holy Paladins (in a BG setting)
---
The Warlock/Priest arguments are only valid later in vanilla when/if said classes are geared to the teeth.
---
Great another guide based on information, npc spawn points and npc ability usage of private servers! A lot of stuff on private servers is accurate, but things this granular like spawn position and density are the most likely to be incorrect imo
---
INFP - Horde - Shaman - Healer - PvE &amp; PvP
---
Right? It wouldn't affect your gameplay at all if a few designated servers were clearly marked as such
---
People in this thread acting like dynamic respawn and shit is suddenly going to appear if Blizz creates a 4k online server..... What
---
100
---
Me: How about both?!?
---
So right at level 1 you'll run to the Dun Morogh starting area where the dwarves and gnomes start?
---
I am happy they are removing it though. For every person like you who wants to just have harmless fun and explore and see cool and interesting things, theres another person using it to try to find ways to exploit, bypass, or ruin something for others players. The harm it can cause is more damaging than the cool things people can find.
---
Eastern Plaguelands, specifically that little area NE of Marris Stead that has the little necropolis things.
---
Suprinsingly I remember it vividly- farming ogres in dead wind pass on my undead rogue. I think I grinded there from like 55-60. I somehow convinced myself there wasn’t enough quests and I HAD to grind. I remember it being so tedious but yet so satisfying when I finally dinged 60. No way I’m doing that again since I know better now :p
---
Yep, and I don't even run an affliction PvP spec, just run with PvE DS/Ruin
---
Clearly they all play on different servers :P
---
Right but this seems like worries over moving targets
---
We're unlikely to get anything resembling old school interactions either in game or on forums simply because virtually every online platform has gone to one of two extremes.
---
1&gt; The ultra-carebear fascist (Think blizzard forums, imgur, etc) where you can get suspended, warned, or banned for laughably vague reasons, or through an automated system where "disagreeing with people" becomes an actionable offense.
---
\-or-
---
2&gt; The ultra libertarian  (facebook, twitter, youtube) who won't confront hate speech or misinformation unless the story gets big enough to make the news.
---
I have personally gotten a 3 day suspension from the forums just for disagreeing with someone because my opinion was unpopular (That nothing players could do would convince Blizzard to do more work for less money).  If enough people dislike your opinion they will report you, because it costs them nothing.  
---
I don't think people are going to be calling out people on the forums for anything short of blatant ninjaing by non-guilded people, since a handful of reports on the forum is all it takes to elicit a temporary ban and removal of the post.
---
This is the same problem we're going to have in the actual game.  I predict empty global channels.  Someone advertising that they're looking for a healer, or recruiting for their guild could very easily find squelched and disconnected.  Right click report and auto squelch is fine in a game like retail where you can play the entire game, see every scrap of content, without ever typing a single word.  In a game where you have to advertise that you're looking for a healer in trade chat it's going to be a fucking nightmare.  I hope I'm either wrong about this or that blizzard realizes they're wrong before it does permanent damage to the brand (A quick glance at diablo however reminds me that they're not very good at fixing blatant mistakes before it can damage the brand)
---
Ditto!
---
Come on, it will all be about sheep...
---
Only a little, and I honestly have a feeling I’m the long run that wouldn’t help much. I think a lot of people will be playing in comparison to what some think. 
---
And unless the CRZ they’ll be using at the start does it’s job perfectly, vanilla wasn’t very friendly to overpopulation in areas. I could see people getting stuck for a very, very, long time. Even with a “surprise, it’s out!” Those people could be stuck even till the people at work got home.
---
But I don’t think this is a possibility anyway. A lot of people would see it as unfair and we’d have a few weeks of people blaming blizzard for not starting at the same time, not being able to take time off, ect.
---
I’m hoping (but this isn’t really a reality) that they’ll announce launch to be pretty soon (if they’re confident it’s ready) and have no beta or a very short beta.  But we’ll see. Just a few days until announcements if rumors are correct.
---
Same. My first retail 60 dinged in Hellfire. My first (and only) vanilla pserver 60 dinged in Winterspring.
---
And it would also piss off literally everyone preparing for WoW Classic
---
Winterspring, had just slew a rarespawn giant, will never forget!
---
Silithus
---
ISFJ-T / Alliance / Mage / DPS / PVP
---
Winter spring grinding north east yeti
---
ISFP-T - Alliance - Mage - DPS - Equal focus
---
You're going to have a bad time when it comes to training. You have to visit class trainers in Vanilla, unlike in retail where you just get skills as you go. There arent any Druid trainers in Dun Morough. At lvl 10 you can train the Teleport Moonglade spell, so at that point you could lvl anywhere and just teleport to Moonglade to train when you needed too. Until you get that spell thouth, lvl 1 Wrath + autos will only get you so far. Your lvl 6 skill up is a huge boost in your dps potential
---
The numbers might be inaccurate only in terms of loot table, which is a guess based. 
---
But technique itself will still work though, that's where people gonna grind for the epic mount until DM:E/ZG comes out. 
---
When it comes to melee mobs without special abilities (and that's exactly the scenario presented here), mage could AoE down those even if they've got 100k hp. Gear, in that case, doesn't matter either.
---
Kinda. I run ~~straight~~ there starting at level 1, getting level 4 along the way through elwynn, redridge, westfall, stormwind, grabbing a bunch of early flight paths and such. My first real block of questing starts at level 4 in Coldridge Valley gnome starting area tho.
---
Damn dude, you were a turbo nerd back in the day! Respect
---
As I was doing these, I realized how different I thought a lot of them were as well. The icons are pretty tiny in game!
---
In Silithus on both my Warrior and my Mage.
---
Great grinding spot for melee if I remember correctly.
---
Yes that will be fine. And a much easier run (and tram ride) than from Teldrassil.
---
No, and it’d be a lot easier to do that since you can just run into SW and then take the tram down to IF.
---
It was in the middle of a LBRS run for the Onyxia quest chain.
---
Correct there wouldn't be an issue here, there are rogue trainers in Dun Morough
---

Stratholme, loved running that instance back in the day.
---
It's easy to do that, because of the tram that goes from Stormwind to Ironforge.
---
By the time theyre naxx geared I expect I will be as well
---
You have lost me. Your post was to ask about bear tanking. I have told you that you will be second string competing for a starting position. Idk what you are arguing.
---
I imagine the guilds pushing for world first Rag kill in classic will have some under 60 healers in their groups.
---
That's still not an open beta. That's just a very widely available closed beta.
---
What would be the point of a Beta realistically?
---
Bug spotting &amp; fixing?
---
Player volume testing?
---
Hype building?
---
I’m not convinced, i think Blizzard can find a vast majority of the bugs with their internal testing. They can probably simulate volume of players to a fairly accurate degree. Does it build more hype to have a beta or to have a (let’s be honest) more significant actual release?
---
Unfortunately I don’t see it happening.
---
INFP-A/T. Horde, Druid, Heals/dps, PVP.
---
You are asking for advice and then refuting the advice given. Play a bear tank with all of your stipulations and see if you have fun.
---
There was a whole bluepost about it
---
It was an alpha
---
Agreed, if you have any plans to tank you will need to get your enchanting up to 265 so you can make Smoking Heart of the Mountain -- but you can drop it immediately after, so it's not really a commitment.
---
Engineering is bis for any class, and even if you can't use the items in shapeshift form, there's not reason you can't and shouldn't shift out to do it. FWIW it's actually also pretty useful in PVE on trash. Generally you'll either be using them before a pull so you can shift into form right after, OR you can powershift and use quickly in between. Most situations calling for you to use these engi items are also ones where you definitionally don't have aggro (already or yet), so it's OK to pop in and out of form to use.
---
I would recommend leveling up with maybe herb and skinning (sell the herbs / vendor the leather) dropping skinning for enchant to make Smoking Heart of the Mountain, and then dropping Ench for Alch or Engi.
---
Absolutely loving the LOTR artwork. Currently waiting for one of Barad-dûr myself.
---
Scatter shot helps separate distance if a rogue actually gets on you. If you can get a scatter off you usually could get away fairly easy and then once at range it's pretty much over
---
It's definitely something that I'm worried about, but until the game actually launches, I have no idea what steps (if any) Blizzard should take to address this.
---
From what I have heard, many private servers fail to accurately emulate NPC defensive stats, as no data is available for values like resistance, armour, dodge/block/parry chance, etc. Supposedly, much of the hard data used to create player-side databases was not recorded until mid-BC, so everything had to be reverse engineered based off a handful of videos, peoples' memories and occasional mentions in the patch notes. 
---
So it may well turn out that private servers underestimated these values, increasing the difficulty and time-to-kill relative to private servers. Should this be the case, no direct intervention will be needed.
---
I thought it was pretty obvious we were talking about WoW here. ActivisionBlizzard has a stupid number of games.
---
Despite the no changes crowd, this is a potentially game breaking exploit. They do really need to move a few mobs around in DM to make it not possible for the sake of economy.
---
This and AV rep/honor nerf or AV rebalance so AV rewards arent so easy.
---
Yea, i was wrong with my attitude. Sorry about that
---
I think much of the fearmongering about the impact of streamers on the quality of a server will, in practice, end up being hyperbole. In *principle*, as indicated in the video, there are some very real risks you could run. Those worst case scenarios are hard to picture enduring for very long at all to me, though, and are not something I feel is in need of any overt, let alone official, action to fix.      
---
         
---
I also think it's wishful thinking to believe that if Blizzard releases a server list that streamers will line up nicely and pre-pick their servers publicly so everyone can respond accordingly.      
---
        
---
All that having been said, I don't begrudge people the desire to not play with a server that has streamers, just as I don't begrudge those who don't want to play with children or with blood elf hunters (an opinion I held vehemently up through cataclysm). So if the anti-streamer-server people want to generate some fan-made 'known streamer server' list as a resource for server selection, that's no skin off my nose. Do it to it.
---
yeah it was available in WoD, but what I meant was, they took it away for Legion correct? or did they take it away in the later stages of WoD? (not sure, been subscribed on and off, but I know when I came back for Legion, Gladiator Stance was gone and Single Minded Fury was gone)
---
They will tell you as soon as they know. At the moment they can't be more specific than that it will be this summer. As soon as they're confident enough that the game is complete to give us a date, they will.
---
It's not as if they have a release date already and simply enjoy fucking with people.

Probably not. Discord is so popular guilds/friend groups will just post there, and anyone that is in their group will go there.
---
Some things were done out of necessity. There wasn't social media or Discord in the early 2000's. (Sans Myspace.)
---
I'm still not sure that pservers were accurately representing things out there.  There was a post a couple of days ago indicating like a 600% dps increase between pservers and top raiding guild world-firsts.
---
Now, I know that's not a good comparison and there's a ton of reasons why pservers could still be accurate representations and yet have people clearing WAY faster than first-clears but **600%** is a big number.  Plenty big enough that it leaves room to wonder if something's a bit funky with damage numbers of pservers.  Maybe not, but if it is then this issue should be mostly negated.

Great stuff. Would be nice to see a similar list for alliance to complement the spots I'm already familiar with.
---
One issue however: The website suggests getting 3/3 Improved Blizzard - for the love of the AoE Gods, don't do this! 3/3 Improved Blizzard will override/prevent your CoC slow from being applied and this severely hurts your kiting ability. Don't raise this talent above 2/3.

That's still not open.

I’m kind of doubting it will be summer at this point considering summer begins next month and we have no release date
---
Hunters, Warlocks, and Mages are your best bet. Basically any class that can snipe a rogue out of stealth, keep them visible, and force them to waste cooldowns will do well. (Pets, Warlock tankiness, Ice block, etc).
---
Since you mentioned Shadow Priest I'll say that a decently skilled and geared shadow priest can 1v1 anything if they get the drop on them though I don't fancy your odds if a rogue with full CDs surprises you.

Mages hardly has a chance vs pvp prepared rogues. Mages don't have an answer for free action potion + sprint, reflect frost/fire spell, absorb frost/fire damage, thistle tea dps, cold blood eviserate, vanish sap/gouge/blind bandage, and all the other tools in a rogue's arsenal. Not even pom pyro lucky crits can save you because a rogue can just reflect fire spells while pyro is mid air.
---
The problem with mages is they are just too squishy and when you can use consumable cooldowns to remove their ability to cc a rogue or instant burst them, then they just get destroyed.
---
ENFP-Alliance-Gnome(lady)-DPS-PVP

The impact on retail Classic will be way less than on private servers since you won't have 80% tryhard neckbeard players and 15k players per server. I'm really bored of people demanding changes based on private server experience.

---
Why do people care so much about streamers?
---
Funnily enough, things like the way the original honour system worked were more ideal for an age where people could make a living from streaming.
---
Things outside instanced content are going to be a nightmare for larger streamers though.
---
Oh no downvoted

toxic= saying words that offend me, aka being a big pussy

missed that. I thought the old twink posts I found were vanilla because they were pre-heirloom but I guess I was wrong. 1 simple dagger for me instead of dual wield. :(  Looks like Nelf really is best

I already have my leveling path figured out, no point leveling on the beta just to start over a month or two later.

"this server is optimized for streaming and video card capture technology"

I mean what’s fair? Is it fair for the rogue to not be able to use his most effective abilities? A big part of their class is stealthing up to enemies and stunlocking.

I have no idea what he'll be streaming, but I'm positive it's not worth me taking a sick day for.
---
I kind of want to say almost, but then again I dont know why haha - I am Austrian ;)

Retail vanilla had an actual, real open beta for 2 weeks. I played it.

Brezhna, human Paladin. Lake Keltheril (sp?) in Winterspring. Ran out of quests and couldn't be bothered to get a group so I just grinded the spectres for the last 4 bars. My friendship group still occasionally references "grinding by the lake"
---
[Ganks-R-Us]
---
The people I hung with back in vanilla did it
---
Lol seriously, maybe if I got to stream it than yah ofc but a sick day just to watch a 1% streamer play the game that I want in on? No thx
---
Even if you got into beta tomorrow it wouldn't be worth it, considering it's likely capped at Level 30 or something. Don't get me wrong, I'd still like to get in, but yeah.
---
But it seems StaySafe is trying to be coy saying he isnt affiliated, but that it's worth taking a sick day to watch his stream tomorrow.
---
Grinding Yeti's in a cave in winterpring. Lots of memories and world pvp there. Definitely a zone I fell in love with and can't wait to return to.
---
Offline mode exists. It's called retail.
---
People seem to forget that classic won't have world buffs on demand like pservers. Miss the last head drop? Sorry, you're waiting two hours assuming you even know when it was dropped.
---
Probably not on the launcher, Blizzard will likely keep everything through the Battle.Net launcher so you can easily see/talk to your Battle.Net friends.
---
Psh, don't tell me what is and isn't worth it. 1-30 would TOTALLY be worth it to me and plenty of other people.
---
I think that's just his exaggerative way of saying "Even though I'm saying tomorrow is a normal stream, it isn't so you'll want to see"
---
I don't think he is seriously recommending people to take a sick day. Just that tomorrow may be special.
---
just shout "In'shallah allahu ackbar" as you gank him. I think any rogue knows to go after a big streamer is on a one way mission
---
Most of the player-base of this game are adults, I don’t see the point in all this childish teasing can we just get a straightforward answer?
---
Ikea Markus,  definitely recommend it

---
Well hey, if you keep saying it youre bound to be right eventually!
---
I made a timer too, for my pizza.
---
Unless your sick days reset before Classic comes out, I'd much rather use that for the real race. Especially if you plan to play on a PvP server.
---
Using a sick day for the actual launch &gt; wasting a sick day that could be used for launch
---
Where I live, it takes 30 worked hours to get 1 hour of paid sick time. So I essentially rack up 5 hours of sick time a month. Takes \~2 months to "earn" a  paid "sick day" off. NOT using that for beta vs launch!
---
People upvote this trash? Okay buddy.
---
Ya. Miss spoke. Meant just sl. What I said still stands though.
---
And on how many naxx geared rogues will be running around. I suspect a lot more than first time around.
---
Walsall here, ay it
---
ISTP - Horde - Shaman - Healer - Even Split
---
This assumes my friends don't all want to go Alliance again, in which case it'd be human paladin, heals, again evenly split.
---
So far I'm the only ISTP healer lol
---
The one I have at work is indeed fully loaded, it just doesn’t work for my body. Unfortunately with chairs/furniture, theres no one size fits all and it takes a long time to really see if the furniture is right.
---
yeah I was pissed. I spent all that time to farm Iron Horde Scraps, to get the Stormwind footman armor and shield, to go with my Gladiator Stance, and I unsub for a while then come back and realize they just took it away. bullshit.
---
why no rp-pvp?
---
Well, close. They invited a ton of people for stress testing and they did call it open, but there were still limited spots:
---
&gt;Spaces for both the Final Stress Test and the Free Open Beta will be given out on a first come, first served basis. So sign up early
---
It's definitely possible and there are screenshot addons. I'm not sure if there are ones that do it at random intervals. Most of them are set to take screenshots when you get an achievement, a new record crit, etc... But the functionality to take them at different intervals instead would be possible. Just gotta get someone to make it. :D
---
Can mods just delete shitposts like this?
---
2k online with faction imbalance of only a few % could end up with 800 or so on one side. Remember that's PEAK. So you're talking down to ghost town levels at certain times of the day. 
---
2k isn't just "fairly low" it's incredibly low.
---
One thing to keep in mind if you go Priest is that you two can very efficiently farm her Grimoire of Doom &amp; your Eye of Shadow from the elite demons in southwest Blasted Lands. Soloing them was a pain, but duoing with a priest will be much, much easier.
---
Better than the relics in the furlbog tunnel in Teldrassil.
---
Yes. I need to test rogue and probably druid.
---
Your weapons are your most important item (duh). You can keep yourself in blue swords for pretty much the entire leveling process by knowing the dungeons to hit for quest rewards.
---
Wing blade from WC
---
Outlaw Sabre from BFD
---
Sword of Omen from SM
---
Vanquisher's Sword from RFD
---
Thrash Blade from Mara (this one is the best sword you're gonna get pre-60. Make sure you get it).
---
As far as everything else: Combat is the best spec to go, sword is generally the best option for weapons though before you get sword spec talent it doesn't matter what type of weapon you're using. 
---
Orc is generally the best for both PvE and PvP though Undead are very good for PvP as well. It doesn't matter a ton, pick what you like the best. 
---
Your main hand weapon should be whichever weapon has the higher base damage as your instant attacks (sinister strike or backstab) are based off this. Generally that means the weapon with the slower speed. Once you get poisons you'll want to prioritize faster weapons in your off hand, though leveling weapons vary wildly in quality so don't use a vastly inferior weapon just because it's faster.
---
edit: To expand a bit on leveling spec. I'm a proponent of the riposte spec. Drop 2 points into remorseless attacks in the assassination tree for a lot of opening SS crits then rush riposte in the combat tree. Riposte is a very good solo ability as it only costs 10 energy, does great damage, and disarms which leads to more sustain and fuels itself with more parries. The downside is it (and the 5% parry you get before it) are completely useless in dungeons unless you pull threat. But since the vast majority of your leveling will likely be solo questing I think it's more than worth it.
---
Another leveling tip would be to get yourself an energy tick timer (Energywatch was the name of the addon in classic) and time your opening to start when the bar is about 90% full, this will cause you to get that 20 energy tick right after you use your first ability which will lead to better burst. With this method you can get off 3 sinisters right away and by the time you're done you'll just need to wait for one more energy tick before getting off your 4th.
---
I bet the lead developers are all quaking in their chairs with sweat on their upper lip.
---
"It's happened. u/LawAbidingPanda has sent his demands."
---
Just search for 'Skarm' on youtube, he's cleared naxx as a warrior and a bear and is pumping out loads of videos on the subject.
---
I never said I'd use time off for the beta, I responded to you saying that getting in to the Beta wouldn't be worth anything because you said it would cap at 30. 
---
I said that a beta capped at 30 would be worth it to me and others. Never said anything about PTO here.
---
I don’t often, but if the difference between getting an extra slow off or not is down ranking at a low mana, it’s probably worth it to have bound somewhere.
---
Yaaaawn.
---
Wow a bunch of hurt feelings in here for a joke.  Bring on the downvotes millennials.
---
There are plenty of reasons not to do a beta. Running one takes time and resources (money). The number of things like exploits should be relatively low since this is a rerelease of an existing game with an existing client that's currently in production. Without a super extended beta phase, it's unlikely random testers are going to find/report hyper specific bugs, especially if those bugs occur it later content.
---
my name will be taken if i wait an hour.
---
 **&lt;Rewind&gt;** is recruiting!  
---
**—-Guild info-—** Faction: Alliance Server: PvP Guild type: Somewhere between casual and hardcore Region: NA 
---
 **—-Raid Schedule-—** Raid Times: 8-12 EST Tues/Thurs Raid Loot Style: Loot Council 
---
 **—-Introduction:-—** This is a guild of friends currently raiding on a Private Server, eagerly waiting for Classic to launch!  We will be starting with 20+ members from day 1.  We run a Council leadership for checks and balances, and we promote guild ownership through participation and being helpful and nice. Our number 1 goal is to have fun, and hang out with friends while doing it.   We have a very active Discord. Whisper us for more info 
---
 **—-Goals and Member Expectations:-—** 1)  Having fun 2) Clear all raid content in a timely fashion 3) Community (hanging out) 4) Treating others as you want to be treated, being punctual for raid times, helping the guild, and overall being a valuable member to our community. 5) We are open to other ideas and events, even giveaways to spark fun/excitement   Most roles/positions are up for grabs, you can talk to any one of us about them.  
---
 If this sounds like the place for you, get ahold of any of our Council. We are all listed below.  
---
**Discord:** Mose#0631, Bodytriangle#1765, Agret#2927, Kombo#5617, Orbiter#4279
---
Likewise!
---
Someone suggested me to watch him. Will definitely do, thanks
---
Just play on NA servers! Easy fix :)
---
Yeah but it's still fun.
---
Gnome warrior named Moonzalar. Eastern plaguelands.
---
Nerf stuff before release? Wat?
---
No interest in a community-oriented beta. They should do it if they think it will give them important information, but other than that, it’s okay. There’s no need for hype-building, work on the actual show.
---
Do you know what an NDA is?
---
The streamers are just annoying and unlikeable at this point
---
for sure there will be exploits lets just hope no one figures out how to dupe items and I think for the most part we will be fine
---
Even though I didn't play a night elf back in vanilla, somehow the whole aesthetic of the night elf zones (specifically the music, ambience, and npc voice lines) is what gives me the strongest nostalgia.
---
No, because it's still on Blizzard to announce it. Blizzard would be pissed if someone outright spoiled that beta is tomorrow or something.
---
My hunch is that beta is about to be playable tomorrow. Why would I want to watch Towellie or StaySafe do their same old thing or watch them stream a blue post?
---
Seems pretty evident at the least, tomorrow streamers will get access to a playable version of the game. Whether the normies get access to it as well or it's streamer only, we'll see.
---
Try the AutomaticScreenshotter software. Not WoW-related, but it seems like it'd do what you need.
---
I'm not sure why you'd want to date concrete anyway.
---
Aye, Im looking for people who say: You cleared all content and didnt wipe? pretty good. 
---
Not people who say: We cleared mc in 14minutes 36seconds.
---
I hate that these guys are the face of Classic Wow
---
They are probably under NDA and can't announce anything until tomorrow. Most likely Blizzard game them the go-ahead to tease Classic beta before launch though.
---
Epl
---
*released
---
Titan bar?
---
Darkshore, I loved that zone before Catashit came and ruined it. Same can be said for Barrens too.
---
He used a level 90 boost at some point. Those were the items you got.
---
Saved
---
im sure they're just taking advantage of "speculation" just to gain more viewers
---
These streamers clearly don't.
---
I hope there *is* something notable tomorrow, but if not, I'm pretty sure the community at-large is going to e-riot. Maybe even go as far as make a *Change.org* petition!
---
" Even if you got into beta tomorrow it wouldn't be worth it " you replied to this. In a comment chain that is talking about using paid sick time.
---
It was pretty obvious when I say "it wouldn't be worth it" I am referring to using a sick day from work to play Classic beta WoW.  And when people say sick day, they don't mean calling in unpaid, they mean using a paid sick day which would be much better used on launch.
---
I think you misunderstand the purpose of this post. 
---
This post is about aoe grinding to level.  If there are 2 good spots to farm mobs and one contains the item I need and the other doesn't, that would be useful information to know. 
---
By adding loot tables, it adds another level of agency.  You might be willing to sacrifice a bit of xp/hr for the profession progression.
---
In other words, put wowhead data in this database and you get the best of both worlds.

**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | NA | Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
❗ **ABOUT US:** ❗
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;:**
---
🏁 **WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?** 🏁
---
\- While our main goal is to be efficiently and effectively clearing bosses in raids, our goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being experienced with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter (read up, watch a video, ask questions).
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
📐 **WHAT IS EXPECTED?** 📐
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Have the desire to coordinate with other members, and have a good time!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, have fun and be excellent!
---
📆 **WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?** 📆
---
\- We will be raiding twice a week; **Wednesday** and **Thursday**.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST.**
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST.**
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
❓ **OTHER FAQ's:** ❓
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we have 120 members.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
Our goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. We've taken our years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. Please reach out via a direct message through the reddit forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***
---
One thing you might want to be aware of is that if you try to do a gray quest you won't receive full reputation gains from that quest. So if you plan on having a specific faction's mount (e.g., kodo as an orc) then you should make sure to do all Thunder Bluff quests asap.
---
"Once the mob goes grey, or a quest is six levels below you, you lose 20% of the total reputation possible for the kill/completion for each level. This goes this way for four levels, until you reach the minimum reputation gain of 20%. "
---
Human female frost mage, I dinged 60 doing the Wintersaber Trainers repeatable quest in Winterspring. I would do that quest countless more times. Man.

Tauren druid. 
---
I was brought in to ZG at 59 and dinged 60 after killing the first boss and got the staff off him.
---
I need details, brother.
---
He plays a mage.
---
Ya these guys are going to be the first ones crying when they want mergers or transfers from their 500 pop servers. "500 ya right" well when the cap is 2k an you're faction balance is bad... That's actually pretty high.
---
I've always been Alliance SH. I know several of them swapped to Alliance in the later part of Wotlk and formed a guild called Enlightened. We strictly WPvPed, the guild broke up by Cata and several of the people went to Emerald Dream or just quit. Let me see if I can find one of the old pvp videos from wotlk.
---
Edit:
---
Here is a vid: https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=153797
---
STV is the best place to learn how to play the game. 
---
Up till then its uncontested zones and relatively limited ability suites. By stv people have most of their abilities, no one has a mount and its easy to stay hidden--without stealth--among the trees. PVP levelers have to start considering their OOC hp and mana, for if you get too low you will get jumped. YOu start to scan your environment for opposite faction and always have an exit strategy to run away. 
---
When you do die you learn how to safely rez. Sometimes you even organize on the spot with fellow faction members to kill. its great.
---
How old are you? I have a feeling you're probably a millennial too and just don't know it yet.
---
Not arbitrary, but you're right that they didn't commit to early summer. Still getting down to the wire...
---
Was an old add on that displayed your coordinates.
---
I don't think it is. My husband's employer requires employees to take vacation, and if you don't schedule and use it, HR will start going down the list toward the end of the year and schedule people off and pay out their remaining vacation. If you don't pick and use your vacation time HR will pick it for you lol
---
In my bedroom
---
Kargoz did a ton of research on Dual Leveling. I think Prot Pally/ Warlock mana battery is the build he recommended. It’s all about passively healing the Warlock, and the Warlock using his imps mana, but keeping he imp out of combat.
---
Spriest will be far rarer, but that's partially because it loses out on a lot of QoL stuff the Mage has.  I'd say go Priest if you don't mind healing or see the ability to heal some times as an advantage.
---
Oh I’m a millennial too no doubt about that
---
Greatest comment of all time award
---
I hope it's not 23 hours...
---
The only truly broken farm is Hunter Tribute, but that requires skill so it's doubtful the Chinese will do it.
---
Also INFP-A, Hunter ;) (I also played druid in later expansions but as a healer)

God the "faces" of vanilla are autistic as fuck.

Rogues can reset/run away at any time. Especially prep rogues. It's just that faerie fire lasts a long time so the reset takes much longer.

Tauren druid named duude (14yo) in winterspring. More specificly grinding spirits on the lake during lunch break in school on a classmates laptop.. ^_^
---
I dinged 60 in Andorhal. It was great to farm there as a hunter because nobody else did due to it‘s obnoxious mob density and big damage the mobs did. 
---
As an icing on the cake i found a Destiny and selled it for 150g. It was much money back then!
---

---
Technique works until you run out of mana.  Or you find that they resist the cold effect.
---
Jokes on you staysafe im off tomorrow AND I won’t watch your stream.
---
Yeah I'll take a sick day, right on it boss
---
I honestly don't think so. Why would I want to specifically tune in to either of their streams around the same time? To watch them react to a blue post? I imagine people wouldn't hate to see a blue post announcing either a release date or a beta date, but you don't fly people to Irvine just to tell them of the launch date or beta date. I imagine they got to get their hands on the beta build that will likely be going out tomorrow.
---
Sure, there will be a post I imagine, but it seems evident to me that at minimum, streamers have access to a playable build. The main question is if the normies will have access too.
---
Yeah, of all the setups I've ever seen posted, this one is my favourite for sure.
---
Nah.
---
It's the other way around. Evening in Europe is the same time as noon in America.
---
Your assuming that it will release in the early summer. If it doesn't release until September then that's 2.5-3 months of beta testing.
---
what do you mean, "at this point"?
---
are you implying there was ever a time they were not annoying and unlikable? I don't believe that for a second.
---
Ive put literally hundreds of days into pre cata (retail and pserver) wow nearly all of it on pvp servers. That happened so infrequently I dont even have memories of it.
---
That said, no one will camp you res spawning from Gadgetzan to UnGoro. If you res hidden 40yards away from your corpse--summon your mount and flee, the ganker will be entertained for maybe 2-3 kills, max if he even follows you at all.
---
Bookmarked...
---
I'm trying mage and some "mage stupid tricks" right now before classic and it's quite fun, especially when rounding up \~100 of those scourge invasion mobs being few pixels from inevitable death. What bugs me with larger pulls is like for 99% one mob will resist frost nova (or half of them) and the attempt must be cancelled when solo. People that actually play mage report they found CoC + Arcane explosions more reliable, also usable on crocs in ZG. So does Frost Nova just has a "diminishing return" the bigger the pull?
---
Cut the shit bitch
---
Be a man
---
My broken clock says 88:88 and it's never right :(
---
Oh shut up
---
Well done!  Saving for later!
---
What happened to the guy who was going on a hunger strike until release date?
---
WoW betas are normally for expansions that have never been tested/played properly before. While classic will still need testing due to how it's an old game baked into the new client, a lot of the stuff in there will be working just fine already, so it may not need a "full" beta period. It's a weird beast in that sense.
---
Summer ends towards the end of September, and can launch anytime before then if they stick to their release announcement of "Summer 2019"
---
It's May... If beta launches next month, and they don't release until August or September?
---
That's more than a few weeks of beta play, bud.
---
Gonna play Paladin, Druid, Shaman, and perhaps one other. Going to try and get each one to 20-25 and see which class I want to bring up to 60. 
---
Back in Vanilla I had leveled a Warrior, Rogue, Warlock, Priest, and Hunter to 60 so that's why I chose the classes that I did. I am currently leaning towards Paladin and Shaman, one for each faction, then an alt on the faction of whichever class I'm enjoying the most at 60.
---
Blizz have said it’ll be a short beta if any at all. A bunch of streamers are throwing out hints that something is happening today/tomorrow/Wednesday.
---
~~Yeah, I know, hence the parentheses and the semi?~~
---
Never mind I’m really not in the mood to have the most needless argument ever
---
I think 45-55 might be another area: I remember grinding that out on my warrior. There were definitely gaps in quests in specific bands.
---
people need to realize that they are backporting the 7.3.5/8.x client/server, there is bound to be tons of issues
---
Oh he’s probably dead by now, his cause was more noble.
---
Summer lasts until september 23rd. So we have time.
---
Most new content has a beta. Even if it's new old content, haha. They set of Summer release so that could be the third week of September for all we know. Usually depends on how the beta goes.
---
Not for all of us? I've been waiting for the public one this whole time.
---
Shit comment.
---
Also INTJ - Alliance - Mage - DPS - PvE.
---
Honestly the best way would probably be to go Teldrassil&gt;Darkshore&gt;Ashenvale&gt;Barrens to Ratchet and then take the boat over to Booty Bay and head north. Of course as a level 1 this would be immensely time consuming as you’d probably spend half the time corpse running.
---
no way, me too!  ISFP - ally priest heals
---
i rarely ever lost to rogues on my hunter. if he gets on you, you wing-clip and FD/trap. If he trinkets that, scatter and get distance with cheetah. Once the CC is about to wear off, hit him with some damage and a concussive shot and drop a flare on top of his head so he can't vanish. It's pretty much gg at that point
---
They haven't broken NDA. They are simply teasing something coming. Which Blizzard likely wants them to do. And then Blizzard will tomorrow morning make the announcement.
---
If Blizzard didn't want them to say anything, trust me, they wouldn't. For a lot of them, having a working relationship with Blizzard is too valuable.
---
As someone that works under an NDA at all times in the video game realm, trust me, they make it very clear what is and isn't allowed. I've seen someone get fired for posting a picture on Reddit of something at my workplace.
---
why so mad I dont get it
---
I don't understand the hate?
---
People are mainly hyping beta recently for a few reasons:
---
* Beta builds on the CDN were pushed to and updated over the last few weeks, of which Blizzard confirmed was an Alpha internal test.
---
* WoW streamers were invited to Irvine HQ, and are all now making numerous cryptic remarks about something big happening this week / tomorrow.
---
* Time frame between now and end of summer is shrinking to a point where even if a late summer release, beta needs to come sooner rather than later.
---
None of these confirm we are getting a beta but all can be taken in a way that is highly suggestive that a beta is coming shortly.

Did you make a new comment just to point out we're not disagreeing with each other?
---
Why does anyone assume anything about classic?
---
Because this sub is devoted to anything classic, shitposts included. It's in the spirit of this subreddit that as much speculation from rosey-cheeked hopefuls and the inevitable backlash from hardliners be the defining modus operandi of this community.
---
Apparently BWL has horrible itemization for bear. Once into AQ/Naxx things get better. Bear is apparently the best tank during MC patch.

I could see if they wanted to do minor tweaks to mob pathing or xp: to prevent situations where specific XP bands or areas end up too easy or hard on a new engine.
---
They were clearly told to vaguely tease it.
---
Yeah I knew Sats had ally alts so that makes a little sense. That's a shame they quit functioning though, I wonder if they'll be playing classic.
---
stop giving these useless leeches attention please
---
Well I personally play on a p server to start learning the class I'm going to play. It's already 'pointless' so I'd restart on the beta to learn how it's actually going to go. I wouldn't take a day though, I'd just go at my own pace.
---
As someone with inside information on pservers (not WoW) this is exactly why it was nerfed. I'll just go ahead and say it. The owners of private servers aren't running that server for your enjoyment, they are making money off of it by selling gold, items and other "services" on the down low. Some servers blatantly make it apparent while others advertise that it's strictly prohibited and then make aliases to sell on websites.

My parents were pretty strict about what games I could and couldn't play as a kid, I had to sit down and let my dad watch a video review of the game before he would let me buy it. I went to Gamespot (My go to site at the time) and we watched this review together, and then took a trip to Walmart. Nostalgia blast.
---
I am at work and can't view what pieces you have listed, but if I am not mistaken, the stat priority for pvp is something like Crit&gt;Stam&gt;Spell Power&gt; Int, so once you have your crit items sorted, I would focus on as much hp as possible with spell power sprinkled on top. Since it is pvp, the spell hit from your talents should be enough to cover your hit assuming they are not running nature resist gear.
---
It's nothing new. There is almost always hatred towards the "streamers" that get perks compared to the normies who just play the game.
---
You'll find it everywhere. It's a "small man vs big man" thing. "Streamer gets goodies that I don't" despite the fact the streamer does far more for the game than someone who has 0 influence.
---
Well I would assume blizzard wouldn't launch classic around 8.2 release time. So Maybe you're right it will be later in the summer months. Thanks bud.
---
I guess people were excited by them bringing back the horde vs alliance theme in full force, but yeah at that point it's just cope
---
This will take a screenshoot every 60 seconds: (retail or classic only, doesn't work for orig vanilla)

looking forward to nost tears when the children who know nothing but high pops cry about DED SERVERS with blizzlike populations
---
I think if you're going to raid for gear, then you should stick to a raid build. Rogues don't bring anything to the table except damage. It doesn't make sense to sacrifice that.
---
It's not like a PvE build is bad in PvP. Every once in a while I will underestimate a Rogue's damage, expecting them to be in a PvP spec, only to get blown up in a stun because they have Adrenaline Rush.
---
Also missed: Why would I want to be tuning in to these streamers all around the same time? To watch them all react to a blue post simultaneously? There ain't no blue post worth altering my schedule to watch a stream reaction to when I could just read the blue post myself.
---
It's clearly because there is a version of the game that at the least will be playable for streamers. Whether it will be for us normies is to be seen.
---

Tips and Esfand can’t stream today mysteriously lol. They’re all setting up for the surprise Beta tomorrow.
---
This is why you grab the Cold Snap talent. As soon as you see the frost nova resist, just pop that and throw another nova. 
---
Also as far as I know, there's no reason frost nova would be resisted more often than CoC and I don't believe it's the case that it is.
---
I hope there isn't a beta and its straight release date hype. Who wants to play a beta and have to start over?
---
No trainer will be a giant pain in the ass. You'll have to go back at level 10 for bear form anyways.
---
I’m sure the streamer meeting w blizz last week was also a beta on how blizz will interact w streamers going forward. If they dont like how streamers deal with a “secret” then they won’t do it again.

I'd love to have that same pvp rivalry like there was in BC. I was in the World Defense Channel guild on alliance.

The thrill of the first legit fresh vanilla server release since 2006 is enough reason to not wait.

This is absolutely the case.  Vanilla had nearly the same amount of soloing shenanigans going on, if anything it was just not quite widespread/established.  People were regularly farming BRD for fire resist/dark iron, Mara for nature, LBRS for alchemy stuff, DM, you could solo packs of strat for UD mats, list goes on.
---
And here's my new desktop background now!  [https://imgur.com/a/aSeXQdc](https://imgur.com/a/aSeXQdc)  Thanks, mate.

Plus they are all either “sick” or unable to stream today.
---
Dwarf Paladin, dinged in Winterspring. Very fitting to start and end my leveling journey in the snow.
---
Yes, yes, you all hate streamers, I get it. I don't watch any of them and I'm not trying to promote their channel, I don't care about *them*.
---
But when several streamers who are heavily involved in the Classic WoW scene point to a specific date like this, I think it's fair to acknowledge that they *probably* know something we don't. And aside from a release date (or, hell, a release), there's nothing but a beta that would justify this level of hype.
---
The streamers are great, I dont know why people are being so toxic towards them.
---
Yea I remember what it is. That was only a small, but helpful feature it had. Didnt see the relevence. I do now. Thanks. 
---
Though I don't think having this book removes the helpfulness of those coordinates.
---
Ah yea, makes sense, people are jealous.  I thought tipsout was a pretty chill guy, not annoying at all and has a good heart.  Also constantly providing content.  To each their own I suppose.
---
You haven't read a single NDA in your life if you think this kind of behaviour would be acceptable. Do you see any employees releasing these cryptic tweets? What on earth would make you think that they went to some of the most dishonest and disliked immature streamers in the classic community and went "hey you three in particular, you get to tease that we have something coming".
---
You can slice people on whatever catergories you wish, and there are literally hundreds of such systems. as long as it consistent. and mbti is consistent. it just asks questions in quiz, and sort ppl by how THEY answer them, as different ppl answer differently and got different preferences obviously. so it reflects back what YOU yourself told it. its nothing more. (neither science or pseudoscence).
---
if you are a similar types with someone, that means you answered about the same way in the quiz. and have a similar tendencies in many ways. compared to the other person that answered the same question the other way. thats all. don't try to make it into something more, and then "debunk" it for what it isnt trying to be..
---
RemindMe! 23 hours “Did this age well?”

if calling his content bleh, qualifies me as being a whiteknight, then lol on your definitions.
---
I know I don't want a beta, and I think Blizzard doesn't want to have one either. A huge huge factor of this entire project is a nostalgia trip. A lot of people would probably get their fix from an open beta and realize it isn't how they remember it, or something else that makes them not subscribe. I don't want it because I want to hit old Azeroth fresh and excited, not on a reset like a private server like playing on a beta would be. Worst case the lack of testing leads to a ton of bugs, which is something #nochanges will enjoy, because they wanted a lot of those... I just want a release date so I can see how fucked my summer is.
---
If Blizzard thinks it's a problem they'll make it not work. They already did that with some auto world quest addons in Retail.
---
does this work with emotes somehow? so i can rp a dwarf with bowel problems who /farts every min?
---
That's exactly what I was looking for! Thank you
---
Really? That surprises me, pretty sure I saw him say he was "for sure" going pvp.
---
My guess would be that Blizz will launch Beta through its normal means. Some will get lucky, some will not. Streamers will be given keys to give out to their audience. My guess is they're telling you to tune in for a chance for a key (and give them views, obviously.)
---
Yeah? These three streamers in particular? All of whom have a history of doing clickbait bullshit or in tips case even straight up lying about their involvement/knowledge?
---
Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
---
Nah, man. You 100% do not have the slightest idea what you're talking about here.
---
I'm not entirely sure, but i believe i reached lvl 60 in Burning Steppes with my Gnome Warlock. This took place almost 1.5 years after i started playing due to me always switching classes and trying new things in-game.
---
Probably a lot faster than running and dying in ashenvale and darkshore.
---
I'm pretty sure it was in scholo on my gnome rogue, Staghelm server.
---
Check his post history vs. mine. Not the same accnt. You ppl who upvoted that comment accusing me of replying to my own comment are delusional.
---
I tend to agree to some extent with you, I todays modern world people are replacing astrology with these types of tests, but cmon people, you are not a cardboard, these tests cannot meseaure you how you behave when you are in different situations and not to mention that some actions are automated so you already start on the wrong foot. 16 personality types are made after Carl Jung research and if this guys not a scientist then I dont know who is.
---
No.
---
Yeah, Tips is great. A lot of the Classic guys are. Esfand, MrGM, Staysafe. They've been excellent ambassadors imo.
---
Spill the beans you bum! :D
---
I’m just hoping for something along the lines of, “Full Classic release next week!”  from a blue.
---
Ditto
---
I can't I'm downvoted
---
Ya man!  I love esfand.  Staysafe is his own type of sperg but still entertaining none the less!
---
I don't hate anyone. But it's cheesy to constantly cock tease people about an announcement. There was that guy who was like "hurr be ready to multitask during GoT this week guise" knowing full well what people will take away from that.
---
Deadwind Pass ogres. On all 3 characters :P
---
Why is there hype about a beta though. I really just want release.
---
    /run C_Timer.NewTicker(60, function() DoEmote("fart") end)
---
:)
---
Some of you guys are nuts. Your insecurities are some of the loudest I've ever seen.
---
Meh...I thought it was great to get a lil heads up.  They didn't have to say anything.  Who cares?
---
Read? My dude, I signed an NDA upon employment saying I can get fucked up the ass if I break it, and I'm in the video game realm. It was made very clear what can and can't be done. Even my social media and LinkedIn is monitored. I know more about NDA's than you do.
---
Trust me, they all had to sign an NDA, and they were told what can and can't be said. Teases? Allowed. Saying beta is tomorrow? Not allowed.
---
Why would ALL OF THEM be breaking NDA? "cuz duMb sTrimErS duH" Get over yourself. None of them have broken the NDA. Blizzard is letting them tease something is coming tomorrow but not getting to say what it actually is, even though it's implied what it is.
---
Especially Towellie, who has experience with Blizzard dating way back and isn't just fresh Classic blood. He's dealt with Blizzard in this capacity for a long time, and he's one of the ones teasing it. Because he knows how the NDA works with Blizzard.
---
And that for every change they make it can expose potential issues in otherwise tested/working areas, these things tend to compound.  I'm sure they have a pretty good grasp on it, but you can hardly take things for granted in the midst of so many changes.
---
How are these “hints” not pushing it with their NDAs? Like if the beta goes live tomorrow to me these hints are just as good as just coming out and saying “beta tomorrow folks”. If it doesn’t go live tomorrow then they are hyping nothing which is just as bad imo. Like why would they risk good standing with Blizzard and the community? 
---
I can’t wait for full Classic to go live so half of these “influencers” won’t be sources of info anymore... it’s all false hype and half truths based on undocumented server stats with these guys. 
---
I just want to play the game Blizzard. 
---
&lt;insert Let Me In Meme here&gt;

Give us a release date already. I’ve got vacation time to plan and  put in for.
---
Is that a joke? Was anybody exited for BFA? I'm pretty sure we all knew BFA was going to suck ass in the Alpha already.
---
I sure hope it’s not a “limited closed Beta” and we have to beg streamers for Keys. (Insert sponge bob meme with squidward watching Patrick and sponge bob having fun)
---
inb4 they release a closed beta early to a handful of streamers, like they're doing with the Hearthstone PvE stuff.
---

If you swim west from Menethil Harbor along the coast about 5 minutes or so, the zone name changes (in certain spots) to Dun Morough. You can then drown &amp; rez at the Dwarf starting area, and run to IF. I'm not sure if it's faster or not, but there's less danger of being killed by higher-lever mobs.
---
You can also take a boat to Theramore &amp; swim up to Ratchet, but that takes time - you could experiment with a path where you can die &amp; spirit rez further up the coast to save time. I'm guessing that once you make into Barrens territory, you could die &amp; then rez right there in Ratchet, and then take the boat to BB.
---
and what percentage will be dps yelling for LF Tank all the time!
---
Sure. But damage out scales health by a decent margin. If they get their turn first you won't get yours.
---
Some streamers are pretty awesome to watch. Vinesauce for example is a group of excellent streamers.
---
Though for Classic, you're correct. I ~~don't think there's a single good streamer doing Classic as of yet~~ there are many good streamers for Classic.
---
EDIT: Oh so there are some good ones! Though they seem to be in the minority unfortunately.
---
The yeti right outside the mouth of the cave to on the right side away from the treeline.

Also, my first corpse run was at level 2 \^\^
---
Theres a lot of anger because people take issue with people reiterating the same topics and info in their content (which is only logical since they dont have any new info etc to work off of) and people tend to scream "leech!" or "bloodsucker!" etc for some reason.
---
A lot of this sub is elitist bullshitters who just cant ignore the content they dont like but instead have to acknowledge it and scream at it.
---
Its ridicilous.
---
Tips was loved on this sub not too long ago. In fact, he was practically "made" from the attention he got from this subreddit. Then he started lying about having insider info (more than once), and half the "content" he puts out is straight up incorrect shit he just heard on twitter, which he could've researched for five minutes and found an actual answer to. People got sick of him trying to mislead the community on a regular basis and passing off wild speculation as fact.
---
You cannot spirit rez in a different zone from where your corpse is located - otherwise, people could just travel through the Timbermaw tunnel in ghost form.
---
&gt;but I played Alliance
---
My condolences.
---
I don't watch influencers.
---
Let me know when release rolls around.
---
&gt; on pvt servers it was cleared the first week.
---
Never ran into this, can you point to the servers that this happened on and were they in anyway blizzlike lol?
---
This right here is a woman that has NEVER smoked weed ladies and gentleman, Jamie, pull that shit up.
---
Yeah but talents and skills will be 1.12.  So Feral Druids will, for example, have the talents to spec into tanking, and the ability to hold aggro, but will be unable to find gear that will allow allow them to tank because there was basically no leather tanking gear.  Paladins will at least be able to, for the most part, steal warrior gear.
---
And once again, healers get shafted royally.  It's gonna be a big problem, nobody is gonna want to play one.  Playing a healer sucked for anything outside an instance or group; questing, farming, etc.  And with the existing, current WoW as a comparison point, it'll seem even worse.
---
I'm pretty sure you're in the minority. Most of us are glad we're at least getting hints and we know they aren't actually allowed to tell us yet. I for one am very much looking forward to this week because of it.
---
Undead mage, dinged 60 chucking frostbolts at owlbeasts for hours in winterspring
---
The only question left that anyone actually cares about is the release date.
---
A beta release date =/= actual release date.
---
This changes everything
---
#***WRONG.***
---
I really do not care for a beta. I played a lot of WoW from 2005-2007 so I've experienced it all. A beta won't save my progress so there really is not point in playing. The only reason I'd see myself log on is to see how close to classic it actually is and then log off and wait for the release.
---
Can’t name private servers on this sub, but it starts with an N and it ends with an E. It’s the biggest most popular vanilla pvt server right now and yes it is blizzlike. Kel’thuzad was down less than a week after Naxx was added.
---
Jealousy mostly
---
Wow tysm, I was really struggling to find a pvp player. Might check when I get home
---
What is this, Pantheon Rise of the Fallen with Carnage?
---
Projecting a little bit.
---
Speaking for myself a lot of the times it's because these people just become de-facto faces simply due to their audience size.  Yes there's absolutely something to be said for their efforts in gaining that audience, but there's also very little accountability for them as far as character/judgement/personality/knowledge/etc.  This is not ideal and it can be more than simply being jealous.
---
Unless you saw what they signed and what they were told was acceptable and not acceptable, then you have no idea what you're talking about. Why would any of these streamers burn a bridge with Blizzard before Classic is even released?
---
I'll be getting back to Vanilla as it was my favorite and most memorable experience in WoW. I was a Rank 14 HWL Warrior in Classic and main tanked for MC/BWL. Our guild ended up finishing C'Thun before TBC but I stopped tanking at that point to finish up the PvP grind as it was taking most of the day.
---
I plan to be semi-hardcore playing (\~10 hours/day) everyday for first few weeks. Then will play more casually either when Raids are in farm mode or progression is gated by further phase releases. I'm actually based in Tokyo right now, but I'm able to stay up to 9PM PST weeknights for raids, then I have hard stop to go to work.

I want to say something and I want some of you to respond and give me your thoughts. 
---
Doesn’t it scare the FUCK out of you guys that not only Tips Out but Towelliee as well are getting inside info on Classic, being invited to the summit and all this other stuff. Towelliee used to bash Classic WoW and make fun of anyone who mentioned it in his stream in the pasta. Tips out came out of NOWHERE and jumped on the band wagon whenever he heard about it and started making click bait videos n shit to make some money. Idk if that plays a part of having any influence on the game design of classic itself but these guys don’t know fucking shit about classic wow and it’s really scary. What do you guys think?
---
Yes, that's an option to do it double. I'll drop a clip in a moment, recorded some of my fails :D
---
&gt; So a guy or group of people could own all the black lotus/devilsaur leathers or certain farm spot on the map and decide whatever price they want, a true economy. 
---
That's called a monopoly and is really not a "true economy" in any way. At best it's equally bad to just having instance farming in and inflation being higher, and at worst it's just very hurtful to the economy as a whole, only benefitting a small minority.
---
You and me fucking both man. It’s scary as fuck.
---
You can't reset even if you could try. Faerie Fire is an instant cast with no cooldowns. They would just recast it on the rogue when it's running out. and like you said it last a long time so even by than the fight would be done.
---
&gt; I think it's fair to acknowledge that they probably know something we don't.
---
I think it's more the fact that they confirmed they were invited to Blizzard :p
---
It’s not about being insecure it’s about KNOWING these guys history and it being unbelievable how they’ve become insiders on this info and not other people.
---
It's because people keep saying this and now people want to play them. I dont see most people lasting a long time playing a warlock. The leveling process can be straightforward but most new people will be turned off by the bag management
---
Game time is game time so yes
---
In my experience, it isn't really projecting. There is always a small guy vs big guy mentality that goes on. Jealousy of streamers getting perks has been a thing since Twitch became mainstream. Usually followed by "They will move on to a different game in two weeks, yet I'll be here poopsocking until mum kicks me out of the basement. I am a fan, they are not! GIVE ME THE BETA KEY!"
---
I'm sure they all gladly are sacrificing any further Blizzard cooperation over a one time boost of viewers for a niche game.
---
Seeing a beta means we're close. Its a one step at a time kinda thing. If they are announcing a beta (which should be pretty short imo) it means we're one step closer to a real launch. If the rumors hold true, which there is every indication they will and atleast somethong will happen in the next few days. We're either getting beta announcement or a release date. Either way its a good thing. Assumimg all this hype is true.

Probably.      
---
As you said, it's a shared subscription.
---
I wonder if the guy who made the video is going to be playing classic
---
Winterspring. I had my heartstone there since lvl 54 or something, so I just stayed there and grinded up to lvl 60. I really liked the zone aswell. It had awesome music and IRL I too love Winter.
---
It's on a really low heat.
---
That's what I'm saying. Why would they do that for a one time viewer boost? For a game as small as classic?
---
You signed a single NDA once and you think that makes you an expert? Let me guess, that was the only contract, especially NDA, you ever signed?
---
Well take it from someone who's signed more than just one NDA, and not just for some small shitty indie company without an actual legal team, NDAs are not all created equal.
---
Towelliee literally just proves my point, as he is the only legit streamer here. You'll notice he is incidentally the only streamer who is not alluding in any way to this timer being related to classic. That is an important difference right there. Hype up your own stream? That's OK. Hint toward a release window for Blizz products? Biiiig nono.
---
And I never called the streamers dumb, not sure why you're trying to start shit. Got nothing better to do?
---
The Barrens for sure
---
The game is 14 years old every single aspect of the game has been minmaxxed for YEARS now. All the shitposting and negative talk you here are from the vocal minority Pservers elietests. They will be a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of people going in blind or. It even knowing about classic at all till it launches. 
---
Play what you want, unless it’s a ret paladin.
---
Solo instance farming in vanilla is actually the reason you can only enter 5 instances per hour, that was added after DM came out and mages were farming 20-30 resets per hour and crashing the instance server.
---
Who do you think is worthy then?
---
This is a bad take. You want 3/3 blizzard 100%. Please don't just parrot what you've watched in scuffed Yt videos.
---
Bajheera is doing Classic I'm pretty sure. He's fucking awesome.
---
Swifty isn't clickbaity and sort of has a child-like enthusiasm for WoW and will be playing Classic. So even though he isn't as skilled as he used to be, he isn't insufferable to watch IMO.
---
Beta usually means the real release soon follows.
---
Now of course there might not be a beta, but just a really awesome announcement. Who knows?
---
I hope the closed alpha testing went well regardless.
---
This. As they haven't come with a specific date for this big 8.2 patch for retail yet - and I would think they'd want to plan along with retail and don't release both at the same time. Probably a couple weeks between classic and 8.2 patch.
---
Yes it will, you will although you will have to farm gold in retail and buy tokens in retail. Classic won’t have the token mechanic at all.
---
&gt;damage out scales health by a decent margin 
---
Not untrue for most classes, but the margin is extremely smaller when looking at a lock, we tend to have a shit load of stamina. 
---
&gt;If they get their turn first you won't get yours. 
---
In my post I explain this isnt true, you have options even more if you have a PvP trinket. 
---
&gt; you have like 2 choices when jumped that don't requier you to use the PvP trinket. 1 Sac Voidwalker mid gank for bubble then fear/dot/heal till it is dead, 2 use a succubus and suduce him mid gank then fear/dot/heal till it is dead.
---
Especially Towellie, who isn't just "Classic blood" and has been working with Blizzard on stuff for multiple WoW expansions. He knows how this shit works and isn't violating NDA lol. This is probably the 4th or 5th NDA that he's signed with Blizz I would guess.
---
I'm going to play a Paladin and smash evil with a giant hammer and I'm sure like 95% of everyone else feels a similar way.
---
People who religiously watch streamers of games they already play (outside of tournaments) are pretty much in the minority.
---
it gives the *option* to de. but I think you are right that enchanting is garbage for your main. If you just want to de, you can do it on your lvl 5 bank alt.
---
That is basically what this sub thinks they are doing yes. Which is fucking stupid.

The most lazy/dumb example to set: when you press Rank 1 Cone of Cold, you're slowing everything for 11 secs and spending almost not resources doing that. Then you can just run around in circles, letting the spirit regen kick in. Don't forget the consumables too. In Classic, you can use potions throughout the fight multiple times, every two minutes.
---
There is a farming method based on Clearcasting procs when people spam R1 explosion (available on level 14) until the proc pops. When it happens, Blink+Max Rank Blizzard for free. 
---
You can play around resists too. 
---
Cone of cold resisted? Use Nova.
---
Nova resisted? Coldsnap, and you have CoC/Nova ready once again.
---
That doesn't work too? Create distance with Blink, Rank 1 Blizzard.
---
Everything of the above failed? Limited Invulnerability Potion can win you some time to get your Nova/CoC ready.
---
There's also Iceblock combined with a well-timed Blink, smart environment usage (mobs can't jump), engi stuffs and so forth. More than enough options to win you some time.
---
Because they aren't risking their good standing because Blizzard told them they can tease something coming.
---
You're asking why doesn't Blizz have them all stay radio silent? Because I imagine Classic WoW is showing up more in SEO everywhere due to people talking about the potential hype tomorrow. Classic WoW especially needs consistent talk, not just a ninja drop like Apex Legends. I bet Twitter especially is having more talk about Classic WoW today due to this, as is Reddit, which is good for Blizz. Get it showing up more. Free marketing.
---
I quit the final few months of TBC, about 11 years ago. I want to be hit with the nostalgia, so will once again choose the Horde, PvP.
---
See you out there.
---
we dont need a beta just a release :(
---
&gt; All the shitposting and negative talk you here are from the vocal minority Pservers elietests. 
---
You sound like the negative one here...
---
ya lets like get mad at content creators and the classic community and betray them hehehe we so kool
---
I‘m thinking the same, it‘s not like they communicate really worthy content.
---
It‘s just boring and doesn‘t give the subject any depth.
---
It‘s a total waste of time.
---
Why is it scary?  Is that the word you really wanted to use?  Are you terrified?
---
Best Option? Yes.
---
Only Option? No, Druids make fine tanks for all 5 mans, and can MT tons of raid fights. But are more often are better as dedicated off tanks.
---
That was more of a joke than actual seriousness of course :)
---
The answer to FAPS is a FAP. Also sheep works wonders for waiting out the duration of it. Its the same on druid. It's terrible having somebody blow a FAP against you...unless you also have a FAP.
---
nice
---
They hate them so they assume they are complete morons.
---
Oh yes, I can finally watch streamer's play the game we are all waiting for, blizzard is the best &lt;3 https://diabloimmortal.com/en-us/
---
Ive messed with Rainmeter in Windows 10. A lot of customization is possible. Just check out the Rainmeter subreddit. Im sure you can do this WoW desktop in some way.
---
In frost we trust.
---
Loved that video
---
Priest can farm some of them I guess, since they can farm lashers. Am I wrong?
---
It's under a fairly dim reading lamp.
---
As was mine :)
---
Ok, maybe not projecting but you're downplaying legitimate complaints by grouping everyone into that bucket.  Yes those certainly occur, but I think most can recognize that's a bad take/immature. There are still plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike content creators as individuals or for what they represent (in certain situations).
---
I get where you're coming from though
---
More information. More testing. It'll give us a better idea of what they have done since the demo. Great for theory rafting and add-on development.
---
Ahh I thought you were indicating 1week from sever start.
---
What's exactly wrong with these guys' histories?  If you believe that others should "become insiders", well then why haven't they?  Would you hate them once they got there, too?
---
Look up the mob in the index from quest or you want, then that will give the grid and page to turn to of the map the mob is at. Just like you would read a real grid map.
---
Blizzard gave them early access to the beta so they could get ahead of the crowd.
---
/tinfoil
---
Also bringing more relevance to old azeroth. People thought old areas would become more relevant. At this point they should just work on WoW 2 / Diablo MMO or just stay away from MMOs all together
---
Undead
---
Fellow Northumbrian (just - Cramlington) here!
---
awesome thanks! xD
---
My opinion is based entirely on my own experience in the matter.
---
Feral Tank gear is very much all over the place - do some research on pre-raid BiS for Bears, and you will see what I mean. You face the following challenges for tanking raids:
---
\- Have the right spec &amp; gear, and know how to generate threat and be a decent tank.
---
\- A lot of people will assume your gear is crap because the Bear pre-Bis is an assortment of PvP, crafted items &amp; dungeon blues. Be prepared to have that discussion that your gear is actually good.
---
\- Druids are not a good choice for MT because they have tons of health &amp; armor, but no real way of mitigating big hits from raid bosses. So you will find yourself off-tanking a lot, except vs certain bosses where a Bear is ok. In vanilla/classic, Warriors are the most viable tanks for every encounter.
---
I am quite sure the price of repairing is deducted from the item price. So, it doesn't matter.
---
Guys, does anyone know some hunter videos similar to this?
---
Sadly there may be some sketchy shit going around.. Like people trading 100 gold in Classic for say 170 gold in Retail for a wow token.   
---
I don't want this to happen as much as anyone else, but i think we're going to have that issue :(.
---
There will be no beta
---
What’s likely happening is they are under an embargo and are not allowed to outright say what is going on.  Looks like the embargo may lift tomorrow morning.  If that’s true then all the usual YouTube channels will light up like a Christmas tree all at once.
---
 **ENFP-horde-shaman-PVE**
---
The selling price of the item will be lower depending on its durability. I think it's equivalent but I'm not sure.
---
What is with the toxic attitude towards content creators on this subreddit? Shouldn’t we be trying to be supportive of creators in this community?
---
dawg let me tell u that at 8am pst tomorrow they will announce it
---
Orc or Tauren, 25% stun resist/ war stomp
---
I have something like 20 months of game time ongoing from retail tokens. I don't anticipate having to pay for that account for a while.
---
I have a few hundred bucks of Bnet Balance from more tokens that I plan on convertint to game time for a second account. All through tokens.
---
There's no "shared" sub. There's one world of warcraft subscription, and blizz doesn't care how you came across that game time.
---
In classic, how long will it take to mail arrive when mailing to an alt?
---
I was outside of Scholomance, and I was about to get ganked by an Horde mage at the time. I was fast enough to kill a mob that gave me just enough experience to ding 60... Still died to mage but I tried lol!
---
Edit: Night Elf Hunter on Destromath
---
I see. Im ok with off tanking. Im considering rolling the druid for offtanking raids and tanking dungeons and rolling a warlock for dpsing in raiding. Will see
---
Orc are probably best for PvP as warrior on horde.  UD are pretty good, but warriors have a natural fear immunity/break ability, which means WotF isn't as necessary.
---
Porque no los dos?
---
Going to level a Tauren Warrior to 60, expect to be one of the earlier 60s on my server simply by virtue of how much time I'll have to play.  Will probably get fully geared out in 5/10 man dungeons but no ambition to raid beyond MC/Ony pugs, and later pugging the 20 man raids.  Mostly just going to farm a buttload of gold, as I find it very relaxing to drink beer and pick virtual flowers.
---
Besides that, I plan on casually leveling Hunter/Mage/Lock/Rogue/Shaman alts, likely jumping around between all of them so as to keep each one on full rested XP.
---
"Destined to be a Classic"
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Ahh, Myers-Briggs personality, the zodiac sign for people who think they are too smart for zodiac signs.
---
1-30 in the first 24-36 hours, human warrior. 
---
I've practiced on private servers, but not taking it as 100% true. I hit 30 in about 27 hours on the private server while getting ganked and sub optimal pathing, so I think itll be possible. 
---
Hit 60 as fast as possible then enjoy the grind on a mage or warlock or something while guildies catch up.
---
In truth Prot paladins fare absurdly well against rogues
---
I'm going to level up with a friend of mine.
---
Not planning on rushing, going to enjoy the 1-60 at a merry pace.
---
Funny
---
&gt; Play what you want, unless it’s a ret paladin.
---
Those vocal minorty Pserver elitists are discovering that ret paladins can do some craze PVE damage when built right. We're still learning the game.
---
You are not alone. But I think the main difference is that if you want to do raids (maybe even harder dungeons) then yes, vanilla classes do have specific roles, and a lot sucks. I was a Druid up to cataclysm and I remember that was very painful to level up (but nice to have the travel form). I did some dungeons in BC but I felt that was a useless class (as feral) so in Cata I started a warrior that was more fun to play ( at least a the time).  I would like to try Druid again, because I feel now I will understand better how to use it but I'll probably go mage but still not sure. I plan to have fun and not try to go high level, because I feel like it will be too much work, and would take out the fun from playing. But that is just me.
---
Nah not really. People will be dicks and get away with it. People will make mods that act as a dungeon finder so you rep won’t matter and you’ll be playing with strangers just like on retail. The culture itself has changed, people are gonna “go go go” classic with no regard for the journey or making friends along the way
---
&gt; getting inside info on Classic
---
Are they really getting inside info on Classic though? I mean it sure seems like it, but afaik none of them has proved that they are in contact with Blizzard. And if they are in contact with them why don't they just say it? - Then we would at least be sure that they aren't just making stuff up. I just don't see the point of having it a secret.
---
This sub is overestimating how big classic will be. A one time viewer boost of a few thousand is meaningless.
---
sounds good ill enjoy it
---
I wish this was real
---
Why the rush? For the challenge or to be first in line for a raid?
---
To some extent, the nitpicking of classes and specs happened in vanilla as well, though the meta wasn't nearly as well understood so plenty of people nitpicked incorrectly.  But there were still "best" specs and classes and roles.  Filling a 40 man raid is tough outside of the top of the top guilds, so plenty of people found raids and the like with sub-optimal specs but there is no doubt that it makes a difference.  People will be aware.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that in TBC, there was significant progress made in making each classes' playstyle functional (at least in PvE).  That's not to say every spec in every class was viable, but at least if you should be able to tank, you could tank if you specc'd and geared properly.
---
That's not true in Vanilla.  Some of the meta is overreacting to min-max knowledge, but plenty of it is legitimate.  If you are attempting progression raiding, yes, some specs (there's usually space for every class) and playstyles will be left behind or at least given low priority on slots and loot.  If you're planning on more casual endgame content, then there'll usually be a place for about anyone.
---
Hi, /u/Makke609
---
Yeah, cuz we want everyone to know our AOE spots.... thanks a lot, OP.
---
They were pretty trash at anything but healing in PvP too... They just got kited like crazy, only stood a chance vs a terrible player or under geared melee class. 
---
There was such a small population of players in vanilla that actually had any idea what they were doing. I was keyboard turning and clicking up until Nax. My guild was actually viewed as pretty good, and I had good enough gear to smash people. Even with this lack of knowledge and poor, slower play ret pallies were a bit of a meme. I think they'll be significantly worse than some of these people "remember" with the increased amount of knowledge everyone will have going in. I just don't see as many ranged classes not kiting the ever loving shit out of them....
---
Alexensual should get one too so i can watch someone without losing braincells.
---
DO NOT PANIC!!!
---
I think it would be funny if these streamers are pranking this subreddit as revenge for all the hate they get here.
---
I’m getting tired of these teases. At some point the hype doesn’t affect me anymore and actually has an inverse effect on me.  Building hype is good but after several months of consuming every bit of media on a game; hype gets tiresome and frankly, pretty stupid.  FFS the game is out now (on private servers) so we’ve all played and experienced it, just give us the damn thing so we can move on.  I feel like so many gamers spend all their time waiting for shit rather than playing and enjoying themselves.  Sorry for ranting.
---
Winterspring, the winter area lvl 58-60 mobs.
---
Both my retail 60s dinged there in the exact same scenario. I had no quests left, so just grinded our the last few levels. 60 hunter and 60 paladin.
---
Usually Winterspring.
---
I wouldn't say mages counter them. You would still need to outplay the rogue to beat him. Dwarf paladin with reckoning (with or without the sit bug) on the other hand is a hard counter to rogue. Multiple CDs to take off blind and reckoning is just designed to destroy rogues. Not many people are going to bother with reckoning without that bug tho.
---
I was not prepared.
---
I'm definitely stoked. Like I said, I wasn't being serious, but I don't think Blizzard is above a surprise drop, or at least, a drop with little notice.
---
I guess we'll find out.
---
Hunters are the rogue killers.
---
The only way to do it.
---
Dun Morough still holds a place in my heart. Smacking Trogs in the face at Gol'Bolar Quarry with a wooden mallet for hours on end, dying every time one manages to escape and agro another pack. Bliss.
---
well you didnt say summer solstice you said next month which most normal people would assume you meant June 1st therefore an arbitrary date for summer
---
edit:sorry youre different people i just realized lol
---
I don't recall people saying that. We were getting blue posts on a regular basis for a while now so people were starting to get a little entitled but nobody was actually expect info updates until this whole streamers visiting Blizzard thing happened.
---
There are some elitists sure, but most people are just trying to warn you of mistakes people already made back then. The time investment in your character is immense, so I would welcome people being upfront about what to expect.
---
I mean no one is stopping you from investing months of playtime into whatever you *think* will be fun. But then be ready for a rude awakening at 60.
---
That said, not a single class is left behind in Vanilla, but certain specialisations are.
---
This was mine as well. I didn't know what else to do at the time, so I just did a grind on those dragonkin for a while.
---
I'm pretty sure mail to your alts was instant. Everything else took an hour.
---
The opportunity cost of *sometimes* de-ing something for a slim profit margin loses out to gathering professions every time if you have even the slightest patient for farming. That said, the level 10 alt isn't a perfect solution either since they'll never get the juicy soulbound blues/purples that represent a decent chunk of d/e income.
---
Winterspring for sure.
---
😂 it totally was. 
---
Running over the river to the wine cellar. Man I want to play again. I’m there with you. 30 this year
---
I honestly think it’s because devs don’t allow mods/dedicated servers anymore. Nothing better than doing the rounds on a couple of clans servers who you knew and fragging in them. You’d build up a reputation, funnily enough like you did in vanilla.
---
Towelliee used to BASH ANYONE who brought up classic servers in his chat and ban people. He used to hate the thought of it and now he’s hyping up for classic? Fuck this dude. Tips out jumped on the band wagon and was absolutely CLUELESS about classic before all this now he just makes click bait videos. It’s fucking stupid.
---
I agree but your guild probably won't take you as a dpsing druid when they go raiding, so if you have any raiding ambitions do know what role can be expected from you when you reach 60.

---
Which private server is this on?
---
I was pretty confident Vanilla had an open Beta but that was almost 15 years ago so my memory could be flawed. Do you have any actual proof that Vanilla's Beta wasn't fully open?
---
Ya, this is a very good point.
---
I imagine if the streamers get access tomorrow, there (may) be a chance the normies are in the RNG invite pool as well, as WoW isn't really a game to be played with like, 12 people (How many were invited to Irvine?)
---
And if it was streamer only, I would guess there is a beta release target, which can be very influential in guessing the launch release date.
---
It'd be easier to get a philosopher's stone and turn all silver into gold!
---
Makes sense. Thanks!
---
jesus ur bank acct must be looking sad
---
I played Alliance since day 1 through like Cata. I wan't to experience it through a different lens this time around.
---
Ya dwarf paladin is just a nightmare for a rogue. They would honestly have to FAP or resto pot to get the stun off. Otherwise you can't evasion tank them and hope for the best. The the rogue PvP trinket not taking off stuns just adds insult to injury.
---
Because scary only means "terrified"...
---
The reality is that a lot of specs were really really bad in vanilla and some classes had questionable (at best) itemization (Druid).
---
If you aren't raiding it doesn't really matter tbh.  But in raids, things like priest/moonkin/enhancement/ret dps just weren't remotely competitive.  Likely 1/2 the dps (or less) of warrior/rogue/mage/lock.
---
It was like that in classic and people had the same attitudes back then as you are seeing now toward those classes.  
---
If raid viability (specifically dps) for your spec matters to you, take that into consideration.  Otherwise, ignore it.
---
No class will be left behind in raids.  Druids will find a Place and shamans/paladins are capable healers.  Hunters fall off toward Naxx but still do respectable dps and provide utility for their raid and the necessary tranq shot.
---
Will raid leaders make raids up with a lot of shadow priests, boomkins, Prot pallies, etc?  No, that would likely be a recipe for failure.
---
Could be fake tbh.
---
The earliest update in there is 4/18. Is that around when the "Friends and Family" beta started?
---
The only psychological analysis I can make in defense of it being an actual leak is that it seems his head does a few extra movements (No real facial reaction) but after closing it, does look towards the chat (presuming where he his turned is another monitor with Twitch chat.)
---
However, he holds back any "oh shit" reaction really well if that was an accidental leak.
---
Projecting again friend.
---
Because betas usually means a release shortly after.
---
Shaman (elemental), SL lock, Spriest (if horde, only slightly hard if alliance), reckadin. Hunters are also a brutal counter. Really, most classes are good against rogues when you start getting out of blues and into epics. When you start being able to comfortably survive the first ~8 seconds of stunlock, you're gonna have a much easier time.
---
My realm's forum was the only WoW forum I frequently visited back in the day.  Gotta keep up on the server's guild drama.
---
You’re gonna be disappointed.
---
I like our content creators, and their imperfections too. I find your anger or jealousy sad.
---
I agree. Most people who wait for classic aren't 14 years old anymore. We're too old for these endless teases and guessing games. Why does it have to be a secret that beta or whatever is coming out? We already know that Classic will be released this summer, so why keep the rest a secret. I don't get it.
---
You just missed that in patch 1.16 they will include ogres a new race that can be warriors and casters for the horde...
---
Troll priest helps even further - three 10% chances to stun them back while you're stunlocked.
---
I think this is hilarious.
---
yeah, it fucking sucks
---
Here's the deal.
---
The amount of people playing this game will be about 30% of its population from launch.
---
The 70% of people who are going to quit, will be the Holy Paladins, Nature Druids, and generally the *bad* classes that arent fun to play, or not useful enough to progress to new content.
---
Play what you want. Reroll if it's not fun.
---
But just realize that if you're not good at the game, the game wont be fun. If the game isnt fun, you're going to be more likely to quit before you reach any real content.
---
POONGOON is the only one I'll listen to.
---
I wish us normal people would get the scoop ):
---
Shadowfang Keep
---
I'm predicting a new trailer. Exclusive to him maybe.   
---
Seems like it. He said something like "We will have tings to observe, new content. Tell you what, my youtube will be popin' tomorrow!" 
---
also predicted 3-4 new reddit threads about him tomorrow.
---
Orc is THE warrior race in vanilla, both for PvP and PvE. Undead get Will of the Forsaken and Cannibalize which are both pretty good for PvP. If looks matter that much to you go undead, but orcs are regarded as the best.
---
Even easier when you resist their stun with your orc racial.

I started playing WoW back in 2005 playing a night elf warrior at the time, I raided up until huhu in AQ40 on the realm Draenor and then before the release of TBC the guild i was in disbanded. I did clear some content in BC and Wrath but the game never really felt the same after that so I just played in and out for a few years, levelled a rogue to 110 in legion and just kinda quit.
---
I am now really looking to get back into raiding and playing the game i know and love and i have an RL friend with me who also played vanilla and is planning on rolling a rogue.
---
We are looking for a social casual/semi hardcore raiding guild who raids in the week mon - fri and also up for making some pre made pvp groups for some ally smashing :) 
---
give me a shout on discord if there are any guilds out there recruiting and want to recruit a couple of good players :)
---
cheers
---
Should also add I'm planning on rolling Shaman but also toying with the idea of lock and priest
---
that would actually be better because it would greatly lessen the tourist dropoff problem after launch and make server capacity more stable at launch.
---
This must be a meme response right
---
Cause Alexensual is the literal worst and picks fights with everyone
---
https://youtu.be/2D_v6M7uZjc
---
Here's the same guy with a 10 years later follow up.
---
Influencers scare me. The fact that w/e product can and will change, based on a influencer and their mindless drones, almost never a good thing.
---
ctrl-F didn't find anyone talking about it, so I'll bring it up:
---
Be prepared to grind gnomer *SHITLOADS*. You need to bring 1-2 dozen crowd pummelers to raids. They are the only item that keeps druids actually viable compared to warriors, and the only chance they have for pulling ahead in threat. 
---
If you are pretty casually raiding with a guild that doesn't care as much you might be able to get away without using it, but you'll definitely be hurting; especially at first when you don't have the gear.
---
If there are some under appreciated content creators let’s see their material. I certainly don’t watch all their videos and none of their streams but Jesus Christ the unnecessary hate they receive is a bit cringey.
---
He definitely does, there's a ton of questions a beta would answer that a lot of people want to know.
---
Well ... than it might be hard for you to accept it but you are NOT:
---
- friendly person
---
- good player 
---
If healers and tanks are burden for dps class than how about 40 dps for raid ? ... no? ... ooohhhh wait ... you do need tanks and healers than ... how about tranquility shot ? ... you don't need it ? ... yyeeaaa real man fight with enraged bosses ... kiting some mobs is also for weaklings ... yyyeeaaa rriigghhtt 
---
And one more thing ... raids is a part of end game content ... there is also pvp and wpvp ... over there 2 button dps combo is not enough ... that tank defending objective or carrying a flag is more precious to team than raw dps ... that healer is usually a game changer ... and this "trash" huntard suddenly is a challenge to defeat ...
---
A few reasons actually. 
---
1) I hate leveling in every single game. The only game I've ever enjoyed leveling in is SWTOR.   
---
2) I don't get a TON of play time, but my wife has made me a deal when I take my week off from work she's not going to say anything about how much I play (I had to bribe her for this) and for up to 2 or 3 weeks after that she knows I'll be playing games more than usual.   
---
3) Since I'm my guild's MT I want to be to 60, and gearing out for pre BIS while everyelse catches up as well so I can be ready to tank MC / Ony when we get 40 of us to 60. 
---
And when I say enjoy the grind on a mage or warlock, there is no real enjoyment out of it because I actually hate leveling, but playing with lower level friends is fun. And I won't be stressed out about hitting 60 anymore.
---
So Hunters are pretty tops in MC, and run for tops in BWL but by the end of AQ40 they're lower than the other dps. You still need 2 of them and will probably have more but they won't be top dps for the most part in the end of Aq40 and naxx.
---
I'm gonna laugh if its something related to their website, or a guild announcement.
---
Better i get fucking good news in classic front, cos game of thrones is turning into rushed mad shit show ( for two years waiting for six episodes for sure they didn't spend their time well) hope Blizzard did better job on their part!
---
are you saying he's so good that when shitheads in his community organize a raid on him he's gonna win a 1v40? I'm not saying it would ruin his experience, he can do what he wants, but that is a pretty valid reason to go pve server as a streamer
---
Can you share results when your done? Really would like to see results!
---
INFP - alliance drood pve/pvp
---
True but not by much. Warstomp was a rogue killer for me. You want to vanish and bandage before I execute spam you? Sorry you're getting warstomped
---
Well, that's the overstatement of the year.
---
Ret Paladins can do *meaningfully adequate* damage when fully optimized and used by skilled players, like any of the other hybrids in a correct raid setup. To say they can do crazy PvE damage, especially compared to their melee brethren Fury Warriors and Rogues, is just disingenuous. Shadowpriests are good for raids, too, but there's no way in hell one could ever come close to outputting the pure damage of a Mage.
---
[I invite you to simply compare the Top All-Time dps records of Ret Paladins on Vanilla Pservers compared to the Top All-Time of Warriors.](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx) Even when limiting the dps rankings to Alliance-Only (because Horde Warriors and Rogues do a lot more damage than Alliance ones due to Windfury buffs), the top-end Warriors do nearly three times as much damage as the top-end Ret Paladins.
---
The question in taking a hybrid dps is whether they are dedicated players who are going to go above and beyond to pull as much weight as they can, because the absolute best of the best hybrids will only come neck-and-neck with the random middle-of-the-road pure dpsers. And I'm not saying that as someone who hates hybrids. I'm maining SPriest for my guild in Classic. But it does little good to overexaggerate hybrid capacity and have the actual playerbase fall short of that idealized goal, because that will make raid leaders avoid using them.
---
Staysafe is telling people to take off work and skip school tomorrow because "youll want to be here" and he went on to say (paused stream, went fullscreen cam) "I will not fuck you in the ass, just trust me". If he is telling people to take off work or skip school, better be something playable for everyone
---
Why are you deliberately ignoring Aodhyn's comment?
---
Sen'jin Village. memorable music, sights, and quests..especially  preventing the Kolkar attack that would have absolutely devastated Ogrimmar
---
Troll rogue. At tirions shack in western plaguelands
---
Are you talking about that 2hander?
---
Man. Me too. I was like 55-56 when TBC dropped. I never experienced Vanilla while at 60. Never did the 50-60 dungeons until LFG was added. Never did Naxx or Ony until Wrath. Other than those raids, everything end game will be newish to me.
---
My legit guess is that they will announce the beta, collectors editions, and release date for the game. Buy the collectors edition, get into the beta.
---
 Strat
---
If it bugs you so much, just ignore this sub/WoW side of social media then and wait for an official announcement from Blizz's twitter.

Not like every topic hasn't been beaten to death on this sub anyways.
---
Many people enjoy it compared to radio silence.
---
"This is why Classic WoW means so much to me" "Paladin vs Shaman" "Leveling route" "Professions for someone who only has a pinky finger?" "Best class for a total n00b" "Coming over from Final Fantasy 14, is this a good time to get into Classic WoW?"
---
You do realize that it's a beta, not a demo? "There's no point in playing"? The point of it is to provide feedback. As it's old content, they might not want feedback on the content itself, but they'll definitely want to know how it runs for people, how the technical changes affect everyone and catch bugs that have slipped through their internal testing.
---
He knows that, which means he's alluding to something else.
---
No thanks!
---
I’m saying it’s a bit silly to say “it’s racist to assume someone’s race based on their voice” when we know for a fact that the person who plays Leeroy is white. It’s not an assumption.
---
None of what you said is in any way correct.
---
I farmed BRD on a rogue and my mage friend farmed Diremaul during Vanilla.
---
There is a reason why Blizzard implemented an hourly limit of instance resets during Vanilla. Farming was nerfed during Vanilla.
---
Disagree. You can find an okay casual guild that will take druid DPS. You can even find a good guild as long as you show up and are flexible with off healing or tanking.
---
maybe he's ready to report his answer to [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyLovelyOwlPeanutButterJellyTime) insightful question.
---
It does not scare the fuck out of me in the least. I think people are completely over-reacting. Yes, tips is far from perfect and I don’t even know who washcloth is, but it’s really nothing to panic over. It’s not as if their ignoring some great content creators and choosing these instead.
---
why the fuck would anyone take a sick day to watch someone play vanilla beta? I just want to play the damn game, not a beta that will wipe after a few weeks!
---
Blizzard used to mock Classic WoW too, and now everyone is sucking the classic teams D for their weekly/bi-weekly updates the last couple months and showing eternal gratitude for creating Classic WoW.
---
Oh look. This thread... Again..
---
One of the few times rave reviews were actually accurate.
---
Haters gon hate.
---
Depends on launch day, if it's a weekend where i can play with my IRL friends I will roll with them based on what classes we need/want for a 5 man group. I usually tank for them and try to stay overgeared to make it easier cause we end up playing with 4 pretty often.      
---
              
---
If it launches a day where it's jut me taking off work, I am going to reserve my names and then blitz level a hunter for really really cheap (I'm always gonna have a hunter anyway), buying nothing, vendoring herbs and leather, making connections and enjoying the rush. I've got plenty of Pserver practice so I can probably outrun the zerg.         
---
My hope is I can put a bit of money aside for gear, playing the AH, and starting a guild early so I'm all set up by the time my friends can get on to level our actual characters together at a normal pace.
---
Like usual then, a "media" access pass. Wowhead, MMO-C, popular streamers. So you can guarantee the likes of Tipsout, Towellie, Bajheera, Sodapoppin etc will all get it. As with every previous WoW beta.
---
**&lt;Ascendance&gt;,** ***casual/Semi-Hardcore Raid guild \[PvP\].***
---
**Region**: EU
---
**Server**: TBA, PvP
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
Should your interest purely be social or completely PvP related, you are welcome as well.
---
**What we expect**:
---
*  You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
· We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
· That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM)
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

Are you really going to watch streamers as often once Classic WoW is out anyways? Doesn't really matter anyways. 
---
Plus, Asmongold, not invited to the summit, is gonna shit on everyone's viewers anyways. Dude pulled 25k viewers yesterday while Blizzard had 30k peak on their big WoW arena tournament. All of them get squashed by Asmongold, and Towellie especially loses viewers when pretty much any other big WoW player is on.
---
Asmongold, while playing into the sperg audience thing, is basically what you're looking for if you're looking for a die-hard Classic fan, and his viewers will trump all of the people invited to the Blizzard Irvine Classic summit combined. He's always been critical of Blizzard and his non-dick-suckery attitude is why Blizz doesn't do him favors.
---
He was literally trying to log into the beta on his stream. Anyone can download the client and build it if they know how which is what he did. Not a leak.
---
Give the neckbeard the banhammer! XD
---
implying those streamers are not normies
---
&gt; I invite you to simply compare the Top All-Time dps records of Ret Paladins on Vanilla Pservers compared to the Top All-Time of Warriors.
---
Those are standard STR build ret paladins using SoC.
---
I'm talking about 1 handed / fast weapon / SoR / spellpower build ret paladins with shadow oil and chili and shit. Completely different meta, and has some crazy potential.
---
&gt;I played a rogue in vanilla on Runetotem
---
Wow me too.
---
&gt;I still have fond memories of Alterac Valley, defending the bridge out side the Alliance base
---
... do I have a split personality and a secret 2nd account?
---
A lobotomized monkey could faceslam into a keyboard for ten hours straight and accidentally put out enough damage to be taken on a raid as Mage if someone keybound everything to Frostbolt.
---
Casual players aren't likely going to be anywhere near full Naxx clears. But to say that people who aren't "good at the game" can't enjoy Classic is both elitist and nonsensical. Half the fun of Vanilla is merely leveling, and early raids can be accomplished by complete casuals, even if only six months later than the cutting-edge guild completions. You don't need to be a wunderkind to enjoy Classic WoW. The original game was *specifically designed* so that casual players could enjoy it, which is precisely why and how it's still going 13 years later and why we are even having this conversation. If Vanilla was hostile to newbies, WoW would have died off long ago.
---
No one? EVERYONE that wants higher pop asks for 10k "but 5k or higher is ok to". And why be so agressive and act like a douche?
---
No one asked for your opinion
---
No one asked for you being toxic
---
Why would it negatively affect me in any way when I say I'm down to playing it with an alt?
---
it is sort of weird to describe it as 'scary as fuck'. I'd describe it as unfortunate.
---
Seems like the most likely conclusion that they'll be let into the closed beta/alpha. I've never watched a stream in my life and I don't plan to, but I'm glad we'll be getting some new info on the game.
---
In my experience almost all the “Classic” Streamers are reading guides someone else put online 14-15 years ago. We KNOW what BiS will be. We KNOW the zones worth going to.
---
Summer ends Sept 23rd.  Plenty of time.
---
WowB was run 2 days ago in that screenshot. This seems like a really big fuck up.
---
They're also the same people that miss Classic WoW, but will be the first to go to the BiS set lists and scream anyone using anything else is complete trash, completely ignoring their own hypocrisy.  
---
The toxicity in this game isn't going to go away and contrary to what people here believe, we know too much about WoW to have the same experience again.  Wipes in dungeon runs will cause people to rage and everyone will be "expected" to know everything because the information is out there already.  It ultimately ruins the experience of Classic since we all originally went into it blind.  Now hundreds of people are actively studying on how to get ahead, which ruins the spirit of it.  
---
I think a lot of people are in for a rude awakening with how Classic ends up and how the general community will behave.  Of course, I would love nothing more than to be wrong about this.
---
Hunter/Druid are the two I'm torn between but I like the versatility of Druid (And have mained druid since Cata). 99% sure I will have both though lol
---

---
Are you just quoting a thing that I told you I don't watch at me? That's.....huh. Pretty sperglord of you. But I guess that's the classic Joe Rogan fan: 16-20 and vomiting quotes from the show! haha!
---
There are content creators that have been grinding their asses off for close to 2 years putting out classic content despite relative small audiences and little to no monetary gain. Then there are content creators that just jumped on the train once this sub and the hype reached a certain treshold. They didnt put out noteworthy content for shit and suddenly they are all "CLASSIC HYPE", despite knowing jack-sh*t about the game.
---
u/jaredletosombrehair is talking about the later rather than the former.
---
r/classicwow
---
Read threads near top
---
You're welcome
---
Before you make a post, ask yourself this: Did someone likely already make a post about this? If you think yes, don't post it. If you don't think they did and you're about to karma farm, then check to see if it was posted. If it still wasn't posted, then post it.
---
I was about to say, I said sweet f all up to press haha.
---
And seeing as I'm here replying, it's not on OP to make sure people aren't ignorant of the fact that summer begins at this time and not when they feel like summer begins :)
---
Context?
---
Probably, I wonder if he will "hide" his actual username for a while. I do get your concern tho, and getting server names would help a lot for me and my friends to decide a server so non of us start levling on different ones :)
---
My plan is to roll a UD warlock and wing it. I do want to be around at launch tho so I get the name I want.
---
What? TBC feral druids were the shit. I was the number two tank in a guild that cleared BT and most of Sunwell. And feral druids are some of the most efficient levelers in the game! Not trying to insult you or anything, but I'd give it another shot if you like the class. Vanilla druid tanks probably had to be 3rd+ spot in raids and had to be very flexible to fill other rolls when needed.
---
Raids usually only keep 2 hunters for tranq rotation which means you're barley competing for  loot. Most of your bis gear is tier too so that's even better. Basically what this means: you should be doing average to high dps all the way to Naxx. Hunters might be a little bit worse in Classic compared to what they've been on private servers simply due to the fact that there will be a much longer time between new raids to get other classes geared.
---
Nice! That’s what I was going for.
---
Play hunter and don't be afraid :) 
---
PvE end game is only a part of a game ... don't listen to others ... they should be afraid of you in pvp instead of you being afraid of them in pve :)
---
So, that was You?
---
 Reporting him was too kind of a punishment for what that druid did.
---
Hey there! 
---
You can use the website [vanillafriends.com](https://vanillafriends.com) to try to find old friends you played with in the past :) It's a much better shot than to search blindly around here!
---
I know of 5 guilds, atleast, that cleared first day, of course thats EU, NA, and Oceanic guilds. But ya.
---
many thanks to you!
---
Can you disclose how you diagnosed their behavior as 'autistic'? If you're just using it as a dumb internet insult, you're not doing a good job of looking better than them.
---
What really? They banned people for that? Meanwhile myself and a friend twomanned both Plaguewind and Spiderwing in wotlk 10man naxx. No ban or warning was ever given.
---
INTP-Horde-Shaman-Healer-pvp/pve
---
It was fairly open for the time, since you didn't have to pay, but today that would absolutely be considered a closed beta. First come first serve, limited slots.
---
WotLK\*
---
Not understanding your logic. You can't Vanish, and you can't outrun. If you can't burst down the Druid, he's going to kill you eventually.
---
At this point, it is almost certainly assured that Blizzard has given them permission to tease us all. They are just excited and having fun within the means they were given. Should be more angry with Blizzard, if they have the information ready to share, why aren't they just sharing it? Why tell these streamers then let them tease us all like this? Its a childish tactic (but it works).
---
Glad you've got time to be the hero and tell people this pal. Great job!
---
Silithus killing a scarab.
---
Drustic for sure. Guys entertaining and one of the most knowledgeable around.
---
First I've heard of it
---
Glad someone else said it for me.
---
What is a "black voice" though? There is nothing genetic about the dialect an American black person speaks with--go to Europe, the Black British and French I've met sound indistinguishable to their white european countrymen. To weave the thread that a (nothing in the video suggests the player is white) dude with a deep voice, who doesnt listen to instructions and is eating chicken is an intentionally racist caricature is grasping IMO.
---
If anything it does more to reveal ones own racist tendencies and world view.
---
That said, Black people, like girls, dont play wow.
---
My only interest in a beta is to practice creating my chars so i can get everything set up before my names get taken
---
**&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
I feel like they are saying “beta tomorrow” but just skirting around it. Which I don’t see the difference at that point. I really don’t think they need these streamers for the hype at this point. 
---
The hype is there. Blue post. They need a blizzard rep talking directly to the community. Someone like an Uncle Jeff or Ghost Crawler figure. We are all chomping at the bit and the only reason these guys are getting attention is we are all so desperate for info we will listen to anyone that “might” have any real info. 
---
I want to hear from Blizzard not these Pserver streamers.
---
LBRS around the spiders
---
I prefer the original, really emphasizes the misplaced elitism
---
Not all heroes wear capes, some wear neckbeards and act as the Reddit police.
---
This + Druid.
---
LOL smh
---
Orc for a Horde Warrior. No question. Stun resist is too good to pass up, and as you have Berserker Rage you do not need Will of the Forsaken.
---
Man's gotta do something.
---
I’m on friends and family list, and we haven’t gotten a beta either. Friends and family typically isn’t under an NDA so you would be hearing more about it anyway. It’s closed alpha testing that is under strict in-house NDA
---
TLDR; To sum it up, no dual spec. That’s surface value enough to understand why.
---
Some of my favorite channels seem lesser known like platinum WoW,classicwinds,scorecraft.
---
Wanna avoid huge streamers like everyone else.
---
All those are literally any Paladin specs in any capacity on all-time rankings. The ranking system on that website doesn't differentiate between specs. If your "fast weapon shadow oil spellpower Ret Paladin" builds aren't showing up on there, it's because none of them have approached the damage output of standard Ret builds, and the best of the best Ret builds ever recorded on that site don't even approach the best dps of other melee builds.
---
Again, a person should play Ret if they want to. I mained Ret in BC (and actually became semi-famous for it, to the point that I recently found other characters on the official armory who named themselves after me). I love the aesthetic of the class. I think a Classic guild can take a Ret Paladin with them and not be insane to do so. But the Ret Paladin just isn't going to be topping meters unless their raidmates are literally mentally handicapped. The interim design team had a hate boner for hybrids and did everything they could to sabotage them. That's just a fact. Just because a guild can run a Boomkin or Retadin or SPriest doesn't mean those specs are being taken for the sole purpose of putting out leet deeps.
---
Oh please Jessica, cut the crap.
---
Every time I do this test I always get a different result. Normally do it once every year or so and my life will have changed a little bit. I have been an ISFP and ENTP
---
Now I'm an **INFP**

---
If I roll ally - Hunter - leaning on this more because of IRL mates

Mixing content but leaning on PvP
---
Wrath of the lich child ?
---
Hey, i have downloaded the Build and want to start the game, only just to see the screen ;)
---
But always i have an error, i made a directory \_beta\_ in the game dir and copied all file in, but no success.
---
Have someone a solution ?
---
I have started putting out youtube videos and haven't caught too much flak yet, but I think what most people are getting worked up over is is false information. 
---
As soon as a youtuber puts something out on youtube saying "Something is this way" but its actually false or they misrepresented it in someway everyone gets triggered and starts flaming them. 
---
I'm guilty of this as well. When I absolutely know a youtube is throwing out false information I get triggered. I don't flame and spread hate, but I get a little triggered about hearing wrong information in a video. 
---
Personally, I'm staying away from making videos that have potential bad information in them. Mine are going to be quest guides for dungeons / high priority quests like Ony Attunment, UBRS keys, and things like that. Things I know I cant get wrong by doing my research. May be the safer route and not get as much growth, but I know what I'm saying is true.
---
just move or jump every few minutes?
---
how is this a question?
---
It’s mainly jealousy. I’ve never seen a ‘community’ hate it it’s content creators so much it’s an odd experience.
---
Wrath of the lich cing?
---
Hmmm maybe I’ll get it then thanks for insight.
---
Can't wait! :D
---
Blasted Lands, there was a cave with orges outside it. Very little player activity about and a nice respawn rate so I didn't have any downtime. Probably wasn't the most efficient areas by any means but was easy with little attention required.
---
Dang man! Thanks for all that I really appreciate it the long answer haha. 
---
I’m fully ready now!
---
I'm not into streaming or streamers at all. I'm just making the point that their actions will have zero impact on anyone other than themselves and the folks who choose to interact with them.
---
So we are just going to hate on all the youtubers and streamers because one guy did one semi-weird thing?
---
Yea as soon as they showed stuff for it I lost interest. Not a fan of the pirate theme and the story so far is bland and uninspiring. Legion and wrath had good stories and good big bads. This xpac i just can't get excited for at all.
---
because 99% of them are just money hungry, which is why they will make 10:01 minute videos every time someone at blizzard sneezes
---
Lol the dancing spinning bitches always ticked me off
---
The ping is a killer for PVP and PVE DPS, 100-150ms.
---
http://old.classicdb.ch/?item=9449
---
Yeah, 50% increased attack speed is straight amazing, and the DPS doesn't matter because shapeshifted druids scale off some base number instead of equipped weapons.
---
What other questions are there? (genuine question)
---
Absolutely
---
Thinking about this too, but I don't know if I can bring myself to do it.
---
Yet A LOT of people watch those guides. So I guess, in fact, possibly, everyone DOESN'T know.
---
Oh i remember it. It used to have charges am i right?
---
Is it useful for pulling mobs or for mid fight?
---
I really don't think it's the streamer that's the problem, it's the streamer community that's the problem. It gives immature kids the ability to become paparazzi while sitting on their computer at home with almost 0 effort involved. Personally I think it's just a product of asshole gamers with nothing better to do.
---
It's mind blowing to me that they don't realize all they are doing is making the streamers life difficult and ruining content.
---
People and their followers tend to be retarded
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
Maybe the streamers are all just announcing a new collaboration...
---
Don't forget the Pandaran that dinged 90 doing nothing but picking herbs.

[EU - PvP - Alliance/Horde]
---
Hello, i’m 27 years old Swedish guy
---
looking for semi hardcore / hardcore guild that raids in the morning / early afternoon to fit my work &amp; family schedule. 
---
Vanilla PvE Experience: 
---
Progressed to Princess Huhuran in AQ40 and tried spider wing in Naxx before Burning crusade. I was one of the tanks in Guild of Honor, Darksorrow EU. 
---
Vanilla PvP Experience: 
---
Made it to rank10 without really trying to hard. I was more into PvE at the time but when i was free from PvE stuff i had the pleasure to get invited to Eternal Ownages premade, top PvP guild of Darksorrow EU. 
---
Quitted retail in Mist of Pandaria and been lurking vanilla private servers ever since. 
---
Gonna main rogue, rush 60 in the first week and start farming pre raid bis / consumables.
---
Please do not hesistate to contact me if you have any questions.
---
Best regards,
---
Johnny
---
Come back and wiggle your mouse every 10 minutes. I will be doing a TON of AFK crafting and will be checking in every 10 min.

---
i also dislike some of them, but they do have the numbers and they do have the information. so it is news, like it or not
---
Good point.
---
Been weirded out by this as well. Why the hate? Nobody forces you to watch them. I understand the problems they might cause in the server population and people following around, but they seem to get hated for some other unknown reasons.
---
you don't watch any of them but just happen to check their twitter 3 min after they post an update?
---
get real son, none of them are "pointing" towards anything. It's incredible how gullible some people are on the internet
---
Me everytime I first get to winterspring on a new character: wow this place is so pretty I'm so glad to be done with felwood =D

---
&gt; Maybe you can make a 45 minute long youtube video on it idk
---
I have as little use as the next guy for videos that recap blue posts I can read on my own.  But if you're just going to be needlessly shitty towards someone, don't cry about it when they ban you.  I'm assuming the irony of you complaining about "snowflakes" will be lost on you, so I'm not even going to go there.
---
I wouldn't mind messing around with a beta just to learn what mechanics are working as they're supposed to or not, and to start practicing power leveling. As well as give add-on makers time to make add-ons.
---
My problem with streamers is boredom.  It's literally just some guy spouting off for 2 hours while playing a game.  The information may be in there somewhere, but 5 minutes of information in 2 hours of spouting shit is ...annoying as hell.
---
Make a 5 minute Youtube video.

no point in me commenting, you said exactly my thoughts lol trust meeeeee!

I knew you weren’t hardcore when I read your post. Only the most neckiest of neckbeards will be granted access to beta
---
Has anything been said about servers being available in Australia?
---
Ya
---
I know. But as I said, I know better now. At the time wasn't good for me, but could be better now because I'm more experienced.
---
this
---
I see. Overwatch worked a bit differently. Even in the friends and family access, normies got access too, just at a much lesser frequency (And you were guaranteed in if your friend/family submitted your email.)
---
But yeah that makes sense
---
never dinged 2 yet as never played classic before XD
---
How can you really beta test content thats locked behind hours and hours of progression? Sounds so daunting
---
If its big news why isnt Blizzard announcing it themself?
---
His music is really satisfying for me to keep watching his vids honestly. Too many pvp videos try too much with their music or it doesn't even match the actual PVP and it ruins it for me.
---
That would actually be smart thinking by them.
---
Clap
---
I mean damn. was i out of line ?. Making 5 hour long 3 part videos on how "progressive itemization" is the pinacle of classic and how it must be preserved at all costs. To make a 180 when blizzard made a statement on it. Going from "this is a gamebreaker" To "its not a big deal". I feel kinda violated
---
To be fair, it is cheap and effective marketing for Blizz.
---
i think u can buy all the goblin shit on the AH so most people go gnomish
---
Have about 18ish players that are all returning to WoW.
---
First day I will create an Orc Shaman and quest up to level 5-10. Then make a run over to Org and start up the guild.
---
Then we will all level together to 60. It’s going to be a blast!
---
Also, a buddy of mine has about 20 people returning, so we’ll probably end up merging and have a raiding group ready before we even hit 60.

Where did he say this? WTF. Im panicking now. Should I call in sick?!?! WHAT IS HAPPENING
---
17 things to expect in wow classic
---
4 things to expect in wow classic
---
11 things to expect in wow classic
---
28 things to expect in wow classic 
---
9 things to expect in wow classic 
---
13 things to expect in wow classic
---
99 things to expect in wow classic
---
And the retards keep watching every one of their 10 min video. Please ignore all this retardness. Their youtube career will end as soon as classic is released.
---
I wonder if part of it is that people here just don't follow streamers generally. If you haven't played WoW in years and are waiting for Classic, you've had no reason to watch WoW streamers such as Asmon, the Classicast crew, etc.
---
Orc
---
Except when a fanbase for a streamer is known to be toxic and disruptive, then the fact that a large portion of said fanbase will be rolling on the server specifically to play with the streamer will lead to a higher concentration of toxic players on that particular server.
---
Me me me
---
Probably because spriest is OP in 1v1
---
Got link for that?
---
Why would we? It's a game we can all play ourselves. Why do we need to support streamers? No matter what, people are going to stream Classic, so why do we care who it is specifically? Fuck giving anybody celebrity status over a fucking game.
---
Go make your own Pserver, then.
---
Was gonna say the same thing
---
Nips out baby!
---
I want FPS wow 2 on overwatch’s engine, imagine shooting warlock spells seeing hands like zenyatta. Blizzard world map made feel that way.
---
I ran this toon all the way to raiding in Wotlk. Although, when I revived my account everything was basically gone because it was so long ago.
---
He's probably gonna repeat what blizzard will say anyway
---
I fucking love PlatinumWoW
---
Destined to become a classic. WHEN!??
---
Male or Female?
---
I think most people who originally played vanilla aren't of the streamer viewing generation. 
---
I'm 32 and never watched or cared for streamers. while my brother who is 19 and will be playing with me grew up with streamers
---
Haha thank you for the kind words!!
---
Rather watch him than Towelliee who doesn’t even like Classic
---
Not really. Mostly, people are watching those videos to soothe their Classic itch a little bit.
---
A few thousand rofl
---
Edit: I misread that as the sub count will only go up by a few thousand.
---
I completely agree with you, and was somewhat hopeful early on in the process that we might get something like that. However, it's pretty clear from Blizz at this point that this will be far more of a recreation project than not. For me it was the blue post around spell batching that proved it. Spell batching was a workaround for shitty net code that the modern architecture made obsolete. It's not part of the balance, it's not part of the skill of the game, and 99% of people abusing it in pvp are doing so with the aid of various add-ons. And yet they went through the effort of reproducing some of the effects of spell-batching.
---
At this point now, all we can hope for is vanilla to succeed to the point that some other developers, maybe even Blizz themselves, see that the cycle of design has turned and there's a place on the market for a game with older MMO sensibilities while hoping for Classic to be the best version of itself it can be.
---
I hope it’s short man
---
As a mage, I second this 100%. Although the number of rogues that are capable of competently playing this matchup is like sub 10%. 
---
If the rogue is good, there is very little chance for the mage to win, but most rogues either don't know or lack the tools (talents/engi) and then it's quite one-sided the other way around.
---
I might have to give him another chance then. This was most definitely not the case when I last watched him.
---
I’ll prob catch some flak for this but fuck tips out man he’s such a little baby when he was feuding with Alex sensual. 
---
Imo I wish alexsensual had the pass. I think he gets trolled a lot but for me he’s enjoyable and doesn’t cater to those babies that cry over every thing. He bitches often but he’s enjoyable.  I can relate with him and I’m similar mindset to him as in if they f classic up I’ll be done with blizz for good.
---
Written like a perfect /r/gatekeeping post lol.
---
Win win for everyone
---
You didn’t even copy paste “the wall of no” 😛
---
https://twitter.com/TipsOutBaby/status/1127967297480474624
---
I may be wrong but I'm not aware of Blizzard releasing something big without a beta.
---
Never public in the sense that anyone can participate, AFAIK Blizzard betas are invite only, but still betas.
---
It would be useful in case of Classic considering they're backporting retail stuff, so unexpected bugs may arise that internal tests only may not show.
---
Well, it was meant as friendly banter and not a fucking personal attack. Jesus 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. And how is it ironic that i asked question and memed alittle and was slighly critical. And was instabanned?. I mean come on
---
Sadly, lol
---
Five minutes isn't long considering back in the day I could take a shower, or fix breakfast, etc while away. I like being able to squeeze more out of my downtime.
---
Well let me break it down for you guys since you don’t pay enough attention 
---
1: certain classic cast youtubers claim to be “the spokesperson for the classic wow community, I feel I can boil down what the community has to say and translate it over to blizzard, I’ve said this before” 
---
2: classic cast guys are KNOWN to be extremely rude to other non-clout content creators such as: countdown to classic where they refuse to do interviews, blow him off, send him nasty emails ect. These dudes hate him because he’s the best competition in the classic scene and it’s 5 year old childish stuff here.
---
3: tips out is a legitimate noob, he has a lack of basic understanding of vanilla and people have found PROOF he put it in writing that he started in cataclysm but now refutes and says he played all of Vanilla as a young boy. 
---
4: these people lie, have lots of mis-information and are just riding the high of the classic wow hype train and being completely annoying using words like “confirmed” for every clickbait title, incorrect information on almost every video. 
---
These people are just a clique and they just act like pompous little kids and run around with spit flying out of their mouths and most people just cringe at the sight of them. Like me.
---
That said, frostadamous and countdown to classic and defcamp and malderon and taladril and sometimes staysafe, these are the real people who are making good content.
---
Nothing wrong with a "media access pass" tbh, as long as it doesn't fill a spot for other fans (if that makes sense).
---
I hate content creators that are used to communicate "inside" information.  Many game devs these days are using them as their lap dogs to do PR work for them, which typically means reduced accuracy and accountability in the information being communicated.
---
Basically, it benefits the content creators and it benefits the game developer.  It doesn't benefit the consumer/players.
---
British here btw CLASSIC IS COMMIINNGG. 
---
(i’ll 100% be looking for a guild on release and one i can stay in for good)
---
Turns out I'm the guy who your guy knows. Jokes on you. If YOU want access, it's now double. PM me if you're still interested.
---
Literally just watched towelliee tell me to prepare diapers and energy drinks for tomorrow, i think its beta tomorrow.
---
Man, tons of reasons.
---
1) Absolutely garbage content. Videos stretched out to 10 mins so they can monetize them, when it's something they could have wrapped up in 2 mins.
---
2) Stealing content, from each other, from reddit, from 10 year old guides, etc.
---
3) Lack of knowledge - Depends on the youtuber in question, but a lot of them aren't contributing anything new and are just re-iterating things they've heard, which sometimes (often times) are false.
---
4) Streamer babies - They get so much preferential treatment from their fans that they become really annoying to listen to. For instance, there's the one streamer who literally started throwing a fit about a warglaive of azzinoth until the guild gave it to him; even though there were other people who needed it and weren't even allowed to roll. He got it because he had a crowd of followers who would have flamed if he didn't.
---
5) They warp the server balance. Tons of people join up on their server just to piggyback off the streamer. It ruins WPvP since it makes it very lopsided.
---
6) The constant brigade of unnecessary speculation. It's making people rage about things like loot trading, sharding, and the beta when it really wasn't even news in the first place, and everything blizz has released actually looks pretty good.
---
That's just some of the main points why I don't like them, but I'm sure there are more. They do some good to the community and there are plenty of content creators making really informative and useful stuff; but then there's ones like tipsout and azmongold who just don't really seem to do anything for the community. IMO streamers are WAY worse than people who exclusively youtube, but every streamer also has a youtube channel.
---
Let the streamer hating circle jerk start again
---
Devon here, can't wait!!
---
Its like smoking meat only this time its pizza lol, might be a pizza cracker at the end lol
---
It was on his stream about 30 min ago or so, he has said it several times at this point
---
The class descriptions are so good, really brings back the RPG elements of the game. No wonder why I rolled a druid, they sound so awesome.
---
Greetings all,
---
I’m a former Vanilla WoW vet and am looking forward to the release of Classic.  I will post my details below but will provide a few things that may help me land in the right guild that will fit me for the long term.  Back in Vanilla, I played primarily as a Holy Priest/Prot Warrior. I was active duty military at the time, so play time was intermittent due to deployments and different operations so I never got to achieve everything I would’ve liked but still enjoyed myself nonetheless and made a ton of friends.  I have since retired from the military and am looking forward to jumping back in and playing the best version of WoW.  All my friends have stopped playing.  Retail did not do that for me at all, and I won’t even touch it anymore.  I’ve not decided what class I would like to play, I just know that whatever class/spec I play I want my guild to say “play what you want “; even if it’s a raid.  If you are a guild that fits what I’m looking for, caters to the older crowd and just wants to have fun while also clearing content in a positive social environment, then please message me here on Reddit.  I thank you in advance and more details are below.
---
Region - NA/US
---
Server type - PVE or RP
---
Faction - Undecided (Played Alliance in Vanilla)
---
Play times/Raid times - Will be on daily after work, playing casually, however I am able to raid a few nights a week from 8 or 9pm Eastern to at least midnight.
---
Guild priority - Social, questing, dungeons, casual raiding with those of us who are Vanilla vets but are now in the older crowd and just want to enjoy the game, relax and have fun.  Not a big fan of huge guilds where no one knows anyone.
---
Rules - Would like a guild that’s friendly, non-elitist, and doesn’t care about what spec a person brings to a dungeon or raid because the relationship you build with the person is more important than if they are specced optimally.  I also would like a guild that caters to the older crowd, and not bigoted, overtly rude to others and will address these matters immediately when/if they arise.
---
Not really. The lashers are ~54, which is a pretty big level differential to begin with if you're farming at 60, but on top of that you're also gonna have blues/epics at 60. AoE farming as a Priest while levelling would basically be like trying to kill lvl 58-60 lashers in fresh greenies. I very much doubt that that's going to end well.
---
And the video: [https://youtu.be/EOKeqrMF7iE](https://youtu.be/EOKeqrMF7iE) \- a "test" mage, so not fully optimized plus lack of focus due to amount of mobs :)
---
I’ve already got access, backed up in cold storage and a hand written access code with authenticated blizzard employee ID credentials in a safe deposit box
---
Republican or "independent"?
---
Can I ask why? Haven‘t seen that many videos of him but he seems okay I guess? 🤔
---
Yea, this sub is ridiculous with its cicrclejerks
---
As a proud member of the horde my first instinct was to downvote, but then nodded cuz it's so true
---
depends on how much +healing you have
---
Its like warning a cruise ship about an iceberg and the passangers on the ship flamming you for pointing it out...
---
What’s the chances that they don’t even do a beta? I guess in this situations don’t really see the point to it
---
Very clean setup!
---
May I suggest you raise your screens a bit to not break your neck? Takes a few days to get used to but screens same height as your eyes will improve your posture a lot.
---
For a couple main reasons: 
---
* 1) It's our "first" glimpse at the full and 'final' product
---
* 2) It means we're ridiculously close to a release date.  This game had an atypical development cycle, and so by all accounts the beta should be extremely short.  So if the beta is imminent, then that means the release date should be imminent as well.
---
#RUSSIAN -- TCHAIKOVSKY
---
That's fair, but given the amount of crap that gets lobbed at these guys I think it's somewhat understandable that they adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards it.  It has to be exhausting to wade through that crap.
---
/wave Dunstable here! you’re about 30 mins drive from me.
---
I pretty much enjoy all the classic content creators, including esfand, tips and staysafe who seem to get a lot of shit for no reason.
---
Half their speculation and topics are based on PServers rather than Vanilla. They talk like experts even though most of them never set foot into upper tier raids in vanilla. Basic topics they are fine but when they wax on about the Meta that’s completely based off of either Pserver trash or articles written 13+years ago by someone else, that’s where I have problems with them. 
---
Top that off with lately they have all been doing the same thing which is “hey guys it’s StayTipserron here. Imma read this blue post for the next 10 minutes then give my hot take” when they could give a  summery of what matters and why it matters in the blue post in half the time. 
---
I really feel after we get a release date I will stop following most of them.
---
Its still hard to believe Wrath Babies are now 10 year vets
---
3 charges per. You use it all the time to keep threat up, a feral with MCP is the highest threat generating tank in the game. This means that ultra-competitive guilds could *theoretically* get faster clear speeds with a feral over a prot warr, since the threat cap is higher for warlocks/warriors who can't dump threat. However this requires healers capable of healing through the extra damage that ferals take.
---
Have you been on this sub recently?
---
The thing is - you can.
---
5sec KS/Blind/Gouge -&gt; Sprint - &gt; Preparation -&gt; Sprint -&gt; Leave combat -&gt; Mount up -&gt; /bye
---
I guess that makes sense. However, you’ll have to wait on others to hit 60 to get pre-BiS gear. Do you plan on going mining and blacksmithing and farming mats for gear?
---
It's always funny reading comments like yours, coming from people who clearly have no idea how anything works related to the coding, infrastructure, and general maintenance of a realm / game server.
---
The hate is real lol. Is it jealousy or just straight up anger inside you?
---
I love the spam message in the corner.
---
O\_\_\_\_P wtf is up with his eyes, did he not do some kind of surgery? think they put them back wrong
---
homie how about you scroll down and check if there's any posts about it before making a new one ?
---
Thanks. Really usefull com. Take my karma and leave :*
---
So, in order to compete with people who were paying to have their accounts leveled, I ran a program in the back ground my buddy drew up (some simple key movements randomized and timed) and I would sleep for like 4 hours a night with my volume maxed and any time someone would whisper me or a BG would pop it would wake me up instantly. People would whisper me at all kinds of random times too, to try and catch me afk. 
---
Big shout out to the Chris and Sean for also standing in for queues and BG’s whenever I did have somewhere I had to be. I think even my sister helped with a couple BG’s.
---
Only the wise guys who get their noses broken and not invited to parties would call it a "classic summer" if it's released at the last days of "summer".
---
Dwarf Hunter, EPL
---
11/10 not a bad score
---
The problem is they (mainly tipsout) spread misinformation. They knowingly and artificially make videos longer (10+ min) to cash in on that ad revenue. Videos that take other, more honest content creators (like Kargoz), 3 mins to cover. And then Tipsout shamelessly comes on Reddit and say his videos “seldom reach 10 min” when 75% of his terrible content is well over that mark. 
---
Tipsout reeks of insincerity. It is so transparent, most of the community can see thru it. He’s openly and widely ridiculed on the Warrior discord on a daily basis. 
---
As for Towelliee, I don’t think I need to even make a case for how disgusting he is in every way imaginable. I don’t understand how or why he has an audience at all.
---
Staysafe's reaction to the above video

---
Watching streamers != following one on Twitter for news. Crazy how that works. See you tomorrow.
---
There's a Druid trainer in Stormwind park district.
---
I probably wont level up an alt for a long time either. Theres so much to do after 60. 
---
I'm going to be doing mining / engineering. I'll also be hoping to find some open time up in WPl to farm the crusader formula while nobody else is up there. Maybe get lucky and get a couple. Save them for when they sell for a shit load.
---
ENFP - Alliance - Mage - DPS - PVE
---
Yeah I was messing around when I first logged in... but found it more fun to play on a private server so I didn’t do much of anything but explore a little of the new Azeroth.
---
Edit** all my gear was basically gone. They told me my account was so old they couldn’t retrieve much of anything
---
Some of the hate comes from the fact that they Care more about making a 10 min video, than making some actual good content..
---
The lake with the ghosts in Winterspring. I'd been grinding my ass off for a couple of levels.
---
When it comes to people like Tips, I agree, but Classic WoW also introduced me to some amazing content creators like MadSeasonSow - love watching his vids.
---
Tips irritates me because he falls into a content creator category I like to call "the hypeman no one asked for"; I remember I couldn't watch one of his streams/videos because he kept trying to hype up info that turned out to be nothing - like those video commercials that tell you "The three ingredients you should eliminate from your diet RIGHT NOW!" but then spend the next 15 minutes saying "wait till you see what these ingredients are - it's shocking!" in about 100 different ways and then never reveal those ingredients because they want you to buy their diet book to find out what they are.
---
But why tho ?. From where does this hate and hostility between the streamers and this community come from?. I hear esfand say all the time he gets downvoted and hated on this reddit just because hes a streamer. Same goes for tips etc
---
One thing to mention most pserver "progression" guilds "practice" content in advance of its release, at least thats my experience thus far
---
Thats just level 10 for Bear Form. You can go back and do it then.
---
1. Don't let me see you first. ⚔
---
There's a Druid trainer in Stormwind.
---
Also there is a countdown on a streamer channel. 
---
Why the fuck does Blizz communicate this way? Why do I need to get the information from a fucking streamer? Why can't they publish something on their fucking website officially?
---
INTP-T - Alliance - Warrior - Tank - PvE
---
&gt; Blizzard used to mock Classic WoW too, and now everyone is sucking the classic teams D for their weekly/bi-weekly updates the last couple months and showing eternal gratitude for creating Classic WoW.
---
Ignoring the flood of hate people shove towards blizzard whenever a bluepost comes up. 
---
Using generalizations does nobody any good.
---
Many people's first corpse runs will be at low level. Usually the moment they try to fight 2 mobs unprepared.
---
Towelliee finished his stream saying "Bring your buckets and diapers for tomorrow"
---
Druid trainer in Stormwind, so not a huge issue.
---
Good point. Its like...as if...people can actually change their opinions and views..
---
&gt;content
---
🤔
---
especially Towelliee in this instance. He shat on and advocated against Classic for years, now he's been gifted free money by Blizzard to stream a countdown clock.
---
Gottem
---
I want both.
---
What I want is for there to be new content to learn and defeat without succumbing to the same bullshit that eventually destroyed WoW
---
People have always had biases in this game. Even Fury warrior was considered weak for a long long time, even after Arms got nerfed people insisted DPS warriors must be Arms for months.
---
Now we have a wealth of knowledge. You can make an informed choice. I'm still rolling Druid because I don't need to be the #1 DPS, but I know certain doors will be closed to me.
---
i have been watching them for this reason exactly. its just easy content to watch while i wait for classic
---
INFP-A - Horde - Druid (resto) - PvP
---
"Content creators", or what they should really be called - adults who video tape themselves playing video games for children to watch, - didn't make Classic WoW. No one owes them anything.
---
I have 0 interest in watching these losers *play* the beta. I want to be *in* the beta.
---
&gt; Make a 5 minute Youtube video.
---
Then they can't put a million adds in it
---
Pretty sure there is a few quests to obtain new abilities.
---
Time to avoid wow section for a while until release then.
---
My grandpa would do this.
---
What was your in-game name? Shoji here. I remember Hit List.
---
no real advantages, just go for the one you think looks cooler, imo you should roll NE for that shadowmeld
---
At this point I think the most likely thing is that this is a large case of the whisper game. Creators or sharing information to each other but nobody knows what exactly the original information was. I think, on some level, the streamers are just as much in the dark as we are. Seems as if Towelliee believes that tomorrow will just be an announcement day.
---
&gt; loved the Dun Morogh starting area 
---
Either way, would still be a pain in the ass to walk all the way to Stormwind to train versus the starting area and first town.
---
So are you saying that Nost did not make intentional non-Blizzlike changes to the spawn rate rules for mobs and resources in order to get an acceptable gaming experience out of their non-Blizzlike population caps?
---
Depends what you prefer. Female feels faster to play but male is obviously more brutish.
---
Haha fair enough
---
They could literally wait 2 months from now, announce a release date that's 2 MORE months in the future, and it would still be summer. We've got a lot of time
---
Classic WoW is a different beast. No server transfers or name changes and massive leveling investment means that if a group like that wants to be toxic they are going to be toxic inside their own little bubble. Yes some fan bases are toxic, but in every toxic fanbase I have seen just as many people screwing around with the streamer as the streamer and their following is screwing around with other people. Also, WoW is very large and a group like that might occupy one, maybe two areas at a time. I don't think it is going to completely warp the servers to avoid them if you happen to land on the same server as a streamer.
---
Exactly. People have jobs and need time beforehand to make deals with girlfriends/wives/friends/work to take time off without blowing schedules. I'd rather have them delay it to fall and to have a clear date than summer with no idea when it will launch.
---
Sunstrider EU Represent!
---
Madseason, platinumwow, and Frostadamus are great! Towelliee is a disgrace
---
You have a clip?
---
Warriors can be very tricky as a rogue. To do the best damage through his armor you'll want to use Garrote, Rupture, and Deadly poison, but that messes with your gouges and blinds. Also they can Overpower for big damage. I usually won't fight a warrior.
---
I was kicked and banned from a streamers discord today for making a teeny tiny critical comment. No warning nothing. Instabanned. And, yes. what everyone says is that some of these content creators are just going inn for money and have little to no clue. And make 3 part videos going on hours on a subject that could be covered in 6 minutes
---
Thousand Needles and Silithus hands down (honorable mention runner ups to winter spring and deadwind pass) I love those barren desert wastelands crawling with player life and the few npcs around stick out. They also tend to be great farming and remote pvp areas.
---
1.) Thousand Needles - The giant elevator life entrance is legendary, I feel off and died the first time on my druid. Not even thunder bluff had me prepared for such an abrupt drop since you don't notice such a steep decline. The zone itself is mountainous and beautiful with a unique topography to it .It desert like feel and an array of memorable quests like the infamous"Free at Last" fighting the evil taurens on top of the mesas. The robot moon well mining on the edge of Ferals comes to mind too and the boil lake in the center. The wyvren cliffs and elite panther quests were a tad annoying for the level though. The grand finale and atmospheric grandeur of the zone is compiled in the Shimmering flats race way area on the border to Tanaris. I always level here at level 30 and not just to get the carrot on a stick and Tanaris FP. The quests are great, the mob density to safety ratio is perfect and the quests are fun like scavenging parts and killing all the varied closely scattered mobs.
---
2.) Silithus - Before AQ silithus used to be a barren waste land where you'd know everyone who'd farm the area hung out. While gold farmers would typically compete in tyrs hand in EPL, ungoro, Felwood for tubbers and Dire maul as an instance people would farm Silithus for essence form the vast elementals roaming the area and Rich thorium veins in the underground insect caverns. My friend and I would farm this area ALL the time as a paladin mage combo aoeing down Air elementals in particular. When AQ finally came the zone we called home most of our non raiding hours became the AQ opening event and twilight page farming. A bastion of PvP and world interaction. It didn't hurt there was a neutral moonwell spot with a mailbox at the neutral town for tailors to park. Leveling wise not the most ideal compared to EPL or WS but since you were likely close to 60 and likely finishing ungoro the few leveling quests available it was a great place to turn to for the atmosphere and isolation. When AQ isn't open prepatch it'll still be that quiet farming place for some out of reach of devilsaur cartels where you might see people run by for the thunder fury quest.
---
3.) Winterspring - A frozen desert much like the other 2 barren waste lands but this time with furbolg rep to get the off hand healing item and enchantment rep. The famous winterpring hunter pet icemaw and the isolated PvP zone. People have reason to be here for grinding their last few levels to ding 60 or farming eye of divinity in small groups prepping for MC domo. the atmosphere and people made it great, granted it's a tad more crowded because of engineer everlook portals and the neutral auction house.
---
4.) Deadwind Pass - Prior to Karazan in TBC this is a place most people would hardly ever think about or spend much time going through as it was so small and often just used by horde via STV and alliance via duskwood to travel to swamp of sorrows, blasted lands and beyond. The zone was quiet empty but had this chilling barren tone to it with even a few mobs to grind as a non competitive farming spot and PVP hub due to the narrow bridge that was required by many to pass. It's one of those very small zones you never actively think about but you love the fact such a small location exists. Bonus points for the karazan easter eggs if you can sneak in to find the crypts.
---
You get it w/ the level boost I believe. Someone else commented on it, but I’ve done my research and I’m ready to actually get that amount this time around.

I watch tips out vids, i watch classicast. I have no problem with content creators of any game. But fuck towlie, for hating on the game and on the community and now dick raiding for money
---
Yeah, right, this sub is the proof of the lack of our aduldhood bro.
---
Technically true but games are usually given a release date a LOT sooner than 2 months in advance. Even look at WoWs expansions.
---
You should be scared
---
I'm spitballing here, but I think it's because of a disconnect between this specific community and the more casual community.
---
Most of the folks on this sub are pretty rabid about Classic.  We immediately devour every shred of news we can find and beg for more.  But I think we're probably a minority... lots of folks who will end up playing are probably very casually following the game's development.  They aren't going to go out of their way to read every blue post the second it hits the forums.  So while for us, a 10 minute recap of the post and it's implications is a complete waste of time, for the more casual follower of Classic that recap might be the only way they learn about those blue posts.  Most people probably have no preference at all when it comes to progressive itemization -- hell, I'd bet most people don't even know what that means!  So perhaps it's helpful to them to have someone explain it like that.  The views are certainly coming from somewhere.

The hate for streamers/youtubers I think is largely due to the fact that many people don't understand the simple fact that *they are not the intended audience for that content.*  It would be like if I spent my time on reddit complaining about the most recent Barbie Island Adventure game for the 3DS... sure, maybe my criticism is valid, but that game isn't meant to appeal to me to begin with so it's moot.
---
Vertical is good for most everything that isn't a video or game.
---
Web pages scroll down. Discord scrolls down. Screens are tall enough that vertical they are wide enough to view words and such.
---
good point, i don't actually have an issue with streamers now that i think about it.  on most games they're not an issue at all but for this particular situation it *might* be one
---
i dont really understand why people get so invested in streamers tbh, i dont mind watching a bit now and then to check out a game i might buy or whatever but people who follow religiously and donate loads of money... why!?
---
and indeed the fanclubs are so cancerous i'm sure the streamers themselves probably dont like them - but need to appeal to them since it's their livelihood
---
Negative. He just started the stream maybe 15 minutes ago. It should be within the first 10 minutes. Towliee apparently has a timer on his currently.
---
What do you mean compete for loot? Everything is a hunter item.
---
Been logging into my old account on retail recently, what happened to PvP servers?
---
Dont care about timers or streamers or playing a beta of an already released game that i ve played in the past. I just want to know when i can play the fking game and thats it.
---
I'm genuinely feeling inspired by your dedication, that's so awesome! Looking forward to seeing you in classic m'dude
---
I don't disagree, just saying it as that's the usual way it goes. At least beta keys are no longer a thing thanks to all the scams and if you get invited that's it, if not, unlucky. Don't have to piss about sucking streamer dicks along with thousands of other people to get lucky for a key.
---
Test sharding ?
---
Yeah because they should just spend hours on producing and coming up with content basically out of nothing for free, because we cannot stand to watch 2 commercials.
---
Reddit doesn’t like “tips out baby” because he spreads blatantly false information. Nobody gives a shit if he played vanilla or not. 
---
Towellie is a tool. He use to verbally abuse random people in game and use his viewers to harass people. At one point he was banned for stealing money from viewers through an illegal raffle scam. I guess he cleaned up his act somewhat though, since he’s still streaming now.

Sorry, but this was posted multiple times today and this post adds no new discussion, IMO.
---
&gt;Math is not a matter of opinion.
---
Point out where you provided any math.
---
Answer it.  Maybe they'll tell you when release is...
---
I usually couldn’t give two shits for these kind of posts but this is really nice. I fucking love your wallpapers!
---
Lol this is pretty dumb. There is strong technical merit for a beta. Retail servers operate differently and rely on mechanics like sharding to scale. Classic will have a different model that will likely need to be tested at scale first. Guessing your not in the software biz?
---
EPL, killing a bat IIRC.
---
As the scrolls have foretold...
---
25% stun resist is amazing
---
Where is this countdown?. The streamer summit is a bad idea imo. Why just not drop a bluepost. Why make us wade through all this "follow, like subscribe" bullshit
---
I've healed on multiple classes, servers, and expansions. The time of damage is upon us. Hunter time.
---
He meant that with the season finale episode. Not this week.
---
This is wrong on so many levels I dont even bother to do anything but downvote and write this passiveaggressive comment
---
“9.6/10”
---
- Warcraft.com
---
Play what you think you'll enjoy the most and ignore the meta talk. Almost everyone speaks as if every player you'll encounter is a meta-gamer and that's just simply not true. I kid you not. There are guilds still active today on private servers that wipe in Molten Core. There will be a place for everyone.
---
it's warcry.com haha
---
You want WoW 2.
---
We're not getting that anywhere soon
---
They may not do a full beta, but I imagine they'll want to stress test servers and test the early zone sharding that they plan.
---
This post is laughably wrong.
---
Or maybe they could cut the middle man and just deliver the news to us all directly?
---
I only ever got to level ~30 while playing vanilla, but on Nostalrius I hit 60 just before we got to Balnazzar in Strat. Very memorable.
---
Mistakes were made. I thought, “that’s fucking funny.” :(
---
I'm switching it up to horde this time around.
---
Although Ironforge looks pretty legendary back then so I may have to level an ally on another server.
---
There will be a small beta IMO. They are still using the new Code and infrastructure with retail WoW, but using the old Vanilla DB. Clearly that will cause issues when the source code doesn’t exactly line up with something in the DB.
---
They’ll probably have a short beta (like 2-3 weeks) to fix any last minute problems that weren’t noticed by their employees or testers.
---
[They did a great video about it at Blizzcon](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM) 
---
It wasn’t an easy feat for them to bring Vanilla back....
---
&gt; you can't outmelee him and lack the tools to get distance/kite again/more than once...
---
Dude, hunter's don't lack any of those

You will regret later if you go with a race you dont like but just want the racial
---
Start falling off during AQ40 from what I have read. The crossbow from Chrommagus being BiS till Naxx probably causes that. Then T3 being token drops, and Hunter never being given T3 makes things even worse.
---
Malthos, joined during the second half of BC
---
I believe its a release date getting announced, I don't think they really need to do a beta when their main concern is stability which they can just test in house.
---
How do you attribute a review to Slashdot hahah
---
That's like saying "10/10 - reddit.com"
---
Why is Towelliee suddenly a voice for Classic WoW? He was SO against it a couple of years ago to the point where his viewers were insanely toxic about it and constantly defending retail
---
It's not at all the same. New/different server structure compared to vanilla, modified 8.x client, modified 1.12 data. We're going to play something entirely new and because of that it will have issues that need to be ironed out via beta.
---
Bummer
---
This is extremely wrong. They’ve made a ton of changes to the client which is exactly when you get bugs. Unexpected code interactions etc.
---
Shit your pants too. Just Incase.
---
Why would anyone prepare diapers and energy drinks for a beta where all your progress is lost? Unless I'm just the odd one out that has zero hype/interest for a beta. All of them teasing a beta is not breaking the NDA because there is no beta coming...thing is releasing sooner than expected.
---
Also staysafe saying that taking a day of work tomorrow would be worth it to watch his stream. Who in their right mind would take vacation to watch a streamer play a beta of a game we all already know everything about.
---
Become a content creator
---
Beta has been pretty much confirmed 100% at this point. And it's starting this week. At least for certain streamers.
---
**[LFG][NA-Alliance][PVP Server]**
---
**Availability:** Weekday evenings, PST-friendly hours. I have a full-time job and I have social obligations on the weekends which limit my hours. I'm open to a 2-3 nights a week schedule but I can raid extra days including weekends in progression situations where we're close to getting a clear.
---
**Classes**: I'm open to playing a Druid, a Paladin, Warlock or Hunter. Realistically, I'm probably going to have at least one serious alt for farming or for raid/party flexibility.
---
**Goals:** Long-term friends to do content with, clearing Naxx, and reaching Rank 11 in PVP. Listed in order of importance.
---
**WoW Experience**: Played a Resto/Feral Druid fourteen years ago and made it to the Twin Emperors in AQ40. Continued playing a Druid through TBC and eventually switched to Death Knight in WotLK. Quit playing after Ulduar but came back during Legion briefly.
---
**About me**: I'm a 31 year old office worker that has been playing MMOs ever since I got a PC when I was twelve. While WoW used to be my main MMO, I've mostly been active on FFXIV where I raided at a Hardcore level [clearing content within two weeks of it's release](https://twitter.com/Leuk0s/status/1045582839914225666) and [participating in Speedruns](https://www.fflogs.com/character/id/57684?mode=detailed&amp;zone=21#metric=dps). I got hit hard by burnout and left my raid team and I don't think I can maintain that level of intensity any more.
---
**What to expect from me**: I plan on getting to level 60 within 2-3 weeks depending on the actual release date of Classic and whether or not I can take some time off work. I plan to be self-sufficient in regards to consumables, have fights researched ahead of time, and to show up early before each raid. While Warcraftlogs are not that big of a factor for me, I hope to show improvement from week to week and to finish strong by the end of each raid tier. I don't mind sitting on the bench and farming for consumables if a particular fight doesn't require more of my class/role with the understanding that when it comes to farm content that I'll be considered.
---
**What I expect from your guild**: A willingness to improve and adapt. I don't mind helping out mechanically weaker players so long as they show growth and the ability to self-reflect on mistakes. I don't want to be put in a situation where we're wiping on Baron Geddon because an officer's Significant Other just can't handle Living Bomb and they are unwilling to replace them.
---
On the flip side, I expect Guild Leadership to talk to each member one-on-one when they are struggling to help them out rather than being cold and heartless.
---
I'm open to most loot rules so long as there is a means of addressing concerns about cliquey Loot Councils.
---
And *most importantly*, I expect your guild to be **FUN**. If we're going to be spending a significant amount of time together, I'd like to at least be friends with a lot of you guys. I'd hope that you guys can take a politically incorrect joke while we get blitzed from getting corpse-camped all night between the Thorium Brotherhood flight path and Blackrock Mountain. I want in for the long haul - especially if a TBC server is eventually added.
---
**Contact me**: Either DM me here on Reddit or message me on Discord@ Leukos#7410
---
And I couldn’t be bothered to figure it all out... I’m ready for classic, releasedateplzandthankyou
---
Coming from OSRS judging from the name? I'm doing the same
---
Everything is a hunter item! On private server and one point I had agility leather gear with dodge chance on it only because I wanted to be a tank too (as a joke).
---
I play NE mainly because of the meld and the majority of the people that I ask are going hordes - more kills for me. If I were horde I would go for orc too. There isn't a real difference between both. Meld is helping a lot while leveling or running away, but stunressist is great in PVP. But if you die a lot - go NE, you will get ur body faster :)
---
I'm hoping there is no beta, or a closed beta was already held, and this will be a release date announcement.
---
One can dream ...
---
If they give access to a handful of addon makers too, then I wouldn't mind this. But I doubt that would happen.
---
and I can't stress this enough
---
changes
---
PlatinumWoW is also my personal fave.
---
2019 problems
---
I found engineering to be frustrating and only marginally useful as a druid for just that reason (can't use most items in feral form). It's not as amazing as it is for other classes.
---
My mum didn‘t let me play wow back in 2005 because it included the word „war“. She thought its something like counterstrike
---
It promotes classic. Why  bummed?
---
SW isn't the dwarf/gnome starting zone. Running to IF+Tram to SW is horrendous for training pre-10, like I said, he's gonna have a bad time
---
wuts ur msn addy?
---
Seriously, the autists, spergs, and general idiots need to stop perpetuating shit like this. That's literally the reason.
---
I think for me it would be odd to look up to get to the top of the page
---
That’s pretty awesome because you’ll be excited to start (having experienced the community at its prime) but have fresh experiences other than min-maxing at end game.
---
Haha I was to dumb to figure it out or I might have. So glad I didn’t now.
---
Hi, /u/Golz
---
**&lt;undecided&gt; \[Semi-HC\] \[PVP\] \[A\]**   🇪🇺
---
**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
\- We are an international group of currently 44 people, consisting of various backgrounds. We have both experienced and inexperienced members.
---
\- We are looking to create a mature gaming community where everyone is valued and people support each other.
---
\- We are open to hybrids and off-specs if people are willing to make them work.
---
\- Our goal is to clear all the content (again)
---
\- As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values.
---
**Guild Structure**
---
\- We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
\- Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers.
---
\- Reasoning for all important decisions are to be made public internally and are open for debate.
---
\- Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
\- Loot council, loot is in line with performance and effort
---
\- While full optimization regarding buffs, potion etc. is not required (in early game), people who put in the effort and support others will be rewarded accordingly.
---
**About you**
---
\- No matter if you are an individual or represent a group, we are always glad to hear from you.
---
\- We accept casuals and inexperienced players (and socials), so all you really need is kindness and a good mood. We do not condone toxic behavior.
---
\- We realize that sometimes life takes an unexpected turn, so if you can't be present during raids for some reason, we understand.
---
\- You can be a hybrid without being treated as a second class citizen.
---
\- Hardcore/experienced players are also very welcome
---
For any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to message me here or on discord. (tom#8446)
---
I really don’t think they’d release tomorrow.....
---
Name game on fleek
---
I'm on board with this theory. Not so sure about the semi closed beta part, but makes sense.
---
I'm guessing they wouldn't release classic any sooner than a month after 8.2 initially launches. That way they retain their subs / gain additional subs instead of showing a drop in sub counts.
---
This is just life man.. and it has been for awhile now. It’s low cost of PR/marketing and beneficial to both content creators and Blizzard to do things like this. It’s extremely standard shit, but people like you are losing their minds over it. I can’t understand Boomer takes like this in 2019..
---
&gt;There are content creators that have been grinding their asses off for close to 2 years putting out classic content despite relative small audiences and little to no monetary gain.
---
So why aren’t we supporting these content creators by creating a atmosphere around here they wanna be a part of? It’s not certain content creators this subreddit hates it’s generally all of them, sort by new sometimes tons of people trying to make content and they are met with negativity. 
---
&gt;Then there are content creators that just jumped on the train once this sub and the hype reached a certain treshold.
---
Like who exactly? Staysafetv and Esfand are met with extreme toxicity and we’re around making vanilla content well before this sub even existed.
---
This is the beta version from the CDN, he has had this for weeks. This is the client he has been getting all his screenshots from and people have been datamining off of. He even has streams of him trying to log into it. I am pretty certain anyone *could* download this right now if you knew how to access the CDN.  
---
TLDR: Nothing new, he has shown this in the past.
---
Let me waste my precious sick/vacation days so some guy with no real responsibilities can tell me something for 2+ hours that would take me 5 minutes with my own research
---
Classicwinds just released a video that was pro-mobile version of Classic. What the hell was that?
---
Sorry about that.
---
Speaking for myself a lot of the times it's because these people just become de-facto faces simply due to their audience size. Yes there's absolutely something to be said for their efforts in gaining that audience, but there's also very little accountability for them as far as character/judgement/personality/knowledge/etc. This is not ideal and it can be more than simply being jealous, there are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike content creators as individuals or for what they represent (in certain situations)
---
I guess, maybe.. they think its time for the community alias the content creators on youtube / twitch to announce it ? Because it was always community driven, the whole classic thing and hype ?
---
Forgot the "you think you want it but you dont" ?
---
So my bet is, they want to bring it to the people with the streamers - the community heads if you want. ✌
---
I agree it won’t be the same but even it’s only 1/10 th as fun I have no regrets playing
---
As long as you've been on private servers then yeah not worth. I want to know what people notice about it as far as bugs and changes but otherwise I just want the full release
---
Winterspring on some yeti in a cave
---
private servers mainly osrs related, played some of the new expansion earlier this year like 8months or sumin
---
If by all you mean a few people. MrGM didnt go, Staysafe didnt go, Towelliee didnt go (that I know of).
---
If there were a closed beta, we'd all know about it. People tell their friends even if they're under NDA and word spreads that it exists even if those in it don't publicly say they are. Highly doubtful that a CB is going on right now.
---
This is so wrong that I'm reporting it as a Rule 7 misinformation violation.
---
Rocked unf!  hOt ... plus some math
---
Afraid of a little opposition, SNOWFLAKE?
---
Yeah man FUCK people who started making content once classic was announced they are POSERS!!!!!!! if you didnt spend hundreds of hours for little to no gain you are WORTHLESS and dont deserve any attention. If you jumped up content creation once classic was announced you are nothing but a filthy leech and dont deserve anything!!!+1!!
---
Oh wait no that makes sense and the anti streamer circle jerk is getting to the point where its almost
---
But you have the freedom to simply not watch their videos... Anyone can make any content and stream or upload it.  Why do theirs have to be exactly what you want to see?
---
Even worse is that there are people who started in MoP, are six year veterans, never played the game when it was good, still play the game today and defend it because the quality hasn't dropped that much in their eyes.
---
I watched Asmongold's yesterday stream, he said he was invited but couldn't go.
---
Someone mentioned below it will be added in phase 2
---
Can you provide an example of inside classic information that was given to content creators then was given to the consumer inaccurately?
---
What are the DRs like on this patch in vanilla. Specifically in PvP?
---
It’s Bran so Wrath of the Lich Cripple obviously. :)
---
Right? Where does all the hate come from? Most content creators videos I've seen have been quite decent and entertaining. People really just love to complain and shit on others
---
My sincerest hope is after Naxx - instead of going into Burning crusade... WoW 2 is announced.
---
I knew y'all would get triggered by "content creators".  You know what I mean...that's all that matters.  I'm not here to argue about semantics.
---
Each of those 3 are making great content. They've got a wealth of good videos to watch while we wait too. They deserve the respect they're getting at the minute.
---
I've noticed way more streamer hate on this sub than anywhere else(which I agree with). Do you think it's because we're basically an ancient crowd compared to the crowd streaming normally caters to? 
---
All I think of with wow streamers is some streamer being on my server and fucking up my night
---
Since they all want to be ambiguous with everything (potential hints from streamers, no real info from Blizzard, etc.) , I am just going to assume we are getting either a surprise early release without a public/invite beta or they are going to let us keep our beta characters as a reward for still being wow subscribers. Yep, since they have given us no other information at all regarding a release date or schedule, I will live happily in this reality of possibilities until my dreams are crushed and I switch to believing the July 16th release theory.
---
I want that feeling as well, problem is most of us are adults now so it's a little harder to get lost in our fantasy world this time around. I still plan on playing the shit out of it though.
---
And to the mobile point, I think it looks great to shareholders, but I feel it would ruin most games that have a PC version. OSRS is having great success with it though so it is possible.
---
Fellow ESTP -
---
horde due to friends, would be alliance otherwise
---
Warrior
---
PvE tanking, PvP dps
---
This makes a lot of sense. Like I said, I don’t know these content creators, but they have just as much power to bring in new people as they do to deter them from ever trying out the game.
---
I'm guessing there will be a ptb, and beta will be more for the leveling experience with early end-game. Ptb will probably be used for raiding/endgame content patches like it is for live.
---
If release isn't mid-july they missed their mark.
---
Just my .02
---
They had cross realm servers towards the end I believe? I cant remember when those were released, but people have been talking about it a little bit on this sub.
---
I feel like I have to tell you that a question mark does not have a space before it, nor a period after it.
---
I bet it'll go one further and we'll see the rebirth of sites like Illidrama, server forum 3rd party sites where real shit talking could take place.
---
Troll Priest, hit 60 in EPL, doing quests with a guildie in Plaguewood.
---
Cross realm battlegrounds were the only cross realm in vanilla.
---
I like that guy too. More than Tips, who seems okay as well
---
No idea, but probably not. If there's anything they *may* have, it's the cross-realm BGs that were released in Classic, but those were implemented largely to resolve population discrepancies on select underpopulated servers, so it might not be a technical necessity if they regulate server populations better this time around.
---
You sound extremely butthurt =)
---
Wrath of the Lich Christ
---
Dude tbh vanilla was so long ago that most of my memories of back then are smooshed together anyway, can't really differentiate in My memories of lvling during vanilla and leveling during TBC, I actually don't even remember when cross server play was introduced... 
---
I'm sure other ppl have studied up so I was just curious.
---
oh noe, you had to watch two commercials man? That shit is rough, considering the guy only used several hours to make that video. fuck him, he doesnt deserve the 10 dollars he gets from all those views.
---
What math you exactly need for me to provide? You make absolutely no sense. Math is not a matter of opinion, that is a fact. If you don't know where &amp; how the math used when analysing scaling it is not my job to start educating you.
---
Fuck beta
---
Releases date or riot
---
Beta is confirmed when Blizzard says "There is a beta now."
---
Has Blizzard said anything? No.
---
But here is a proposition: I am saving your post, you do the same, and in a week, one of us gets to post an "I told you so". Deal? :D
---
If you would consider PST and weekend raids hmu.
---
Platinumwow and classicwinds are putting up some serious numbers on YouTube I don’t think they would fit into lesser known. They have phenomenal content and are making 10+ minute videos so the YouTube algorithm is playing nice.
---
&gt; Unless I'm just the odd one out that has zero hype/interest for a beta.
---
I'm kinda with you here.  I mean, I would definitely participate, and I would definitely have fun!  But I'm not foaming at the mouth for it.  The best part about it IMO would be revisiting things like keybindings and such... it's been over 8 years since I played for real and would need to get all my bindings and muscle memory back.
---
And caps were never made more than 4-5k in vanilla - so why ask for more?
---
Why would they drag them all the way out there on Blizzard's dime for that?
---
No thanks.  I’ve waited a long time for classic.  I’m not about to spoil the experience by beta testing some buggy junk.  I’ll wait two extra months for the finished product.
---
Ahhh let them be. Classic will be more fun with some noobs running around.
---
Low effort
---
Me and a couple friends are going to take 2 weeks off work and level together in a group of 4-5. Meeting at lvl 11-12 and decide from that point where we are gon a grind or quest. Might not be optimal as a group, but will be fun as hell and easy !
---
You sound extremely stupid =)
---
Could you elaborate on what you meant? I don't remember being able to join someone's party who's on another server in vanilla
---
Everybody and their mother isn't already?
---
Wow, Towellie truly sounds like a terrible content creator.
---
Yeah that's the thing I really don't expect blizz to just randomly drop the game, but all I'm saying is that the level all this cryptic hype they are all generating doesn't really add up to some closed beta. Possible just a short beta with a sooner than expected release date announcement.
---
Used to love try harding with the mauser, but the M1 Garand on realism was the tits! Calling out ‘whip’ on 1v1s.... spamming lean... miss those days
---
Is it? I figured it was worth sharing the link, as I wasn't sure where to find it without looking it up.
---
Probably because they're under NDA until tomorrow and were told they're fine to tease. Just wait til tomorrow for the straightforward answer
---
Unfortunately, Hellfire Peninsula (human rogue)
---
I started playing literally RIGHT as 1.12 was released, and in that span of the several months of 1.12 before the TBC pre-patch and TBC were released, I only managed to level to high 40's. Come 58 (the level at which you could enter Outlands) I went to Hellfire Peninsula and dinged 60 there.
---
Fellow valley commando reporting!
---
this!
---
It doesn't go to the ceiling. I would say the top of my vertical monitor is 2 inches higher than my horizontal.
---
What’s sad about this?  It’s releasing this summer, and summer is almost here.
---
We won't have to wait a week.
---
I'll go ahead and delete it... /shrug
---
Nothing that wont get caught by in house testing. The underlying mechanics are barely different, and things like Rogue Energy Regen don't need to be retrofitted into the client, they can just be emulated using the modern resource API.
---
reckoning pally.
---
Thank you. Im bad at words 😊
---
Because people from retail will be jumping on and quitting because it's too hard. I don't even mind 4-5k pop. That's what I want it to be. What I don't want is thousands of retail babies getting mad at the deadmines defias npc not spawning quick enough and quitting. 
---
I don't want to play on dying servers. Hell increase the cap to start and lower it down. Fine with me. I want blizzlike but I don't want to ignore that the time period and player base has changed.
---
I've been on a pserver for the past month, 52 mage atm. I've been taking it rather slow and mostly solo, it's my itch scratcher and refresher course/practice. And I haven't really played since Wrath and I bailed 3 months after it came out. What I mostly remember is straight classic and playing the pserver has been such a great reminder of how good it actually was. 
---
I could care less about a beta, like most, and just want that release date. Pserver is fun for now but it's always possible I could lose my char at any point.
---
Hillsbrad and Searing Gorge are my favorite
---
Yes, far from everyone is going to pull it off, especially on classic with lots of old timers returning. I'm just talking about the top end of pvpers and what a duel would look like given the spec in question with engineering and/or pvp items.
---
And yeah a bad rogue will definitely be super kited by a good mage.
---
Hype is the entire point. It's why streamers are classed as "media" when they get early access, because it's free advertising.
---
[Right here.](https://i.imgur.com/ygqNcRM.jpg)
---
All you gotta do is stick your finger into the back of your throat and tickle the little dangly thing a bit, and, boom! Gag reflex!
---
Yeah I hear ya. That would be the only thing we have the potential of getting on classic. There definitely wont be any cross realm raids, dungeons, or anything like that.
---
Did you ever get it? Would you recommend someone who will spend 20-30 hours a week playing to go for it?
---
to show them alpha stuff and get feedback.  they didnt have to drag them out there to tell them beta date either
---
imagine watching someone else play a video game when you could have spent that time playing it yourself
---
You couldnt join a players group on another server. If you played alone or in smaller groups your group would automatically be put together with some other players from other servers in the same battle geoup.
---
You predict that release is tomorrow?  That would be something.
---
and the rest of your life must be looking sad
---
Classic Release won't be nearly as big ans any of the Retail launches they have done so far. I don't think they need to do much testing there. A simple load sim would probably suffice.
---
Because im dying to play sooner than that :(
---

---
Summer runs until the end of September. Just saying...
---
Yo, as someone who has never played WoW, is it worth it to start playing the classic version?
---
I know im asking the classicwow subreddit, so Im not expecting no as an answer.
---
I played the fuck out of 2007scape until they falsely permabanned me, so Ive been in the market for a new MMORPG to sink some time into.
---
I mean you were right about the child-like enthusiasm, but he was never actually skilled, and definitely was (last I watched years ago before chair streams became too annoying) insufferable. Has he changed since?
---
What's up with the black war mounts. You just have to get the rank right?
---
You couldn't party up with someone from another realm like you can in modern wow, but your team (made up of people from your faction from your server) could be matched up against a team from a different server. It was added to reduce queue times and help out servers with faction imbalance.
---
Fractures the community. Personally, I like discord as a VoIP program, but have 0 reason to use it for anything other than voice comms. Forums are also more readable. At a glance you can see what something is about and know all the discussion inside will (in theory) be centered around that particular topic. You can say that's what channels are for but that's still too broad and unfocused. I just dont get the whole discord craze. It's a fantastic VoIP program that has all the best elements of the other big ones, but that's all I can see it as, is a VoIP, it's just the Vent/TS3/Mumble that people are using for now.
---
PM me for info please
---
I agree. While it is lawyerly correct to come in September... I think early August is the best they can do without folks being upset. Emotions don't care about technicalities. :D
---
Ssssshh, don't give the corporate guys in Activision ideas...
---
Killing boars in Elwin Forest
---
I'd like vanilla again but changes to some awful elements. For example make feral scale with weapon attack so bis isn't a gnomeregan drop with charges that you need to farm every week. Maybe balance dps a bit so some classes don't deal 2+ times the damage of another.
---
Yeti Cave
---
If you look at the post from yesterday about all the stuff that was removed from the client it’s dizzying how much stuff it is. It’s silly to think there wouldn’t be a significant amount of bugs introduced by making that many changes. Especially since some wow devs have talked publicly about how the game is spaghetti code.
---
Zug zug.
---
Imagine that
---
Cross realm grouping was introduced in patch 4.0 the cataclysm expansion. 
---
Vanilla did have cross server battlegrounds in patch 1.10 I believe to help combat low pop servers and heavy faction imbalance servers. 
---
And vanilla had sharding too kalimdor and eastern kingdoms were separate shards.  Classic will not have “phasing” or “cross server play/grouping”
---
The primary purpose of a beta would be to see how they handle server stress etc.  there is no chance they have a media/streamer only beta.
---
whats up with the hate for tips? Isnt this sub what made him 'big' in the first place?
---
If you plan well it doesn't cost much at all. As an alch I could easily make as many major mana pots as I needed. 300 fishing allows you to just fish for your mp5 food, a little tedious sure, but costs you nothing. Dark runes are annoying (forgot about them), but if you are running scholo where they are prio to you (the healer) then you can get about 4 per run. If your guild is asking you to pop distilled wisdom flasks then they are clueless. It is never needed. Not even hardcore guilds running naxx ask their healers to all pop distilled wisdom. Compare this to tanks/casters/melee dps where you are flasking through progression and burn through consumes with every wipe. Trust me, healing is the cheapest thing you can do.
---
It means you join a guild and attend the raid at the scheduled times.  Find a guild that suits your availability and is ok with a feral tank.
---
What happened?
---
Devon here too! Nice to see a fellow South-Wester!
---
Yeah. It’s odd that these content creators would binge a game that they’ve played multiple times now and everything they work for will be wiped. I can totally understand them saying “I’ll have a longer than usual stream” but not I’m binging 24 hours....on a beta?
---
I mean, I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard just drops it and walks away like “have a classic summer.” At the end of the day this is a B-level game for them....they’re not looking at hyping the shit out of it.
---
The more I think about it the more I believe tomorrow is the end of the NDA and those that were part of the Alpha/Beta will be free to share video's and media associated with it as well as information about the release date coming from Blizzard around the same time.
---
Loot council if done fairly, theres so little loot droping that you dont want that guy that wont show up again to get someones BiS
---
Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad.
---
Just get ready for your youtube inbox to be full of "this level 6 quest wants 300 boar assholes!!! How to get ahead of the pack and collect your green boots first!
---
What blatantly false information has Tips spread? He seems like he would be open to correcting himself if he was wrong. I have seen this trumpeted a lot with no examples.
---
What's wrong with mobile Classic WoW? I would love that! Old School Runescape was launched on mobile. People love it.
---
Only cross-server play was with battleground groups, where multiple servers shared common battlegrounds. You couldn't group with people form other servers, you'd just end up in a battleground with people from different servers.
---
I remember when the server Death and Taxes was added to our battleground lol. First time that warrior put me down with corrupted ashbringer was awesome.
---
Ever.
---
It's just that he was the first one to politely explain the reason for the general dislike for Tipsout. Even after that comment you kept going on replying every single negative comment claiming jealousy and blatant hatred, when it's plain not. Just stop for a second and read the comment.
---
A rocky launch is part of the classic WoW experience!
---
&gt; They are still using the new Code
---
Sorry to break this to you, but they were lying in that video about the part with having to change the code :-)
---
I have integrated legacy software into new systems myself. The thing you do, when the client wants old behavior on a new platform, you don't change the platform, **you EMULATE the behavior using the platforms existing facilities.**
---
Vanilla Rogue Energy regenerates in chunks. Need to change the code governing resources? No. The game has an API that allows resource generation in chunks...like in certain Vehicles. So, what do we do? We bind rogue energy bar to a configurable vehicle resource generator function and call it Energy. There, problem solved with existing facilities, no need to get down in the entrails of the engine.
---
Changing the platform is a MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. It's time consuming, always carries the risk of introducing bugs, and quickly leads to spaghetti code. Avoiding to do that is not even considered shoddy craftmanship, it's common sense among Devs =)

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
Looking For: 
---
    Damage:
---
     -  Hunter
---
     -  Warlock
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Rogue
---
    Healing:
---
     -  Priest
---
     -  Paladin
---
     -  Druid
---
    Tanking:
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be.
---
Raid Schedule 
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining, or learning more about the guild, use the following two links to view our website or join our discord. Please feel free to speak with myself through PM's if you have any questions. When you are ready to commit to the guild, please submit an application on our website.

My favorite system is anything point-based (DKP, EPGP, etc) but with Loot Council oversight.
---
Let the points determine loot 95% of the time.  But every once in a while, maybe there's a scenario in which an item that's a 5% upgrade for me might be a 30% upgrade for someone else -- in that situation, the LC could step in and help guide the upgrades for the good of the guild.  Most people are understanding of situations like this, I think.  As long as the LC overrules the point spend sparingly and the whole guild is on the same page, I think you can get the best of both worlds here.
---
Just do a +1. Every item is /rolled on. If you get an item you get a “+1”. Any one with +1 can’t roll on an item unless no +0 players want it.
---

---
My first 60 ding was in the Western Plaguelands doing The Scourge Cauldrons quest.
---
I'd just center that on my desktop and set the background color to match the oceans
---
who gives a fuck about streamers? let them play circle jerking each other in one realm to contain them
---
“We don’t negotiate with horde terrorists”
---
Skinning for sure, mining or herbalism if you don't mind farming those skill lvls for the new zone, that time is worth it if you plan on using the mats.
---
skinning is enough to get you through leveling and 40 mount i think

because he's a known shill. gotta keep those blizzbenefits!
---
They are. Tomorrow.
---
You clearly don't know how business works. This is marketing and it's working. It's being talked about. It gets classic WoW in the news for two days instead of one.
---
You dont immediately just make a blue post once you learn the details.
---
Tanaris was the closest to STV, so much ganking went on there. It was hell to level when you kept getting ganked by Orc Hunters or Undead Rogues...
---
I mean, there are pros and cons to the whole thing, but i'd rather have a big start with a populated WoW again. I think that alone would keep people playing.
---
Towellie is an Omega level Cucklord, if you watched him back in the day you'd understand why, and I can understand why content creators get hate about hyping classic and pretending to be classic experts when their only experience is private servers.
---
Tips seems like a cool enough guy, but he's a tourist, he's not gonna get respect from OG vanilla players.
---
Esfand is a twat though, he's going to have his guild carry his sub-optimal Ret ass while doing embarrassing amounts of dps. But hey if thats what his viewers want to do, more power to him, I guess?
---
You mean the system that is currently active and functional on every single live server? :D
---
My first character was Alliance, but I played Horde.
---
Thorium Point... *shudder*. Ironically, the most dangerous place in SG is the town, and the safest place is the underground lava slave dungeon.
---
I did this mostly in TBC, but as a former Undead Rogue, the Mage Tower in Stormwind.  Often times you could kill people as they zoned in before they had even finished loading all the way, and guards couldn't spawn in the room.
---
AUBERDINE
---
Would actually be sick if you could log in on mobile, ez cooldown crafts on crafting alts
---
Point is a lot of the "content" they make is useless. Ultimately, I think its on the consumer to recognize brands that don't create worthwhile goods and avoid them accordingly. So while they're free to keep pumping out this re-hashed content, I think in the long run they're only damaging their reputations.
---
You look at it at a very wierd angle. You make it sound like all items added later on were "fixes" and improvements of the generall game and  balance - that is very much not the case. Its true in some specefic regards - but not overall:  
---
1. **Catch-up:** A good number of the items added later in the game were ment as catch-up gear for people dinging 60 much later. For example - around patch 1.10 you can get good enough gear through dungeos to basicly start raiding BWL straight away - not having to slave through MC at this stage of the game. Same goes for alts that start to rise in levels around this time. 
---
2. **Re-playability:** By adding items in laters stages - even to MC - the content you have already "completed" suddenly offers new items - sometimes of very great value. If this was attentionally done or not by Blizz I have no ide - but personally i think its brilliant in comparison to todays mindset of just adding new and new content. I remember having to revisit several dungeons even with AQ gear - because of the release of relics in for example Scholo. Dungeons I rarerly had any reasons to do since farming pre-raid gear.
---
When it comes to "no tanking gear" for Druids, you would be suprized how creative the classic druid community are in figguring out all sorts of workarounds to be able to utilize all specs at all stages of vanilla. Same goes for paladins (who btw - should not steal warrior gear if they want to tank, thats "old" beliefs. Protpaladins nowadays goes for alot of spellpower and other stuff for tanking).
---
&gt;Guessing your not in the software biz?
---
You should read more of my posts :D
---
I did. And yes for sure go for it mate, if that's what you want... It's definitely do-able. Here is a link to the reddit discussion (there's also a power guide on it): [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bjgoy1/anyone\_plan\_on\_grinding\_the\_winterspring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bjgoy1/anyone_plan_on_grinding_the_winterspring/)
---
Oh lawdy thanks for this info
---
So basically you botted.
---
you sound extremely reported for breaking the /r rules :D
---
Silithus - dinged 60 on an earth elemental
---
I'd love some info on purchasing a few of these!!
---
So you don’t get a piece of gear as a hunter until all the other non-cloth DPS classes have it?
---
No system is perfect, and even within a particular system there are changes you might need to make.  I've tried all of these before and had both success and drama with both.  Take a look and pick out what sounds good for your guild.
---
DKP is a relatively fair system, but do you have variable or fixed prices?  What if one class decided ahead of time who is going to "win" their set pieces? With fixed prices, how do you determine who gets the item?  Are points earned per boss, per night, per hours spent, per "progression" vs "farm", or per EPGP, or something else?
---
Suicide Council seems to work, but if you only make one "bucket" you tend to get people forgoing upgrades to stay on top for that  one thing they really want (legendaries, mounts, quest starters, etc).  How many buckets should you use?  You can't simply go with armor class, because there are plenty of instances of mixing and matching in vanilla.  You could make tons and tons of buckets, but then it gets convoluted and confusing.
---
And then there is loot council, i.e. the raid officers decide who gets loot (its tracked, so they try to be "fair").  This seems to work for progression in guilds with a consistent structure and roster.  It work less well when you can't 100% fill your raid slots from your own guild.
---
Swifty may not be skilled now, but he was skilled in Vanilla. He is a pioneer of Warrior gameplay. Swifty's Incredible Warrior Tricks will always be a part of WoW history and if there was a "Warrior Hall of Fame" He would be in despite not being good now.
---
I hit a brick wall around 40-45. Not even because the game gets too sloggy, but because I get distracted by all the WPVP. Tanaris can be a bit much sometimes though, there’s always ahenanagins near Gadgetzan.
---
3sec instant pyro mage
---
Towelliee is just a terrible human being. Watch his stream for 2 minutes and see for yourself. Most people here hate him because he relentlessly bashed classic WoW until BFA turned out to be garbage and Classic started to gain momentum. He then changed his tune quick and now loves classic all of the sudden.
---
Yes more people to gank in PvP 8-)
---
I just was so burned out after I don’t think I played seriously again until TBC.
---
No. You’re not thinking straight. They would have to alter the game so much to make it fit in a mobile version. The amount of spells alone would be too much for the mobile version.
---
You’d be playing a very dumbed down version of classic and that can greatly impact the rest of the player base as you’re grouping with them.
---
&gt;So yes, there will be beta for 3-4 weeks minimum
---
Okay, same proposition as to the other 2 guys goes to you:  
---
I save your post, you save mine.  
---
In a few weeks, one of us gets to write an "I told you so".
---
Deal? :D
---
The thing is about rogues in classic, in a  1v1 scenario... it’s pretty skill based. And like others mentioned, depends on the rogue’s talent tree (tons of variation for PvP). If your reason behind asking this question is something along the lines of, “I hate fighting against rogues” for X reason... your best way to combat rogues (or any class) is to master whatever class you choose. With enough in-game knowledge and practice you can counter rogues using any class.
---
Silithus.
---
It's a deal then.
---
Hat's off to you for being a sport =)
---
Yeah OSRS is point and click game. WoW, not so much. WoW would be very user unfriendly on mobile.
---
Feels like a bit of an exaggeration...
---
In Cenerian Hold, in Silithus, you can find a couple gaps where the guards and patrols don’t reach you. So you can load up your ZG trink, Arcane Power, PoM, and 3 second 3-shot people. It’s pretty fun, but makes you feel bad.

---
Oh, so you want changes when it suits you and your misconceptions about how the game will be? Got it.
---
I would be lol’ing if it’s not actually the beta, but the actual game. Watch this fucking sub melt with “I’M NOT READY!”
---
I REALLY DOUBT that will happen, but would be laughing my ass off.
---
wrath of the liking classic
---
this would be fine with me. at least its new info from somewhat trusted sources
---
If you didn't ding 60 in Winterspring, did you really even ding?
---
I played 16 hour days but yeah I guess you could call that botting
---
To be honest, people are jealous of the few people who make a living playing video games all day. 
---
It spews out all sorts of ways, but being incredulous that “we” have to work while they get to do our hobby all day and get paid for it is certainly there.
---
Unfortunately, most streamers have never worked a real job, regardless. Being a streamer with a couple thousand viewers a night is akin to having won the lottery. But a lot of them fail to realize how good they have it and find reasons to complain and beg on stream.
---
Streamers already played the demo in Westfall, as did anyone else who wanted to. It wouldnt be worth a streamers time to lose multiple days of stream revenue for something so insignificant.
---
Look at any competitive streamer. They leave for a tournament for the weekend and lose hundreds of subs everytime. It's gotta be a good reason to leave the den.
---
Arm's is actually really weak to a really good rogue.
---
They can deadzone you - leaving you unable to attack them / intercept them while they dart in, stun, attack, and back out - constantly inbetween melee range and intercept range.
---
Thanks you too! Super excited to play again! I’ve been inspired by everyone on here and their setups, account revivals, ect! See you in classic!
---
Yeah and tbh I'm fine with that. The one downside of vanilla was having friends on other servers u couldn't play with :(
---
&lt;Sorry&gt; | NA | PvP | Alliance | EST/CST
---
On behalf of all guild members, I would just like to say to the horde, we're sorry... Sorry... is a group of close friends and family. We have all experienced Classic WoW, and are excited to have it back. We appreciate a good community, and are looking for players we can get to know and trust. With any MMO we understand max level is just the beginning, but RL is more important to us this time around. With that in mind, we still want to experience ALL aspects from this great game.
---
Goal:
---
Sorry is looking to form a tight group of players before the launch.  We really want to get some fun premade BGs going, but know we will need PvE gear to excel in PvP. Therefore, we expect to run many preraid dungeons to acquire everything we need for raids. We are determined to see all content Classic has to offer - we'll do what it takes!
---
Raid Times:
---
TBD
---
Classes Needed:
---
We are taking anyone interested at this time!

Ashenvale was always glorious
---
I don't agree. Click to move for movement, swiping for camera movement, tapping on the skillbar to use skills.
---
Is it too much for PC? No? Then the same Skillbar isnt too much for mobile either.
---
If you want to get real creative you could have a second toolbar at the top of the screen.
---
Modern big-company betas are for marketing purposes. Everyone  being smug in this thread can eat it
---
imagine not having 2 monitors and doing both
---
That would be an interesting strategy. 
---
A lot of people want to take time off during the initial rush, but blizzard hates that as it adds a ridiculous amount of stress to the servers.
---
If they launched out of the blue people might be a littl pissed, but who can really complain about a surprise launch?
---
yea i watched some duels last night and rogue won 90% but the guy was good
---
INTJ - Alliance - Hunter - DPS - PvE Focus
---
&gt; It’s pretty fun, **but makes you feel bad.**
---
Oh, bless your heart...
---
Then you faced shit rogues.  They could deadzone warriors - keeping in between your melee range and intercept range while you had crippling poison on you.  
---
They'd come in and stun do some damage and back out right before stun wore off.  Constantly staying just out of reach.
---
Multiple monitor setups are fantastic because they enable multi-tasking with full screen applications without having to alt tab.
---
A couple use scenarios where they shine;
---
- gaming, need to look up a location. Throw it on the side monitor and you can glance over at any time.
---
- emails, need to respond to something? Throw the email on one screen to refer to and work through it on the other.
---
- spreadsheets, want to look something up? Again, side monitor and you can refer to it at any time.
---
- monitoring info, need to keep an eye on your email inbox or some live data? Throw that on a monitor and forget about it. Need to see who’s in your Discord channel? Sure you could use an overlay, or *you could just put the entire application on a monitor and check it at any time*. 
---
Basically multiple monitor setups let you go a lot further before you have to alt-tab; and that significantly helps with maintaining a state of flow. Work, play, whatever- I’d highly encourage at least trying it. 
---
I think in terms of user experience improvements, I tend to go:
---
1) Dual monitor
---
2) SSD
---
3) Having an ergonomic setup
---
Stop giving these tools free clicks
---
And guess what, im using that freedom right now. To answer both of you guys, its not about them earning some money for creating content or making specific content i like or not. The problem lies in 90% of the content of the video could be cut out without missing any information. They are wasting ALOT of viewers time and ultimately making their content worse, but trying to reach the 10 min mark together with releasing multiple vidoes each week of a 15 year old game, in their desperate search for the quest of living from youtube. Id rather have the cashier read up my receipt of every item i bought, than listening to 10 min of how to craft linen cloth bandages.
---
Right right, that makes sense and that's what I thought but was jw.
---
Kinda sucks if a real life buddy doesnt choose the same realm as you though , would be nice to at least be able to do BGs with them eventually
---
imagine wasting a monitor on a streamer
---
On a certain private server that shall not be named, I had a blast engaging in some WPvP in Desolace. Specifically in that Kodo graveyard area.
---
I haven't see it happen first hand in Classic WoW, but I've seen it happen enough with other games.  There's no benefit to the players for information to come from content creators instead of the game developer.
---
I'd actually love the sub-to-play idea for beta. Makes Blizz money and guarantees your access.
---
But considering we know for a fact there is a friends+family pool, that likely means it's going to be invite only whether by F&amp;F or getting your account flagged by random.
---
I actually built a new gaming rig, but I'm not updating my pc specs on battlenet because I think I'm slightly more likely to get in with a worse build than one with a really good build. (RNG is still RNG, but I still feel like they want to test min specs)
---
Back in vanilla winterspring now in classic i will see.
---
Eh, MoP was the last time the game was still at least "pretty good". WoD onwards, however...
---
Because it gets all the little sheep and twitch suckers hyped and engaged in their product, without spending more than a few thousand dollars to bus in a load of internet "personalities", have them watch a presentation and feed them a cold salmon sandwich.
---
In the world of Marketing, that doesn't even register as an amount of money.
---
FYI I hope you're right cus I want to play meow. Full launch tomorrow? Yes please

 **ESTP-A** \- Horde - Shaman - DPS - BOTH
---
Are you the type of guy that hears a setup to a joke then before the punchline interrupts and says “Now hold up, jus’ a minute. Why’s a priest a rabbi an a imam goin’ into a bar? The Muslims don’t drink”
---
Towellie's audience is comprised mostly of very angry 30-something neckbeards, all that toxicity had to go somewhere.
---
What kind of barbaric healthcare system does that to its people? Where do you live, poor soul?
---
They need to give enough notice so that we can all put in our vacation time requests.
---
Oh yeah, fun memories of sneaking into hymnal. And they had that construction blockade at the top
---
**&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail.  We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured.  To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization.  We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience.  Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS.  In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended.  In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks.  Please refer to the Charter at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this.  We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience.  Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
Tuesdays:  6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays:  6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule.  With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as as non-raiding member.  Such positions remain selective and are held to the same member expectations as everyone else.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at [celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter.  The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading.  May you find your perfect guild!
---
Who are they angry at?
---
So do they plan to have battle groups again? I would assume yes but I ask cuz idk
---
Please don't
---
pretty sure both my 60s were in EPL somewhere.
---
A while back I looked into mohaa and they actually have a mohaarevival website with a client you can download and play! I just wish I could find all my old buddies who I used to play with,. They’re the same ones I started wow with. Went to college lost connection and 13 years later I’m still wondering about them.
---
I miss the reputation and community games had. Which is why we are here isn’t it =) waiting “patiently” to play a 15 year old game
---
Lol take off work to watch me play beta.
---
For real, it better be the damn game release or open beta for everyone. I’m not watching a fucking streamer play a game that I played 14 years ago....
---
As someone who works in software dev, you are way off the mark here. Making alterations of this scale to codebase is going to cause bugs. Not everything gets caught in in house testing, and the purpose of a beta is to test something with actual end users to eliminate bugs and often in blizzards case, to stress test servers.
---
Hey me too! I bet we crossed claws/paws a few times. Spent ages in Desolace, just having fun with PvP.
---
ESTP A here.   
---
Horde, because of shamans, but still long for alliance.  
---
Shaman  
---
PvP Dps, PVe Healing
---
My argument against this is always that adults can take sick/vacation time whenever they please. I'd PREFER to spend time in the sun than have to choose between Classic WoW and that.
---
For kids, sure, summer is important because that's your scheduled 2-3 months off. But Classic WoW's target audience is adults. Although I still want it ASAP, I wouldn't hate it being late August/early September, cloudy outside and not feeling obligated to soak up some sun. Sometimes the gaming guilt with awesome weather outside is real.
---
&gt; What is your approach on classes for classic?
---
I'll still play the combo I want to play, not the one a spreadsheet tells me to. The differences are not make-or-break for any single character. Will raids refuse you if you haven't rolled Dorf as priest? Only if they're already full on priests (which means they already have the 2,3 Dorfs most raids are shooting for), in which case they would refuse you either way. One single FW every three minutes will not make or break the raid, because there are other mechanics to counter it - it's just an easy fix. Horde does it completely without FW.
---
So, I'll play what I bloody well please, because I play for enjoyment. If that means rolling a Dorf Rogue, or a Troll one, those will be my characters, even if a spreadsheet throws a conniption over it.
---
Most streamers will pick a random server and pop up because streamers know that their gameplay will be messed up severely too. All in all, I understand not being on a streamer server cause then the server will be built around one or so people.
---
&gt; I mean, I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard just drops it and walks away like “have a classic summer.” At the end of the day this is a B-level game for them....they’re not looking at hyping the shit out of it.
---
Exactly! Also from Blizz perspective of taking so long to announce a release date, and potential of people sperging out about needing to setup vacation days... Blizz knows that classic is fueled by die hard vanilla fans that are going to hop on the game no matter when it is released. If they just drop it randomly there will be some backlash from the people who didn't get to setup their vacation but for Blizz there is no effect whatsoever on the end number of subs. All the marketing Blizz needs is from streamers to showcase how good vanilla actually is, a shitton of twitch viewers + small marketing to public is all they really need.
---
I love all the people saying "they stretch their videos to 10 minutes because they are money hungry"
---
I don't follow them or any of the drama with them but wanting to earn money from the thing you enjoy is in no way wrong.
---
If any of you watched YouTube you would know that basically anyone making YouTube videos makes them 10 minutes long. It's not just because of money. If your video is not 10 minutes long with extra ads YouTube does not promote your videos. It's literally needed if you want success of any kind on YouTube.
---
Plus they can't be making that much money in the first place. I'm surprised they don't have to work a second job.
---
MT1 gets first pick, MT2 gets second pick. Loot council decides the rest, keeping seperate listings for weapons and armor, since weapons are rarer comparatively (no boss had more weapons on his drop table than possible armor pieces). MT1 gets first binding, second occurrence of the same binding goes to a rogue, third to MT2.
---
Edit: freakin autocorrect
---
Loving the Lord of the Rings frames 👍
---
pretty much confirmed at this point. every single streamer and some other influencers can barely stop themselves from leaking it
---
Towelliee seems to think tomorrow is just an announcement. To say the least, this is all just confusing and stupid. Childish tactics by Blizzard to get free publicity. UGH
---
I was an Orc Hunter with Lupos so I attracted the ire of all Alliance players.
---
I really dislike tipsout and most of the classic you tubers
---
This is misguided just cause I don't suck Classics pee pee doesn't mean I wouldn't play it.  Go ahead say I'm doing it for the money.  lol.  Yeah I will be buried in Classic channel under 30 top variety streamers I am definitely doing it for the money. If I was doing it for the money I would corner myself as the only retail streamer and inherit all those who want to watch retail.  It is easy 1 + 1 shit in streaming.  Plus my gf is very pro classic she wants to play too.   It was honestly me talking to tips and staysafe at Blizzcon that convinced me to play it.  Before that I was only gonna try it out.  Don't get me wrong I am retail first but I will go hard for as long as I can.
---
What blows my mind is how people call me out but I actually played all of Vanilla. I can show my general 60 achievement at least and have 2 videos on my YT of me in Vanilla.  But I guess I bought my account in TBC predicting that I would need it for this very reason. But I don't deserve to play it cause RETAIL SHILL LUL LUL
---
/incoming downvotes
---
/incoming guy with psych evaluation of me
---
/defensive
---
sorry but i disagree. even if its not a full beta it makes sense to want to stress test servers etc.
---
The daily friend simulator drama thread. Maybe mods could do something about this spam?
---
What? I was soooo excited for bfa. I stoped playing during cata and didn‘t like the themes of the next expansions (except of legion but I didn‘t have time to play it). When I first saw the cinematic for bfa I was like „yeah this is the good shit! Bring back the old vanilla theme horde vs alliance“. We all know how it turned out but yeah the hype was there
---
Why would anyone watch ALL the streamers just for an announcement? That doesn't make sense.
---
Clearly, atleast streamers are getting access to a version of the game. The only question is if it's friends and family (+ streamer) beta or an actual closed beta.
---
WotLK was arguably still in the past when leveling characters.
---
Towelie is fake as fuck. Bashing classing fans, now he monetizing it. Pathetic
---
Stop posting nonsense. Rogue vs Frost mage is one of the most balanced matchups. That‘s why RvM is the best duel to play and to watch, it all comes down to who is the better player. 
---
Source: Played BiS mage and BiS rogue, regularly played with and against top 1.12 players (perp, greatwizard, yolam...)
---
Which Ikea tabletop / kitchentop is that /u/Mr-Vain ?
---
What should I take away from this
---
It‘s not a counter, it‘s actually a fairly balanced matchup.
---
Sorry, but I don't see much of a difference between a "15  things to expect with classic!" Video from tips versus one from madseason or Frost. All of this content is the same, and they all get the occasional information wrong. It seems stupid and arbitrary how much this sub nitpicks content creators, glorifying some and shitting on others. They're just dudes taking about something they love. They all essential fulfill the same role: to get people hyped about classic.
---
I had the exact same problem. Decided to go NE because of meld and I never leveled an Alliance char to 60 back then. 
---
Hunter is the easiest class to level. If your decision feels wrong after a while you can still swap without losing too much time.
---
Women, men ("chads"), people with good paying jobs, the world, the government, I'm sure there's more.
---
In all the years I've never played one. How are they in vanilla in terms of not end game. How are they grinding? Questing? Exploring? World pvp? Grinding for mats?
---
Found the fanboy
---
What on earth are you crafting that takes 10mins ?
---
Same, now would it be crazy if we had the same name?
---
I'm jealous you have this. I lost all my vanilla screenshots with a hard drive crash sometime in 2005. It had screenshots that went all the way back 4 months into beta, so it was especially crippling! I remember taking a screenshot exactly like that both in Beta (played a Dwarf Warrior named Flimflam) and in retail, a Troll Mage named Flimflam. I was *this* close to playing alliance, but my RL friends I was playing with basically already picked our server and faction. Haha. Honestly I fell in love with the music and scenery of Dun Morogh... Almost...
---
But I don't regret going horde.
---
Skinning / Mining. Save the ore, sell the leather. When you get to 60, drop skinning pick up engineering and keep Engineering / Mining.
---
Your'e welcome
---
The classic forums may be cool after several months but at launch its gonna be a shitshow of retail people flooding classic expecting the classic experience day one. The forums may be a bit toxic until all of those who aren't really a fan of classic wow and culture leave
---
Burning Steppes grinding on humanoids
---
People waiting for this game are bursting at the seams, man.   Some people are afraid that streamers will negatively impact server populations and cause problems for the in-game economies.  If they feel that way, then i respect that, but i agree that some people need to chill and let things happen.  If blizz does something wrong, i have faith theyll make it right.  Weve made it this far.  We thought classic would never happen.
---
Some of you guys are on some acid or some shit.
---
Collectors Edition for Classic WoW? My dude, they aren't physically releasing Classic WoW.. And there is no actual purchase made of Classic WoW so there is no digital CE either. The only requirement to play Classic WoW is to have a WoW subscription, and that allows you to play Classic WoW and retail at once.
---
The mages in my guild in vanilla ran a DKP fixing scheme where they did just that - pre determined winners of set pieces to inflate their dkp for bidding on cross-class items. Was hilarious when they were exposed - although it was very dramatic and led to the mage class leader getting gkicked..
---
Not sure, just put it up for those who may be interested. I do find it interesting that hes laughing, whats so funny, lol
---
You haven’t even been alive long enough to have played vanilla, kiddo. What a cringe comment.
---
Well you can call me what you want, I do enjoy almost all classic content creators. They all seem like quite decent people, and the content is okay too.
---
Is that true about the guys from Classic Cast being, let’s say, unsavory towards Countdown to Classic? I’ve always kinda wondered why there hasn’t been any crossover between to two shows. Countdown, IMO, is far far better. Ultimately their goals seemed aligned, promote and discuss Classic in hopes that it can be the best game possible. Are you able to elaborate on their lack of a relationship, just curious?
---
Hate this chair so much, sold it for $60. $240 down the drain.
---
I once woke up, put a pot pie in the oven at 2AM for reasons and then fell asleep. In the morning there was this tiny black pot pie about 2/3 the size of the dish in the over. I am surprised it didn't set off the smoke detector.
---
Guy that makes money from Classic says he doesn't do it for the money.  We're in the end game now folks.
---
One craft can takes up to 1min
---
This right here. Tons of work go into a video. Getting it to hit that 10 minute mark can triple what it makes money wise. Most people don't understand the 10 minute thing. 10 minutes is when the ability to have more than one ad is activated. I'm a smaller-time youtube creator but the 10 minute mark means my 20hrs of editing gets me $100 instead of $50 and that's huge.
---
I agree stretching to hit that mark is a little shady, but you can stop watching at anytime.
---
MoP had some pretty good class design.
---
Or maybe that's how I remember it because WoD fucked classes so hard, hardcore mains were being rerolled.
---
I mean, shock value alone would be a genius marketing move. Think about this sub, WoW, forums, etc. just being like....Classic was just released today....with no heads up! EVERYONE GET INTO AZEROTH NOW! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! 
---
With this day and age, I understand marketing and the such....but this is a 14 year old game. They know who they need to market to and frankly know we’ll jump at a moments notice.
---
Dont watch it. Problem solved.
---
Speculation: Blizzard is dropping the ACTUAL classic, not just beta
---
It’s the greatest MMO ever made. That isn’t just fanboy, no other MMO ever came close to the player numbers, including modern WoW.
---
A big part of the appeal is a nostalgia trip, but it’s genuinely good content. It requires more commitment than most other MMOs as well. You can play casually and not let it take over your life, but if you want to do end-game raiding then it requires you to dedicate one or two nights a week to that.
---
And I’m not talking high-end competitive raiding either. It’s a scheduling issue. The only way to get 20-40 people available on a regular basis is to have a “Tuesday night is raid night or you lose your spot” rule in place.
---
PvP allows you to be more flexible since that tends to be organized on a looser basis, but high-end pvp requires dedication as well to rank up and to get good. Additionally, even pvp focused players will want to raid for gear. That’s another great thing about wow: pvp and pve aren’t unrelated. They assist each other.
---
TL;DR it can be a real time sink. At minimum one night dedicated per week in a solid 5 hour block to allow raiding, with more hours each week to farm gold for stuff like mana potions. Speaking realistically, 15 hours per week is about minimum to progress through the content as it’s released. If you can commit to that, it’s the most rewarding and well designed MMO ever made.
---
Ignore the ones you don't like. Support the ones you do like. That's a much better use of someone's time and energy.
---
You have a phone, don’t you?
---
&gt;Forums are also more readable. At a glance you can see what something is about and know all the discussion inside will (in theory) be centered around that particular topic. You can say that's what channels are for but that's still too broad and unfocused.
---
I agree with this, sometimes im trying to find a post on a discord I remember from a year ago and it is almost impossible. I think sub channels would really improve that aspect of discord as well as someone very competent in forum/disscusion management.
---
&gt;but have 0 reason to use it for anything other than voice comms.
---
I think the general pages have some great uses though, Ie an ingame question to your guild when away from your computer, meters and data from that nights raid, important annoucements for the guild, and signups for things.
---
&gt;but that's all I can see it as, is a VoIP, it's just the Vent/TS3/Mumble that people are using for now.
---
I miss vent.
---
Hi, /u/Storkas
---
What class? I switch between human and NE based on class because of shadowmeld and animations
---
If you enjoyed chivalry I think you'd love mordhau. It's everything chivalry aspired to be. Part of the fun with chivalry was the bugs, but this is much more refined.
---
Don't you have phones?
---
? Chill bro
---
Hmm I must be out of the loop then haha. None of my friends who still play seemed like they were excited. One of them said legion was ok...
---
Ashenvale as a Night Elf ... lots of Horde ... great atmosphere:)
---
I don't make money from Classic.  I make money from streaming.  I have 1 classic video on my YT. Esfand Staysafe MrGM TipsOut Classic podcasts, streamers they make money from Classic.  It won't be my content until IF there is a beta or release.
---
Haha uhhhh that does kinda sound like me... spooky what else do you know?
---
Asmongold is an actual OG and basically the stereotypical neckbeard WoW player. He clearly plays up his schtick now that he's raking in the bucks, but he is one of the most knowledgeable WoW players out there. Even the fact he can do a transmog contest and rattle off the loot and where it drops without inspecting regardless of expansion is pretty crazy to me. (And I think before BFA, he had like, 98% of all the items in World of Warcraft? His All The Things was nuts.)
---
Sometimes I have to stop watching him, but Asmongold has always been a "back in the day" type player, he enjoys Vanilla/Classic.
---
The world will grip you and not let go.
---
Yeah, I started in the undead zone and for 40 glorious levels I had gorgeous forests in the ruins of one of the largest human zones. The amount of lore in it was outstanding. I later on found the Eastern plaguelands and felt real bad, because I wish I finished there.
---
 **Tourette syndrome** is no joke
---
It's funny, I know this is mostly a joke, but I do wonder how the plethora of available information is going to affect Classic.
---
I don't really care about streamers. There's some shit, there's some good stuff. But there was a point where it seemed every day Asmongold's stupid ass face was plastered all over this sub constantly. "ASMONGOLD REACTS TO [STUPID SHIT]" and at that point he needed to fuck right on off and go away forever
---
They haven't specifically stated but since they're pretty much modeling after 1.12, which included the cross-realm battlegrounds, I personally would assume there will be.
---
Some people were sour on it but it decreased queue times quite noticeably for low-pop servers when it was implemented.
---
I dont really see them doing a long one but ive been wrong in the past. Theres too much content for them to have us test everything. I hope they're just doing it to test interest and stress test servers. I would hope for a two or three week beta.
---
A person of interest recently asked their audience if they would enjoy watching someone play a CWOW beta, even if said audience did *not* have access to that beta themselves. The chat answered with a resounding 'yes', to which the streamer responded  with a thoughtful, "Interesting, okay, good to know."        
---
            
---
It wouldn't surprise me in the least to find this closed beta situation to be true.
---
But you're still losing many brain cells watching Alexensual
---
That link was just me screwing around on the character tool, but I am interested in comparing BiS lists for various points throughout the game. Pre-BiS, MC BiS, BWL BiS, and so on. Like I said, I was just screwing around so I wouldn't take the list on the tool character I put together too seriously.
---
I plan on running a shaman throughout classic with full on goal of being elemental, and restoration for progression raiding. Doubt I would be able to get away with a 30/21 build in progression raiding but will if I can lol.
---
I like your BiS list of ele gear though and plan on getting most if not all of the pieces for farming and PvP. I will also be getting a resto set but I know of other spreadsheets for resto.
---
I have absolutely no plans on ever going enhancement other than for leveling. 
---
Shaman was the class I spent the least amount of time on in vanilla, but ended up playing in BC and WOTLK. I liked playing it in those expansions and hopefully I'll enjoy it in classic.
---
Thanks for your time, PM me if you want to discuss anything about shaman.
---
People on this sub are so dumb it hurts. Commenting that mages COUNTER rogues while every scrub in durotar knows that RvM is a balanced matchup decided by skill. Fuck me, this game is over a decade old and people still don‘t understand it.
---
I could post screenshots of how I crushed top mages like greatwizard and madscientist with my rogue but what for since the plebs here still think that Grim is the best rogue ever lmao.
---
I did it on my hunter back in 2006. Folk used to run SM for cloth, or Desdmines for defias BOE gear, or Shadowfang keep for the sword. 
---
Folk have been farming / running instances solo from as soon as they could.
---
Seems like something that can be handled with some pre-launch discussion.
---
The ol' "You think you don't, but you do!" huh? ;)
---
Fair enough though, that makes sense! I always just associate the old "wall of no" mindset with your stream whenever I used to drop by. I assume that has changed over the last couple of years.
---
&gt;Go ahead say I'm doing it for the money. lol.
---
I never said that! I genuinely hope you enjoy it and stick around :)
---
If there's a beta, I only hope it's for a few days only. This way people can set up their WTF and Interface folder and save them for when the proper release arrives. A few days for stresstesting servers should be enough
---
downvoted that comment fucking offended!
---
Dragonblight EU from classic to Wotlk.

London based as well.

Can't wait for classic!
---
&gt;Making alterations of this scale to codebase
---
Hello fellow developer.
---
Have you ever ported a legacy system onto a new platform? If so, what was your first impulse when the client or ProductOwner demanded a certain behavior of the legacy system to be ported as well:
---
* Touch the platform itself to change it's behavior
---
* Use the platforms existing facilities to emulate the desired behavior
---
And now that you (hopefully) answered this question sincerely, think for a moment about all those vehicle resource bars that can regenerate continuously, in chunks, on pickup, questtrigger, etc. and think about how much easier it would be to tie one of those to the rogues resource bar.
---
&gt;to stress test servers
---
That would be the servers that have handled the release of seven expansions so far, all of which with more day 1 users than Classic is projected to have, yes?
---
And how often do you craft such an item ? 10 times in a row without having to do anything in between ? Like getting more mats for example or trading or whatnot.
---
I really hope they'll release in July. August is when i need to start thinking about tests and when September hits my spare time is gone until Christmas.
---
You don't know just as we don't. Stop acting like your theory is any more correct than anyone elses. It is perfectly possible they release a physical collectors edition that doesn't contain a game. Most physical collectors editions dont include a game anyways, maybe a code for a game. This would be more like an art book, statue, etc. Its a commemoration of the Classic launch, that is why it wont be 100$+, it won't include a game.
---
Nope ^^
---
Once vanilla get released they will disappear but hating on content creators ain’t good for the community but that’s the hype effect and it’s normal
---
Not exactly a change if I'm trying to keep it the way it was is it? I want the pop to be blizzlike there just won't be a constant influx of people like there was. I want them to adapt the system to get as close as possible to blizzlike. 
---
"Hey I like 4k pop we should aim for that" urmygurd changes!!!! Not what I'm saying. 
---
Is having the servers die a slow death blizzlike in your opinion?
---
I dinged 60 in the Burning Steppes, farming Blackrock Stronghold.
---
&gt;\-Warlock: Summoning encourages grouping and friend making. Health stones encourage player trade and interaction along with qol buffs like unending breath. Fel hutner dispels
---
Summoning does nothing but encourage spite and resentment within the warlock himself towards said group.
---
Edit: I wanted to explain why this is real quick, you get a lot of groups who'll get a lock so they don't have to walk, then none of them want to be the 3/5 that have to walk and it ends up just being the lock waiting for others to grow up and make the sacrifice, also the people who have to summon to every raid when theyre HS is supposed to be set in Kargath, but they don't want it their so you have to grind extra shards to support them. 
---
Rant over...
---
You are proving my point.. as soon as you can legitimately make money from Classic via Blizzard's official release, you somehow become a Classic fan.  Get outta here.
---
The main issue i have with this is that there are numerous locations posted that are high traffic quest areas/mobs. Being contested at all makes a huge difference to your xp/gph. The two biggest factors for how viable aoe farming is #1 that you're not farming quest mobs (class quests being the only real exception) and if you can get a rotation of at least 4 mob pulls. Especially on any pvp server, you bet your ass anyone who happens to walk by can easily kill you trying to aoe.
---
There are a few spots missed in STV (basilisk cave) Tanaris (dog/vulture spawns around some of the large bone piles) that aren't included.
---
isn't LW better as you can craft more gear for yourself?
---
I just don't follow the drones of people painting Classic to be sunshine and rainbows.  I give people real situations.  Real things that pissed us off back then.  Real expectations.  But I always supported the strong communities back then
---
More than once Tips has lamented his financial situation to the playerbase. Call me fickle, but that's a huge no-no for me when it comes to "content creators". Whining about losing your job or not getting your checks directly to your fan base and using their empathy to launch your Patreon or invigorate donating activity is cancerous, and Tips has done so more than once.

I get that you gotta do what you gotta do as a family man not to get kicked out or have your power shut off, but once you cross that threshold it draws into very stark view the fact that the "community" they create is a revenue source, and I *hate* the thought of being a part of that.
---
The release date better come out tomorrow. I don’t need the beta, I’m playing pservers
---
Release date is way more important
---
In my mothers basement
---
I remember this being the case in all PvP specs/gear as well (Pve priest would get shreked) until Naxx.  2x MSA farmed off trash (it would take about 40 hours to get) dominated me from then on.  The stuns + unmitigated nature damage made it impossible to heal or dps through.
---
&gt; I ran a program in the back ground my buddy drew up (some simple key movements randomized and timed) and I would sleep
---
Literally the definition of 3rd party software.
---
No kidding nochanges! I want bugs left and right and servers crashing!
---
Wonder if it’s possible to make a key bind that automatically moves cursor to the “Accept” location for quests, and bind another key to M1 so it can click? That way you can use zero mouse
---
Oh yeah, and tbh it's not really that big of a deal.
---
Not exactly. It still amounts to false advertising and time-wasting. If you click on a video titled 'FASTEST, EASIEST WAY TO EARN GOLD BEFORE LVL 40' and after 10 minutes all you've learned is 'take skinning' then you're right to feel annoyed.
---
90's kid here. Can confirm. Only streamer I ever cared about was \[this one\]( [http://krommenhoek.info/wp-content/uploads//2019//04//water-sprinklers-toys-7-fun-hydrant-sprinkler.jpg](http://krommenhoek.info/wp-content/uploads//2019//04//water-sprinklers-toys-7-fun-hydrant-sprinkler.jpg))
---
Ok, break my link, r/classicwow
---
No, i wont be playing the Beta as i do not want to start the burn out before the actual game goes live.
---
If this is a twitch streamer beta then gamers are gonna rise up
---
So... just agree to roll on the same server then? Not that hard is it?
---
Pallies and Locks won't be getting their Class mounts until P2.
---
Like you hinted at. I will not be getting my Pally mount.
---
A classic fan?  I already played Vanilla bro.  I been a fan SINCE 2 0 0 4.  So because I don't think Classic shits fucking rainbows I should not play it.  What is it with you people in this SR with the whole if you're not with us you're against us bullshit. Why do I have to suck private server dong to be able to play Classic.  Show me your vanilla videos and level 60 pvp achievements.
---
"Destined to become a ***Classic***"
---
They *knew*!
---
Right, the battle groups will likely be in but not like crossrealm in the sense that I could invite you to my party and we can BG together, right?
---
Either way, not a big deal. Thanks for the answer
---
Dude I have atleast 50 keybinds on my resto shaman. You telling me I can play mobile and be able to use my 4 ranks of healing wave, two lesser heal ranks, 3 chain heal ranks, and 20+ totems?
---
I was talking average rogue vs average mage, not worlds best rogue vs mage
---
That’s why I’m hoping! But I’m also hoping for a random very close release lol, just call me a sadist
---
You are into something. It would definitely calm down the overpopulation from just a standard release. Maybe they went with no sharding and this is the way to combat that?
---
Paladin requires Scholo, not DM.
---

Not sure about Warlock.
---
When I was raiding in Vanilla and TBC, we had a mix of DKP and council. Basically, it was pure DKP unless it was an "important" piece (like Bindings). I think we only really overruled it once when it was a VERY intermittent player.
---
It's very likely to be Beta. The only other thing even close to being big enough is a release date, and I doubt that's enough for all this hype and mystery, considering the massive information they give us on an almost weekly basis.
---
Using a sick day when you are not sick should honestly be grounds for getting fired.
---
Kinda off topic, but for the love of god, call in sick when you are sick. Not cause you are lazy
---
What if blizzard pulls a fast one on us and just straight up releases classic tomorrow
---
I feel like there probably won't even be a beta. My reasoning is that it would take months for players to actually get to the point that they can even test the content. Not to mention, since this is old data, there should be fewer bugs as it already was tested for years, and some of the issues that come with mixing new and old shouldn't effect *too* much in comparison to bug fixing completely new content and a completely new backend.
---
 If the classic demo was any indication, they just needed to change a bunch of little things to revert it back to how classic was. I don't know what kind of work they had to put into the zones to get them to work properly though, but i imagine if there were issues, that the issues were all similar for each zone and would just be a matter of going through each one.
---
This is all of course speculation based on my time as a software engineer.
---
LOL I predict at least 15 Towelliee posts tomorrow.  I am going to love the internet
---
Meh, engineering is probably the best profession in vanilla. Its good for PvE and for PvP. Engineering pairs with mining, tho you can do it without if you are willing to spend the money.
---
Nelf Hunter, EPL.
---
Proof?
---
It's cool, man. He vapes.
---
Then spend time out in the sun whether classic is released or not... It'll always be there.
---
I think this is plausible
---
Of course, now the countdown guy is extremely nice, he never says anything about it that’s negative, he’s very professional but that being said, he has had several planned calls to Esfand for an in-depth look at ret paladins and esfand never showed up and rescheduling quite a few times I’m not sure on the actual amount. 
---
Staysafe was asked to come on and talk about warlocks and he refused; stating that he doesn’t do well in interview environments and then posts a 40 minute interview on his YouTube channel 2 days later;
---
Tips out is a noob that no one would like on their show. Except for classic cast for some reason.
---
From what I’ve heard, during a classic cast tipsout gets up to go take a shit mid podcast and Josh pointed out that they should edit out his screen for that and they sent him emails that were rather nasty from what I’ve heard. “Don’t you ever criticize us, don’t you tell us how to podcast, where bigger than you”
---
Ect.
---
I really prefer playing in groups of friends, sure the gathering quests take longer but it’s much more fun!
---
Would it really? Outside of this sub not everyone is holding onto a release date as much as us. We are actually the minority here...
---
As someone who has a 40 hr a week jobber and raids mythic two nights a week. I am ready for even less of a social life.
---
I honestly disagree but oh well :)
---
My religion deprives me of trusting someone that clicks their abilities.
---
So i should stay in zones after im done with quests to get my mining up for the next zone every time? Sounds kinda bad.
---
I think it's partially because the game is so old, and the content is established. So when you get these clickbaity hypemen, they can only rehash old information and concepts so many times. It's very transparent that they're just putting out stale content in order to stay relevant and make coins.
---
Who the fuck would take a day off work to watch a stream on a game that isnt even playable yet?
---
I hate the internet sometimes.
---
Is it? Seems like everyone is pissed and they are generating bad blood.
---
People in this sub don't want streamers like you here.  None of you represent us.  You did nothing for the cause and we all dislike fair weather streamers.  Go back to the game you and your friends ruined.
---
edit: I think its pretty obvious to you by now, most of your comments are getting hidden because of their dislike ratio.  Take the hint.
---
Yeah I mean some people that I used to play with I don't talk to on a consistent basis anymore , some I lost touch with completely but I'd love to play with them if they end up playing again. 
---
Agreeing to the same server will be easy for my irl buddy and my cousin and I to coordinate, but things change and those guys likely won't play as much as me. Also some people join the party late or won't play until others have said it's worth playing. Sometimes things are easier said than done.
---
Like I've said to other comments, it's not a big deal. You're acting like I said this was a make or break for my decision to play when I'm just wondering what systems will be in the game, not too absurd of a question.
---
Thanks for the reply and advice though
---
I'm not saying that beta will be tomorrow, I just say that it will be and probably 3-4 minimum weeks long. You can save my post, I don't care
---
Becoming famous streamer brb.
---
Well, its just clickbait. The internet is full of it, hell, even so called newspapers took up the tactic. Just ignore them and do your own research if you really have such questions.
---
Edit: No offence dude.
---
I don't think I've ever wanted to slam someone with a giant NO hammer before I read this comment
---
Hi I have signed probably 50 NDAs in the last 10 years.  Skirting is allowed.  Giving a specific date or specific day or anything internal is not.  Although naming your channel "classic beta tomorrow" and signing an NDA is probably a big fuck up
---
Lmfao fuck towlie, dude is such a herb. I asked him several months ago about classic “Nah man, why am I gonna play a game I already beat? I want NEW content, not 15 year old content.” Low and behold last week I hit him up mid stream saying “Yo, I heard you arnt gonna play classic cause it’s not your thing.” He goes off on how he is gonna crack out on classic, how he is gonna out level everyone on his stream. Dude is a shill, and a crappy player while I’m at it
---
It’s cause you never played Destiny
---
&gt;I played the fuck out of 2007scape until they falsely permabanned me
---
Secure your accounts better if it wasn't you silly.
---
As great as that would be, I don’t have time off and it isn’t summer yet
---
"""content creator"""
---
Try it out after release. maybe you cant handle a class. Melee, ranged there so many things you must consider. 
---
I will play shadow priest but back in vanilla i was a hunter with T2 equip. i ditched the idea to play a druid because for me and my playstile he is too weak
---
You need a pristine black diamond or whatever its called which started dropping in the DM patch I believe. 
---
Warlock is DM.
---
🔨 up bro 🚬☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️
---
Hmm it's a bit hard to tell in that clip due to the camera zoom. But it kind of looks like you might not be within range of 100% of the mobs all the time when using frost nova. And then there's just bound to be some resists in such big groups of mobs. Just be ready with the cold snap -&gt; another frost nova
---
GET OUT
---
Nah. Any decent BiS rogue with double MSA lifesteal/fiery enchant proc party will destroy druids.
---
It’s Blizzard Activision. If they can make a dime they will do it. I mean, they basically charged people for a chance to play an early alpha in one zone (blizzcon demo). Nothing would surprise me at this point lol.
---
4thing this, I love the care he puts into his videos. The Alex Jones escort murderchicken was fucking hysterical
---
I think you're missing the point
---
We just wanna play this game man. It's an itch that DEARLY needs scratched by many many people. I recommend not commenting here, it's only gonna be ugly in my opinion, because "the rest of us" apparently don't know what you might know, and there are no guarantees, and we want guarantees, of course.
---
They’re hyping this up so much that if it’s not real wow, then all these fools are just hypebeast goobers. Consider me a passenger on the #fucktowelliee train
---
There is only one other option that I see. Only take skinning and nothing else until 60. Every other profession will have you spending time to catch it up before you continue, if you dont want to spend that time, just get skinning and ride it until 60.
---
Without raiding you will definitely be at a disadvantage.  The PvP gear isn't all that great and unless you plan to play 16 hrs a day you will never get the r14 weapons.  The gap will be more and more noticeable as more content gets released.  You will be getting 1 shot by people in tier2.
---
On the bright side, I would assume that after people have been clearing content for a while it will be very easy for you to tag along in MC/BWL and get geared up very fast
---
Everyone knows it's classic closed beta
---
Doesn’t make money though. That $15 from tourists is an extra couple mil to blizzard.
---
He once implied you could break sheeps with Will of the Forsaken.
---
I guess it depends on what you want. Do you want to level quick, or enjoy the ride? the ones that are ging for 60 asap won't bother with professions at all because they slow you down. But they are nice to earn some extra gold on the side for your riding skill :)
---
I play Horde because I believe that their lives are valid. They belong in Azeroth and they deserve to be able to live in peace (like they are trying to do).

Got enough dkp? Then roll for it, win it this week you don’t roll next week.
---
It's a simple fact of the game design that PvE is integral to PvP. This holds even truer to PvP healers, since the available PvP sets are for their damage specs. If you want good healing gear, you *need* to raid. And if you don't have good healing gear, and you're fighting against premades with both PvE and PvP gear, they'll roll over you unless you're an utterly astounding player with an equally skilled team. Of course, good PvP gear itself requires very long grind times (far longer than any raid commitments if you want to reach R12+).
---
You can certainly have fun in low-stakes PuG groups if you're lucky to not hit opposing premades. But you may need to adjust your expectations of PvP competence if you can't dedicate time to getting the gear. Vanilla WoW has a much different, far more grindy rewards structure than the instant-gratification retail setup. For some people this is a huge boon. For others like yourself, it may be a death knell for your aspiration.
---
Also, the post greatly over estimates the amount of players who will be 60 in a week and clearing mc by week two. 10% is way to high of an over estimation.
---
5/7 math skills, perfection.
---
no, but I might be interested in some TLP servers.
---
Exactly. I'll have Wowhead and MMO Champion open at work tomorrow.
---
Relax. Everyone starts at level 1 so experience is not an issue. Keep browsing the Looking for Group Monday threads. New guilds are added every week, so you'll find the right fit eventually. Most guilds are just looking for warm bodies who show up when they say they will.
---
...wow. He truly is... I won't even say it. Ugh.
---
Saving Private Asmongold
---
&gt;I just don't follow the drones of people painting Classic to be sunshine and rainbows.
---
It is infinitely better than what the game has become now...
---
&gt;But I always supported the strong communities back then
---
Sure you did, buddy
---
No tools to close the gap? Ever heard of improved sprint? If the rogue uses reflector or skull correctly and predicts the hunter‘s trinket (most times out of kidney), the rogue wins.
---
Mage is easy compared to playing the matchups as most other classes in my opinion. I played mage for most of vanilla.
---
Yeah, Josh is really great. His podcast is fantastic. That's very unfortunate about the other guys. Oh well.
---
Maybe use the stickied thread specifically designed for guild recruitment efforts.
---
Exactly. If people dont enjoy their content, they dont watch. So there's no reason to hate
---
Honestly, next to TBC and WotLK, MoP was probably the best expansion. If not for those dailies being so insufferable, it would honestly likely be in the same tier. People just complain because "Kung Fu Pandas LUL", but I mean, nobody complained about the space goats in that way, and nobody complains about the snake-people or the fox-people now.
---
I love feeling nostalgic, which is why I picked up 2007scape in the first place. And I'm okay with the time sink. 
---
But from what I'm gathering from you, this game isn't really solo-player focused? I get it, raiding and whatnot. But is there any game content where you can basically do your own thing until you're ready to join in on that kind of stuff?
---
Apologies if it's a dumb question.
---
We of the Horde also do not encourage interaction with backstabbing Alliance traitors. Lok‘tar Ogar.
---
I post whenever I want whenever I want.  And yeah I didn't sign up for the crusade of toxicity.  I don't need to represent you.  But you will see a lot of me chub.  Have a nice day
---
Why would I take a sick day to watch someone's stream? If the beta was available tomorrow, I would inherently know because Blizzard would be advertising it. If it's not available tomorrow why the hell would I waste sick leave just to watch someone talk about it? And if it's literally a stream of a streamer getting to play the beta....I mean I played this game way back when, so it's not like there's anything *new* to see.
---
&gt; I'm looking for a guild that will be able to clear everything and who would also do world pvp or other fun stuff on the side. I'm not looking for a guild with people who play the game for stats or who want to be the best on the server, they obviously wouldn't accept me anyway because I don't have the necessary background. 
---
No one is going to care about your "Background" they care about how you preform inside and make a judgment based on that. 
---
&gt; Should I just wait for the game to come out and hope I run into a good guild on my server 
---
Yes. A large amount of these future guilds won't make it, just as most ingame guilds don't really manage a lot. Go ahead and find a guild pre-release if you want, but don't be suprised that GM is 10 and his mom runs the discord. Generally ingame you can do some research, check the /who see how many members, ask others about how the guild is recieved. You can also check a few out, join if you see some potential and leave if you find yourself inncorrect.
---
They honor the sacrifice and realization of Grom Hellscream that demon enslavement was an awful way to lead their people.
---
Still futile I‘d say :)
---
Once again I got my vanilla achievements and videos where are yours lol
---
Well, we will see.  My clear recollection is that before the druid talent reset, whichever patch that was, Tanking, especially in raids, was out of the question for Druids because no matter the gear, they couldn't get enough armor to make their mitigation viable, they don't have parry, and they had trouble stacking enough agility to push their dodge up, while leaving enough strength to do sufficient damage to hold aggro.
---
I know because we tried it in BWL.  One of our Fury Warriors who normally OT'd wanted to not OT and do damage so we geared a druid up as much as we could and me and the other priests and healers couldn't keep him alive, even after assigning a second person to do backup heals because he would just take too much damage too quickly (like 100%-&gt;10% in one hit), so we made the fury warrior put his shield back on.
---
But by the time we were in AQ, after the patch that changed up the Druid talents, we had two druids who could OT that horrible trash in front of the Twin Emps, as well as during boss fights when that was necessary, and part of that was because they upped the armor on feral leather gear enough that with the multiplier, suddenly they could get enough mitigation that they took heavier damage than warriors, but with a lot fewer spikes, making them rather easy to heal.
---
I dunno, I hope you are right.  I just remember hating the original itemization scheme and welcoming every change as a big improvement.
---
Yeah I got a handful of things I wanna test on their beta. I really fucking hope it’s not a streamer only beta where they are gonna fuck around and not squeeze any useful info out of it
---
It was nothing like that. 
---
Got permabanned for goldswapping between my accounts, which has been allowed in the game. They labeled me as a RWT-er But with their appeal system, there's no way that I can contest it. So the 1000+ hours I sank into the game is just gone like that.
---
He has some good content and some “ok” content, rubs some people the wrong way though for multiple reasons, mostly 1) using the youtube algorithm to his advantage or 2) his personality.
---
Almost no one does. It's not faster than questing. You'd only do it for fun.
---
If the Beta does go live tomorrow why not announce it from a blue post already? It’s a Beta. It’s not like it’s the full release. I feel like this “hey it’s SOMETHING but not gonna say what that something is for a whole week” isn’t building hype it’s building frustration in a community that is already frustrated with ActiBlizzard as a whole for not actively communicating with its player base. 
---
If they are planning on giving us just the Date of Beta and not the actual Beta tomorrow this has all been one big tease. And not in the fun kinky way.
---
I guess I see myself playing solo a lot. More PVP/BGs then PVE, but i'd still like to play PVE by pugging a raid group here and there. What would you suggest?
---
Yeah
---
I just got put on 12 hour shifts. So now would not be the best time lol
---
I like the soft res roll system. 
---
Before the start of the raid a public list of **all** potential item drops is uploaded. 
---
A player can choose **one** item he likes the most and write down his nickname next to it. Thus, the item gets a soft reservation, and if it drops - only people who wrote their names next to it are eligible to roll. Since the list is public, you can choose wisely the item you want to compete for and people you are competing against, and the list is locked once the raid begins. Basically it is a poker system with both probability and strategy coming into play.
---
Items that did get a soft reservation are on roll on based on main spec &gt; PvP &gt; offspec priority.
---
This system requires zero maintenance and is as transparent as an item system can possibly get.
---
Dwarf is the best Hunter race for Ally
---
Well I'm not really disagreeing. I'm just saying, when people give certain content creators bad reviews in public, they're justified in doing so, and shouldn't simply be told to shut up and not watch. I doubt anybody here is watching hours and hours of half-baked Tipsout content in order to induce a stroke.
---
Blizz-like is exactly how the servers were in vanilla, no more, no less - some servers were full, some weren't &amp; if you picked a server that died then tough luck, realm xfere - thats what you did in vanilla, your choices mattered, you want an experience when what realm you play on doesnt matter? go play live, sharding makes it lovely and full everywhere.
---
What happens when the popular streamers server is at 10k online 24/7 and the world first race is fucked because of the abundance of materials/gear/active raiders that wouldnt have been available in vanilla?
---
I'm going to try and get each (horde) class to about 20ish before release to see if anything changes my mind atm
---
Auberdine -&gt; menethil -&gt; theramore -&gt; swim to ratchet -&gt; boat to BB
---
Frostadamus has awesome videos :)
---
I definitely have. Hunters just have way too many tools to keeping their distance. It's a total miss match.
---
And if you wanna ask what if -all these random situational item combination possible-, keep in mind you would have to considered the hunter also has access to them. I'm pretty sure a single living action potion would put the match up more in the the hunters favor than anything the rogue could use.
---
This is absolutely true. And a point that I think is acknowledged somewhere on the website as well. But there are ways to mitigate this. You can duo with another frost mage to increase the safety of an area or play on off hours for instance. 
---
I don't think any reasonable person will tell you to AoE farm 100% of the time from 24-60. Make the assessment according to the situation you find yourself in.
---
If a thing is popular there will always be a loud percentage of people who dont like it. 
---
And reddit is a toxic cesspool that breeds mob mentality

You guys should try this Banana Custard I am vaping
---
Those maps are awesome, can you link them OP? I’m gonna steal your wallpaper :^)
---
my husband and i are gonna level together at a kind of casual pace (maybe a couple of hours a day) but try not to miss out on any big events. i'm a completionist and altoholic so i'll wanna do everything  eventually but for now i'm in no rush
---
Nonesense, ofc you will get gear. Would you disenchant T1/2 hunter armor ? For weapons you should have dkp or some such it place also ? No guild I have ever heard of just does not allow hunters to get gear.
---
I see what you are saying, but they are essentially “cheating” off their old work. They are restoring everything to what it once was. They can easily boot up the old client (and showed in Blizzcon) if something looked off and compared it to the old client. They then fixed it right then and there.
---
What are we going to give them in feedback that they don’t already have by looking at the old client and matching it up?
---
I totally am with you that a beta will probably happen, but I’m not sure what we are testing for them....
---
That druid was being annoying by following/standing on players who were participating in Tips' duel tournament. To be honest I don't think it is a reportable offense, but the druid was being very annoying.
---
It costed me about 300-600g for all of the items iirc on a Pserver soo idk what the prices will be in release
---
do you like the social community aspect? do you want to be  progressing in the end contend? if yes do you have the time to invest in it ? if no to all the above its still good to give it a shot as a casual.
---
Too many glamour shots on here ;D
---
PS red for Horde!
---
You didn't pay for the demo. You paid for the blizzcon. Demo was a freebie.
---
Im sorry I mislead you, I just don't like Tyrande.
---
Will be so funny if people will complain about not getting an invite when there are so many private classic servers you can test it.
---
Streamers just cant stream private servers so they have to wait for the "offical" beta
---
respect for speedruns, they're really stressful and lots of competition!
---
That ramp From Maestras Post to Astranaar is always littered with skeletons.
---
Hopefully! I don't care if I don't get in I just want to see and hear progress.
---
Ultimately I think they have to run some fairly wide scope test simply because they've had to modify/import/remove so much stuff that their team alone simply won't be able to press every combination and do x y z in 500 different locations and all that jazz.
---
Plus the more nasally voiced geeks can go "ackshually that gear had +4 stam, not +5" the more tiny details can be bought to light. Stuff like that to ruin the game but the more they nail, the better.
---
Now let me iiiiiinnnn!!
---
I played the second one when they gave it away for free, I think that says enough
---
Ahh so you are of the mind "blizzlike no matter what" even if it means some people get unlucky and roll on dead servers. "tough luck". So you aknowledge it's bad luck and there is a problem but you don't want to fix it before hand because part of the experience is the risk of having a bad experience? 
---
Alright man then we should have rolling restarts at random times and bad disconnects for days on end. It WAS blizzlike. Gotta keep it the same no? Sure it makes the game worse but it's blizzlike.
---
My goodness. Xfire was my jam!
---
Gland you enjoyed the post! I figured I would start some Ele discussion for PVE since I couldn't find any advice that was not PVP based. I would take my PVE link with a grain of salt for PVP as one of the other users so aptly noted, the PVE gear has vvvvveeerrrryyyy low stam and armor. I can imagine the PVE build getting mulched by rogues and warriors due to its low defensive stats. I think some of the cloth pieces would be best switched out for some stam heavy mail to improve survival chances.
---
A BIG thing to keep in mind about this list is that it is untested. I have not played much on private servers and I started in TBC so I never experienced Vanilla Ele. I do not know how fast I will be going OOM when going full chug on mana consumes, and do not know if switching out some of the spell power gear for MP5 gear will result in more net damage over a long raid fight. I'm relatively confident that switching out MP5 gear for for spell power is fine for dungeons as the fights are much shorter length, but I still worry about making it work on raid encounters (by making it work, I mean not running oom for 50% of the fight, idc where I am on the damage chart).
---
That being said, I will probably make more posts on Ele and maybe Resto as the other patches approach, or I will just get bored out of my skull while we wait for Classic to drop and make them sooner. I believe the most exciting time for Ele is around the AQ patch so I am looking forward to doing a deep dive on a patch by patch basis.
---
No he is actually talking about the upcoming expansion, War Of The Lich Clones.

I played a mage in retail vanilla and on multiple private servers now, I would not recommend attempting to aoe level if you start a mage within the first 6 months or so of classic launch. Leveling areas in general, and good AOE spots in particular, are going to be overcrowded and it wont be an effective spec or strategy to level. Morso on PVP servers, just go frostbite and shatter normal PVP Mage spec. You still have great single Target damage, you can do quests easily, you can solo any elite that can be slowed. And you have a strong spec for World PVP to finance gankers.

WrAtH oF tHe LiCh CING????!!???
---
Theyre probably going to be similiar in price to a normal epic mount at first. Prices will probably fade later on though.
---
i don't remember where i saw this but IIRC they said it was slated for a quarter 3 release (july, august, september) so august is most likely
---
Group of 5 dedicated players with a lot of experience in most expansions, looking for NA EST PVP raiding guild with raid end times between 8-10 EST (most of us work early mornings) pref weekday raids. At least 2 of us will be no life-ing this game
---
The second one is what cata was to vanilla wow bruh it’s like making out with a hot girls mom
---
Without Silithus, you end the quests at 59 and about 1/2. It's about 2-3 hours of grinding, but because BRD has a ton of quests, best in slot pre-raid drops, and the mobs are mostly lower level, it's a popular alternative to grinding
---
Feral Druid is very decent against Rogue. Resto and Balance are at a 80/20 disadvantage in a 1v1.
---
I could be delusional... but Staysafe is not an asshole, he is not telling you to take vacation to watch his stream he is telling you to take vacation so you can play the first day of classic launch
---
There are two ways to get very good gear in vanilla as the patches move on and no one is pvping in dungeon blues
---
PvP - this takes WAY more time than raiding for BiS gear , but for some classes gives teh best gear. Although for a full BiS set each patch you're going to need raid loot too. The upside is you can sorta half ass rank and over tiem you should be able to get some decent blues. Not bis but workable, especially if they put out the good pvp blues early. 
---
PvE - Takes a lot of time at the start of the expansion to get your banks ready, but then raiding can be done pretty quickly especially when there are only a couple raids out. BWL and MC can be finished easily in one night under 2 hours. 
---
The problem is that the game isn't just about gear it's about buffs/consumes. So you could in theory make up for your lack of gear with a shit load of consumes relative to your enemies...Assuming they aren't using consumes at the same rate. But if they have better gear than you and are also consuming..You're fukt...So hard to say how bad you'll have it
---
If you have minimum gear healers are almost always better. And I'd say priest is best because it's easiest to get your hands on decent gear and they work well without good gear. 
---
Things like Flask of the Titans, Demonic/Dark Runes, Limited Invlun Potions, and Major Manas can take a healer VERY FAR relative to a crap geared DPS.
---
Tank roles are not viable.
---
DPS with no gear does no dmg, not nearly as useful as healer
---
I would say of all the healers priest is best. Druids are specialists and need gear in to be useful in a meta sense in PvP. Paladins have terrible PvP and dungeon gear, the limit of plate really hurts them. Although no item progression does make it a bit better. Good but not great, lotta armor for crap gear.  Shaman's use a bunch of spell power gear even in resto spec, very hybridy. Suck without gear. And finally we get to priest which would IMO be the best choice with no gear. I prefer paladin but I raid so I will end at naxx with 11K plus armor and 8k hp. None if it coming from a pvp vendor even if went Grand Marshall.
---
So healers are best IMO in this order assuming you're not geared
---
1. Priest (offensive options don't require spell power to be effective. Mana burn, mind control, offensive dispel)
---
2. Paladin (would in theory be be best because not expected to do any damage anyway, at all, but because of how gear works not as appealing with no raiding, 1k extra armor from MC shield alone, one drop)
---
3. Druid (specialist in BG's, requires special gear farms, pvp sets for OP pvp set bonus, just a pain to get gonig and requires consumes to flag run)
---
4. Shaman is at the bottom because they're the ones who are expected to do some dmg. Without access to raid loot having the impact you want will be much more difficult than the other 3 heal classes.
---
I dunno, seems fair. One guy gets called out for being poor, so another calls him out for putting too much emphasis on money. Welp.
---
Well, I hope he didn't get banned or something, because he didn't do anything wrong. Tho I get that he was indeed annoying.
---
I didn't play in vanilla but I loved leveling trough Winterspring in retail. What's so bad about it?

---
Right, the reason I made the thread is because I wasn't sure whether looking for a guild like this before release is even really possible. I was under the impression that everyone who searches for guilds beforehand has background in the game and is mostly looking for hardcore guilds.
---
EDIT: Looking through the thread, so many good sounding guilds are Alliance.... damn
---
Followed by Revenge of the Aspects.
---
I was hoping GoT would keep me occupied during Classic...nope. What a shit show!
---
The memes are on fire at r/freefolk though
---
Why do you care about beta? You can go play right now.
---
Maybe people don't like you because you act like a dink, instead acting like a real honest person and saying "yeah I wasn't on board with classic when it was announced but I've come around" you are

"LOOK MY 60 ACHIEVEMENTS AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS. I WAS A FAN SINCE DAY 1. SHOW ME YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT"
---
It’s a very social game, but there is an incredibly large amount of stuff you can do on your own.
---
Quests galore, ton of profession depth (from gathering to crafting to fishing), huge world to explore, etc.
---
While I love the group content, I also love just wandering the world, grinding for a rare drop, seeing the sights, etc.
---
Its sweet and simple.
---
Alright, I'll just calm down then I guess.
---
Reputations are completely borked on Private Servers so any information I give you on that is unreliable at best, only thing I could recommend is doing ashenvale instead of duskwood or wetlands to get more NE rep
---
I see a number of old guilds from my server, but since I've moved 11,000kms I can't raid with them :-( Gonna have to make new friends this side of the pond.
---
Nelf Hunter grinding those ghosts on that frozen lake in Winterspring.  I had to get to 60 by a deadline or I was kicked from the guild.
---
Well, having a classic summer doesn’t necessarily mean it will be released during the summer....
---
You maybe pissed at first, but then you would remember that classic is out and would be filled with joy when you got to your PC lol
---
If you have Reddit Enhancement Suite mod for your browser, you can ignore a user &amp; never have to see their stuff again. :-)
---
&gt;Right, the battle groups will likely be in but not like crossrealm in the sense that I could invite you to my party and we can BG together, right?
---
Correct.
---
&gt;Either way, not a big deal. Thanks for the answer
---
Some people were against this because they liked the idea of everything staying within realm and creating friends/enemies that you would see and interact with in the open world. Once you start fighting and playing with people from other realms, you sort of lose that touch.
---
That doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
Blizzard probably told them it was fine hyping it
---
So clean and organized.. I like it. Reminds me of my work desk
---
You will want to skip it for two reasons
---
A) it won't be released until Diremaul is
---
B) mana mounts suck, maybe useful on a pve server i guess. Otherwise stay away. Riding around on a charger is like screaming "HEY I'M A PLEB WONT' EVEN BUBBLE HEARTH KILL ME NOW"
---
The fact you think im a streamer fanboy is fucking hilarious... you just love to assume things. If you think any of those things are gonna happen to only streamers just legit don't play. There is always gonna be a group of elitists on servers aiming to be first for everything... You dont need a streamer on the server for that to happen. If youwould prefer to play without streamers guess what??? you will have to not play wow at all... Unless you're checking up on every fucking streamers stream to see what server they're gonna go on, even if you had a fucking list you'd never know what server they're gonna go on until launch. Only one getting insulted it seems is you because this is a dumbass idea and you're getting called out for it.
---
 Clean it up chief. 
---
Do it for the horde.
---
&gt; A large amount of these future guilds won't make it 
---
That's a good point I haven't thought of, a lot of people might say they'll play for a guild and then just change their mind or never appear.
---
I'm mainly hoping some of the add-on developer community gets access too rather than not having any at launch for the first month or so.
---
This happens to basically everyone who gets traction while streaming or doing youtube. It's a sad slide from "i love making content" to "i love making content that will get me the most clicks"
---
Toss in stream donations and patreon and collabs and social media and then a year later the channel is hollow garbage meant to keep the host on financial life support.
---
Found the jaded individual who gets mad about people being passionate about something, and getting mad about youtubers he has no obligation to watch, and should have no affect on him.
---
it's okay, you don't have to lie on your reddit account.
---
It's not going to give your gold back.
---
Alterac Valley, farming those harpies
---
It won't be. Remember how marketing works these days. It's all hype and viral. They want you frothing and getting emotional. Streamers are just reputable figureheads - I bet you r/wow mods and other sites are privvy to information too (and keys for giveaways, if it'll be a thing), they just don't have the outlet to gossip or haven't been given the go-ahead to.

I hope you are right!

Well there is also purposefully(?) misunderstading and just generating rage (sidenote rage content does better online than happy positive stuff). What comes to mind first is that one guy doing vid on the hamsterwheel(that his name?) nax video. Sure it wasnt the best of stuff but ammount of toxicity was way more than is needed. (Asmongold said some decent things about that, one being the ammount of gatekeeping here being way too much)
---
Good luck with your content! Hopefully it's helpful to new players coming in. I'll go and check em out.
---
Edit: I do think we have many "useless" vids about classic that magically go over the 10 min mark. Simetimes those are fun to watch but honestly they arent the best of stuff.
---
Deep diving into an mmo beta sounds really fun and a good way to spend time! Especially when it all gets reset!
---
The past few expacs are evidence that in-house testing is insufficient for a lot of bugs
---
Yeah, people like you are why I stopped even trying to get my account back on the osrs subreddits.
---
Not really surprised to see the toxicity here, too.
---
Loot council is best if your main priority is raid progression.
---
You're out of line, dude. 
---
The truth is the community doesn't need you guys. In fact a lot of us think you and your massive droves of mindless followers will negatively impact the game through a multitude of reasons. I'm glad you're playing on a PvE server. I wish all of you "content" creators rolled on the same server so none of us have to deal with you.

Don't take credit for Nost, all you did was record yourself playing a game.

When you make negative comments towards someone that creates content that’s generally consider to be toxic. What do you consider to be toxic?
---
People keep saying "there's not gonna be a beta! no beta!"
---
Oh look, now there's beta files on CDN.
---
Now they're saying "there's not gonna be a PUBLIC beta! no beta!"
---
Goalposts. Moved.
---
Appreciate it =). 
---
And yeah I agree. The internet feeds off drama and thats the content that gains thousand of views and attention. It may be bad attention, but its attention and it gets people paid either way.

Week later... oh its just employee alpha.
---
I think this is more plausible:
---
Their internal beta expands by extending it to content creators etc tomorrow but not public invites yet.
---
Itd be triggering but atleast Id have some  fun streams I guess.
---
Would be logical with the whole rumoured Irvine content creator meeting with Blizz etc last week and them hinting that we should check out their "special streams" tmrw.
---
I agree on this, i was mostly speaking about 1vs1 in random PVP scenario. With average to good players
---
A godly rogue with opti professions + consums + amazing skill can send any classes to grave, Mages/Hunters and Worriors alike.

But that doesn't mean it will be easy / fast and everyone can do that :)

---
Well let's just pack it up and cancel classic then. No point having if when retail is still not 100% different.
---
For raiding or pvping? No. For leveling, farming herbs, grinding cash? Yeah probably
---
&gt;  I specifically said if there was legit legacy servers I would play. I mean I have a 60 in ND, had toons on Fenix for while. Was first person on Twitch to ever be timed out banned for playing Private server. But yeah dude I'm anti classic?
---
Yeah not about you. Baby man.

Same, though i didnt even start until Wrath.

I am wondering what the recurring troll chat cues will be.

If I were the devs I would troll the community by putting Mankrik's wife in a different place.
---
Doesn't make sense. Blizzard does not really care if you sub for 8.2 or for 1.13, everything that counts are your bucks.
---
Did I just say "take my money, Blizzard"? Yeah I think so.
---
Not much, I spend way too much time trolling on reddit and watching classic wow hype videos.
---
I think to stay relevant in the YouTube algorithm they all started pumping out just the most worthless content (because classic is not even out yet) and I think it rubbed people the wrong way, At least I know that's why I stopped watching them all. 
---
Then, shocker their videos are all just over 10 minutes with about 6 minutes of fluff 4 minutes of substance because we gotta get dem YouTube shekels. Feels like there is no passion they are just doing it for a paycheck.

Some people just like to hate for the sake of hate too so there's that.

how about one of these?!
---
servers will be populated regardless at launch, tourist dropoff is what will start killing populations and fixing that ahead of time would only be advantageous
---
The ultimate spoiler, 15 years ago
---
If your main goal is wPvP, I would recommend going Orc Hunter;  the stun resist is OP. In BGs NE Hunters with stealth pet are great for flag guarding in WSG and AB once they get released.  Having leveled both, I did not notice any major differences in leveling or loot availability.  Getting into a good guild that will support your goals is far more important than faction choice.  
---
At end game, most Shammies will be heal spec for raids, so you shouldn't have too much issue rom them with DPS mail drops.  In my experience, the loot issues were mainly with DPS Warrs and Rouges, so faction will play little if any difference in that regard.
---
Nah there will be much more acceptance of this in nearly all guilds these days, everyone's older.
---
I actually think generally private servers have been more accepting about *everything* than I ever would have thought! We killed cthun yesterday with an enhancement shaman a shadow priest and a holy priest who often needs to be afk for exactly the same reason as you. It is literally fine.
---
None of what you said appears to be based on facts at all. Fairly open? Either it was open or it wasn't...
---
Nothing wrong with a trackball. Particularly nice if you have a lack of space. I personally prefer that same model but the wired variant(has a red ball). Had some odd issues with that one, went through about 15 of them
---
PServer mechanics that never worked in vanilla is so annoying to hear. /sit to procc enrage or Backstab in the face. That never worked.
---
Yea and get them from the vendor.
---
34 y.o. ... yyeeaa nice try
---
Honestly throughout the years, it all boils down to giving loot to deserving people. Loot council is the way to go but it can end up being too black-box and manipulated too. So I'd try to make it more transparent and determined before entering the raids.
---
First I'd divide up any obvious class BiS loot and ensure those items are restricted to those classes initially. Don't need BiS rogue weapons going to hunters.
---
Next I'd create a simple checklist, and you could see your checks. They'd be like: do you show up on time? Do you stay the whole time? Do you attend both progression and gear runs? Do you contribute to guild efforts outside of raiding in any capacity? Do you put in a reasonable effort into preparing your character?
---
These would all be pretty low benchmarks that any reasonable human being could achieve.
---
Then I'd simply say things like "BiS weapons are only available to full participants tonight (all checkboxes checked)".  "Tier tonight is available to those with minimum 3 checks".
---
Getting full checks would be as simple as near perfect attendance, showing up in PvE spec with some pre-BiS items, and helping out with an attunement or gear dungeon run for a guildy.
---
But it would ensure people who are actually trying to contribute to the guild aren't losing out on gear to those who show up late, leave early, only show up for gear runs, ghost and solo pvp all week between raids, don't bother respecing for raids because "they're on farm already".
---
That’s what you consider toxic, not what is generally considered to be.
---
My mistake, was going off of OP's saying it was the final step in the quest chain.
---
Sounds gay. I don’t want half the people running around on my server to be completely ineffective or gimped in world PvP (friends or foes), cause they are playing on a phone during their commute. Just a silly way to water down the entire server when you got bot-like players who can’t even turn their character around in a single action
---
Also requires DM west spirit horse....

Why does it matter who the face of a game is?  Look at 90% of the ‘faces’ of other games and you will see they are100% worse.
---
Well..... maybe not as bad as towlie dude is a fuckin moron but the others aren’t *that* bad.
---
Make your own :)
---
You should definitely share a picture with us!
---
They care about *making money* from 10 minute videos
---
I agree, but looking at it as a subretainability type of thing they want to retain subs as long as possible. So if you sub for 8.2 to see the new content, about a month later is when it starts getting boring to people, so having 1.13 come out then and keep your attention and monies actually makes sense.
---
Yeah thats a good point I suppose. I guess with the beta we will be able to see what kinda mount patch they are on. Unless that is subject to change with the actual release
---
Just off the top of my head
---
* How populated shards are
---
* How far sharding extends
---
* What mods the client will support
---
* Experience values
---
* Quest route verification
---
* Spawn locations (Mobs, Nodes etc.)
---
* Item availability/version types
---
* What Raid UI is available
---
* Raid boss difficulty (Assuming we can hit 60 and Ony/MC are available)
---
once we find out, rest assured you will be the first to know.
---
Sure if you are looking at it in a vacuum. But most fights won’t happen like that. All my point is that Druids have good tools for handling rogues in a 1v1

---
There’s a weekly thread for LFG that might have better information. Most of the communities forming right now are more serious in nature to prepare for end-game raiding.
---
The only community that comes to mind immediately is the “countdown to classic” community based on the podcast. You might join their discord and see if it’s a good fit. A lot of that community is older people with obligations, and the vibe I get from them seems pretty casual; I think they want to do stuff like raiding but at a leisurely pace without stiff requirements.
---
Dishonored might be a good fit for you.

---
I don't like wand specialization at dungeons, because I just focus on healing. It's ok at leveling. I'd rather have unbreakable will.  
---
Silent resolve and healing focus gives a very robust dungeon healer that usually does not draw aggro but if your tank and team are bad, then these talents help.
---
I don't think you need  Spell Warding when you already have threat reducing talents.
---
Lmao just look at him as he says it. He's been smoking the good shit :p

Right cause there was achievements in Vanilla.  Nice knowledge petition m8

What is generally considered to be?
---
Did you expect something different?
---
The only way it's "worth it" is if we get to play the game. I'm not changing my schedule just to watch someone else play, or for just an announcement.
---
I don't think calling someone out for not having $15 is unreasonable, I don't think they should play if that's the case... The other dude is just overreacting in defending him imo.
---
I was 58 when Burning Crusades dropped. Ground boars in Hellfire Penninsula to 60. Horde, Anetheron.

Yeah let me take a day off work to watch someone else play a video game. Imagine if they have the nerve to hype this up all for a streamer beta like you have some huge privilege being able to watch these losers play a game

Well said. Towellie was one of the main people against classic back when the Nost shutdown was happening. He was constantly advocating against it and would bash and put down those who wanted to play it in a legitimate setting. He banned so many people in his stream for asking him questions about classic.
---
People change their minds about things all the time. People grow and look at arguments for thing they don't believe in and are allowed to change. But this guy just ignores what he's said in the past and pretends he's been FOR Classic all along. He's a shill, nothing more, nothing less.
---
If there isn't a blue post about it on the official forum the answer is "nobody knows".
---
I mean no one sane is gonna wanna dungeon with some one who has to deal with their kid every second....
---
But I raided with a guy once who would AFK on trash to "put his daughter to bed" EVERY SINGLE RAID lol AS A TANK. Pretty sure she was not 2 tho. 
---
And we were doing world progression on pace. Always had it by the lockout assuming it wasn't so bugged it was impossible. Which was a problem in that game.
---
So it's not like it's some deal breaker. Just don't think that starting a dungeon then AFKing constantly is OK, because it's not.
---
There is a “retro” vanilla private server that does instant 60s. You can make a few characters and give them pre raid Bis and see how each class plays at max. That might give you a better feeling.
---
I can't even decide between Horde or Alliance let alone class. Flip flopping daily..hourly even
---
If you arent bothered about "spoiling" the leveling process, try some out on private servers or beta if you get in? Thats what im gonna do i think
---
warlock mage rogue all good for solo and pvp/bgs.  DPS will be plenty so 5 man's and raids could be a little harder to get into than say healer/tank roles.
---
Aren't these gonna be a lot less valuable on classic because most private servers have dynamic respawn or 5 minute timers compared to classic which should be 15?
---
I have a difficult time believing there'd be a beta for the public considering they SOLD one last year
---
I’m assuming you are talking about lvl 20 in retail? Most classes play vastly different in vanilla. All that work would be for nothing.
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
Nope not retail
---
Ah yes, I can't wait for those raids. At any one time during the raid, 7-8 people will say "brb baby screaming". What an enjoyable raid.
---
Since you've not specified what region or what time-zone you're looking to play with I'll just link you this -  https://discord.gg/2r25M8Z

You should be able to find something suitable there.
---
I'm personally in a laidback guild forming up around the concept of just having fun, we will raid and do everything the game have to offer, just not with the "gogogo" mentality. It's EU based, but got people from all over the world at the moment. I can link you to the discord if this sounds interesting.
---
Lmao, the PvP achievements got auto added to your account when they implemented the achievements in around 2008!
---
The only reason it wouldn't is if you added an inactive account to your battle.net account (after making an illicit purchase) which you clearly did in 2011... Nice knowledge m8
---
inb4 "but I had a seperate account lol xD"

That does not sound like a fun guild.

i think this is not class dependend. if your playstile is social you can make even friends.

Definitely a Warrior. I always rolled human. Rolled Dwarf in the demo, I liked it. I am also very interested in Shadowmeld though objectively NE would be the worst race for a Warrior xD. Assuming we get a Beta I will try NE as well.
---
Would highly suggest getting to rank 8 or so then raid..then mass pvp again.

Then there's the vast majority of players that don't need to make deals, won't take time off work and won't need to adjust their entire lives for the release of wow classic....
---
No that was in a later expansion.
---
The sun?  doubt it.
---
I don't think anyone forgets putting the word 'anal' in front of linked items in Barrens chat.

it's getting hotter and hotter.
---
Well most likely sucks who they chose then - MadSeason released a video yesterday saying he's in the dark and didn't get an invite for anything. Will wait until tomorrow before I grab my disappointment pitchfork of course!
---
Hot taek: Legion was actually really good. But it had warning signs of mechanics that were double downed on in BFA and removal of some good Legion ones.
---
I had fun with a lot of classes in Legion, felt there was a good amount of content, the raids were fun. Mage Tower. Mythic+.
---
My friend played his hunter on an XBox controller... ranked up to field Marshall
---
This is the essence of a lot of the crap on this sub since the announcement. Reaching speculations...
---
Wow, that's great. I hope this is the case with classic.  I can't commit to much other than being excited to play as much as I can, when I can. There's always a parent moment that seems to pop up at the most inopportune time.
---
True, but as op asked, why let it trigger you. Its just useless imo. Like drinking poison and expecting the other guy to die of it.
---
Just type /vomit
---
Undercity as Alliance Rogue
---
You use to be able to challenge some classes to a duel, then do a /forfeit right as a channeled ability (such as frost bolt) hit you, it would cancel the duel and flag them for PvP. Then you just kill them.
---
Only 10k hours? Casual
---
&gt; stay away from Goldshire. That much is true.
---
It's only bad when there's people from PvP/PvE realms going "LUL WHATS THIS!?!? OWO" and getting naked and faffing about with sexual shit in /y and /s chat. the actual ERPers that sit at goldshire arn't even an issue. they just stand there like statues.
---
Does anyone know a good WoD private server?
---
Oh you sweet summer prince.
---
Apparently we don't know, because even in this sub there are constant requests for leveling guides, BiS, pre raid BiS, etc.
---
Staysafe on twitch's title in his stream today is BIG STREAM TOMORROW
---
It’s causal friendly as in that it encourages exploration. It’s not a race. It was designed to bring an entire audience into a new and more immersive world. We see classic, or wow for that matter, for what it is today: a race to the finish line. We can’t unlearn the secrets, tricks, and general information we’ve accrued over more than a decade. When it was released it was all about discovery, and taking your time enjoying things in Azeroth. A real game.
---
Everything is wrong with mobile classic wow.
---
 Don't even pretend to be interested in that shit lest Blizzard take the idea and run with it.
---
**&lt;Maelstrom&gt; Alliance community. Recruiting more players for Classic. We’re a serious progression guild with a 3-night raid schedule. T/W/TH starting at 7pm central time. NA-PvP server.**
---
**Currently, we are only looking for active and dedicated players who are interested in raiding with us twice a week on our test server. We believe that by playing together prior to the release of Classic, will give us an advantage in terms of progression as well as to allow us to get to know each other better.**
---
**We are not looking for those who just want to populate the roster and then never participate in any guild events (we have plenty of those).**
---
**If you meet the requirements and want to know more, send me a msg on discord. You can read more about us here** [https://maelstrom.gg/about/](https://maelstrom.gg/about/)
---
Fuck, no stream is worth taking a sick day for. How about I wait for an official announcement rather than stroke some lonely guy's ego.
---
What a fucking asshole.
---
That has nothing to do with the healthcare system. The employer controls all of this.
---
Jesus christ this is more like a job application than a guild. That's gonna be a yikes for me dawg
---
Dude seriously lol. OR I didn't log into my warrior until 2011 because I only played my main Towelliee a paladin since TBC came out. AND WHEN I finally logged into this toon I got the achievement, which I did LIVE. Come on man everyone knows this is my account. Accept the fact that I played Vanilla and we will be good.  And side not they did Not get auto added unless you logged into that toon back then.
---
God I hope so. Lack of server community is my number one problem with retail, along with CRZ and dungeon finder
---
That music was the best
---
Nope. Nightelf is superior. Feint death shadowmeld is insane in pvp and ne&gt;dwarf in pve too
---
I can't see why it wouldn't be since private servers are supposedly the elitists.
---
Obviously people don't fuck about at the back end of aq40 but now and then things come up and it's still fine anyway.
---
From my personal experience, rolling on a new server and organically finding friends/guild is way better.
---
I was Lucky enough to roll on a Day 1 New server back in Vanilla(Akama PvP), at the time I was playing on a PvE server and didn't know anything about the game really. Went to load server list one day and saw a few new servers just popped up and dived in since friends quit.  Best gaming experience I have had by a long shot. Meeting new people, PvP in heavily populated zones, just having fun. I have also joined Guilds that intentionally waited for the release of a new server (still Vanilla) and it just isn't the same. Because you don't really bond or anything before committing , letting it happen organically you find a better fit I believe, even if you want end game raiding. 
---
  Last thing, most of the Guilds I have seen in Vanilla that were created before a server launch became a few bigger Guilds. Drama/Gear/Player count will all lead to some of these GM's to combine there efforts at some point., and the more organised guild will absorb the fall out usually.  A lot of stuff can happen between 1-60 in a guild haha
---
After a guild run in Strat I was left with like 2% so I just killed some mobs in epl to ding. Won a boe epic ring during that run which gave a nice boost to epic mount savings. It was either the same day or the day after I was invited to heal in MC and I'm pretty sure I got my first tier 1 item on that run.
---
Literally why he's asking
---
i answered his question i dont care what you think
---
The Plaguelands. It's just one long ass road that everyone has to use. Even sneaking past is tricky in spots due to the hills creating chokepoints.
---
We could only hope so. Apex Legends launched pretty well after being released out of the blue.
---
Winterspring, at the entrance to yeti cave. I parked there at 55 and got a lot of thorium while grinding.
---
Tauren Warrior, Xavius EU
---
Lol. Rogues are great but a well played warrior easily counters them. Even then Rouge is absolutely useless without all their CD’s. (So once very 5 mins). Real PVP’ers know Warriors are the king of Classic in all aspects except for healing obviously.
---
They’re saying this to defend classic wow more than anything
---
Love this, looks like someone's real battle station
---
Most people seem to agree with me so you may want to rethink your opinion. There are only a handful of streamers big enough to bother me. I'm impressed by how much this means to you. Judging by your persistence I would assume you were personally offended by my post. Again, you can play with streamers if you want. If following Asmongold around makes you happy then by all means do it.
---
It is definitely more casual friendly than BFA, and thats not a bad thing at all. The only thing that matters in BFA is endgame raiding lol.
---
I see most people agree that there are indeed some pretty bad specs that will not be viable for end game, but at least no classes are left behind. And I understand players are simply pointing out some facts, which is perfectly fine. What I am more afraid of perhaps is the general concept that X class or spec doesn't perform as well as other ones and that people start playing with that already in mind and exagerating these facts, therefore dooming some of specs in advance. My goal however is not the be top tier, but to have fun and do most of the content. I want to raid, I want to pvp, I want to run dungeons... But I don't think I care if I am top dps the day a raid opens up. However, I do care about getting a spot when I want one in decent groups.
---
I thought that was the case, but I think this ones gonna be big.
---
Why give us “Big News” from second hand sources though? I’m not discounting your popularity as a streamer and your ability to help promote the game. But if it’s “Big News” I feel like we should be hearing it from blizzard first hand. They could give us a blue post or a hype video easy. But letting streamers have info they can only hint about for over a week is just annoying.
---
Yeah I'm with you. I hate that everyone goes to the very very top of every ladder. It is not a good statement for representation for the rest of the community and they know this yet they still bring it up. It happens in every game too. Really obnoxious.
---
How are we suppose to know the answer to this question bro
---
 **&lt;Drive&gt;** is a North American guild focused on progressing through end-game PvE content at a reasonably quick pace. We are aiming to reach max level within 4-5 weeks of launch and will start progression rapidly after doing so. Our primary focus will be on PvE and, as a semi-hardcore guild, we expect our members to have a healthy thirst for progression. We aim to raid 3 nights per week from \~8 PM to 12 AM EST.
---
**Why join us?**
---
1.) We have stellar communication during raids and have well-defined goals that we lay out before each raid.
---
2.) We are very accountable towards our members. We hold everyone to the same standard.
---
3.) We are organized with our progression; we have a system for carrying out encounters.
---
**Why should we pick you? Additionally, our expectations of our raiding core:**
---
1.) You want to progress through raids at a reasonable pace with guys that love to banter.
---
2.) You are prompt, organized, and provide constructive criticism.
---
3.) You actively contribute to the welfare of the guild. This could be done through helping to gear alts, farm mats for the guild bank, research boss fights, etc.
---
4.) You read and learn every boss fight before any attempt is made.
---
5.) You can communicate clearly in discord.

Leveling 1-60 is very fun.
---
Once you hit 60, you wont be playing very long if everything you do results in you getting your ass kicked or failing to get consistent spots in raids to gear up.
---
If you choose a feral druid for example, you're pigeon whiling yourself into not being very good. You wont get the same opportunities.
---
Take a look at www.vanillafriends.com
---
I didn't even realise people on this sub hated these streamers until today! Seems a bit immature to get so wound up by them.
---
I actually had some try this and I still crushed them. Granted Dwarf Warrior has an advantage here
---
I complain about them implementing game mechanics that corroded the end game experience while also destroying the leveling journey. They implemented character boosts, thunderforging which was warped into titan and warforging over time and LFR was tested in cata during the last raid tier but was fully embraced in mop. These are the three worst aspects of modern world of warcraft in my humble opinion. They all caused issues that have, over time, ballooned out of control and are just seen as standard operating procedure now.
---
I ran a point based suicide system that we managed with the epgp mod. Raids granted a point every 5 minutes and a point every wipe. Suiciders split their points evenly among those in attendance with a minimum suicide value = raid size so everyone got at least one point every time someone suicided. You could go negative too, and points decayed 10% per week, encouraging people who had a lot of points to keep coming back to maintain their spot.
---
When something big dropped like the car door shield the points would fly... everyone in the raid that night got 22 points for that one suicide.
---
Best part is that this worked for pugs, and lead to lots of them becoming regulars.
---
You want LFG don’t you
---
&gt;Getting fed gold and items, getting carried, help with mobs etc. These guys that strongly claim #nochanges are going to have the easiest time playing this game claiming #nochanges but streaming and using their fanbase for help.
---
girls existed in 2004
---
This ain't it chief
---
You can never hit 60 in classic and still have a good time. In BFA you have to hit max and get a certain item level to really play the game. Plus it has zero social aspect to it. I haven't made a friend in wow in years. Trust me I have tried.
---
How is it more casual friendly? Genuinely curious.
---
&gt; Private servers have proven this to be wrong, the only problems would come from whatever they've fucked up with the modern client which will probably plague the normal servers anyways.
---
This implementation of Vanilla will be based on the current engine which is known to under perform, even crash when a moderate amount of players are present in a zone or a shard. The experience with private servers is based on a server configuration that will not be used for Blizzard's Vanilla servers, the limitations will be different this time around but the result will be the same.
---
I can see them getting the population up to 5k max with sharding in various high density zones (starter zones, crossroads, TM/SS)
---
I've read some stupid ass shit in my day but god damn.
---
It's absolutely fine with dads or moms even in semi-hardcore guilds. 
---
The only advice I can give you on this matter based on my experience - don't roll shaman or tank, your group really needs you or your totems and they can pull patrols if left unattended :)
---
A streamer exclusive beta aka marketing campaign. You see EA and other soulless companies with no self respect do these all the time. Blizzard use to be above this
---
Server 1st guilds are a grind.  I did it back in college, raided 6 days a week, 7 hours a night.  Then had to grind outside of that for mats and what not.
---
It's because in BFA you have to get to 120 to start playing the real game which is quite a time investment, wheras in Classic the game starts from level 1 as leveling isn't just a formality. There's also a more infinite grind in BFA due to the azerite necklace (and artifact power in the previous expansion), whereas in Classic, given enough time any casual player could eventually get a character all geared up for good.
---
It's a scam and nothing more.
---
If you are incapable of actually filling out the ten minutes with good information or whatever else you are supposed to have going for you, then maybe the job of a content creator isn't for you.
---
57.5-60 in the yeti cave, skinning. i had so much leather.
---
&gt; I really hope the streamers all agree to just play on one server, but I doubt they'll do it. Many of them are hypocrites in that they also don't want to play on a streamer server.
---
Thankfully, there's 2H and 2A streamers that're all going onto one server. if i recall their fanbases are roughly even. so it shouldn't be too bad on their server, unless a megastreamer goes there too. and just throws it all into the trash.
---
So? For a casual player who's randomly choosing cool specs they think look neat, it's going to take 6 months of gameplay just to reach 60 on one character. Casuals will be totally fine playing the game. They don't give a shit about endgame raiding, and even if they want to try something at some point, by the time they manage to get there, so many guilds will have MC on farm status that they can simply be carried by one.
---
I'd been keeping my eye on that thread (and the similar channel in classicWoW discord) but it was mostly all "hardcore" or "semi-hardcore" with progression priorities. I didnt want to barnacle on a semi-hard guild and be that guy.  
---
I'll give the countdown to classic a look though, thanks for the recommendation!
---
So you're saying you don't want to play with other people then. Got it.
---
dude that Sport Direct mug should be in the bathroom full of toothbrushes
---
how would Blizzard even police that?
---
and why would they want to? free publicity.
---
we are just gonna have to live with the radioactive AIDS that is streamers.
---
\#NoChanges to the game, sure. but the (real) world has changed, and there's no way to stop that.
---
And they just don't add anything unique. Enh Shaman with totem twisting and Nightfall can be useful for group buffs. Shadow Priest helps your warlocks do better. Feral can help your other melee do better. Ele doesn't bring anything to the table for the rest of your group beyond the baseline totems all Shamans get. Even a Boomkin brings a caster aura.
---
&gt;/incoming guy with psych evaluation of me
---
​/defensive
---
Projecting your insecurities through a preemptive guess doesn't invalidate the points.
---
Aside from that I follow you though.
---
This is exactly what I am going to be making. A guild for parents and people with a life. I had a small guild full of casuals before, I plan to make one and go that route again.
---
Omg this is hysterical. This dudes reaction to losing to a priest has me dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Happy cake day, bud.
---
Check the LFG thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, yo. There are multiple guilds that specifically advertise that they're for working parents and whatnot.
---
At this point it would almost be mandatory to divulge if you're played on private servers for any more than a few months.
---
The amount of elitism, min-maxing and just overall bullshit coming from some of those private server fucks, it's infuriating.
---
Here's a list of the classes from my untainted memory of Vanilla.
---
* Druid. They were fine. A raid typically had 1 feral and 1-2 resto druids.   
---
They were hella fun in any spec in PvP because people HATED them but could not kill them. This combined with a shitload of useful support spells: awesome.   
---
* Hunter. They were fine. Marksman was the only useful spec in raids really, but if you're a hunter does that matter? DPS is DPS. 
---
* Warriors. They were fine. You could be DPS or Tank. I don't think much need to be said about warriors, really. 
---
* Shaman. They were fine. Raids you are almost guaranteed limited to healing, the others are unfortunately just awful. Like Druids they are extremely fun and useful in PvP no matter your spec, though Enhancement is too luck-based for my taste (no WF procs and you're less than meh.)   
---
This was my main class. I loved healing as shaman.
---
* Paladins. Were they fine? They were kickass healers both in PvP and PvE.
---
* Mages. They were fine. Quite a varied DPS class both in PvP and PvE. Like warriors not a lot need be said.   
---
* Rogues. They were fine. A very particular playstyle that as far as I know didn't change much from Vanilla to TBC. You'll know before choosing a class of you want to be a rogue or not obviously.
---
* Priest. They were fine. They were an obvious choice of you like healing, and a raid would generally have 1 Shadow Priest. PvP allowed all three specs.
---
Conclusion. They are all fine.   
---
TBC did a shitload right, in truth they probably improved every single class to the point where I don't really feel they ever needed to be improved after it.    
---
With that in mind is definitely the car that vanilla was *lacking* as far as choices go.
---
Thing is, you have the luxury of choosing right this time. Just choose what you know will work for you.
---
As for the min-maxers. Fuck them. They can suck a literal cactus. They are the absolute worst.   
---
It's not that they are wrong per se, is just that they can be collectively summarised by this one image:
---
[Ackchyually](https://i.imgur.com/Ek6jgeF.png)
---
I agree with this, seems pretty smart
---
I want to play with other people who are on their computers. Not a semi-afk person playing on their iPhone as they take a dump
---
I cannot confirm or deny giving some gold in OG vanilla for an RL handy.
---
Ice cold milk. When you are lvl 10+ and can afford splurging on Ice Cold Milk it makes you feel like you are a non-stop mana regenerating bawss
---
Uhh that was a quote from Blizzard. It wasn't open but it was quite widely available so they and many others _called it_ open. I don't think that concept is so hard to understand? Not everything is black and white.
---
I literally wrote the exact opposite.
---
Eastern Plaguelands. Noxious Glade, almost every time.
---
The truth is more practical than Blizzard using teases and secrets to build hype. They don't want to lock themselves into a release date if they don't have to. July 16th may have been their internal deadline, but that could change if things need extra time to be ready.
---
Wands that are decently priced will sell
---
SEE I KNEW IT
---
Idk, if I say "Tips is shit", I'm not really triggered, just stating my opinion that he is shit. 
---
Like cilantro is shit, but I'm not triggered by the fact that it is shit.
---
have to play a lot to get the rank tho
---
Speak for yourself. You are so dramatic, jesus christ.
---
most of the things i would say have already been addressed so i'll just say a couple i think are important
---
esfand and staysafe for example only got popular by spamming private server /world channels with their streams like 60 times a day, i remember blocking both of them because of it
---
another thing is that almost every """content""" creator just steals stuff from other channels, reddit posts, old guides, and so on and they advertise them as new, they make long videos so they can make money instead of making videos for things they enjoy, i make videos and make them as long as they need to be (usually 2-3 mins) because I'm not greedy and don't enjoy milking the fanbase of a game i like
---
It’s a closed beta that’s coming out Wednesday. Few people will have access
---
Thanks, this helped a lot. I mostly plan on focusing on PvE but I'm rolling on a PvP server. My main is going to be a priest, so I'll probably go with rogue because I don't think I'll have the time to significantly gear two characters and the priest will be my primary.
---
If you know what you're doing, playing the AH in the early days before inflation hits will net you huge rewards. You've already acknowledged this in your first sentence, so why *wouldn't* you bother with it?
---
Thanks for the shout out man!
---
That “opt in for beta” feature on the Blizzard website is straight bullshit lmao. Unless you’re a streaming, good luck getting an invite
---
It has a 6 second CD but yeah your point still stands.
---
literally my OC but ok, people might have made similar images I wasn't aware of
---
Yea this confirms what I basically thought, that you can't really prepare a guild that's not hardcore, these guilds are supposed to be almost like friend groups and you can't really force that before the game is even out. I think I'll wait till launch and worry about it later, I much rather prefer things happening organically.
---
I like this a lot actually
---
lol americans and their sick days
---
I'm completely ignorant of how it all gets put together. 
---
That said, I Hope You're Right! I'd be down to play sooner than later.
---
They didn’t confirm it, but this is correct
---
Who's looking for someone to duo level with?
---
I didnt know there was a discord just around guild forming (i've only been using r/classicwow lfg and the discord as my sources), good resource thanks.
---
EU servers probably don't work for me (I'm West Coast US, but I'd be on at 11pm pst - so 6/7am UK/DE time)
---
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT
---
im SO curious to see the "hype" after 3 months
---
i just have this feeling that after launch, Blizzard will be like "see, this is why we never did this" lol
---
Ah, if only it were that easy...
---
Because of the popularity of streamers, a lot of game developers have started using them as their de facto PR people.  Announcements that the game developers used to make will now be funneled through the CCs instead.  Information gets teased through CCs, announced through CCs, etc.  Except - the CCs are not employees.  The operate in this weird "officially unofficial" gray area.  Which means information gets convoluted.  I.e., "Is this an official announcement/tease, or is this guy just speculating?"  It also provides the game devs with plausible deniability.  They can slip some news through their CC, and then just wash their hands of it if they change their minds and the CC just goes "Welp" - it obfuscates accountability.
---
I hate it all around.  I don't mind if people wanna watch a CC on YouTube.  I make it a point not to fuss about what other people enjoy.  My primary (if not "only") gripe about CCs is how game developers have latched into using them in place of a proper PR department.  That provides absolutely no benefit to the players.  It just helps the CC make money and helps the game developer avoid accountability and/or proper communication.
---
/u/awesometographer has been getting competitive levelling times on his paladin ([even faster than Joana](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bnvj92/alliance_160_guide_as_war_5days_w_4x300prof/ena027o/), albeit on a pserv) so there's no way they're as slow as you describe
---
EPL
---
my dude has a land line?
---
fair
---
that's even sadder.
---
Even a druid won't have huge issues if you grab the flight paths on your way. You need to return to Darnassus one time at level 10 and that's it.
---
I remember Adam Sessler convincing me to buy this game. At the time, 5/5's on X-Play were rare as Hell.
---
He wasn't wrong.
---
&gt;OR I didn't log into my warrior until 2011
---
Sure you did, buddy! :)
---
We were good when I first responded, you just carried on being toxic!
---
Grinding for Frostsaber lol. Can't even believe I did it looking back on it now. Stopped questing at 57 and grinded the repeatable. Amazing priorities.
---
I have nothing against the overall design of MoP, I didn't personally liked the aesthetic of the expansion, but that's subjective.
---
Although his statement is still true imo. MoP was when WoW stopped being WoW. Talent redesign, resource distribution, introduction of TitanForging(Thunderforging at the time), etc, etc, etc.
---
You may say that the changes actually started at the end of WotLK with the introduction of Dungeon Finder, and I agree! And then in cata with the Raid Finder.... But it was in MoP where "Modern Wow" Truly came to be in it's final form. Not only with the queue systems but also with everything that followed, changing it from the MMORPG into more of an action, instanced based game.
---
I wish this was going to be the case but it looks like we will have to wait until tomorrow for that to happen. Doing everything I can to keep busy until like 2am when I can pass out. Got another 10.5 hours to go until this is essentially all over (I am not counting my sleep time and I will wake up just as the news is releasing, or after)
---
You need to understand i'm being realistic. I'm not going to hedge my bets on some random dude that's he's going to be honest when it's not statistically the case.
---
It's not your fault that you don't deserve to be given the benefit of a doubt, but you're still not going to get it.
---
Profit is profit. There are different percent levels of profit, but if you can still make money on margins from selling items for slightly higher on the AH than what you paid for them/what you can vendor them for, why not?
---
Madseason doesn't really stream so it makes sense
---
You are right. But there's more.  
---
Recently, the longer the video, the better your watch-time as a whole on the channel. More watch-time, more recommendations.  
---
I believe the new meta will become 30 minutes videos or your channel stops growing.
---
Twitch streamers appeal to kids, which is fine, but most people looking forward to playing a game this old aren't kids
---
PS: Blizz don't care about us having time to request our vacation time. They'll straight up drop the game like "oh, and classic is available to play, now". I'll eat my DKP if I'm wrong (let me dip it in Mustard at least please).
---
 Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational clutterstation!
---
Well, here is my thought process. Take for example a twenty of linen cloth. Early (assuming about first two months) you can probably get roughly a gold from it. 
---
If my memory serves correct, a 20 stack of linen six months down the line would be like 5g. Should you wait for better payout? Does that make sense?
---
/leave general
---
Im pretty tired of the "just ignore it" mindset. I think that is why we live in the world we do. Why offer poison from the beginning is our mindset. And if we can choose, we rather not want to be around the poisonous. Why do other people have problem if we have problem with the poisonous? Just let us be on a server etc. where they don't exist. The problem I have with that is; 1. It takes up mental energy and time to constantly analyze shit content. 2. It is not only about us. It is also about fighting for what is right in a sense. Also for minors who get abused watching a 10 min video and learning nothing. 3. I kinda despise 'influencers' for several more reasons
---
Yeah... nah...
---
Dude I don't know who you are as a 30 something. I literally had to Google it and was like "This dude is too fucking old to be acting like this." You're obviously super insecure with all of those "/" 's affixed to this post. Just do us all a favor and just don't fucking play classic. 
---
All you'll bring is your armies of fuckwit teenagers who think streaming is a real career. What are you going to do in a couple of years when you're just a washed-up NEET whose fan base grew up but he didn't?
---
Ahh yes, but do you wait for the margins to get larger?
---
It's not so much false as misinformed. If you know a class decently well and watch a stream where he either has a guest or talks about it, he doesnt really have a great idea what hes talking about and tends to ride on the words of his guest.
---
Deleted.
---
Dwarf definitely has an advantage in this situation - but that’s a small portion of the warrior population.
---
Also, it is a hard thing for the rogue to properly pull off. But a skilled rogue doing this is disgusting. At least versus a frost mage you know you’re fucked already
---
It's just experience, not really skill. The rogue just plays this like a PvE encounter because just about everything the rogue does is reactionary to something the mage is doing.
---
Hrmm. The Alliance? Or Garithos? Or are you talking about the Night Elves? Or the internment camps where they held alien invaders backed by the Legion that almost wiped out humanity and life on Azeroth?
---
Wow, lick some more boots.
---
Then he should word it that way, instead of "jesus" and "looking sad". He is the one overreacting. Spending your entire paycheck from last week on bills is not unreasonable for someone making an average income. Everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about.
---
Back when your screen was filled with skills. Now I’ve got about 8 buttons on my screen.
---
I can call in sick whenever I want. The idea is sick days is ridiculous anyways. If I’m sick, I’m sick. If I don’t want to go to work, I’m sick.
---
I'm not talking about basic newbie items like Linen Cloth. There's no meaningful profit margin in that stuff.
---
I'm talking about snatching underpriced Black Lotuses or hoarding Shadow Blades or monopolizing the Felcloth market, etc.
---
Yeah the examples I gave were a little extreme for comedy purposes, but I'm very responsible around stuff like this-- I only play games after my daughter has fully gone to sleep, which I can only reliably say starts at 10pm. But in the \_rare\_ case that she has a bad night, WoW gets dropped like a hot potato. Which is why I want to self-select into a group where this is an expected and acceptable (occasional) occurrence.
---
its more casual friendly because theres other aspects to the game other then just high end raiding and mythics. theres alot of things you can do solo or make your own content with ie professions, random world pvp. things like small dungeons matter more and are more accessible since things like [raider.io](https://raider.io) and gearscore arent a thing. you also meet alot of people while leveling and doing random stuff. the game was originally marketed towards a casual audience because it was made to be a less hardcore everquest while bfa focuses only on high end pve.
---
This is definitely a good idea, I've done this and it cleared a lot of stuff up about how classes work at 60, which is what you want. Be aware it misses a few things though, like Warlocks being unable to generate soul shards..
---
Eh idk I'm 27 and watch twitch regularly. Played Vanilla starting in '05. Started watching streams in college around 2011. Though I've always been big into gaming as a hobby so any way to consume more content while not actually playing games was fun for me. Naturally twitch/streaming provides that outlet.
---
I don't think it's entirely age related, but idk I guess maybe those 5 years makes a big difference?
---
this is the problem with streamers there are popular but no progamers.
---
DM'd you. Or add me on Discord: Ownaron#3071
---
Thanks for the links, I couldn’t get them to work for myself so thanks for extra work there.
---
The Wand Specialization is mostly for the odd cases where I need to kill something when out gathering resources or hunting for something random. Not for use during anything group related.
---
Spell Warding would be the first talent I would drop but I enjoy the excessive survivability when it comes to PuGs. Maybe I would drop it for Improved Renew and Improved Prayer of Healing.
---
He even agrees, how is that woosh material? Of course he understands its /s.
---
Got a link for that quote?
---
Yeah. Would basically ruin my plan to be the first to a few reciepe vendors though
---
I don't understand your post.  You seem to be implying that I shouldn't be annoyed by someone's behavior if they're doing it in the name of making money.  Why does monetizing their annoying behavior somehow make that behavior less annoying? 
---
You monetize a service, a product.  They're monetizing hot air, because you don't realize you've wasted your time until you've finished watching - by which point they've got their advertising view.
---
IMO, this is no different than the "CLAIM YOU FREE GIFT - CLICK HERE!" pop-ups that lead you on a never-ending quest of giving away your personal information without ever giving you the promised gift.  It's predatory and exploitative.
---
I see the boost items in the backpack, your boots was spent on this character :)
---
I've got a decent-sized group of friends looking to start playing again, so we'll likely form our own little leveling guild and take things relatively slow. I'm going to roll an orc hunter and just enjoy leveling up and chilling in Azeroth with my friends like it's 2005 again. No long-term plans.
---
Anyone else miss ventrilo?  Discord is nice but the simplicity of vent was great.
---
From what I recall  Lillith  was a dude and he was not the most pleasant person.
---
Frost mage is such a brutal hard counter to a warrior that the mere sight of one just fills you with defeatism, lol
---
No mustard! Ketchup only!
---
Troll shaman, WPL.
---
I think DKP for most things but loot council on specific items like bindings, stuff to gear up tanks, etc. I wouldn't let a rogue use DKP on TF bindings no matter what because TF on a main tank is such a big TPS increase for the raid.   
---
For most other things though DKP should be used as a way to reward attendance.
---
This is one of the reasons I'm still contemplating on class choice. 
---
Nostalgia pulls me torwards priest as it's the one I played in vanilla, but warrior would be cool too. Then again being able to stealth into enemy cities to cause havoc with rogue would be so fun.
---
I do! Raided a bit with him! :)

I'd been keeping an eye on it, but I hadnt seen those (and admittedly have not read 100% of all the posts there)  
---
Part of the problem is that at my child's stage of development, I only get about 1 solid hour per night to play-- so right now guilds talking about raiding are out of reach.
---
If servers aren't down for a week, is it really no changes?
---
Personally, I'm going to profit from any edge I can get early on with the thought that more cash early will allow me to fund more and better alts to farm more later.
---
Another way to look at it is, if you cash in now and build your captial, you'll have more cash to invest in later. If you are waiting to cash in later, there is more risk in hoping your material investments will sell at the level you want and in the meantime you'll be stuck on the selling side and might not have the liquid cash to invest in an emerging "hot" market
---
I've been opted in for betas for over 10 years, since the first time you could do it (no idea when that was, 2005?).
---
Never seen a single beta.  Not one.  Feelsbadman.
---
I plan to AH everything I'd normally vendor, at the lowest amount the system will allow. Call it my "good deed contribution".
---
So he made a mistake? What competitive advantage does he gain from this? Does his viewer count increase...? That doesn't mean he should be written off lol
---
Asmon peaks at 30k you peak at 2k lmao
---
have bank alts and wait until it's a seller's market for whatever you are trying to sell.
---
29 and same.  I just cannot get into watching streamers.
---
I actually have a really close friend i used to play wow with that streams, and i legit cannot even watch hers.  It just bores the crap out of me.  I'd rather just play the game, even if im bored with everything on it.
---
So from your opinion, amass stacks of valuable items and send to alt banker, then go for market?
---
Not sure about 30min videos because realistically even 10 is a stretch for a lot of content creators and 30min vids stray away a lot of people just because of the length. 
---
In theory if every video was 30mins and every view you got was 30mins you would be right but it's not realistic.
---
OH SNAP YOU GOT ME BRO I'M DONE
---
Razadin during TBC you mean?
---
Yuk
---
It's casual friendly as in you don't need to get to endgame in order to enjoy yourself. You get a fullfilling experience even when you're leveling.
---
I think that's what I'm leaning towards
---
Weird flex
---
The thread is sorted in Contest mode, so different posts will be on top when you refresh it.
---
I've seen several guilds that advertise themselves as like "Raids for Dads" casual stuff, and I'm sure a lot more will appear in that thread as time goes by and the sub explodes in subscriber count.
---
Yes, it would. Streamers, content creators, endgame raiders, they all want to get to 60 asap.
---
Dark edge of insanity on a ret pally... *shudder*
---
If you're planning to be active around 10pm PST I'd love to help :D
---
Mage. DM AOE farming.
---
Yup. Stuff you know is either in high demand or is comically underpriced due to surplus supply. Grab it, hoard it, resell in P2 or P3 for 1000% profit.
---
Theres literally a post pinned at the top of this subreddit with guilds advertising lmao :D
---
I don't mind them. I actually watch Asmongold videos every now and then when he talks about Classic or reacts to Classic videos. But I've not once watched him live, or any other WoW streamer for that matter. I don't even know many other streamers? Sodapoppin? But he has been around forever and I only know of him bc memes.
---
I'd just rather not roll on the same server as one to avoid the potential headache it could be. With that said, I think it is kind of overblown. Rolling on the same server as a streamer, in the long run, PROBABLY won't do much to ruin your game experience. Probably.
---
How do these posts not get removed but when I ask for legitimate information about Shamans or Shaman communities it gets removed for low effort? Mods are retarded.
---
Thumbs up for KaoS! Used to play a in there (during vanilla) for some time! Great people to meet IRL :)
---
Make one... Advertise it everywhere, then update which server once you get to choose.
---
Look, they didn't try *that* hard.
---
“ If I was doing it for the money I would corner myself as the only retail streamer and inherit all those who want to watch retail. It is easy 1 + 1 shit in streaming” 
---
That’s all I needed to read. People don’t realize you’re taking a pay cut in your profession just to play. 
---
I used to be against avocado, now it’s tolerable and not the end of the world. My favorite salsa has it, not so bad.
---
Deadwind pass, there were no more quests so i had to grind from 57 - 60 on the ogres there. Took me two days i think.
---
Well, for sure I will never join a loot council guild as point of view is the most biased thing in the world.
---
DKP is the fairest of all. If a guy get the BiS and never show up again, so what?! He did his job anyway, otherwise he would not have enough DKP to get the item.
---
I made it a point at the time to always get my final level in Alterac Valley for some reason, I got to level 60, 70 and 80 there, after each expansion.

What Mic do you have there? Apparently everyone posting their battlestations has a fancy floating mic, I had no idea that crappy headset mics werent the norm
---
When Classic launched, it was the most casual MMO ever made.
---
Obviously, now there are many more "convenient" MMOs (retail WoW included), but I don't think that makes them casual, per se. I think they are more solo-friendly now but not as casual... systems like AP grinds and rep grinds (which are currently world quest counters) make you FEEL like you are falling behind if you don't play for a few days.
---
In vanilla, it wasn't really about constantly grinding daily THINGS to improve your character. You could much more easily come and go and not fall super far behind.
---
I put this in another similar thread:
---
* In BFA there are way more catch up mechanics with every patch.
---
* In vanilla, there were fewer reasons to care that you were behind.
---
Ahh ok unless you’re MTing as warrior I’d go human for the looks and sword spec 👍🏽
---
Can you please elaborate on points 2 and 3?
---
As a nightelf you can stealth with your pet. As an orc you'll look like you should be holding an axe rather than a bow. At least roll a troll.
---
Always agree on that one! :P

Hi, /u/borschtcannon
---
Swe? ;)  
---
Was fun times trying to keep up with you guys (ooth), sucked when you left to Frostmane.
---
Esfands great. I enjoy staysafe too. I appreciate the videos he’s making now discussing phase 1 preraid bis gear but one thing to note is - in the Warlock video he took work that was done by Zephan from the classic warlock discord and didn’t mention any credit. The guys done extensive theorycrafting and deserves to be mentioned. But it’s worth it to make videos so the info is easily accessible, just a mention of where it came from is appreciated.
---
Yea people like that will be everywhere.
---
If people aren't logging on the obvious way to have an active guild is just increase the size. There will be a lot of guilds filled with people who only play a few hours a week. 
---
Even hardcore raiders generally join leveling guilds if they haven't figured out what they wanna do. Most of the server will start the game in very casual guilds with huge attrition.
---
Modern WoW architecture handles 40v40 and similar densities of players outside instances worse than ever before. 
---
They maybe be not *public* beta but there will be betas as Vanilla had zero phasing. 
---
What makes you think emulation doesnt necessitate beta testing? Again, a public beta might not happen, but there will be betas undergoing testing.
---
Yeah of course, but at the same time I want a solid gaming experience and depending on the server populations, this is a necessary change.
---
I understand people wanting to keep it within your own server, maybe you should be able to opt in/out of playing crossrealm within the battle group? Idk how difficult it would be, obviously higher queue times for BGs. But tbh that's a long ways down the road anyway
---
When Im talking about casual friendly Im talking about things like no dungeon finder, weapon skills, not having money to learn all spells. not having money for your 40 mount, slow and less plentiful flight paths. less quests more grinding. no quest tracker. things like that I feel will dissuade a lot of new players
---
Iv seen his streams and he doesn't even play games, they just meme and "discuss" classic. Do people really like that kind of content?
---
&gt;different posts will be on top when you refresh it
---
Cool, I'll scan it some more, thanks!
---
He was in Doom Squad afair.
---
don't just "lean towards" it, DO IT.
---
the Auction House in Classic is gonna be a shitshow for at least a few months.
---
send anything of value you find but can't use to your bank alt, and just wait out the shitstorm.
---
Silithus as well, ran out of quests. Purely grinded a half level from 59-60. One bar per session. Took forever. I regret nothing
---
Not really. I raided ret through all of aq and naxx. My buddy was a shadowpriest. Raiding in vainlla was more about getting 40 warm bodies than anything else. And if you're a skilled player on top of that? You can outperform most average people. Everyone here seems to think they're world first raiders when none of you are lol.
---
lol what? how does this make him an asshole?
---
DKP works fine 😊
---
To my fellow ESTP. Do you even need friends that corrupt your soul so much? Abandon them. They're just holding you down.
---
Hello,
---
About me: I am looking to get back into MMOs, as vanilla was a huge part of my childhood. I was in high school when this was current. Fast forward 12-15 years, I am 30 with wife and baby….couldn’t be happier. I enjoy my games but nothing has hooked me like WoW did. Overall, I am nice guy looking for other nice players. 
---
Goal: I want to experience that magic they called Vanilla. I will be making a mage and focus on PvE content. 
---
What I am looking for: A guild that understands that I will be late to raids and doesn’t mind that I am not a core member. I will only be able to play on weekdays after 10 EST(usually) until 12EST.  In terms of gear, I will never take any BIS over my fellow mage members from a raid. Dungeons, we can duke it out J
---
Experience: I was part of a guild that transferred to another server to open up AQ. Amazing experience. We ended up raiding into Naxx. I believe I hit rank 10 or 11 in PvP. At one point, I understood my class.
---
\-Prefer a server located on the east
---
Same! So fucking stoked
---
It's more casual friendly because you dont need to play a ton of hours and do daily stuff to keep up with gear progression, you stop for 2 weeks or play less in bfa and you fall behind really quick, I know it first hand, content gating sucks be it by gs, quest/achievement progress or whatever
---
Sure can
---
can we hate about s8 in this sub too pls
---
Ask Blizzard. I want an RP-PVP realm.
---
&gt; MoP
---
Unironically better gameplay than Vanilla+TBC+WotLK combined
---
I read this in Dwight voice.
---
I don’t care about Assmonger or anyone that actually regards what he says.
---
Thats it, go in and read it .
---
Essentially the same as every other patch throughout vanilla and TBC.  RNG stun/controlled stun/KS/poly/fear/blind all have their own.
---
My understanding is this so far:
---
&gt; How populated shards are
---
&gt; How far sharding extends
---
I was under the impression that sharding is only for the starting zones and only for the first few weeks until the server population starts spreading out so I imagine that they will be tweaking this live. As such, even Blizz probably doesn't know the details. 
---
&gt; What mods the client will support
---
Should be same as retail but they may end up tweaking it since retail has different limitations compared to vanilla. Good question. 
---
&gt; Experience values
---
same as vanilla
---
&gt; Quest route verification
---
I'm unsure of what this means
---
But the rest of this will be the same as vanilla
---
&gt; Spawn locations (Mobs, Nodes etc.)
---
&gt; Item availability/version types
---
&gt; What Raid UI is available
---
&gt; Raid boss difficulty (Assuming we can hit 60 and Ony/MC are available)
---
Except this last one. While the numbers and such should be the same, I imagine that in-game the challenge will be a little bit lower as the general population is a bit less ignorant. I've actually been curious about this myself. 
---
With the massive time-sink that is vanilla, I can't imagine that they'd release a beta to test this sort of stuff though. It would require a significant commitment just to test and I can't imagine that many people would want to commit to that just to have their characters reset come the final release. All the actual content is already years old. The infrastructure stuff is already developed and honed (if you can call it such) through retail and all of the tweaks they have to make to get the classic content running on the "modern" platform can be tested internally. I'm sure there will still be plenty of bugs, beta or not, if either retail or even vanilla were any indication.
---
And if his opener applies crippling? Not enough distance with cheetah to get out of his ranged range, meaning he can daze you. (remember facing this alot as hunter)
---
Another goddamn vague hint from a streamer? Great, just what we needed.
---
It's more casual friendly because there's less of a barrier to entry for meaningful content. For a long time now, retail has had a strict focus on endgame raiding and PvP content, which is pretty poor for casual players. In Vanilla, almost the entire game is meaningful content, including the journey to 60.
---
It also helps that in Vanilla, you don't have that rush to reach the "current" content. IMO one of the biggest mistakes Blizzard ever made was segregating their high and low level players onto different continents. Everything is kinda there around you, all the time, and even if you don't get to personally experience hardcore endgame content, you're still interacting with the people that do.
---
I'mma laugh if it's just a list of realm names. Speculation isn't truth lol
---

What I'm saying is that if they want to thrive in the YouTube environment they CAN NOT make the ideal videos. If they presented the video without a flashy title and video that was not 10minutes long they would get nowhere thus not being worth their time in the first place.
---
IMO, you don't watch YouTube and don't understand the fact that YouTube basically forces some behaviour that is not ideal to succeed on the platform.
---
And as a side note not every content is ment for every kind of person. Maybe they are not 100% accurate all the time but from the few videos I have seen I do think they put in research. For a casual player their videos are good. 
---
I think the main reason they are disliked on here is because the main audience of this sub is still more on the hard core side. When classic releases and casual players start flooding this sub I would not be surprised if one of their videos reaches the hot page.
---
Edit: deleted 2 posts because my shitty internet literally sent 3 of the same post

-What's their overarching goal?-
---
Keeping the elements in balance and to become worthy enough to properly assist the Orcs and Trolls back on the path of Shamanism.
---
-Are they searching for someone, seeking vengeance or power, looking for an artifact?-
---
The Earth speaks of ancient cities buried in sand and snow that hold items of power. The idea of these falling into the reckless Dwarven miners, Gnomish engineers, and ignorant Humans fills him with much dread. If he were to acquire and secure these, maybe they could be used to better protect the Elements from unrest?
---
Also feel free to share your planned alts and their stories too!
---
I wanna see the bfa casuals questing alone like they like in the depths of vanilla caves
---
&gt; What I'm saying is that if they want to thrive in the YouTube environment they CAN NOT make the ideal videos. 
---
I understand that.  I don't care.  Their desire to profit from a crappy business model doesn't mean I have to like it.
---
Reminds me of people who work for major oil companies, they dont wake up evil, brush their  teeth evil, make breakfast evil, help their kids get on the bus evil. The job they do is irrevocably destroying the environment and poisoning our drinking water but they are handsomely paid out the ass to ignore that, to them it's just a job.             
---
I'm sure Asmongold and all these other big name streamers are well aware of just how shitty they make the servers they choose to be on, they dont care if they ruin one guys time or a thousand, they dont encourage their army of followers to be shit heads but they also are paid to ignore it. As long as they get views and money I dont think they give a flying fuck how much they ruin Classic WoW and thats why I dont like them.
---

Why wouldn't you use your tier sets? You want less hit and more stam but apart from that your priorities are very similar. You just wear the best you have, maybe swap a few really stam heavy pieces for duels if you can be bothered.

---
Ooohhh when you said barely competing for loot I thought you meant you weren’t even in consideration to get loot. I see what you mean now.
---
&gt;	Hunters might be a little bit worse in Classic compared to what they’ve been on private servers simply due to the fact that there will be a much longer time between new raids to get other classes geared.
---
Could you clarify this then? Rereading it, wouldn’t the fact that a phase rollout making other classes take longer to get geared make Hunters competitively *better* since later gear doesn’t favor hunters?
---
There's no particular sense to it and the hate is completely disproportional. People are just bored and dying to be upset about something. There's also a ridiculous amount of gatekeeping when it comes to content and content creators on this reddit.
---
Good thing the world doesn't revolve around you :D
---
You're very welcome, hope you find a good home for Classic :)
---
what else would I do on Reddit, waiting for Classic?
---
Without so much as a 'kiss my foot' or 'have an apple'.
---
I mean they're definitely on slower side. You say as slow as I describe but I'm going off of other threads on this sub. It's all speculation as no one has played true vanilla in a long time and PS aren't the most realistic portrayal imo. 
---
Regardless, palas are on the bottom half of the 9  classes for sure (warr obviously being slowest), but whether they are 6th or 7th or 8th is probably up to the player in a lot of ways and there likely isn't much difference overall in the time put in.
---
Like I said, hopefully paladins aren't too bad cuz I plan to roll one eventually, but I've had a hard time choosing a class and studied up a solid amount . While it's all speculation, from all the research I've done about choosing a class, most people's opinion is that paladins are the second or third slowest leveling class in the game.
---
JUST
---
DO IT
---
don't let your dreams be dreams
---
why do you even keep posting here, I doubt youll find any friend whatsoever here, is that not clear. Youve proven several times that you lack backbone. People generally dislike that.
---
I joined late in Vanilla and wasn't rushing. Never knew BC was coming out until it sort of landed in my face. Hit level 57 before the Dark Portal opened.
---
Yeah I misread it. That makes sense
---
You know it! I remember you Rapster, nelf hunter right? I stayed on SH until TBC when &lt;WHO&gt; (or was it &lt;Who&gt;? can't remember) disbanded. Played a nelf rogue myself called Morwath.
---
It's crazy but it's so true. You can never done 60 and still have a blast.
---
My YouTube feed is full of people trying to cash in on vanilla. Tips definitely falls into that category. I wish him well, I'm just not the target audience because I actually played the game extensively in vanilla and on several private servers.
---
I never knew backbone meant taking it in the ass on the internet and being a doormat. Good call
---
Beta would help us know even more about their intentions and capabilities with the game though. We'll find out how the servers handle large amounts of people, how respawning works, how much the rainbow pony mount costs in the cash shop, how buggy it is, etc. 
---
All of these will be part of determining whether or not Blizzard works with the kind of passion/skill that'll make this better than private servers. 
---
Of course I'm gonna play it anyways, but it'll need to be excellent in most or all of these aspects for me to never go back to vanilla private servers. They need to make an excellent version of wow classic, and beta will be a big help at determining their level of commitment to that excellence.
---
I'd much rather have a release date, but seeing beta footage and seeing Blizzard blow our minds with excellent server performance and flawless gameplay would be so hype.
---
You really think Blizzard isn't going to give an official announcement when the time comes? Why are people so triggered at streamers "teasing" information. Do you guys feel like Blizzard is just going to hand the reigns over to these content creators entirely or something?
---
I'm just confused where this outrage is coming from since anyone with a brain should understand marketing atleast a bit (maybe I'm giving people too much credit). They're building hype through multiple channels. Super simple. Super common. When the day comes Blizzard will release the announcement.
---
&gt; 6) The constant brigade of unnecessary speculation. It's making people rage about things like loot trading, sharding, and the beta when it really wasn't even news in the first place, and everything blizz has released actually looks pretty good.
---
This whole post is pretty much how I feel. Point 6 is especially egregious though because it can impact everyone including those of us who avoid watching those 10-minute youtube videos of bs speculation.
---
Padding a video out so you can make extra money isn't doing anybody any favors. It compromises the product you create, so instead of having something you can stand by now it's just some shit you have to do to fudge the algorithms, and this sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
If you're just doing it to make a living there are far more efficient ways to make $100 than spending a week editing videos you don't give a shit about.
---
I don’t really get all the hate for Tips. While he may not have the best content he does have a lot of solid videos that I and I’m sure plenty of other people enjoy. The dudes just making videos about something he’s clearly very passionate about and people shit all over it.
---
Human Paladin, EPL
---
MEO? Was that their marketing slogan? What, was MMO not epic enough?
---
Suprised no one mentioned shimmering flats tbh
---
I usually only play in semi-casual guilds but joining a guild that purposely focuses on mother fuckers going AFK? Nah, I think I'll pass on that shit.
---
No one cares what a retail shill like you have to say about classic. All you do it sit on your dead stream mocking people who wants to play Classic because **YOU** think it will fail and therefore it must be true. In your little head anyone who disagrees with you is wrong. 
---
How such a braindead person like you can have 2k viewers is beyond me haha... So stick to being a retail shill and speak good for BfA even though WoW has never been in a worse state than it is now.
---
you nail it. We, the people who have been pushing it for years deserve this game. Every person who went to private servers, making them a big deal. Vouching for the true desire for the game that isnt blended by nostalgia. This wasnt done by any of these big streamers(exceptions possible)
---
imagine being so full of yourself you tell people to take the day off work just to watch you talk about "nochanges"
---
UD Shadow priest questing to level 10 then grind mobs to skill skinning to 50. After this meeting with mate in crossroads. Day 2 finish ratchet and crossroads. Day 3 i pick up all fly points and explore a bit.
---
day 4 normal questing and leveling but no dungeons before level 50.
---
No twinks no bank char.
---
Of course they do. For the larger guys this is their job. They started with something they enjoy and are now making a living off it. If you had the chance to double your income by stretching a video an extra minute or two you would absolutely do it. Anyone complaining a youtuber waisted their precious 2 minutes needs to reevaluate their time if its really that precious to them.
---
It's a crockpot pizza recipe, you know people love slowly cooked pizza.
---
Most of them literally specify "we don't know if this will work exactly like retail this is all guess work but..."
---
And if you truly believe that vanilla was that much different than a modern pserver you are delusional. The armour values can't be exact sure and the trash spawns are not perfect but the main part of it is basically the same.
---
Last off you NEED to make YouTube videos at least 10minutes long to gain any success on YouTube. I'm sure there is at least one person on YouTube who makes 5minute videos that you have no idea about because YouTube does not recommend them. If the content isn't for you why bother watching anyway. Just read the blue post yourself.
---
According to perplexity (best rogue around imo) it's Ret pal
---
Can confirm. Quite terrible.
---
Some streamers are worth watching just for their personality alone. Guys like Staysafe  (Hi Twitch!) and Asmongold are awesome people who are fun and entertaining without needing to play or show a game. It's like they're  your cool friend that you never get to meet IRL at all but you still look up to him.
---
Others are just straight up trash, repetitive and trying to live off being live every day playing the same old trash games and trying to appeal to younger kids.
---
Then again, streaming isn't as easy as turning on your shitty face cam and racking up those twitch primordials. So I understand why some people struggle to break through.
---
Anyway, I feel that the notable Classic streamers and supporters are sort of like our spokespersons between us and Blizzard, so like it or not, they have an important role to play right now.
---
Silithus grinding some of those worms with my warrior. i remember it like it was yesterday
---
Can do you one better: https://web.archive.org/web/20041105010143/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/openbeta-faq.html
---
See sections
---
"Do I need to go through FilePlanet to get into the open beta?",
---
"Do I have to be a FilePlanet subscriber to sign up for the open beta at FilePlanet?",
---
and 
---
"Will there be a limit to the number of people who can play the World of Warcraft open beta?"
---
All three of them reference the limited number of entries.
---
How do you know that they didn't bring in the streamers to build hype while they are going to drop the big "beta x day, release y day"?
---
The long, long con.
---
To me WoW is the only game in history that deserves a full 10/10. Nothing else comes even close. But only classic, It was losing a point each expansion.
---
I got really used to using DialogueKey in Legion, I really hope it works in the hybrid client
---
The thing is they will likely be in large enough numbers to form their own groups/guilds and still be toxic without really having to worry as much about social consequences.  
---
And given that the size of the fanbase of the streamers we are mostly griping about is in the five or six digit range, usually with a few thousand viewers during streams. Server caps are a (flexible, apparently) thing and it’s not unreasonable to consider that when a big name streamer is streaming that the server they are on may quickly hit it. That sort of thing will also cause headaches.
---
Or, if he plays retail, uses the Swapblaster liberally to launch teammates to their deaths. I know I did every raid night.  
---
“God DAMNIT Draco!!!”
---
Nice phrased. You can see that happening often. Whenever people are like " i did x or like x, so roast me, or ahte me for it", is just basically the atempt of taking validity out of presumed criticism. Its a pretty common thing, but yea its bs ofc.
---
Yeah, correct. The rumour at the time was that he allegedly hacked multiple people himself. He had plenty of haters so it's difficult to tell the truth from fiction though.
---
God that show is such trash now
---
NE Rogue on Lightning's Blade.  Dinged 60 grinding mobs in Burning Steppes
---
Sure! I'm assuming you mean the user experience improvements
---
2; SSDs (solid state drive) are significantly faster than hard drives, and result in noticeably faster performance all around; from outside of gaming tasks such as turning the computer on and opening applications, to inside of gaming things like *significantly* faster load times whenever new instances load. Once you try a solid state, it's actually painful to go back to using regular hard drives because they're so much slower. 
---
3; Good Ergonomics. People typically spend a lot of time at their computer; especially in a Classic WoW subreddit, I would expect most users here will be putting in at least a few fairly serious binges when they get the chance. Those binges are all fun and games... until they start triggering back / arm / finger / neck pains because you're spending a long time in positions that the human body simply isn't built to handle and typically not moving. I'm talking things like having your keyboard too low, not using a wrist rest when you should, using the mouse at awkward angles, pinching nerves, having your monitors either too high or too low- those types of issues. There's a variety of ways to mitigate this, and ultimately everyone will have their own versions of what works and what doesn't work; [there are a number of great guides out there that I HIGHLY recommend people check out.](https://ergo-plus.com/fundamental-ergonomic-principles/) I didn't pay much attention to ergonomics until I started playing Overwatch and noticed some discomfort in my mouse arm's wrist and in my neck after long sessions; I found that using more of my arm to move the mouse (larger mousepad) and lowering my center monitor a bit totally eliminated the discomfort.
---
Srsly, go rogue.
---
I played rogue in classic and i loved the fact to be able to sneak around in open pvp / bgs early on.
---
Even leveling is fun because you will always be an unseen threat to everyone in Stranglethorn (etc.).
---
If you go for a Spec requiring daggers you wont have to compete very much (besides nasty hunters). Maybe some druid will ruin your day because he „needs it for his feral gear“. But besides that your gear is more or less uncontested.
---
Im goinh to roll warrior just because i tanked everything since tbc and had a lvl 60 warrior twink with sulfaras and tf. I love the fact to be vital for a group and plan on leveling as a duo with a pala. Otherwise i would go rogue again :)
---
&gt;There is no need to do a beta test on Classic Wow. The systems have been tested 14 years ago. The engine has been tried and tested since Legion was released. The underlying server and network infrastructure has been tested for the last 14 years.
---
Just because individual parts have been tested does not mean the combined whole will magically work perfectly.
---
Your second point doesn't make sense because the vast majority of people won't play the beta.
---
A PTS would do the same job 🤔
---
What I gather is that it just kept him logged in, and when he got a whisper it would play a sound, or when a BG popped, it would play a sound. It wasn't actually playing the game or progressing his account in any way, it was just for notifications.
---
*Why are you so angry that people watch videos they end up not liking? Instead of getting super  defensive about Youtubers, you should just ignore those comments. Not sure why people failing to worship the ground streamers walk on is getting you so worked up.*
---
See how silly this type of attitude can be?
---
It’s not a terrible glare for you? Sun right in your eyes?
---
&gt;people tell their friends even if they’re under NDA
---
Even if this very bold assumption was true, to then go on and assume that their trusted friends who they broke NDA to would also go and tell everyone...you do understand the implications of breaking NDA with a multi-billion dollar company are right? You don’t fuck with that.
---
Sorry -- ***artists.***
---
Its treason then
---
Oh yes. The demand is going to be insane.
---
the nerve right!
---
i think its a hyperbole
---
Uhh.. ok
---
Not typically.  Close the blinds a bit if need be.  Indirect or filtered light if the setup allows.
---
What's MSA?
---
His character moved on it's own in order to not get AFK flagged. That's 100% botting and that's why he slept with sound at max level... so he could reply to GM whispers that were checking him out.
---
Having 40 warm bodies does not equal "viable" raid spec. I guarantee if a mage, warlock, or rogue came along wanting to join, you and the shadow priest would be gone in an instant, unless most were people you already knew. Did they have a place in those 40 warm bodies? Sure, because numbers matter. But, along with oomkin, in a long fight, they were not actively sought. It was more of a "we're short a few, so we'll take what we can get."  I'm not trying to be condescending. It's a well known fact that pallies were generally forced into healing roles.
---
Holy crap! I never realized how low my monitors are! Thanks for the comment!
---
I would be incredibly fucking annoyed, and that would always be how I felt when I started my adventure in classic wow. I don't think that they want people's very first memory of their product to be one of missing out. I'm planning on taking a week off work for launch, if it just dropped on me randomly I would be livid. Far from what the internet expects, you can actually maintain a job and still want to play the game hard when it starts.
---
People do it anyway is my point. If there was a CB, we'd know.
---
Then why post in this thread? 🤔
---
3 monitors for me!  
---
One for gaming, one for wowhead, one for a TV/Twitch/YouTube if you’re doing some grinding.
---
I would be down for an all Brit guild. Preferably Horde, and definitely PvP. Don't have time to lead one though.
---
I joined one of the most active guilds I could find for BFA, I played through launch to just before thanksgiving when I took a break and realized I was having very little if any fun in the experience(quit cold turkey). I can tell you that people throw around the word toxic, but this guild was such a diehard group for blizzard and BFA that any guild members who spoke of issues or concerns would face a huge amount of harassment which quickly drove guild numbers down. I raided through heroic G'Huun and kept hoping I would find the spark or sense of community. I came up empty despite my best efforts.
---
Looks like that site doesn't exist anymore.
---
I'm going to play on Macbook with touchpad when taking a dump. Probably gonna look similar to what you're describing. Honestly I don't see much difference between touchpad and touchscreen. Do you wanna forbid laptops?
---
Nice and minimalist. This is goals right here. But are you really not gonna center those paintings on the monitors? Cmon breh
---
Huge JeBaited inc
---
I guess if you get super technical, yeah he had a bot to keep him from getting logged out. You could do the same thing with any modern gaming keyboard's software. Don't try to downplay his achievement though, because that was all him. I doubt a "bot" that strafed left and right occasionally got him GM.
---
Yeah life at 60 for warriors is pretty grim especially if your MS is prot. Most prot wars have hunter alts that they farm gold with.
---
I certainly am not telling anyone to not play hunter. I'm not even saying they're bad dps. But they will not be top dps in the 2nd half of raiding. Not being top dps isnt a reason to not play. And you still NEED them.
---
It does not grow your viewer base. If you want to grow instead of stagnating and dieing off you need to follow some basic youtube algorithms.
---
Creators, even if they wanted to, can't be perfect. They can't appeal to every single person and they can't attend to their every need.
---
Patreon is mainly used by people whos videos take a long time to create or the "money hungry" guys you are so scared of. (And if you make the argument of "Ha! So you agree they make low quality fast to make videos" Yes. That's literally the main point of their channels. They have to make the "classic news" videos as fast as possible so they can get a bigger audience and get the news out first. That's literally what actual news companies do and get a lot of shit wrong).
---
I sincerely can't recall a single loss in our WSG premade while I was most active.
---
Where can I find that desk?
---
Same (originally)
---
Hastily made, stretched out and vapid content. When a single paragraph from a bluepost spawns multiple 10 minute videos from multiple creators, it gets fairly annoying having the community flooded with them constantly.
---
I can't really blame them tbh, the Youtube algorithm really promotes that type of content, and that's where the money is.
---
That said, there's a ton of good classic Youtubers out there, you just don't hear about them as much.
---
Yeah, thats me. In classic gonna roll the same, but without (it was not intended! -.-) legolas look, this time will be female ;)
---
I rerolled horde (tauren hunter) after TBC (since my bow did not ever drop in sunwell and went fuck it rerolling horde mode - farmed it some time ago finally on Rapster) ended.
---
Sucks you guys disbanded, slowly competition was dying off over time :/
---
The difference is that Classic WoW starts at Level 1.  BfA starts at Level 120; leveling is treated as a prerequisite to starting the real game.  in Classic, exploring is a core part of the game, not an inconvenience and time sink.  All these points you list force the player to interact with the world and the other players in it.  When's the last time you made a friend through Dungeon Finder?
---
i could say the same thing to your initial post
---
Only the feral version has a cooldown. Normal Faerie Fire does not.
---
&gt;people do it anyway is my point
---
No, they don’t. That’s my point. I really don’t think you understand the implications of breaking NDA over something so financially important to a company. The proof that I’m right is already here now. If people were just shamelessly breaking NDA left and right we’d probably have a beta date and release date at this point.
---
I would love to help with a guild like this. Please feel free  to DM me.
---
Lmao good one.
---
Lol. The servers would be deserted
---
I won't be using the AH to sell things but I'll be using it to buy things. I have a road mapped out for a vendor path all the way to 60 with my professions that'll net me plenty of gold to get started.
---
Lol come off the being deep thing man, I have my own monetary struggles "you'll never know anything about". I guess you viewed the initial replier's comment as more serious than I did.
---
This is my experience as well. Everyone seems to be an ass hole. I used play horde. But I swapped to alliance now a month ago. The community is different and a little more laid back. So in classic I'm trying Alliance in hopes of the same results.
---
Any contact I had with him was him being an arrogant prick, thats all I remember.
---
Wrath of the Lich Crusade?
---
no it means having no balls. aka u monetizing classic after bashing it either hate classic or dont but dont flip flop like some little bitch
---
Fun fact: Razadin and I went to the movies once! He even paid! Raz I think will probably play Classic although haven't spoken to him in a few months. He has been playing pservers though so he's probably hyped for classic and maybe even reading this.
---
Will do - thank you !
---
27 here, watch twitch daily, watch YouTube daily. Love all the content these guys put out!
---
Lorthar is all-out IRL since a few years back so doubtful if he's coming back to classic, although it would be fun to play with him again.
---
Just play on my server and send me all your shit at +1c vendor price.
---
It also means you don't have to watch it and literally don't need to give any thought in what they are doing. The exact way you ignore the "CLICK HERE" ads.
---
They are providing a service that people aperantly find good enough to watch. Otherwise you wouldn't even know they existed.
---
It's not like they make so much money they can put it 30h in each video and make it perfect just for you. They don't have editors and I bet they don't even make that much.
---
I believe he is getting at the fact that there are so many different ways to play, that you can find things to do aside from only end game raiding. Take myself, casual due to time constraints, and I know I can spend time leveling professions, getting gold to get mounts, do some of the epic quest chains in the game, all at my own pace. It would seriously take me ages to level a toon and all the alts I plan on making up to 60, and I can’t wait! I don’t have to rush to the end to feel like things matter.
---
If he pulls out his ranged weapon you change aspect. Firing takes forever so you have plenty of time to react.
---
a lot of channels have done that, it's downright pathetic how money hungry they are, people like them ruined youtube
---
Progression is super gradual and slow paced in vanilla. You can accomplish almost anything in the game by just chipping away at it little by little. Can't really say that about modern wow where the only thing that matters is raiding and m+.
---
This was me and my buddies favorite thing to do once we were all 60, gather up the boys and hit Gadgetzan like it owed us money.
---
I also noticed tom seguras face in a portal on one of his videos I believe lmfao
---
This is my personal opinion, but all the quests there are really agonizing. They're mostly grind quests which I don't normally mind, but the ones in this zone always seem to take forever. They're either ones where you have to gather quest items with extremely low drop rates (e.g. gathering chimera horns or w/e it was), or they require you to kill mobs of different types with only a handful of spawns each, and each type spawns in a different place all over the zone (e.g. the owlkin quest). It just feels especially tedious to me compared to similar-level zones like WPL, EPL, Felwood, or Silithus. Again, just my personal opinion on the zone.
---
Hey man , at What lvl Can i start doing the rep ?:)
---
Same. Grinding levels and Timbermaw rep.
---
I'll be rolling a gnome warrior love gnomes.
---
There is building hype and then there is creating frustration. I feel like giving streamers info a week in advance they cant talk about is the latter. Would be like me telling my wife “hey I got great news!... But I can’t tell you till next week” it’s a shit move. We ALL want to know. Dangling “Something” I front of us for over a week is just pissing a lot of us off. Im 35 and married. My wife and I both play. We want a release date so we can plan our vacation.
---
Ya you bitch! Never change your mind, pick a lane and dig down baby! I ain't movin for NOTHIN
---
Hi, /u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY
---
Back in my day we used to call them computers.
---
You realize saying "same as Vanilla" doesn't mean anything right? We haven't had access to Vanilla for over a decade, most of us have things planned from private servers which are different from Vanilla. We don't know what these were in vanilla because we don't remember, that's the entire point of half of these questions we want answers to.
---
We don't know if starting zones mean Northshire abby only, northshire abby + Elwynn or even Northshire abby + Elwynn + Westfall. We also don't know if you're going to see a handful of people in a shard or dozens. More questions the Beta might answer
---
And as for Mods being the same as retail? Another assumption that a lot of us would like confirmation about which.. surprise surprise is another question the beta can answer.
---
You might care about getting these answers or putting time in but other people (like me do). I'm simply trying to answer your question about what answers people are looking for.
---
&gt; If you had the chance to double your income by stretching a video an extra minute or two you would absolutely do it
---
It still wouldn't be acceptable if I did it. It's a shitty system and no one should be defending it.
---
&gt; Anyone complaining a youtuber waisted their precious 2 minutes needs to reevaluate their time if its really that precious to them
---
Some of these videos could get their points across in 2 minutes. the other 8 are filler, begging for likes\subs, and beating a few points to death.
---
Mmos are vastly inferior to 90% of single player AAA games in terms of gameplay. If gameplay was the deciding factor for me I never would have gotten past level thirty in vanilla.
---
the madness is out of Blizzard's hands at this point
---
wtf i love blizzard now
---
The grindiest zone! Hit 60 going back and forth between yetis and furbolgs.
---
&gt;It was honestly me talking to tips and staysafe at Blizzcon that convinced me to play it.  Before that I was only gonna try it out.  Don't get me wrong I am retail first but I will go hard for as long as I can.
---
Props for not overdoing with Horde shitz. 
---
Like a normal adult.
---
You don’t need anything till you’re 60! My plan is to take skinning and herbing, and pretty much vendor all the leather on my way to 40, get a mount and then on to 60.
---
Once I’ll change skinning to either alchemy or enchanting and farm gold.
---
hunters sit on their flare, scatter then trap you and kite you
---
warlocks live until they can deathcoil + fear spam
---
mages live till they can get a poly off
---
shadow priests live until they can get a fear off and kill you in 2-3 spells
---
paladins put all their armor on and wear you down with reflecting damage
---
druids are irrelevant
---
holy priests die
---
all this can be, and will be, mitigated by engineering trinkets, consumables, etc... which are a huge part of vanilla pvp (otherwise it's very rock paper scissors)
---
Shar the road maps so we don't get lost
---
I mean warr isn't great, but it's also the most in demand/popular class. It has drawbacks, but also huge benefits. Hunters have great flexibility, gold grinding, solo, and PvP; but at the same time they are far less in demand for raids. It's just a constant trade off on every class.
---
based but also cringe because these threads make more people aware of how shitty most content creators are
---
Is that the HyperX keyboard?
---
You plan on vendoring skins?? That breaks my soul.
---
By lesser known I would say i mean they care more about content,information and originality over putting their face as self appointed leaders. The others seem to legit want to be the spearheads of classic, to be the main people talking about shit people discuss, and to basically appoint themselves as liasons. They act more like subcontractors of blizzard who never got an intern position vs. People who legitimately want to play the game and to make funny content about it. Lesser known to me means people who don't want to just constantly be a public face to a game but instead make enjoyable videos. You really think the likes of tipsout or who the fuck ever are gonna have the most fun PvP videos when release hits? Probably more likely to be boring streaming..watch me grind guys come look at my face talk about how I'm the best min maxer.
---
Orc shaman, jan 2005, winterspring yetis grinding for the pristine horn.
---
But which of those three drops the most wool?  Compared to difficulty of killing the mobs.
---
Cute that you think having a voidwalker out is common as a lock.
---
Fellhunter/suc is &gt; in 85% of situations.
---
Uvula.  The word you are accurately describing is Uvula.
---
cute you think people never world pvp...
---
50% of the time you fight a rogue its while you are out farming
---
Towelie, I have personally been on your stream MULTIPLE times while you BASH the classic community and bash the game. You passive aggressive the shit out of it. Maybe you have changed your mind or have grown more fond of the idea, i get it, but dont act like you have been a champion for it, you talked shit about it, straight up. 
---
THIS is why people bash YOU. Maybe if you owned up to what you said/did and then explained why you are now cool with it, people would be more accepting. Stop trying to act like you never did any of that and people will stop calling you out for it. No need to lie man. The more defensive you get, the worse it becomes.
---
Leveling a warrior may be tedious/hard but once you hit 60, depending on spec, you are the best pve tanking class in prot or one of the elite pvp damage classes in arms. If you want to focus on pve dps you'll have a bit of a wait while you gear but you're capable of pumping out the highest dps in the game in fury. You have to stance dance and push lots of buttons. This class is not boring or bad once you hit 60!
---
if you only read half of someones post and then respond, you're going to look like an idiot. way to keep THAT specific trend alive LOL
---
More frequent phases means less time for everyone to get geared for the next raid. Since hunters gear up much faster this means that they're gonna get a slight boost on the DPS meter. For example, the warrior I'm playing now on a private server is raiding AQ/Naxx but still missing at least one item from MC. So at the beginning of each raid our guild usually saw our hunters further up on the DPS meters because they were as BIS they could get from previous raids. Other DPS classes were missing multiple items from previous raids because they were competing against each other. When new raids release it unlocks more and more replacements and alternatives to the items you were missing, meaning it's easier/faster for the other classes to gear up in late vanilla.
---
Basically what I am trying to say is that: in BIS gear, most classes out DPS hunters in BWL/AQ but they take longer to gear and therefore hunters usually shine at the start of raid progression. 
---
I hope that made it more clear and not the opposite xD

---
Stockade is best. 
---
You can pull big sets. They run to you and a lot of corners to los pull.  
---
You got 2-3 stacks /clear and slot of vendor trash fir a few min worth of job.  I did it as a warlock at lv50~ 
---
In about 15-20min/run. I could have been a lot faster tho.
---
I think people are confusing casual with time consuming.  BFA currently has everything time gated.  Everything requires daily’s (which are super boring).  Also you need to acquire x ilvl before higher ilvl items are available via dailies and such.   This gives these people the idea that classic is more casual friendly since you can jump on and grind your heart out till you have everything.  In BfA that’s not an option since you have to wait for the time gate to be up.
---
In reality tho BFA is still more casual friendly as anyone can get online and queue away for whatever content they are capable of doing.  If they want to progress to harder things is when time gating becomes a problem.
---
I completely agree with you and I love the features I listed. But people aren't use to them. Someone who is conditioned to blizzards hand holding now days will be in for a shock when they try vanilla, until they learn to appreciate it like the rest of us.
---
We had a moonkin in our guild on a private server. It was fine. You can raid with less than 40 players if you want. If you compare your worst dps or healer to the best you will see a massive difference. So getting the absolutely most optimal setup isn't as important as just getting good players.
---
The problem isn't that you can't bring hybrids, it's that they aren't maximizing the potential of the class itself. Could you dps as a druid? Sure but it's better if you heal. So you have to admit you have a player performing less optimally because it's more fun for them not better for your guild. That probably where people get mad.
---
If pservers are to be trusted it seems the Legolas look has gone out of fashion!
---
&lt;Who&gt; was a good guild, although the main issue was that Ludriches/Santac was so stubborn to not recruit replacements during the BT farm so we entered 9 months - 1 year farm with like 33 raiders, and when SWP dropped we could just barely fill the raid. I love the guy (main gaming buddy for a long time, he gave me the glaives, we then played in MM together, etc.) but some things you just couldn't talk him out of.

That would just be “negative”. Toxic is more of a cultural issue, like if everyone here focused on the negative all the time. For example, this sub would be toxic if everyone’s posts here (whether it were a meme, battle-station, screenshot, etc.) were shit on. It’s not really the case at all. Sure there are negative opinions here and there but there’s nothing wrong with that.
---
That truly sucks :/

If you don't like it don't watch it?

I edited them so they fit my 1440p screens ;)
---
I mean if you're getting frustrated over this shit then idk man, I feel a bit sorry for you. Seems so inconsequential in the grand scheme. Take a break from F5 spamming the sub for a bit and come back tomorrow when the announcement is made. It's really not difficult. You can entirely avoid this if you made some effort on your end, yet I feel like people like you willingly put themselves in these situations and then get outraged over it.
---
It'd be like if I went to a store every single day asking when something is going to be back in stock. They give vague answers since they don't know, but say they'll send an email to me when it is back in stock. Yet I keep going back every single day asking when it's going to be in stock citing advertisements telling me it's here.. I'm going to get the same answer I did the last 50 times.
---
Also why are people planning vacation around Classic WoW release if it's so inflexible for them. Just makes no sense. Again another thing that seems fairly easy to fix, but you are willingly hindering yourself over it. Just plan your vacation if your work needs to know.
---
play more games
---
You seem reasonable and level-headed :)
---
Sunstrider EU? Was my first server!
---
Finally a Real unstaged battle Station
---
Same! Troll rogue, and a total noob 😂
---
Yeah, pretty much all till rugged leather. There is no gold in the economy to begin with, will take a good 3-4 months easily before the economy increases. 
---
I can vendor most leather on the way to 60 to pay for my mounts. 👍
---
Yet it works and people regularly tune in and watch. There's an audience. And it doesn't have to be you so why worry about it.
---
My dollar example is small time, these guys have the potential to make a living at it so it is worth while for them.
---
 Ikea has all the answers for you ;)

---
How do you think this would work for PvP?
---
Yeah I quite like trackballs for WoW, hoping to get a CST L-Trac before classic hits. The Logitech's been going for around 5 months with no problems so far, touch wood!
---
Be careful with private server information. There are weapons that add a ton of damage to feral forms that are bugged on 80% of private servers. I'm not saying you are flat out wrong it's just a lot of missinformation is floating around. Stuff like SoR increasing proc rates is something I've noticed a lot of varying information about.
---
So you're defending them on the basis that if they don't produce cashgrab videos their userbase will not grow? All that does is give them an incentive to keep making unwatchable horseshit clickbait. That's why people are hating on them.
---
Lmfao how entitled are these streamers getting. You want me to lose time off that can be used for camping and azeroth this summer to watch you stream, and generate revenue for you to not work. I really hope most these bois alliance
---
My first was epic.  Shadow priest lv 59.99 fighting my last mob to level (a scorpion in sila) 
---
when a orc warrior charge me I dot him and fear him off.  As I’m about to die the mob dies from my dots ding full life and 10s later a dead warrior.   
---
/spit
---
My first 60 ding was a human pally at Tyr's Hand
---
You're doing something wrong.
---
It's statistically impossible you're that unlucky.
---
Winterspring. On the lake killing ghosts.
---
Why bring them in then wait a whole week before anyone can say anything? Again “hey bro I’ve got some exciting stuff to talk about. Stuff you probably want to know real bad... you wanna know now? Nah we gonna make you wait a week.”   It’s a shitty way to give out information. Specially information most of the community has been waiting for since a very bad PR Blizzcon. A definitive release date is what we all need to know. Taunting us with a “maybe” for over a week doesn’t help with hype imo.
---
The Hinterlands
---
&gt;  The dudes just making videos about something he’s clearly very passionate about and people shit all over it.
---
He's very clearly in it for the money and that's it.
---
As a priest, Blackrock Mountain. Nothing like drafting people into the Molten Core Swim Team :)
---
Okay lol
---
No clue, I don't PVP.
---
Ahh yea looks like a fileplanet limitation. Did BfA or Legion ever do an open beta? If Blizzard's last few expansions never did an open Beta that's probably a pretty good sign Classic won't have an open beta.
---
They still play it, because they like it. We want classic, because we loved it. Basically these are two different games. :)
---
It's cuz it's not a beta lol
---
Everyone just shouting it's a beta it's a beta like wild animals based off nothing but pure speculation.
---
What half am I missing, exactly? If you are referring to the skilled part, it doesn't matter. In long, drawn out fights, a skilled oomkin will still run oom. A skilled shadowpriest will still run oom. A skilled ret pally will never have dps as high as some other classes. A skilled pally tank was not able to hold threat as well as a warrior. That was a balance issue on Blizzard's part and was just a part of the game, back then. It's not opinion. It is literally a well known thing that actually happened. I understand you are trying to defend the position of pallies raiding in vanilla, but when you burst out with the name calling, your point is already moot.
---
Nah, do your research; all the necessary information is out there.
---
When you browse this sub everyday and see shitposts nonstop it gets annoying.
---
What could possibly be wrong?  LOL
---
Either I'm opted in or not...
---
Im not big so i can stream pservers, so i dont really mind
---
Farmers Broom, ideally with fiery enchant
---
The towel guy made a comment about everyone putting on their diaper and getting prepared for tomorrow.  
---
Maybe he’s hinting at more than just a closed beta.
---
Hmm
---
Alliance best faction
---
Undead best race
---
Fuck
---
Fear Ward is only a 30 second cooldown.
---
People should play what makes them happy but others shouldn't downplay just how much better Dwarf priest is.
---
Starshards is fucking hot garbage though.
---
Good I’m in the same position.  
---
Family 
---
Work
---
Friends 
---
Games 
---
In that order.  That means I’m not going to raid a lot this time.   I ran a casual guild back then when I burned out.  Just find like minded and it will be glorious.  Slower but progression is not everything.
---
Both Games are super casualfriendly. But Classic requires more time-investment. Most Casuals will probably not even reach 60 in quite a while, especially Wrathbabies who never knew how it was in Classic and TBC.
---
I think the key to loot council is for the decisions to be made publicly in some way. This will show the council is not being corrupt, or will revealed corrupt loot council members if they are being selfish with loot.
---
Pservers are pretty small so you don't get a lot of selection. I like to watch Docken. Chill, mature dude who doesn't act like a reactionary dick weasel.
---
Horde needs more Rammstein. Alliance needs more Zima.
---
I'm talking about average players, not Blizz employees. The only people who know beta date and release date are Blizz right now. But if your average gamer got a beta invite, that info would get out. Chill out dude.
---
And the fact is for many games, testing details do get out despite NDA's. People do it regardless of what the agreement says and realistically companies aren't going to do anything to these people because it's not worth the effort. Maybe they'd get their account banned at worst. Have you heard of New World? It's Amazon's game in closed alpha and people have been yammering about that for months.
---
Female orc no other choice
---
I have a feeling that’s not gonna work this time around
---
My point isnt moot because you clearly never even played vanilla. Your private server experience doesnt amount to anything. Ret pallies WERE in raids. This is an indisputable fact. Because again, the hardest part of old school raiding was finding enough people and said people being consistent raiders and showing up each week. NONE of the bosses in vanilla required min-maxed perfection that people like you seem to think.
---
Warrior will smash dps charts while hunter becomes subpar
---
Not a Brit, but same timezone, close enough at least.   
---
And you guys can make fun of my accent. 
---
Regards from Germany
---
What about herbalism and alchemy makes so much money? I remember raiding at 60 and needing potions and shit but cant really remember what
---
I like having skills current level so I will be getting 50s for my greens instead of waiting a few months to get 1g+
---
How bout you meet me outside of org after release?
---
Pretty strange assumption.
---
He used to a lot, but the last couple of months have been just super chill "just chatting" type of streams. The Classic waiting room were people just hang out and meme around doing stupid shit and linking stupid videos to watch. He uses to stream mostly wow, but some other games as well. He also used to do a lot of IRL streams which honestly are the best, most entertaining irl streams I've seen. Pretty funny. He has really good back and forth sort of improv with random people, he just recently got back from a Taiwan(Thailand?) stream.
---
Anyway, I'm Ramblin. I like the dude, solid fella, always cracks me up. Top tier content imo.
---
Warriors take the most effort but are also the most rewarding.
---
Warrior is a wrecking ball, it feels ballsy and dangerous and powerful. Even levelling when fighting casters and you get to pummel something and MS/OP/execute crit something and then you charge something else and do it again. You just tear through things. You get retaliation and sweeping strikes. You get a big weapon upgrade and feel like a god (once you level your wep skill).  
---
    
---
Hunter you really miss out on that. While levelling really 90% of the time you hunter's mark and tell your pet to attack and wait for something to die, mend pet when you need to. All your pet abilities are on autocast. Effectively you're playing a support class for your pet. You are definitely stronger than a warrior, but you never feel worried or powerful, you never get any big crits or satisfying sounds. There won't be any fancy stance dancing to pummel intercept, and back to overpower. You might FD/trap something occasionally or juggle aggro with the pet but really you just hop around till your pet kills things.  
---
At 60 the actual gameplay is not a whole let better. It takes about 5 mins to get timing your aimed shots well and then your entire gameplay for most fights just becomes hoping your aimed shot crits. Compared to a warrior that's managing rage and execute phases and deathwish and aggro and fear breaks its just really boring. Yes one in 20 fights you might have to cast another button (tranq shot) or kite something but it's rarely difficult or that engaging.
---
Finally, a man of culture!
---
As a private realms vet, over 9 years, I can completely agree with your post.  People in the private scene are very understanding, I have brought up 3 kids and played wow every day.  I ask the group for 10mins afk to deal with kids I usually get 100% understanding.  
---
There are exceptions like trying to do 45min baron run or raids, but thats understandable.
---
Most of the time in 5 man content or in casual raids, even the hardcore player will give you some tolerance.
---
Not anymore! REVOKED.
---
Chill dude. You're raking this way too seriously. You can't honestly think his tweet was serious in that you should call in sick... Cmon Bro. Brain up a bit, eh?
---
Sadly the only screenshot that I have found  Skyddsängeln in vanilla was from AB, cant find anything WSG (wasnt taking mass screenshots sadly in pvp, and even less in TBC).  
---
As its been ages ago, was any of these: Gekko, Drewniok, Kebabn Miajloogr, Phyrre with you guys as well?
---
Used to hang out a lot with Cableguy, Isy, Sistah and Shader (despite being ally lol).
---
You just did
---
My first 60 (Human Warrior) did it in the Eastern Plaguelands grinding Undeads.
---
Eastern Plaguelands killing larvae.
---
I grinded with my UD Priest there from 56 to 60. Oh boy, that was a long grind.
---
But... do you ever bring... *ret pallies* ?
---
Nah mana mounts are terrible
---
You're a pleb if u have one
---
lol holy plaadins can get locked out of their spell tree. So u can be outta combat but not mount, and it burns mana
---
It's a holy spell to summon it
---
Nope
---
Ok. Which server? lul
---
ISTJ - Horde - Mage - Equal focus
---
Enjoy your mud hut and 3 toes t. Beard Gang
---
Do you really expect a lot of selection from classic? It may feel big here because we are the core community but I think overall six months after release the community will be just medium sized.
---
Yeah, and the low texture on everything just made my screen blinding white, to my tired eyes it was a blur.
---
In no world is a stack of linen cloth 5g or even close to 1g. You'll most likely get a few silver above vendor price. I wouldn't even bother with lower level mats on the AH.
---
Hey what is SEO?
---
That’s one of the worst. I imagine it’ll be a lot better on a lower population, than on a private server. But it’s such an open area with nowhere to hide.
---
Less of a focus on "end game" means you can kinda just go at your own pace, whenever you can log in.
---
Also, no dailies/weeklys/whatever. You don't have an arbitrary need to log in every day.
---
Sure, for my friends, the sweeties, for the rest, the leftovers. They are lucky to be raiding with us anyway.
---
I used to hunt down Horde outside of Kargath, then continue ambushing them as they made their way towards blackrock mountain.
---

---
Chuckled when my personality came up as "Defender".
---
I am seriously interested in your guild, as PVE focused player that has literally years of played time in vanilla I would be interested joining your kind of group.
---
I am a single parent, ex PR staff, wow addict.  I am looking to find an EU group to join for the "classic" adventure
---
Was stockades an option in vanilla, I truly don't remember? cause stockades is the best wool farming in the game and why wool is always cheaper on alliance than horde.
---
If you enjoy it then it’s not a waste. If you continuously waste your own time watching shit videos then the problem isn’t on them
---
Imo, SM and Uldaman/ZF are the last dungeons you can do comfortably in an offspec, unless you’ve been meticulous with offspec gearing. Once you get to the lvl 50+ dungeons, its really really hard.
---
Cool! Tell him to contact me, not sure if I have/had him on bnet and/or steam ;) Would be nice if we all managed to roll on same server in Classic (got some old ooth and SH people trying classic as well).
---
This is the conundrum I'm facing
---
I want to be undead rogue so bad but i need my happy zones
---
Yes I’m sure your opinion changed real quick when you saw classic gaining momentum. Have to cash in on the hype, huh? After years of bashing the classic movement. You’re human garbage.
---
&gt;Where I live, it takes 30 worked hours to get 1 hour of paid sick time.  So I essentially rack up 5 hours of sick time a month. Takes \~2 months  to "earn" a  paid "sick day" off. NOT using that for beta vs launch!
---
Epic system. Imagine being scared about calling in sick, because you have used your 'sick days' and won't receive pay for those hours/day(s).
---
I'm glad we have less of these useless streamers here in Europe. Makes it easier to avoid the servers they will play on.
---
There’s a reason why Warrior will be the most popular class by far.
---
Ubrs, right after clearing the first room. I remember people gratsing me on the ramp before the next room.
---
Tips quote from when he was interviewing monkeynews,  A famous private server warrior - "so you mean to tell me.. that demo shout gets Rogues out it stealth!?"
---
That should tell you all that you need to know.
---
It is absolutely known that trolls and undead are extremely racist and despise all living things, respectively.
---
Stoneskin vs rogues is just too useful imo. I'd say gun skills are better than whisp form in the later part of the game.
---
Why are you talking about average players? Average players don't get NDA's to sign.
---
What a non argument.
---
Undead Rogue same place. I want to say it was on a PvP kill but I really don't remember if PvP xp was in then.
---
If you watch the same person’s content constantly even though you think it’s bad, maybe THEY aren’t the problem
---
you fool, i know its /s
---
All these guys will burn themselves out in beta before release.
---
I hope beta lasts only 1 week. not months.
---
Or criticizing you for your hatred of icebergs.
---
My god. You people are fucking toxic as hell and saltier than a thousand unwashed nutsacks.
---
You're taking a few tweets as gods divine decree, when they should *obviously* just be taken as a person who is very excited expressing said excitement and wanting to build up some more hype for classic. 
---
No, don't call in sick to work. Fucking **DUH**. I'm honestly a little disappointed in some of the comments in this thread. My god man, just chill and have fun with it won't ya?
---
Get excited. Classic is coming. Soon.
---
Can't we all just share that excitement without getting upset?
---
And to prove your point here you are hating on the popular past time of hating on streamers.
---
I’m sure some if not most of the actual hate is uncalled for, but let’s be real here: no content creators touched the idea of vanilla or classic before it was announced. The only one I know of was Esfand who actually built a persona around his retpaladin. 
---
The others either actively spoke out against it or didn’t care. That’s fine to, but they should at least address it. They went from people being grateful for it happening, to outright thinking they are pillars of a community who should be thankful for their ten minute breakdowns of a blue post. 
---
These last two weeks are just a culmination of the discontent they have sowed collectively by actively not being a part of the reason we are getting classic wow (private servers, let’s be real, it’s the sole reason this is happening), and now teasing what they seemingly think is some well deserved treat in front of a crowd of people starved of information. 
---
Anyone with half a brain could have solved this for them, by simply saying: “hey guys, we can finally share something really cool with you next week, stay tuned”. Not acting like privileged assholes.
---
Yeah dude, I miss good shit in life because I don't want a fucking warcraft FPS. Lmao
---
If Joe Gamer gets a closed beta invite that is under NDA. How hard is this to understand?
---
its hard to squeeze more than 10k hours into a month lmao
---
For buying, yes. But I think it's worth explicitly stating that for *selling* it's a bad idea, since inflation helps buyers not sellers.
---
Holy shit, what kind of question is that?  
---
What if I want to play as a unicorn, or a nuclear submarine?  I hope that guy stays away from Classic.
---
This makes sense, honestly.
---
39, I watch people play games. Don't watch Warcraft though
---
Felwood and Un'goro
---
I think you have an extra space after your [ which messes it up
---
I'd love to get into the beta. Are you kidding me? I don't care if it was wiped once a week. Would be super fun.
---
You either believe that bandwagon content creators exist or you don’t. And if you do, you would be hard pressed to make a sound argument that their content quality matches that of someone who has knowledge and dedication of classic prior to the hype train. 
---
There’s gatekeeping and there’s opinions based on facts.
---
I hardly have time for gaming myself these days but gonna play every minute of spare time I can ;)
---
INFP - Horde - Druid - DPS - PvP
---
Edit: holy shit INFP + Druid is apparently the real deal
---
My new theory is that those irvine invited streamers get it 1 day early, and public rollout starts Tuesday (NA) and Wednesday(EU). 
---
We'll see :D
---
The OP point we are discussing. Not whether they existed, or not.
---
Barely touched a private server. I played from Vanilla through Wotlk because they game died, after that. And yes, I did raid Vanilla. Yes, They had ret pallies from time to time. I never said they didn't exist in raids. I stated that they were often overlooked unless it got to a point that the raid just needed the numbers. On the very high population servers, it was a real challenge faced by people who mained ret pally and were forced into healing if they wanted to raid. Maybe the small to medium servers were different. But, it doesn't change that their preferred role was that of a healer.
---
What do you mean by medium size? I think I agree if you mean 1.5-3.5 million. 
---
I think it has a chance to go big if blizzard plays it's marketing card correctly because I don't think classic is a lost cause to Gen Z. They just need it to be shown to them through a different angle. Same game, just different talking points on the outside. All about the aesthetics.
---
You can have fun in Classic even if you never see the endgame.
---
Obviously it's a facetious comment.
---
Lmao wow dude. Yeah, seriously call in sick so you can maybe watch someone possibly perhaps stream classic beta. Maybe.
---
Get real.
---
I guess i was trying to demonstrate a concept, rather than set values.
---
The big streamers tend to come from the hardcore crowd. People that run high level mythic + dungeons, mythic raids for server firsts, and arena for titles and high ranks. For these people the fact levelling is quick and easy and you get a mount at lvl 1 and you can get epics through LFG is completely irrelevant, the game starts at max level when you start competing against other guilds. By this measure Classic is very casual compared to BFA. 
---
In Classic, every fight and challenge the game has is already solved. You'll be able to experience and succeed in every aspect of Classic just playing 3 nights a week. Levelling will take a while, but once that's over there's not a whole lot to do. You log on for raids that everyone knows the strategy for and everyone knows the item and spec builds for and you're done for the week. You can grind some appearance stuff if you want like rank 14 or winterspring mount or whatever but the actual gameplay challenges in the game are very easy and straightforward for someone that is coming from high level retail raiding.  
---
Ohgee (I think) did a video on this how the hardcore pve 'meta' has moved on to speedruns and speedkills now that clearing things is no longer a challenge. But that's not why a lot of raiders play, and it's probably not hugely enticing to them. They play to clear new content. There is a very finite amount of that available in Classic, so yeah if they play it's easy to see why it would just be a backburner/downtime game for them, not something they'd get excited about sinking a ton of energy into.
---
World dragon / boss spawn locations
---
I hit 60 in the exact same spot. Remember it well!
---
No direct answer so far. However Blizzard said that you can have 10 chars per server and 50 total. Which means there will be at least 5 servers per region. ;)
---
My prediction is that Blizzard will seriously underestimate the demand and there will be way too few servers at first.
---
sure that's the correct term, but i like the original comment text. it just FEELS better, like when you're in a meeting and manage to satisfy the itch in that spot between your butt and genitals without causing a scene.
---
Orc is the better race because of the hardiness racial. Horde is way more active in world pvp on private servers despite always being outnumbered. 
---
Leveling is the same for both races. Hunter is very easy and smooth to level. Endgame wise Alliance have it a lot easier because of Paladins.
---
Sweet level 48+ ripe for the picking in phase 2.
---
Heck yeah!
---
NO BETA JUST RELEASE THE BEAST LATE JUNE, OR IN JULY.....NO LATER!!!!!!!
---
Same it’s either mage or warrior but who knows until classic release probably
---
They like it because they dont know better.
---
Have a look at this madlad over here.
---
I have absolutely no idea. This sub is inxredibly toxic. For like, literally *no reason at all.* I don't get it.
---
If you don't like them, or don't want to view their content, that's totally fine and I understand your opinion is just as valid as anyone else's. There's no reason to roast people or get salty and rage just because you don't like person ABCs Content, just move on. This is a sub for everyone, for everything Classic WoW.
---
It's not your personal WoW diary or entertainment journal. We're all here, together, for classic. Stop being so divisive and just be happy that we're even here at all and we're getting classic.
---
Cant we just be happy and have a good time? We should all be friends here.
---
Ah gotcha either you hate it or don't or flip flop but if you didn't agree with something then agreed with it isn't that flip flopping? Usual streamer makes money haterade.  Y'all gonna love me tomorrow.  /s
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYepdsfid4w
---
This is a good list of shit where he's off the mark, flat out wrong or misleads in favor of acting like private servers are "miles off".
---
If you know a lot about classic it dawns on you really quickly that he doesn't do any research but rather eats anything at face value that is being fed to him from whatever his sources are. He doesn't care about diving into the specifics himself, he just spews out anything and package it as a "vanilla fan" in order to, yes, live a life as a content creator. Nothing of value has ever been created by Tip. Nothing.
---
Absolutely vendor skins. They only fetch what, 10-20% over vendor prices? But then, you need to account for the huge volume that goes into the AH, vs. the small number of buyers since most people can just get what they need anyway. So a lot of it doesn't get purchased, or someone undercuts you by 1sp. Then, you have to eat all the deposits, which are usually going to be more than the margin over vendoring.
---
So unless your skins sell the first time you list them, every time you list them, it's just not worth it. And that doesn't even account for the added time of listing them all on the AH, and the postage cost of mailing them to a bank alt, or the lost inventory space of carrying them around till you hit a mailbox/major city.
---
you mean july right :D
---
May I ask, people who doesnt care about beta, do you play private servers?
---
I can understand if you play on private, that your in no hurry to join a beta, but if you arent (like me) then im alittle surprised if you arent interested in trying it out
---
Can confirm as a bad rogue. I get my ass kicked every time. I am very good at warrior but, for some reason I can't seem to wrap my head around the rogue class. It's the only class I simply can not play even a little. Which is why I am running it when classic drops. I am going to be a damn good rogue or die trying.

2005-2010 I literally played nothing but WoW. Name me a single other game that could entertain a guy for 5 years straight without breaks (and it's not like i quit it because i got tired of it either, it just wasn't the same game anymore). After that i was looking for my next big thing, and i went through hundreds of games on steam in the following years, but nothing could hold my interest for more than a couple of weeks (even massive games like skyrim only have about 200 hours of actual content in them).
---
And it's not just about the quantity but also quality. When i first saw/played WoW it literally blew my mind, no other game has made such an impression on me before (or since). And it didn't wear off until end of wrath when the game started going downhill.
---
Main reason I want a beta is so add on creators can figure things out and start working on stuff for launch day.
---
I believe they're known as GRIZZLY. They were One of if not the "top" US guild on Nost
---
they are unauthentic and their content is mostly shit. we love the game, they love the profit.

Guilds in WoW have a variety of goals. No single guild will ever fit every person’s play style, social needs, or progression goals. The core of Pretty Good has found that we value playing together and growing as a group more than any other element of this game. Make no mistake, clearing multiple raids in a single night and killing Kel’Thuzad are the immediate goals of this group. Where we differ is how we choose to pursue this objective.

We have an active discord and a diverse and funny group. Some have been playing vanilla WoW together for 5+ years and others are just now finding us as we prepare for Classic. There is something special about vanilla when you find 40 people with a common goal and experience your guild’s progression and achievements together. We are determined to maintain a consistent raid group in Classic who values playing together first and crushing raids second. Clearing PvE content is immensely easier than finding a group you will enjoy playing with for years at a time.
---
If you are interested in joining us and our raid times work for you, make a point to talk to some of our members. Hang out in our Discord for a day or two. We care more about the type of people we play with and their commitment to the group than your ability to lvl quickly, gear or raidstats.
---
We play hard. Consumables are expected and world buffs are strongly encouraged. We all recognize criticism is a necessary ingredient to growth, but there is a clear distinction between constructive criticism and tearing other players down. If you enjoy acting like a child or if you are a child then this guild is not for you.
---
We are always striving to build a finely tuned boss killing machine, and to do that requires constant improvement and accountability. If you choose to spend your time with Pretty Good you will always have to earn your raid spot, but you will be guaranteed a place in our community.

The worst mic you could possibly get. I hate people using them, and they use them mostly because they see streamers use them.   
---
The reason is that a mic like this, captures a fucking flies wings flapping. You can hear when he smashes his mechanical keyboard, you can hear the kids and wife screaming from another room, you can hear doors opens and closes in the house. You can hear the television more clearly than the person infront of the mic.   
---
Boycut any idiot who uses this as a form of communicating. Its idiotic and respectless to other players. Worst thing is you could probably get a Sennheiser game zero/one cheaper than this shit, with a crystal clear mic that does the job of capturing your voice and nothing else.
---
But everyone's pre-bis is a mix-match of different armor classes and dungeon blues. Holy paladins wear dresses!
---
I agree with that thought, but at the same time, there is a HUGE community of gamers out there ranging in age. Gamers typically enjoy a challenge or having something to work towards. In the current gaming world, I can hit max level(Which a huge portion of gamers enjoy doing) in a week or less. There is a sense of accomplishment and a NEW ability that makes a huge difference in your experience. Working towards that is rewarding. Getting a new piece of gear that is better will last for days or weeks for casual players. Sometimes longer.  
---
So, yes it has more to work towards. More goals to set for yourself that are difficult to reach. So, in that regard, it is setup for casuals to play casually and enjoy the game. For the class of gamers that are about world firsts and having BIS as fast as possible, they will get that crap done pretty quick, so in essence, they will bored quicker. I think that is what they mean when they say it is geared towards casual. Hardcore guys will get through the content quick(Still way longer then most games though)  
---
Now the quit spike is going to be rough I think. There will be a ton of snowflakes that get offended or hurt or whatever crap word they are using these days for something NOT going there way. The game is more challenging then most. You can die easily to a couple of mobs, or when trying to run past things, they can aggro and smoke you. Most games nowadays I can afk run through whole camps and be fine. LOTS will hate that and probably quit.  I enjoy the challenge and grind WoW gave. Casually I could lose a night and still feel like there was more to do the next night. THAT is the hook that I think will hold a ton of gamers again.
---
I lost it seeing Shooter McGavin and Creed. 😂
---
The player base?
---
Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. I didn't factor in deposit fees/mailing costs.
---
Both worldofwarcraft.com and fileplanet had a limited alotment of accounts they were allowed to register. It's entirely possible that this was due to fileplanet seemingly fronting the download or something like that. Or it may have simply been technical (couldn't just spin up more servers on the cloud).
---
Legion and BfA betas were both strictly closed as far as I know, but they did do a promotion back in Cata where if you pre-ordered the next expansion (MoP), you got a guaranteed beta key.
---
Pick undead rogue, stealth into Alliance happy zones, gank noobs. Best of both worlds.
---
Thxs! I hesitate between hyperx and Corsair replacing an aging Razer.
---
Yea I agree. I dont understand people who wanna do everything extremely efficiently, just for the sake of it. I already played till 60, but I forgot most of it anyway, so Ill just have fun.
---
Uhh... VendorStrike.. THERE, I SAID IT!
---
Can you do a TldR version
---
Winterspring Yetis perfect 5/7 60 dinging zone
---
The cancer is gaming the YouTube algorithm and constantly fills it with low-effort 10 min garbage. If I leave the PC with a YouTube running the algorithm is fucked for a month.
---
The first quest can be picked up at 58, while the other two require level 60. I feel I should warn you though, it is a long, long grind.
---
Or he changed his mind lol
---
Winterspring grinding or questing Yetis. Every character I've ever made always ends up like this.
---
INFJ Horde Druid Healer PVE, Hybrid PVP
---
I'm "defending" them on the basis that that's just the truth. 
---
If the content was "unwatchable horseshit clickbait" they would never keep their current viewer base let alone grow it. 
---
And you're missing my whole point. I literally explained why the videos are not cash grab.
---
What the fuck is he wearing? He looks like a 40yo woman on chemotherapy.
---
Sounds like you need to educate some people on the art of push to talk and capture levels
---
Also, these mics should be above and not below right next to the keys, I don't know why people think these massive studio mics need to be as close as a headset
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
Azshara grinding them blood elves
---
ill msg you on release.
---
IMO efficiency is for your alts lol
---
You spent time wall jumping, a feature which will never be in WoW again and has never been on any private server. So technically the people leveling wasted their time because that can be done in 2019!
---
Lovely ! My body is ready😍
---
S8 was the best. Like everything was viable D:
---
This is the most abrasive comment I've read in this entire thread. Maybe take your own advice?
---
My first 60 was here also. I grinded spirits with my frost mage from 58-60. Quiet area, good loot, not much pvp drama. :)
---
Average rogue vs. Average mage is in my opinion down to gear score. The better the gear the more improbable the victory for a rogue. Mages are in my opinion one of the most forgiving classes. You can mess up a lot and still win. Rogue though you make one misplay and you are perma walking one mile an hour at the mage with no recourse.
---
&gt; I think most people who originally played vanilla aren't of the streamer viewing generation.
---
I would say this is mostly true. Im not of the streamer viewing gen. But as a side effect of that, I dont watch the streamers.
---
So.... why then would I be so massively and completely triggered by them? Thats the part I dont get. People chain post and cry about these people that you have to go out of your way to see. Just don't watch them... Get a YT recommend? Click the three dots and mark it, and BOOM. You literally never see them again.
---
Leveled to 60 as a Protection Warrior. Grinded the last few levels in Western Plaguelands. I saw a lot of Mages Blizzard AOE mobs there, so I figured something good must drop. Those last couple of levels probably took me days and nothing ever dropped. I was over the moon making it to max level!
---
Ah yes Atlan :) ... I posted replay in wrong place :) ... I was about to reply to the main post ... sorry :) 
---
Cheers !
---
plus theres a shitton of more features in modern wow, generally the more there is, the more overwhelming it feels to a player, because even though if most features arent releveant, people might still feel left out, or that theyre too late for the party, to me thats not satisfying.
---
“Came out of nowhere”... well how do you suppose streamers start? I don’t recall anyone of them streaming their birth...
---
I was in a pickle when I first started playing on a pserver last fall.  My all-time fav class is shaman. I've also enjoyed the versatility of druid.  I began playing a lock and(which i never played very much on retail) and was overjoyed with the up time to actually enjoy the game instead of spending half my time eating/drinking/corpse running. 
---
But...   
---
Rogue.   I'm die-hard pvper and while I didnt play rogue hardly at all on retail during my decade of playing, its all I've played in the last several months and can't wait to get on a pvp server.  
---
GLORY TO THE FORSAKEN!
---
What would the raid times be?
---
I stopped playing WoW right before WOTLK 
---
Burning Crusade was very fun though
---
Some people enjoy competition
---
&gt; using words like “confirmed” for every clickbait title
---
Or like Asmongolds stream who puts "WOW CLASSIC NEWS!!! BETA SOON" in the title everyday when there are no news.
---
They should just keep players uninformed and release the game 1st of June without any notice
---
uh what
---
To start, I think it will release on Wednesday (worldwide) similar to how BFA launched. I think the beta will launch either this coming Wednesday (most likely) or the next Wednesday. The game will launch 77 days later July 31 or August 7. I believe they will tie the "invites" to a purchase of some sort, most likely a "collectors edition" of some sort. Buy the CE, get access to the beta. Don't want to spend the money? We will be inviting more people over the coming week(s). The reason I think they will do it this way instead of your way is because your way is based on how they do it for most every game. However, most every game has a 6 month+ testing phase. Starting with family / friend, and growing from there. This is after whatever internal testing they do. They do not have the time to do that this time around, they need it to be faster and more concise. I think they will release "betas" in the form of what we saw in the demo. For instance, 10 different phases for 1 week each. This would get them the targeted information they need in a quick manner, paired with the stream-lined bug reporting of the 8.0 engine, and you got a recipe for success.
---
Haha. That quiet Wuaaahh in the distance. 😊 👌🏻
---
I enjoy Tipsout, Esfand &amp; Staysafe. They originally said they looked forward to taking their time leveling and enjoying content they missed out on in Vanilla. Then almost the next video they seemed to all say they were going to rush to 60. Good for them, just was odd as a group to have such a sudden change of heart. I foam at the mouth over lots of things, just never them. I watch their content here and there cause' they create awesome videos!
---
Meh
---
Are you calling all Wow players hearing impaired or something?
---
&gt; Name me a single other game that could entertain a guy for 5 years straight
---
Tetris. Minecraft. Civilization. The Sims. Pacman...
---
It also depends on "the guy." I'd say its pretty non-normal for someone who is a gamer to only play a single game for 5 years. That's not a commentary on you, necessarily...just that your experience is probably more of an edge-case.
---
I'd give WoW a 10/10 also, but I'm definitely doing to recognize the other contenders for 10/10 from 2005-2010: Bioshock, Red Dead Redemption, Mass Effect 2, Age of Empires 3, Fallout New Vegas, and a few more contenders.
---
The joke is on you.  I'm going to level three at the same time so I don't have to be efficient!

---
the real shocker is that most of the people here that claim to be wow vets (they played on 1.12 private servers) never played before cata or even wrath
---
I mean no offense by this but how far have your videos gotten? 
---
The main reason to make videos often and make them 10:01 is tho appeal to the YouTube algorithm. If you don't do so the chances of getting your channel of the ground let alone making it your job is close to 0. 
---
You're probably not trying to make it your job but they do want to create a career off it.
---
yes, I like competition too. And I will do nothing but play classic all day, but regardless of that. I dont feel like planning all routes out. But to each their own. I just find it strange how people still wanna be so competitive about this age old game. 
---
And why do dimwits downvote me for this lol
---
I suspect the early game sharding will need testing, but not too much else.  That’s why money is on a very brief open beta.
---
Not a ton of conviction with that though.
---
It is common for games to do closed betas with an NDA with regular players. Spellbreak, for example, did this.
---
Inspiration? That's just unhealthy...
---
I've played enough vanilla bootleg servers to not give a shit about a Blizzard beta. I'm ready for the real thing.
---
&gt; I'm the best minmaxer
---
While I put a sharpening stone on my main hand as a horde warrior.
---
Preach brother, most of them are in it for the money, and it shows so bad.
---
i don't even monetize my videos on yt lol, most of the people that make money from "youtube" do it via subscriptions offsite or on patreon, not youtube
---
the site shouldn't be catered towards greedy people that wanna make money though man, it should be for everyone like it was for a few years after the site was made
---
Came here to say the same thing, never once got an invite to any of the betas, watched a friend of mine get invited to all of them.
---
Who gives a shit what you use your sick days for, if I want to use my sick days to play a video game and chill out then I'm gonna fucking do it
---
Nothing is happening, and if it is it’s some minor bullshit that doesn’t really have any bearing on a release date or beta. But it’s news and views
---
I am really conflicted on it. I did the grind back in vanilla, and I really do want it for my main, but I'm just not sure I can stomach another go. We will see. Though if classic plans to stay around a few years, I guess it's worth it ultimately.
---
Oh you mean season 8 of game of thrones, I thought you were hating on wotlk arena season 8 lmao xD
---
Very well put, all points are spot on. To add onto #5 about server pop: Once the streamer gets bored and leave, the server's population can die off overnight.
---
I dinged 60 off the undead boars in epl I did it for 3 levels it was hell
---
[Rogue LF guild and friends]
---
What's up everyone! I am super stoked about Classic more so than I anticipated probably because i.m.o. games nowadays are too fast-paced, dumbed-down, and at the complete sake of their parent company making profit$, which almost always ultimately takes a hit on the quality of the game/experience itself in the long run. I am happy to see the game successful enough to reach the current expansion however post-Mists the game was not for me (of course along with growing up and learning to life). Although technology continues to progress, I have yet in my life enjoyed a game more than I did when I played WoW shortly after the release of tBC. I know that was many years ago but I strongly believe Classic is so good as a game in whole that it will be a tremendously fun experience to revisit and relive. It will be especially fun and wonderful for returning players who indeed miss actually taking the time to level, know the quests and lore, roam around the entire landscape, help other passerby, enjoy the m.m.o elements, and most importantly master their class and their role in the game's storyline. Although I know the grind from 1-60, I am looking forward to the end game content just as much since I missed these raids entirely.
---
[Guild Criteria:] &lt;NA&gt;&lt;Pacific, Mountain time&gt;&lt;Alliance&gt;&lt;PvP server&gt; Looking for a raiding schedule that starts in the evening and goes through the night i.e. start at 7, 8, or 9 and go until 10, 11, or midnight on any 2 or 3 days during the week and/or Sunday evenings/nights. I am looking for a guild that takes the game seriously but is not necessarily "hardcore." A guild that definitely wants to progress at a good pace but not be so intense and time consuming to try to get server firsts etc. In other words a guild that is cooperative and helpful to all people (as I plan to always help others with whatever) whether they are leveling at their own pace, completing dungeons, raiding, leveling professions and trading, doing World PvP, or simply need help with gankers. Again, personally I want to find a slot in a core, serious but relaxed, raiding group for the guild once we have a solid group comfortably hit 60.
---
[About Me:] 28 years old, English/Spanish. Knowledgeable, helpful, experienced, leader/co-leader. Discord: Dumbledore#3345
---
[Experience:] Started playing shortly after tBC dropped and stopped towards the end of MoP. Alliance; have done all specs of Paladin, MM/BM Hunter, Enhance Shaman, and Arms Warrior. Casual raiding, more serious PvP BG premades and arenas. World PvP/raids on enemy cities. Co-ran a guild for a while. Have played mostly on realms Burning Blade, Wildhammer, and Ysondre. Have mostly healed and tanked and want to do mainly DPS this time around.
---
[Personal Plan:] I'm not going to speed level by any means although due to prior experience I'm also not going to level super/new player slow. I will level at a solid pace while taking a bit of time to enjoy the scenery and quests and also kill some people on the way. Plan to do dungeons too while leveling up first aid, herbalism, and alchemy. Do you recommend any professions for rogues specifically? LMK. Want to successfully clear all raid content as it becomes available and guild is prepped for. I want to group up with guildies for group quests and dungeons.
---
Looking forward to playing with some of you
---
PS: I'm not opposed to rolling Horde but I really do miss the Alliance line and looks, sounds, regions....
---
So fucking sad they shut it down. 
---
I had my xFire account since like 2002 with a bunch of my old Call of Duty friends added. Back when that game was actually amazing and not the garbage cash grab it is today.
---
I respect your scepitcalness (word?). I do however think you are wrong. I do not think it will be the 2nd coming of Jesus like some people may think. However, I do think it will be something pretty large.
---
You aren't wasting any adults time, the fully grown adults are wasting the fully grown adults time. Did I mention being a fully grown adult? You aren't entitled to so much as a bread crumb, click the video or don't, you choose the consequences, you aren't being mislead either it's par for the course that videos have filler.

Beta release date: February 2004.
---
Basically we get paid to play video games. And because we get paid the way we react, perceive, and give advice about games can not be taken seriously or can not be given any merit because of the notion that we get $$$. With an SR there are favorites and non favorites there are those people love and adore and those people hate /raises hand. So you get stuck in an endless loop of fuck this YTer but this one is cool, well this one gives good info, but that one does it for the money.
---
You can't just tell someone you don't like, don't watch. People are addicted to those they like and those they hate. Hence why so many people around here know so much about bad and good streamers in their eyes. 
---
I know SR I know....downvotes inc
---
Yeah but do you think those content creators would have brought up that information? They are so uninformed and don't research anything that they probably wouldn't know.
---
What if \*we dont know who\*?
---
Wasn’t me lol, but maybe it was the insinuation that the way you’ll play is the fun way rather than theirs. Also the olympics have existed on and off since the Greeks, do you find it strange people still want to be competitive their?
---
Classic WoW in game store ;)
---
stuff like this really shouldn't be encouraged
---
aoe grinding is absolute cringe, for those doing it and for those having to see lfm groups for it constantly, thankfully blizzard nerfs group xp
---
INFJ-Horde-Mage-Equal Focus
---
I plan on doing alchemy late game and getting gear from progressing PvE just so I can kill Alliance that are farming my herb spots.
---
They keep crying wolf, saying beta starts every week. 
---
Eventually, they'll be correct (I mean, it has to release at some point...), and then you'll get the morons praising and defending them for being prophets forever after.
---
what we need a Beta for?!?.. they tested it 14 years ago! :)
---
If everyone knows then it's not insider information, next.
---
Same here, good spot for a caster
---
Same as most of us over the past 15 years, ready for a release date, hopefully, one soon.
---
I don't want to give him the satisfaction but its something you use to dry yourself when you leave the shower
---
This is not the case on my current pserver and I really hope you're wrong for classic (for the most part... there is always "this guy").
---
Honestly it took me 2 weeks of grinding on a private server to get 80% of pre-raid BiS for my fury set while tanking dungeons as prot, and once you're at that point you become the best MC DPS class, so it's not even that long of a wait for DPS.
---
The only bad part about max-level warrior is gold farming, but you can still grind plaguebats and ore/herbs like everyone else, and you're the best class in the game in about half of other situations, so it ends up being worth it even if you don't make an alt.
---
For OP/anyone else concerned I would recommend making a hunter/mage/maybe warlock alt if you plan on playing your warrior heavily long-term though, the amount of gold you'll make back by farming at 60 will outweigh the leveling time, and that's not to mention leveling alts being fun for some people (I love it in Vanilla). It's not mandatory though, by any means. You can be an absolute oil tycoon as a Warrior if you put the time in 2-manning Dire Maul, doing professions, working the auction house, and killing Devilsaurs, you just don't have access to super broken solo farm like Hunter/Mage do.
---
My dude I am getting real  - real money doing a real job. lol
---
Sorry you can't understand, "sephrinx".. if that is your \*real\* name...
---
I get bad rsi sometimes but using a trackball mouse helps. I am right handed but i also have a left handed trackball mouse so i can just swap hands if needed.
---
I can definitely try. The more I've thought about trying to shorten this speculation, the more I feel like my points would get lost.  Sorry again for the wall of text!
---
Edit: There's a TLDR, hopefully that still gets the point across the same way!
---
I think my first character dinged 60 at winterfall.  Took forever.
---
Every single character after that in original vanilla or more recently in private servers dinged 60 doing something in the Plague Lands. Usually farming bats, the cult of the damn, or anderhol grinding undead.
---
Why is it that my faction has the most annoying, edgy people spewing garbage like this?
---
”Hurr durr alliance white people mayonaise vanilla amirite”
---
I think we'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
The perceived power spike of leveling up in Classic will help a lot--getting talent points and abilities every (other) level feels so much better than the big fat nothing Retail gives; if anything, leveling up can feel *bad* because your gear gets less effective.  Leveling up will mean something again.
---
I leveled quite a few alts during WoD because I had nothing else to do, and every so often I'd spam a few dungeons through the Dungeon Finder to fix my gear.  I remember during Vanilla, I had to deliberately hunt for upgrades instead of mindlessly chain-pulling dungeons and getting showered in blues.  I would stop every few levels and work on tailoring to upgrade my boots or my leggings.  I dinged 60 farming air elementals in Silithus for my Robe of the Archmage.  I can't tell you where I dinged 80, 90, or 100.  I don't remember those.
---
Putting a group together was a pain, sure, but it made actually completing a dungeon that much more meaningful.  It'll be something to work for again, rather than a given.
---
While Classic may hold the player's hand less and offer less in the way of blatant carrots on sticks, the gameplay and process of character progression is much purer and more immediate.  Yeah, the levels come slower, but that doesn't mean they mean less.  If anything, they mean a lot more.
---
I think you are close, I think it will be some sort of Collectors Edition + Beta Announcement (invites tied to buying CE) + Launch Date Announcement. Beta will either be the next day or next week. I do not think the game will just launch tomorrow. I do not think they will just drop beta tomorrow. I think they will be greedy and try and milk this hype for money, and it will work
---
They jealous neckbeards.  Hey at least the fights in classic will be fun, then :)  COME AT ME BROS
---
...butthole_blowdryer?
---
This is actually surprisingly popular on Twitch latley. I've never understood it myself, but there are a _huge_ selection of streamers who make a killing just watching youtube clips and talking to chat.
---
I assumed, best case is to just ignore the person. Posts like this, even tho you dont drop names, only makes things worse IMHO. You do you tho boss :)
---
...or a rip off of a Southpark character.
---
What are you monitors? The one on the right looks like a 32" or something.
---
Towelliee  
---
There. Sorted. I don't even know who that is. I keep seeing his name.
---
Guess he’s talking about towelliee.
---
You expect to see  **\*you know who\*** but it was me, **DIO!!!**
---
There isn't any reason why they wouldn't.
---
I follow a guide simply because a lot of the quests are done across zones and I don't know them well enough to know where and when I need to grab them before heading to a zone.
---
More like Age of Empires 2 from whenever it came out, even until today.
---
you mean an ass blaster?
---
It's a made up problem
---
This is a very interesting take, and with time constraints, who knows what route Blizzard will end up taking.
---
Just so I understand your days of release as well, do you mean Wednesday because you are EU?
---
Because Tuesday was the BFA release day in NA.  That's where my Tuesday beta/release idea came from.
---
I should've also clarified that more than I did in my post, but Wednesday makes perfect sense from an EU perspective. Sorry for any confusion!
---
my dirty underwear?
---
8 seasons of buildup and character development thrown out the window ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ thanks for nothing d&amp;d
---
That would work but 90% of the time i have to log into the mobile app and it doesnt save ignore history until im logged in
---
What I'm saying is if you want to grow your channel to make it relevent at all you need to follow the YouTube algorithm or make a viral video. 
---
Maybe if everyone who played wow had a choice between your video vs one of the "cash grab" videos they would chose yours. But if you never get recommended you can never really grow your viewer base. 
---
Don't you think it would be easier for them to give their opinion in 5 minutes instead of 10? But sadly 5 minute videos don't get recommended on YouTube. 
---
It's not all about the money(even tho it's obviously the end game. Making videos about a game you love and that being your full time job) it's about growing the channel.
---
Yeah it was, but it was full of ranged mobs and narrow corridors and so is terrible for aoe farming.
---
Lol I intend to make my level 60 home in booty bay for culling the herd reasons. For the alliance
---
Same spot for me! :)
---
Thank you! At first I read it as WOTC and that’s the wrong nerd game.
---
Do you think you can afford another fuckup?
---
Goldshire is the next area, where the humans start.
---
Played retail since '06 but in that time I never tanked once... I kinda wanna try prot warrior for Classic. How steep a learning curve is tanking in Classic?
---
Edit; Follow up question. Is leveling as prot viable or just a terrible idea? Quests vs Dungeons?
---
&gt;it's about growing the channel.
---
which is inherently about money, otherwise they wouldn't have a reason to need more viewers and subscribers, unless of course they're egotistical and want the fame and money (they are)
---
Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!! 100%.
---
I would say more ICP for horde. Also, zima is fucking delicous.
---
Or, everyone could stop bitching about it and that would solve the problem too
---
On my vanilla warr, Silithus, was grinding mobs for the last little bit. 
---
Oddly enough I don't remember were on any of my pserver characters. I think one of them was in Eastern Plaguelands. Did almost all quests in all zones with that one, but didn't finish EPL before hitting 60.
---
Lets group up and gank them.
---
&gt;at lvl 50
---
So completely not viable as a leveling option...
---
The point of this post is leveling with aoe grinding,  I'm asking to add in loot so you can consider that when choosing where to go. 
---
I don't know how to explain this in another way.
---
I was in the no to classic camp for a while. The BfA came and it sure changed my perspective.
---
my girlfriend was murdered in 2009

Just saw his response and you said it for me haha. What a backpedal.

Next time you go to work make sure to put in the least amount of effort and do the least efficient thing just so you don't run in the risk of being called egotistical and money hungry. :)

Leveling three at the same time is actually more efficient since you get more use out of rested XP
---
You are right, but I've also seen a lot of these posts about not leveling efficiently...why? Because not everyone is going to level the same way. But people who take the effort to create a guide want to share it for feedback or to be nice. Those like you and me, we're not creating content so have no reason to post except in direct opposition to those guide posts. 
---
That's the only reason it feels one sided. It really isn't though. Those posts aren't telling you to play a certain way. So just ignore them if they are not relevant. Like I do :)
---
blizzard needs to have the time pushed back 5 hours after it’s supposed to be announced so we get that real tuesday maintenance nostalgia...
---
it's funny that out of all youtubers to post it was you despite being the most negatively viewed """content creator""" on this subreddit
---
In Eastern Plaguelands, close to Borelgore. I stopped playing ss soon as I hit 60 and only started again halfway through TBC. Firdt thing I did was find a 70 mage who helped me with Borelgore.
---
not an argument, imagine defending these people and comparing their easy lives to a real job with actual work
---
running obs and recording in-game footage is not work, cropping and trimming clips, adding overlays and adding text to them is not work
---
I cant remember if seal of light was a pally thing in vanilla but I remember farming stocks in BC a lot because LoS pull as a tank was really easy and between my gear and my trinkets I could have over 100% avoidance with heals on block and you'd never die. go in and do it in 3 pulls at 70. 1 pull at 80 in wotlk, not sure if thats going to be possible with maybe an AoE tank and a healer in classic.
---
Or go Druid and AoE farm with thorns and the imp reflect damage fire shield! Lol
---
No, you know what sounds like a lot of fun? Picking a middling server that dies out, and then they transfer everyone over to a different server and you know nobody, half the people quit and transfer to a high pop server out of spite, the other half don't play because they lost their server identity, and you end up a stranger in an unknown world where everyone else knows everyone, and you're the outsider, Charlie Brown.
---
On a low pop server, you can do things like structure your own guild, grab EVERYONE so everyone has a place to hang their hat, a group to call their own, a brotherhood of fellow geeks to raid/game/play with. That small niche community will stick together with a fierce loyalty that defies logic, and you will lose a few, gain a few, over the months and years, but the community there is small and wonderful, instead of loud, rapacious, obnoxious, and toxic.
---
I've played on several different servers with several different communities, and my playstyle is reflected in the fact that the fulfillment of gaming I get from structuring a community on a low pop server to have fun, play together, and succeed together, is much more than being in an uncaring mass on a high pop server. Just my two cents. I have my fun. I'm sure you have yours.
---
What are you planning to play that you're worried is going to suck?
---
Remember a lot of people are talking about raiding - you may get a little pigeon-holed in roles for raiding but that's just raiding. Solo, 5 mans, and PvP are all big parts of the game too.
---
Unless you're wanting to raidtank as a paladin, or raid dps as an elemental shaman, moonkin, or ret, you'll be fine playing whatever.
---
No, BFA launched at the same time world wide. This was Monday in the US and Tuesday in the EU. I think they will do the same thing but with Wednesday. It launched at 3pm Monday August 13 in the US (PST) and Midnight  Tuesday August 14 in the EU (CEST)
---
Still gonna use my lock mount cause it looks dope :p
---
I have always had a pretty decent gaming rig amd have never gotten a closed Beta invite for any game I've signed up for.  However I've noticed a trend amongst my friends who've gotten beta invites, that those with mid to low end rigs are often the ones who get the invites.
---
the x is silent
---
Being a warrior in vanilla WAS miserable, with a huge pay off in the late game once you get geared. And if you don’t want to tank, don’t play a warrior. Even if you’re DPS you will have to off tank many raid fights because no one else can
---
This is the minimum required by law in the US(I work in a big payroll company that implements these types of Time Off Policies in companies HR departments)
---
To be fair, most companies offer PTO(Paid Time Off) or vacation on top of Sick Time.
---
Good lord people...
---
Nah, Towel is in for the $$ and its pretty clear.
---
There is no change of heart
---
Agreed, DKP is not a system for serious guilds. Giving one piece of tier to all the top bidders is way less effective than hitting set bonuses on a single person. Not to mention the amount of people who will pass on actual real upgrades because they want a cooler / bigger one later.
---
it's time to stop
---
I'm talking about farming while leveling.
---
There’s less RNG in classic wow for top end players
---
a phone call? jesus christ...
---
lock isn't as bad as pally cuz of life tap, multiple spell trees, and less likely to get cs'd
---
still bad tho
---
&gt; Did I mention being a fully grown adult?
---
No, because it doesn't need to be mentioned
---
&gt; You aren't entitled to so much as a bread crumb
---
I'm not asking for any entitlements 
---
&gt; click the video or don't
---
I don't
---
&gt; it's par for the course that videos have filler
---
The topic is "addressing the hate on vanilla content creators". One of the reasons people "hate on vanilla content creators" is because of the filler. We know we have choices.
---
based fanboy showing his favoritism
---
Is rolling a feral Druid actually as bad as people make it out to be?
---
I have a strange urge to do it, if for no other reason than to excel at something that people say you can’t lol
---
Next what? I’m saying just to announce the date. You know, like an announcement goes.
---
Can make all the money you want, but rubbing it on peoples face after shitting on classic so much is well, questionable
---
and he’s a likable asshole.
---
Lol. These kind of posts + the entitlement in this sub has reached a new level. I dont blame him for messing with you guys, its just too easy.
---
Short answer No.
---
Long answer Nooooooooooooooooooooooo.
---
5d paranoia
---
So r/gatekeeping. At the end of the day only sweaty neckbeards are going to cry over this shit. It just gets the game more exposure. Are people going to not play classic because it’s too mainstream now? Lmao
---
ah, ok, I just saw wool and wanted to drop that tidbit as its a great place for wool.
---
What do you do for a living dude? Most companies want a two week notice if not a month. Also when vacation rolls over usually in Q1 a lot of times it’s first come first serve. So the quicker vacation requests go in the better chance of having the days off you want. Some years we plan trips. Some years we stay home, eat takeout and binge the new expansion of WoW. A lot of people plan vacation time around expansion/game releases. 
---
As far as your over simplified comparison it’s not the same at all. It would be like if out in front of the store there was a blogger that writes about that store telling everyone “hey you know that thing you all want? Yeah I have info about it... but I can’t tell you till next week.” And the store being cool with it cause... hype? It’s poorly handled. If you can’t see that then I don’t know what to tell you dude.
---
Esfand blinked three times in 1 min, half life 3 confirmed ?
---
This guy is obnoxious. Obviously jumping on the hype train only for $$$. He shat on classic few month ago now claims to love classic. Fk diz guy! Don‘t give him a platform.
---
Well there is a reason why they wouldn't, they don't think there's enough players there to support it. By all accounts there should be enough to support one, but Blizzard is the one with the metrics and the money so it's their call.
---
This is garbage. I love ‘em both, so do you.
---
&gt; If you continuously waste your own time watching shit videos then the problem isn’t on them
---
I don't waste my time with them. The topic is "addressing hate on vanilla content creators" and the non-sense filler is part of the reason. We know we have choices.
---
I was about to say this! It's also a good way to explore/see different zones.
---
Stop it. Get some help.
---
"Beta confirmed" when the files hit the CDN was blatantly false clickbait bullshit.
---
I hate tips out
---
I don't remember. It was like almost 14 years ago D:
---
entitlement? His literally on video saying he won't play it then he comes to the sub just to muck around with anyone and not adding anything of value to any discussion?
---
I could be wrong, but Monday at midnight would technically mean that the game was playable for Tuesday.  12:00 AM is Monday, but 12:01 AM becomes Tuesday, and I thought that was there initial goal, more for the sake of  "In contrast to previous expansions, which went live at midnight in each time zone, *Battle for Azeroth* had a simultaneous release for all regions, corresponding to midnight [Central European Summer Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time) on August 14, 2018 "  You are definitely correct that it was released at that specific point on Monday, but realistically we were all playing on Tuesday/Wednesday, depending on if you were NA/EU
---
Not actually trying to debate this with you, you have a good speculation, and I'm definitely curious to see how it unfolds!
---
Thanks for listing some alternatives to watch, I was looking for some.
---
I always skip doing professions.  I don’t see the point
---
&gt;FFS the game is out now (on private servers) so we’ve all played and experienced it
---
Speak for yourself. I haven't played since 2006 and the hype is very much real for me. The 4 mates who are coming back with me to play it haven't played since then either. Not everyone on this sub plays private servers.
---
I kept seeing all these posts and thought, heck I should try to get my old one back too. took all of 5 minutes. got my 70 shaman back from TBC. so stoked.
---
No, sorry. It was just me phoning to ask if the word on the street is true
---
It isn't CRZ, it's sharding.
---
Can you fill me in on what he said.
---
He also thinks it's funny to make fun of disabilities.
---
Shitty composite aside, it's already an established [relaxed gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/voPlh9z.jpg) PC setup, gonna be fun for that sweet sweet fishing immersion.
---
And?  The OP was asking why people don’t like them.  I answered.  Also, even if you don’t watch them, they do still exert an influence on how things are done these days, specifically with regards to many devs using them as their de facto PR department.  They also clutter search results.  So even if you try to avoid them, they still can affect you.
---
&gt;What the hell was that?
---
A joke, if you look at his top comment.
---
that monitor THICC BOI
---
I went back and watched your initial video you posted after the announcement to get a better feel of your intentions.  You have a pretty clear understanding of how you view classic, and how you prioritize it versus retail. interesting point to note, you immediately stated that their was going to be a massive rift between the two communities, which is pretty spot on. You've already written off this community as a whole for being inherently biased against you, and you think that gives you an excuse to speak however you want. People here have a lot of unfounded preconceived notions about you, but if you keep coming here and acting like this you're just building foundation.
---
Your comparing streamers and youtubers as if they were the same thing. Of course it’s easier to make YouTube videos and be entertaining for 10minutes over streaming for 6+ hours.
---
Also who is claiming to be the self appointed leader of classic? I’ve watched a fair amount of staysafetv and esfand while I’m working and they both seem very humble. Esfand has talked about having the privilege of sharing community concerns with blizzard support staff, but outside of that he would never claim to be the classic leader or anything crazy. 
---
I personally don’t like tipsout he seems to be more focused on the super casual playerbase that do look to him for news and his opinion so his content doesn’t fit me personally. 
---
I think it just discredits platniumwow, classicwinds, and Frostadomus to act like they are lesser known they are big content creators in the classic wow YouTube scene.
---
Probably plaguelands like a lot of others lol
---
Yes mushhhhhh
---
NA PVP realm horde guild looking for players.
---
Core that we have now are all private server vets and looking for anyone and everyone who wants to raid! Raid times will be 8:30pm Eastern US Tuesday and Wednesday.
---
Msg me if you got any questions :)
---
Let me give you an example of aa unpleasant experience in the making.
---
Last week a staying safe youtuber put out a hunter  BiS "guide". He includes a REALLY GOOD TRINKET FOR MELEE (caps really meant) Hand of Justice as a BiS for hunters.
---
Now, this is true. For Phase 1 (and ONLY for Phase 1), HoJ is bis for hunters. It gets immediately replaced in phase 2 by the DM trinket though.
---
Now for melee, HoJ is bis till like AQ40 or more (you will still have it in your bags in Naxx, till Kiss of the Spider prolly).
---
Now what happens after a hunter watches the video, needs on HoJ, wins it over a warrior, gets tagged as a ninja on the server, get so much hate and _doesn't know what he did wrong_. The reputable guide said its bis right, the guy is on classic cast, he should know what he's talking about.
---
Except he doesn't.
---
i'll take lotr and tendies every day
---
It’s just me the real life person playing a game, get out of here with this nonsense.
---
Man either it's your birthday in July or it's the release, mom's are never wrong and they never lie.
---
Oh okay.
---
Night Elf Rogue - Tyrs Hand, farming elites with my brother. IIRC, fuck its almost 15 years ago.
---
ive been looking at them on ebay recently and people all want like 30+ just for the shiping to Canada more then the books themselves!
---
meanwhile your mom  is like "Billy let me watch my soap operas in peace"
---
Yeah like I *want* to be a warrior, but I have a feeling there is going to be so god damned many of them.
---
To be honest, whilst I really want to play the game, I also like to have something on in the background whilst I do other things, and I'm really keen to have access to some streamers I enjoy, like Frostadamus, playing the beta. I personally don't want to play the beta at all (and as such I haven't opted into it) because I don't want to play a character that will be deleted.
---
Can’t wait to surf some webs on the net and set up my electronic mail.
---
Do you get any input lag? Would love to play on my big screen but there is always a delay.
---
a few different ways, transmutes are press-button-receive gold.
---
if you are out actively herbing you can use the mats to create pots and flasks, which would sell for potentially more than the herbs are worth.
---
or you can do the math and skip herbing altogether, buy herbs from the AH and create flasks/etc that will gain you profit after the herb purchases.
---
If it's not work and it's that easy why don't you do it yourself?
---
You're one of the people who in a "actual job" does nothing and wonders why the people trying to succeed get a promotion.
---
I was really impressed that you had the no main option, but then couldn't answer 4 because you didn't have a no primary role option.

---
Breaking news: We will perform an update Tuesday 14. may 2006.
---
At the end of the day, if we are being honest, we will all most likely be disappointed in whatever they release. If it is invite only and the invites are random, there will be millions of people upset. If its invite only and you have to buy your way into that invite, tons of people will be upset. Etc etc. There is a very very slim chance that we will all end up happy with what they announce / release. 
---
I personally would pay for access and be happy with my purchase, especially if that also meant getting some CE stuff with it but I know many would not be happy with that. If, after all of this tho, they are only inviting random people and I do not get an invite, you better bet I won't be happy with that. This is a big fucking moment for us all and to not be included would just downright be depressing.
---
Same! I want to heal and tank. Be a hybrid that can take care of myself and a group.
---
Why does OP want to temp ban a southpark character?
---
To build hype and have people talk about it on the Internet, like we're doing now
---
lol what could he possibly be saying that's worth a sick day?
---
Hahahahah
---
depends what you mean by feral. feral dps is pretty bad but feral offtanks are quite good. also be prepared to sit in gnomregan farming crowd pummelers all day if you plan to do anything feral.
---
that's the thing about most of the meme specs, they are 'viable' but they just won't be as good as other classes and you'll have to go the extra mile with consumables to even get close to competing.
---
Thank god someone posted a realistic battle station. Everyone here is cleaning the shit out of their desk for some r/classicwow karma. A true battle station has a couple of cans or a box of pizza on the side.
---
Not at all if you set your expectations right. Will the average guild probably ask for you to heal in raids? Yeah. That said, an off-tank spot isn't crazy at all (though if you genuinely want to go for it, you'll have to put in more work than most). 
---
For PvP they're actually fantastic. Unique playstyle, harder than most, but so worth it if you figure it out. By far the hardest to kill. As a result, grouped WSG will want you for flag carrying (which varies from super simple running back and forth to very intense fights over the flag), grouped AB you'll be defending bases most likely. 
---
Leveling they're genuinely great, one of the best. Best mobility, no downtime. Can fulfill every role with 1 talent spec in dungeons. 
---
If you want to do it, absolutely go for it. (My main issue with them is actually that I hate not seeing my gear and those form visuals did not age well.)
---
Or a release date. And no open beta.
---
because i have a job that pays well lol. why risk it all for something so unlikely as these things?
---
you do know that becoming a famous content creator is something that less than 1% of all people that try it actually succeed at, right? and even then most of the people that succeed do it because they knew someone else who got them popular
---
I would say if you start leveling on server launch without any gathering professions at all, your crafting professions will quickly fall behind your leveling, and your wallet will be mostly empty. I'm not saying you can't make it work, but you are going to be living quite poor during your leveling phase and scrounging for every last dream dust and iron bar you can possibly buy for cheap.
---

Came to say this lol I wonder which is easier to move (monys I’m guessing) but it’s not my setup! Better than mine tho, my monitor is the living room tv with the pc behind it. No desk atm :(

Some are more helpful than others, and many provide pre-bis items for 60. I personally find tailoring/leatherworking easy to provide mats for while leveling while alchemy/blacksmithing are considerably harder to. I find that this means alch/bs are harder to level simultaneously with your player, while tail/lw are able to keep up with the player lvl easily.
---
&gt; I could post screenshots
---
but you're not going to
---
shouldn't it be bugs? #nochanges
---
seems pretty easy to decide imo
---
I definitely agree with your perspective too!
---
Limiting the amount of overall players is definitely going to lead to a lot of disappointed players. 
---
I'm gonna try crossing my fingers for hope that they will show a huge list of servers (MAYBE SERVER NAME REVEALS?!) and truly open this up to open beta testing.
---
It's not like they don't have the ability to do so.
---
Balls in their court in the long run to see where they leave us all at when the time does come.
---
50' HDMI from the PC (behind the screen) to the projector across the ceiling and bluetooth KB/M - I don't really notice much at all. I play easy shooters like tomb raider and whatnot without any issue. Lazy grinding in wow's not an issue.
---
From a lore perspective, Alliance is way more evil than the Horde.
---
These points basically all combine, interact with each other, and result in streamer drama too, which is somehow why some people follow streamers in the first place. This alongside point 6 means any news involving streamers directly or indirectly is typically on the level of tabloid news and celebrity magazines, meant to get attention above anything else, and is clickbait rubbish that's hard to avoid and simply in the way for everyone else.
---
Following what streamers say and what drama they get into is the gen Z version of past generations' celebrity hysteria and no different from following whatever nonsense is going on with the Kardashians, the Queen, etc, and whatever they're saying. Your brain rewards you with dopamine for "new information" even if it's nonsense. The idiots following streamers around on servers are like the new digital mixture of people eager for the latest celeb magazine and paparazzi (and similarly go unpunished despite being basically stalkers, except in this case, even the celebrities don't care since they're directly making money from these people).
---
Admittedly, some e-celeb streamers and youtubers are better than others and not everyone who watches their content is bad, but it really tends to be one of the lowest levels of entertainment (and news) IMO, though this is probably more because of the way the medium has developed than an issue with the medium itself, which is why there's exceptions.
---
The actual tanking rotation is super simple (Druid's easier, but it's hardly challenging either way). The difficulty comes from guiding a group through the dungeon, as you tend to take the lead if we're talking pugs. If you know the dungeons, you'll figure it out in notime. 
---
I wouldn't level as prot. Warrior is already incredibly slow, so unless you have a premade with which you are constantly spamming dungeons I'd avoid going that route. That said, you can absolutely tank dungeons well until your 50s in a leveling spec (2H Fury, swapping to Mortal Strike at 40 so you can survive all the WPvP whatever, it'll work for tanking just fine).
---
PSH. I make my own words :)
---
Tips seems like a genuinely nice dude. People can not like certain content but I don't get bashing people online, especially people we've never met.
---
Tidy desk empty mind. Guarantee all these people posting their Snapchat filteresque stations end up with their desk like this every week before adding some more rgb and cleaning up for the next photoshoot.
---
Is your father J. Allen Brack by any chace?
---
the learning curve is around learning the dungeons/raids and figuring out what the best pulls are. it's not that bad to be honest, you just have to be willing to lead your group and give orders for CC, etc.
---
leveling as prot is unnecesary cuz u can tank through your arms dps spec while leveling, just carry a weapon and shield and switch to dstance.
---
quests are the way to go. dungeons are not worthwhile exp/hr wise, but they can be fun to do. also if you want to do dungeons you should try to grab as many of the related quests for it before you do, usually you can get good gear upgrades this way.
---
No idea what is being specifically talked about,  but of his ideas and opinions on the game and blizzard are generally right.
---
29 here. I slightly get it. Slightly dont.  I love watching esports events and competitions, but I dont get watching individual personal streamers. The closest I get to that is LoadingReadyRun's twitch channel, which has various streams of the different cast members just playing something.
---
Its hard to say, you dont need to and you will have more money by default, because it cost alot of gold to level profession and time but then again, you do get the ability to sell stuff, it might be fun for you?(i sure enjoy it), but i would recommend not leveling professions at start if you are aiming for easy 40 mount but if you dont mind spending the time, you can easily craft/gather and sell and get your mount.overall i would say that the earlier you level professions the more time/resources are required  
---
edit: since its a new server and the population for a vanilla server is prob unseen since vanilla itself, the possibility to make "alot" of gold of linen bags early or weapon enchant from blacksmithing is hard to predict but if you spend 1 hour im sure you could earn atleast 10-20g just selling bags to new players who dont respect or forgot the harsh starter economy and the struggle for spells and mount or even just players who do and dont really care since it just 2-3 mobs at lvl 35 those 10 silvers

You put a lot of emphasis on always using r1 nova, however I have heard very experienced mages who pvp at a very high level say that max rank nova is viable with good gear as the damage becomes decent.
---
Edit: According to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) frost nova has a spell power coefficient of 13.57%, so it's not much but with really good gear it adds up.

&gt;Name me a single other game that could entertain a guy for 5 years straight
---
Starcraft BW, SC2, WC3, DoTA 2, Quake, Smash Bros Melee, Smash Bros 64, Mario Kart 64, League of Legends, Diablo 2.

I'm not even saying I'm a fan of all those games (especially the mobas...) but they've certainly been known to entertain people for 5+ years straight.

LFG - NA (PvP), Alliance, Hardcore, PvP Oriented
---
Looking for a guild to play with at the launch of classic. My buddy and I will be leveling 2 Mages. I am PvP oriented (intend to grind to the highest rank I can once phase 2 is out, and play BG's often).
---
I do not have much end-game classic PvE experience, but I do want to do PvE content and will participate. Just know that I'm not experienced and will need to follow along until I get the hang of it. 
---
Work from home, and have a generally lenient schedule, so once classic comes out we'll be playing pretty hardcore.
---
Exploring in Azshara
---
Warrior was the class that scales best with gear in WoW classic.  Hands down. 
---
So, whether warrior was miserable or not really depended on a few things:  what did you want to be doing and what gear did you have access to?  Also note that in much PvE warriors weren't great farmers.  There weren't the same dire maul strategies for example as mages, priests, warlocks, and hunters had.
---
Hunter, on the other hand, scales the least with gear.  The pet was completely independent, and so a fresh 60 hunter was a decent chunk of the power of a 60 hunter in T2.  And when it came to soloing content hunters were unmatched.  Pinnacle was basically the fact that you could solo dire maul north "tribute" runs.
---
Yeah because most people "try" to make it by making one 3 minute video a month and hoping that it somehow blows up.
---
These people have put in the research and effort in becoming relevent. 
---
Do you think they started off with 10k subs and without a main job? Ofc not. They had a job and their channels as a side project. Probably putting almost all their free time in to it.
---
A bird just shit on my truck, in a vague shape of the world tree. Beta confirmed?

---
Don't you dare bashing \[streamer\]! He's my friend, he even said my name after I donated my allowance to him.
---
For a lot of people leveling and more-so in classic is a pain in the ass. It's tedious and boring, especially if you already leveld a couple of chars to 60 so people want to be as efficient as possible.
---
If you subscribe to the any press is good press sure. I still feel like it was poorly handled.
---
Gave you a pm
---
Make bank alts, NEVER log them, send them mail you want to keep/sell.  Name them accordingly, it works well for 29 days
---
That's a perk of working from home. Can wear whatever you want lol
---
Getting called a stream sniper and then getting harassed by their rabid cult even though you have never heard of them don't know or care who they are and don't watch twitch or other streamers anyways
---
Yeah I know I should be. You don’t know anything but the surface of Vanilla wow. If you’re only around to bring hype to vanilla that’s fine but if you have any influence on decision making on what the devs should do now and in the future it’s fucking scary. Watching your streams back in the day and how you would act and talk about Classic no one in the right mind would want your opinions on how it should be run. So ya damn right.
---
NE flips &gt; all
---
I used to level like this in vanilla actually. My dad got us a projector rather early it was really dope.
---
Look at a wow powerleveling guide for vanilla professions. You can totally level gathering professions and just keep everything you need for the powerlevel on a lvl 1 bank alt. Then when you hit 60 mail it all and power it out. Blacksmithing has many quests that require you to go to lvl 50+ zones to complete

I think we are drastically underestimating the attrition that will occur over the first 3-6 months.
---
Don't talk for "us". You're part of the hatefilled, toxic portion of this subreddit. Myself and others have nothing against streamers.
---
Not arguing that you can't dislike them but disliking a YouTube creator for stuff like 10minute videos and calling them cash grabs is nonsense. 
---
It's basically the same thing as being mad at someone at a job for putting in more effort for a chance of a raise.
---
LBRS, after the jump down and during the orc pulls.

Human Mage EPL
---
Can you do the Paladin class quests in the dwarf/gnome area or do you have to go back to get it?
---
What are you going to play? Holy paladins are the class which can perform best in pvp with non raid gear IMO.
---
Good points, didnt yhink about that thanks! :)
---
Maybe the r/woosh was /s. Like an inception of some sort
---
Ideally we would all like to see it be open but I am banking on them tying it to some monetary thing. Best case scenario is them doing invites initially tied to a purchase with more people getting in over time, eventually finally opening up to everyone. In this strategy, they would save the server names and starting zone testing for the end when the most people are in the game. There are honestly about 100 different ways they can do this, a few of them are ideal, a few of them are complete shit and many of them are compromises. What will they do, tomorrow we will see
---
hahah this is gold, his right but I dont know what he said and I thought alinity fanboys were stupid
---
Pretty sure people are so starved for info and game play that some might do just this. Whatever drops that would be big enough (definitely not watching some tool stream beta) can only be Classic come early and launched. These guys are gonna lose credibility with anything else.
---
No it did not.
---
It allowed streamers not regular players to sign.
---
This! Don't think of this knowledge as constricting, it's actually freeing!
---
Can you imagine if you went all the way to 60 thinking, "I am going to be the best caster DPS, boy howdy. Just you wait, every 40 man raid is going to be dying to have my boomkin come along." Only to find out that that shit just ain't happening, because Blizz didn't add any talents to Balance to sustain DPS over long fights, or add a gear set that boosts damage instead of healing?
---
Lacroix on alliance? Dem fightn words. Too bad we don't yet have a mmorpg with pvp to duke it out in over this... Too-soon-tm
---
I'd argue that this games development warrants waiting for a specific release date.  It's not a usual project for a game developer I don't think.
---
Hi, /u/Sharp16
---
This was moving in two ways
---
easily at fresh 60
---
The sharding tech is live, right now, on all servers, for all players, in all Zones.
---
I doubt that needs much testing tbh.
---
No idea. I plan on skipping the level 12 quest, maybe. Too slow.
---
What do you mean by suicide?
---
People will be leveling mining, they will need silver ore. Corner the market early
---
58ish, for all but UBRS full, still a 60 lvl group is preferred
---
Human Paladin.. EPL grinding scarlet crusade mobs
---
Kinda what i was thinking if i did just crafting. Wasnt sure if it would inherently hurt me goldwise to craft snd gather over just gathering and making the switch later. Ill check out those guides, thanks!

"Content creators" ...yall' shit is wack brah.
---
Blizzard: you are NOT the father...
---
&gt;Yeah because most people "try" to make it by making one 3 minute video a month and hoping that it somehow blows up.
---
i don't have any interest in being internet popular if you're trying to use that as a way to attack me, you must have misunderstood my post
---
&gt;These people have put in the research and effort in becoming relevent. 
---
yeah the research of googling things that other people wrote
---
Because everyone knows each other because of the private servers
---
Most of them are not very good at the game.
---
Some of them are just plebs like Tips, he's your every day guy. But reaches out to smart people. He's OK IMO, doesn't generally pretend to be something he's not. 
---
Esfand plays Ret pala.....One of the worst specs on the patch we will be playing on 1.12. And is basically the epitome of a pleb who understands the numbers. Yet he is still shit at pvp (plays like a warrior not the support class he picked). And PvE while he plays OK his DPS is terrible and he holds back his already terrible raid when he should be a warrior doing way more dmg with a taunt.
---
He's the one who I've seen videos of. SOme idiot the other day asked me if I was Drachova while I was in WSG....Had to google him. What an insult to think I could be that pleb who would play with esfand. As I'm dominating euros who would laugh at drachova if he asked to group.
---
Mother fuckers
---
Stay Safe i dunno, only warlock pvp is complex and I've never seen him pvp. As a general rule tho in the p server scene NA sucks so I'm gonna guess he's not very good. But he could be. Sure doesn't talk about the complexities of warlock pvp if he does.
---
Classic is Classic, it'll come with the good and the bad and there are a large number of people who won't be able to play through the bad (Some of those will try it out and find it's not for them, some people already know and won't even bother). There's enough of us that know what we're in for and are looking forward to it that it doesn't matter.
---
Undead priest, Scholomance.
---
What a proper fucking twat.
---
Ok, I agree.
---
The elitists are already burned out on classic WoW. They might exist but I think you'll find a lot of people, like myself, will be going in blind and just enjoying classic for what it is. IMO, why would I want to make every decision before playing the game? It boggles me that people have already plotted every action and quest to power level to 60. That's what makes retail so much worse... Speed. Why would anyone want to get through content as fast as possible when they can enjoy it all over again?
---
When I was a wee boy, I was enthralled by the vast beauty of WoW. It was something I had never seen before. My first MMO. Back then it didn't bother me that I had to figured things out, and that I would make mistakes. In fact, I loved it because I learned from my mistakes. I became effecient, more wise, more powerful. It felt good. When I was confused or in trouble, I asked for help. I didn't Google that path of least resistance. I made friends and allies.
---
Sure, you're going to run into the odd asshole once in a while, but just block them and move on. Hell, change your spoken language to racial and talk about how he's an asshole with your fellow &lt;race&gt;. That's the beauty of WoW classic. People will remember you, and you'll remember people. Elitist arseholes will gather into their hardcore guilds and race to be the first and best guild. 
---
None of that means a thing to me. I'll be enjoying WoW casually with other casual people. That's the beauty of it, man. You can make the experience what you want. Don't feel pressured to take the game more seriously. There is a place for us all.
---
Yeah. And they will have enjoyed it for six months, which is a hell of a lot more than most games can keep one's attention for if one is a casual player. Again, I'm not sure what you're arguing, but my position is (1) casual players will enjoy Classic because (2) leveling itself is part of the game and (3) they'll enjoy that for the majority of the time they ever play, and *if* (4) they stick around for a long enough time, they can even get to some raids.

You got any videos or links of him bashing Vanilla in general and not just saying the shitty parts of Vanilla were shitty?

So you have never heard of an interviewer asking questions they already know the answer to? Are you serious?

I do that too partially, but thats not what I meant.

I don't want to play with undesireable private server weirdos anymore, I want to play with excited normies

Misplaced Servo Arm, a one handed mace which drops from Naxx trash. High dmg plus nature dmg proc. Get two of those, enchant them with lifestealing or fiery weapon, get 8/8 T2, darkmoon card maelstrom/heart of wyrmthalak and you deal 5k+ dmg in one stunlock. It‘s a proc party
---
I’m not entirely sure how sharding works in current wow so I could be wrong but I would imagine the fact that only some zones are sharded might add a new wrinkle to things.
---
You could very well be right though (and I hope you are!).
---
I think the purpose of the demo was honestly just to show that they were, in fact, working on it. With all the big streamers hyped, beta seems entirely possible, but don't get your hopes up, just in case.
---
Jokes on you! that's my wife and ~~we're watching gray's anatomy on the projector most nights right now~~ I play wow on the projector some nights once she goes to sleep.
---
Only idiots worry about dps meters.
---
whats with the retail pleb room
---
There's no rest for the wicked.
---
IRL friend of mine played a paladin on sunstrider called Hattemager :p  
---
I was on an entirely different server though :)
---
“””””working”””””
---
Yes. Do you even meme?
---
Huh which streamer said “they are going to play the beta in a few hours?”
---
And to get people to pay for the virtual blizzcon on ticket just to play said demo (which I may or may not have done).
---
No it is not confirmed.
---
Yes, but no. Does that help? Too-soon-tm
---
Which streamers do claim so? Source please, thank you :)
---
I don't know who played nothing but pacman or tetris for 5 years straight, but may the light have mercy on them.
---
Anyway, i did say "to me", so clearly i'm not trying to pass my opinion as objective or anything. I played all games you mentioned except civ, and out of those the only one that would come even close to a 10 is mass effect (the whole trilogy, but 2 was indeed the best). But it was MERELY a must play masterpiece. WoW is a game that rivals life itself, to me it transcended beyond being just a game, it was a world you wanted to live in!
---
Of course that only applies to classic, retail barely passes as a game anymore.
---
Also i guess i'm the only person on the planet who didn't like RDR or NV... at all. Guess wild west stuff isn't my thing. But i also don't like GTA and Fallout 3/4 so maybe it's just that.
---
my fear
---
I may or may not have also bought it solely for this...
---
Yea, look. Im a hardcore player, i got probably downvoted cause that comment amde me come off as casual. I am a competitive person and i like to win and be a tthe edge. But classic to me is a bit ina  vacuum regarding that. But as i said, to each their own. My point was just that i find it weird how noobs to the game wanna know every efficient thing there is to do, when these people wont be at the edge anyway.
---
surely you are seeing one of his many posts by now they are all literally -downvoted, add nothing thats "classic-focused" and are just there to troll people
---
Dinged 60 in Hellfire Peninsula lol
---
90% of all streamers I’ve heard my step son listen to either sound like douche bags, or they’re constantly screaming into the mic. I always ask how he finds it enjoyable? That and most of the stuff I’ve heard is regurgitated crap with an opinion thrown in for flavor.
---
I don’t remember the name of the guy, he was fairly well known just not so much as Lorthar who was a bit of a legend.
---
Were you on the realm back then too? I’m trying to track down people I used to play with, don’t suppose you ever heard of Stormblaster, Lasso or Losso?
---
I never actually got to 60. Made it to about 51 or 52 when BC came out. I spent a lot of time just fucking around. I ran Deadmines about 30 times with guild mates. I got my fishing to 300 before I hit level 50.
---
Human warrior and dwarf priest both in EPL
---
I'm not being facetious here when I tell you that's just your interpretation man. He's poking fun at both sides and people are going to read into it what they want.
---
Towlie or something, I don’t follow streamers, I find then toxic to the game. I just heard from a friend.
---
I'm a casual nobody who sucks at WoW and I've been in every beta starting with Wrath. I've been playing since Nov. 24, 2004. Sorry you haven't gotten into a beta :(
---
TBH you aren't missing much. The only thing I wish everyone got to experience was beta DKs in Wrath. 5 manning level 60 dungeons with 4 Death Knights and no healer was a blast. Chains of Ice and Death Grip was so broken, you'd CoI a mob then Death Grip and it would launch the mob up in the air and put a slow fall on them. The ultimate for of CC.
---
I laughed. But Smirnoff? C'mon man...
---
It's not the same thing.  You either get that or you don't.
---
!remindme 1 day

This time around I am determined to finally get my full shadow craft set lol.

You think that's bad, check out the difference between the Druid thread and the Priest thread.
---
How do i get into investment banking without degree?
---
I'm rubbing mine right now. They are hard af
---
Uhhh, you cant hold a youtuber accountable for stating a list that is actually correct. Hell, bis-term didnt even exist back in vanilla, and everyone needed on whatever the fuck. Now if you think that a minor youtuber with a small audience could have such an effect on needing and greeing preferences that requires hating on him, then thats weird.
---
Also remember time saved will make you so much more later. Taking time to sell the stuff, plus the fact that not having the money in pocket might bring you up short on money for skills or even worse, your mount (even buying food/drink, flight paths, or portals from mages can speed you up). That could lead to taking hours longer to level.  Losing out on a few hours at later levels could be losing hundreds of gold.
---
For me even planning leveling as a palladin with the free mount, I am going to vendor pretty much everything because my leveling speed will heavily bank on how good my weapon is.
---
Why is the priest one freaking perfect and ALL the other classes have cracks n shit on the edges?
---
Maybe its a closed beta and hes giving out keys.

Ah nice, he was awesome. Gave young me lots of rogue tips in BC. You know the guy?

Nop, no one confirmed anything. Apparently there is a big announcement tomorrow.

I don't like to comment on action (or no action) taken in most cases, but I can say that I'm looking at them now and pointed the other mods at them, too.

# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Started by a bunch of irl friends (**and already at 35 members**) with top tier experience through all expansions. (**including world 8th kill TOTC**), Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours.
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We wanna give everyone a fair chance so if you wanna be Role officers or Raid leader the challenge is here and we will make you feel at home.
---
* We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Thu(+Sunday on progress). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will probably use Loot Council but DKP is still in discussion.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord **KingMavros#2601**

Sound still harsh. I mean if I’m sick, I just go to a doctor and he’ll prescribe me with the amount of days required to get better, and I get paid for those.
---
You missed my point I was more thinking about formating and advertising their content but what's wrong in making a video format for a written post?
---
Someone Plays Horde...
---
Such a strange paradigm shift to even consider tanking in a dps spec. But great to hear that's completely viable! Thank you!
---
Leading groups doesn't trouble me. I consider that an extension of the tanking role anyway. Honestly the biggest thing I'm afraid of is the plague of new people who don't understand or don't educate themselves on how threat works (healers and dps alike) who then wrongly blame the tank when they rip aggo for going full dps or pre-healing on pulls. THAT scares me. I worry how vitriolic it might be.
---
Im sure thats all people ask..thanks for your work
---
For what it's worth, if they were given this info by Blizz, and arenn't releasing it, they were very clearly embargoed.
---
What if someone nabbed the vendor pattern before you, do you just head on or are you going to hang around waiting for it?
---
Can you add what weapon were suppose to be trying to obtain from Deadmines?  This would be useful for the newer folks (-:
---

Okay cool. Just rumour. That’s that cleared up.
---
Where there's a will there's a way
---
I'm glad to know the rotation itself is relatively simple. Let's me focus on the other responsibilities and nuances of the role. Surprised dps-tanking works all the way to ~50!
---
10:01 youtubers bad
---
WPL I think
---
Ok I'll just say this.
---
If their videos weren't 10minutes and their videos were low quality/ unwatchable they would not be relevent enough to even talk about.
---
Strat and Scholo will have plenty of 58 or 59 leveled players running them. Maybe a few in LBRS as well. A fresh 60 will be able to run all of these for sure.
---
You only like classic wow because you don't know better.
---
Whoever think he will outsmart people in the AH at start is delusional, it's a waste of time and you are not on a private server dualscreening with 2 accounts.
---
There is only one way to make easy gold when a server launch. Selling crafting mats to plebs leveling LW/engi/BS. The best way is taking mining and skinning and level it accordingly to your current level (people tend to leave the tin zone before being able to mine Iron). Then make a lvl 5 alt and take enchant.
---
\- Send BoE useless item you drop to your alt and dis it.
---
\- For skinning vendor everything until you skin heavy leather, then start to sell it to AH or stock it for brotherhood.
---
\- If you are in the 1st to mine iron and mithril and later arcane crystal. I can assure you, you'll get your fast mount before hitting 60.
---
Back in vanilla, even in TBC when class leaders were a thing, most of your fellow class mates were your closer group. It always seemed dumb to rack up the dkp for a set! item against them.
---
As for ranged wep. and polearms it was a different thing among us hunters, we went on in that. :)
---
People getting mad or dramatic about that specific thing...
---
What really worries me is that this attitude is going to carry over into the game even when that's not how it was in 2004. I hear you can get banned in modern Blizz games like Overwatch simply for calling someone an idiot, but people in WoW years ago were way ruder than that without repercussion and it was largely up to players to deal with them themselves rather than get babysat.
---
Even ninjaing was well within the rules and when guild banks were introduced, there was no rule against "stealing" from them until much later, since you had the right to take whatever you were given permission to and it was up to the guild leader to keep it safe.
---
Attitudes are really different now. It's hard to imagine the game having close to the same kind of players, let alone realm forum banter where specific people get called out, etc.
---
Try play on a different server zone, OCE or EU or something
---
Meh, you could be right, but seems like OP has quite the bias, poking fun at only one side.
---
&gt; Retail IS the beta
---
BfA summed up
---
Isn't it clear were all having withdrawl Here? But really seems like my post got taken seriously too. Can we not be wise guys on the internet anymore? I really don't care about the topic heavily
---
Here is what sharding does, basically:
---
You know what instances are, right? Imagine that the zones in the "open world" are also just instances...with the difference that a) they never reset and b) they are not created by a portal and c) who gets to be in one, is determined by the server logic.
---
Now, the server keeps, at each point in time, N instances ("shards") for each zone. When players from the same realmpool walk into that zone, the server picks X (the maximum amount of players deemed healthy for a zone), puts them in N1, then fills N2, then N3, and so forth (Obeying some rules ofc, like keeping groups in the same shard. It likely starts to fill N2 before N1 is completely full to facilitate some form of load-balancing.).
---
Keep in mind that "Zone" is an arbitrary term here, that doesn't necessarily coincide with the named Zones of the game world. It's a finite area in the open world.
---
Now, all you have to do, in order to make sharding possible in only a few zones, is configure N to be 1 for all Zones where you don't want sharding. And voila: limited sharding.
---
Would that be hard or unusual? No.
---
Because N is dynamic to begin with. TO save resources, the server doesn't keep a fixed N forall zones at all times...for example, it doesn't make sense to have 10 southern Durotars  on the retail servers when there are only a few people down there. So N is dynamic, and can change, and you can bet that it can be set manually as well.
---
Ditto. Can't believe they didn't invite MadSeasonShow to their secret meeting. He's just a huge cut above the rest of the saturated WoW Classic YouTuber scene.
---
You're one of the lucky minorities then.
---
just create your own groups and kick the toxic people, dps/healers are usually appreciative of tanks because they are so few though.
---
Hes prob like "that idiot should have kept his mouth close"
---
Haven’t most if not all Blizzard betas been closed, at least at their beginnings?  I doubt it will be JUST streamers that get in, but there will probably be limited invites.
---
I support the content creators, i don't get the hate.. it's nice to have vids to click on during the wait for info and they have a hard task in making interesting vids using info we all have access to. Don' be hatin'
---
He has always liked classic, but he is a current player that wants to play and experience newer stuff to be released and progress the account he has had since vanilla. That is why he was never a fan of it, and you can't blame him for that because thats a completely valid reason.
---
No. It’s not even summer
---
I just realised how this is absolutely going to happen.  I think it's going to scale a lot more though.  Like 100 classic gold for 100k retail gold.  Considering how much easier retail gold is to come by.
---
LMAO
---
This is some prime bullshit. If you head over to Tips' channel and browse the videos, you'll see that none of them are 10:01, actually many of them are 7-9 minutes long. I had to go back 9 months to find a video that was just barely above the magic 10min mark.
---
It won't, so this is useless speculation.
---
Thanks! Really appreciate it.
---
Lol whats this for? Context on this seems to be missing. Seems like he may be talking about the future potential of Classic iterations? IDK
---
No speakers?
---
What? we definitely know better now. lol
---
Feral as in cat/dps form is what I specifically meant.
---
Oh, did that make no sense?  Fancy that.
---
This is 500x more likely than any insider info. They know they have people autistically following everything they post right now and it's literally free money to just post random cryptic shit that everyone loses their mind over.
---
Thats my only thought. Hes laughing at Towelliee just dropping all the bombs and nobody knowing if its true or not, lol
---
No lol
---
Did you just say you look up to Asmongold?
---
Hahaha, Tips legitimately did not know demo shout worked this way, he never played vanilla. There is no "playing dumb" for the sake of the interview, he genuinely doesn't know 1/10th of what a content creator should know about the game they create content for. Maybe if this was an isolated incident, I'd agree with you. But he has shown us time and time again he knows very little.
---
Watch the footage of him playing the demo.
---
Oh yeah I expect it to be a little bit of a slog for sure lol
---
Thanks so much for the input!
---
Doubters be damned. I’ll believe cause I want to believe it.
---
I think highly unlikely that game release tomorrow. Blizzard would want to build up the hype. 
---
It can be possible that a release date will be announced. I think classic would have to wait after BFA update comes out.
---
Human Paladin in Western Plaguelands.
---
For me it feels very counterproductive to level an another class just for farming. Even if you powerlevel an easier class, it will take 6 played day (~144+ hours). And then you have to gear it some to be effective.
---
Meanwhile if you already have your warrior main, which you farmed gear/skills/profs for you are much better off. If you farmed for 144 hours even with a shitty gph strat you would make thousands.
---
Many people dig this pseudo-socialising. For many people streamers that interact with chat is their only interaction.
---
God, that would be disgusting to be allowed to keep beta characters. Yes please, let’s make a limited beta only allowing some in and give them a head start on the game. Totally ignoring the purpose of a beta, to find and squash bugs or stress test populations.
---
(For the record, I could give a rip about getting into the beta or having a head start or not since I will play classic for the journey, not the rush to 60 so I can be bored in molten snore again)
---
you'll do less damage than pretty much every other dps class for twice the amount of effort put in.
---
I'm hopeful that they're starting to redirect current wow very slowly into that game design philosophy. 8.2 is looking very promising and it's obvious from the classic fans that there's something magical about vanilla so I'm sure they've analysed and gone back to vanilla to figure it out. One example of me thinking this is having new resistance gear again, very minor detail but still a bit of an RPG element. Ion said they want to take more risks and give more abilities to the player from now. I unfortunately don't think we'll get a new experience I'm just hoping that wow will slowly, slowly go back onto the path that made the game great in the first place.
---
It's all younger and younger people who don't know how to find their own dank content. 
---
Just like this recent rash of YouTube videos that are literally just people scrolling through Reddit. It's absolute garbage.
---
thats smart
---
Well they are for when you are actually sick. Vacation time is "fuck I need a day off" or "Classic WoW is July 16 I need a week off boss"
---
The only reason I believe this is plausible is because they are not going into this blind, and with the most optimistic reasoning, they really only have to make sure the servers and graphics hold up, everything else is database information which was mostly filling in the blanks with an old game like this. Realistically, we are in uncharted territory with a re-release like wow classic, so how do we truly know what to expect when there isn't anything truly similar to compare this to? Regardless, I'll be more than grateful for the next table-scrap of official WoW Classic information Blizzard drops on us regardless of what it is.
---
Honestly what's there to be jealous of? Being a YouTuber or streamer seems miserable and unfulfilling.

Cannabis enthusiasts &amp; Gamers collide here at  ⚔️ **420 High Rollers** ⚔️ ! (*&lt;CDXX High Rollers&gt; guild name, &amp; yes.. CDXX = 420 in roman numerals).* We are a tight-knit age **18+** community that has been growing like a WEED since 2014. Established at the launch of Destiny 1 on PS4, we have since expanded to reach members of all game-types &amp; styles. Ever since the announcement of WoW - Classic, we have been ecstatic &amp; several members have been day-dreaming about which class to play.

Little bit about me personally.. Started at the Burning Crusade &amp; played all the way through Cataclysm. The times where I was most heavily time invested was the BC era. Worked my way from the bottom..a lonely little Blood Elf Paladin not knowing another soul (my RL friends stopped playing after vanilla) to eventually getting in with a end-game raiding guild &amp; becoming their Main Tank for Serpentine Cavern, Tempest Keep and beyond progression (tiers 5 &amp; 6). At the launch of WolK, I kept trucking along.. got through the first couple raids, but eventually I stopped playing as much as I had mainly due to not having as much free time. When Cataclysm dropped the same story ensued, but I did complete all the raids when it was end game content. Pandaria &amp; WoD is where WoW for me started to become unrecognizable, so far removed from what I knew. Everything seemed so streamlined &amp; forgiving.. &amp; nothing felt special any longer. I yearned for those feels, &amp; was jealous of players that were able to experience WoW in it's original, raw state. This is when I abandoned the game completely, &amp; started to focus my game-time elsewhere.
---
WELL as we know, that's all changed now.. the Nostalgia is coming back in full swing &amp; **420 High Rollers** will be there for all of it! Looking to start gathering interested people &amp; starting a **NA** **HORDE** guild on a **PvP** server to smash out ALL of the raids/pvp/end game content CLASSIC WoW has to offer.

I would be pissed. As I currently only have use of 1 hand while the other is in a full cast.
---
That’s awesome! It’s been a trip going back through and actually getting a toon back you spent so much time on.
---
&gt;Just *Incase*
---
Great artist.
---
That username...
---
Fucking lol at the rogue dying to a melee hunter at 4:20
---
I wish people were going to be as bad at the game in Classic as they were during actual vanilla lol
---
Yolo I guess.
---
I don't think being compared to the goth kids from South Park is meant to be taken proudly.  However one side does seem to take more of the brunt of the joke.
---
No, just because I don't know what OP is specifically referring to doesn't mean that I can't agree with Towelliee and his opinions in general
---
This is why you should hate on YouTube not the content creators. Most youtubers wish they didnt have to make 10 minute videos, its not a option for them they have to follow the rules. It works exactly like most businesses if your not doing what the company wants you to be doing your gonna lose your job.
---
Found the Gnome.
---
Good point. I've dps'd my way through the last 13 years on almost every class in the game, at one point or another. Dps never really got much saying power except the periods where i was in end game prog. I forgot that tanks in Classic tended to have a bigger voice by virtue of scarcity.
---
It's going to be interesting to see how the community shapes itself. Whether it mirrors the Old Ways or if society norms on servers is totally new. I look forward to it!
---
Dwarf hunter Nozdormu EU. Also in Winterspring killing frostsabers.

Nothing to do with vendor patterns or buying things from vendors. I mapped out all the profitable crafts I can do that will net me a PROFIT to a vendor.

I'm getting downvoted by a bunch of kids who want free info apparently. Pass.

I'll get round to it soon. :)
---
I thought of playing druid and try new stuff, but nothing is really set in stone yet. Might play Warlock, might go back to being a mage, which I am since TBC.. who knows...  
---
But I wasn't just speaking for me. I just want to see variety.
---
why herb over mining for leveling?
---
I think you're defending a lot more people than deserve it.
---
I see way too many streamers with dead looks in theirs who reuse the same jokes and honestly it looks like I'm watching someone who hates their job but doesn't want to do something else
---
It's as interesting as talking to someone at a watercooler at work.

Your grandma could pve well in vanilla wow if she knows how to use a keyboard for most classes
---
Prep will take you a LONG way there. Then it's just a question of mashing buttons and not doing anything too stupid.
---
40 man raids are not tightly tuned even in Nax, the last raid
---
I think you mean Thottbot.
---
Are you going to quit BFA when Classic comes out?
---
Lmao, I think I’ve embarrassed myself thinking it was the cool side first.
---
Undead Warlock, Western Plaguelands, killing Shades at Gahrons Withering, because nobody went there.
---
Blizzard would never let "the community" announce something.
---
Nice. I always wondered how I would play wow if I lost my right hand.
---
Mmhmm.
---
if you want to make the math that simple, you have to assume unlimited mobs with no downtime in between.
---
It actually takes you a lot longer than 15 seconds to kill that beast, you aren't factoring in everything you had to do to get to that point
---
I'm the same age as you and I hate streamers and streaming culture. I still miss pre-monetized YouTube. I started playing in 2.0 though
---
I can only dream of being that blissfully gullible and ignorant.
---
You might find yourself a little low on gold at 40 though
---
Not mindblown, but anxious, i still dont know what class i wanna main..
---
It’s a terrible amount of damage 
---
71-80
---
Damage max rank
---
145 mana 
---
A bis mage is going to be around 600 spell damage “roughly”.  With a 13% coefficient this makes its final damage on a target with no resistances about 140-150.   Or roughly a wand attack. 
---
Rank one is a 1/3 of the mana at a 55 cost, and damage around 19-22 base damage, or about 90-100 damage.  
---
Now you may be thinking “with a mage in bis gear what’s 100 mana?  Well as a mage you are going to come across someone living because you don’t have enough mana for a Fireblast 100 times over before you have someone live because they didn’t get hit with a max rank nova.
---
Why build more hype when they've already expressed concerns about starting zones at release? Sharding is an unauthentic experience. They want to use as little of it as possible.
---
Yeah you can fuck right off. Clickbait bullshit.
---
I really don’t know. I think I’m going to just raid mythic tues and wed and play classic every other day including all and night on the weekends.
---
would be pretty stupid from Actiblizzard, they would never do anything so dumb... hahaha... haha.... 
---
Diablo Immortal
---
I guy asked you what he said, you said no but his right because generally his right - you don't see anything wrong with that?
---
That would be the most guaranteed method to find people ... I guess I'll keep it in mind as a last resort, I'm just worried about lag.
---
How do you see sharding to factor in to this?
---
I agree that realm population caps will exist. But I think they will be higher than 5k. Blizzard is preparing for a game that booms in Q3, but dies off by January. They stated that starting zones will initially be sharded to prevent overwhelming mobs trying to level on launch day. This way launch will be smooth for groups of people, but after the fair-weather tryouts don’t come back the servers won’t be sparse. 
---
I expect the beta to be open for 6-10 days to the anyone who is subbed. The intention will be to test one server’s zone shard functionality and to determine if it’ll be needed in secondary zones like the Barrens, Ashenvale, Westfall, Redridge, etc. 
---
I also expect a second limited beta to test and fine tune the numbers (raid or dungeon mob HP, dmg, resistances, etc) to ensure phase 1 aligns smoothly with 1.12 stats. 
---
These two betas could be inverted. I would be shocked if there was only 1 beta.
---
Honestly it would kind of suck all things considered. There'd be a total panic and frenzy just for choosing servers, no time to get PTO, addons not working, game hasn't truly been tested, etc.
---
They said prepare for a classic summer. They never said prepare for release during summer. June 21 is the start of summer, still earlier than the July date we've been quoting.
---
I think a lot of people were, myself included. Also got the opportunity to try it out and actually enjoyed the fuck out of it.
---
Just keep in mind that's also why guilds that are more casual lean toward dkp and hardcore guilds traditionally run loot council. If loot has priority over progression then corruption is much more likely. Good guilds usually don't have trouble with the loot council being corrupt because so much was invested in building the guild and people at that level have high expectations of leadership.

We are a hardcore 40 man raiding guild based on the West Coast.Our faction is Alliance with no intentions of going horde.  Core members have a wide range of experience ranging from US and World competitive Naxxaramas clears in original Vanilla and Private Servers to server first endgame content up to current retail WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including but not limited to rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 gladiators across every expansion, Hero of the Alliance/Horde and even pro gaming experience across various games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining. We expect you to know your class, game mechanics, and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic. We pride ourselves on using raiding time so efficiently that it doesn’t require an exponential amount of time to clear content.
---
If our goals match your own feel free to reach out to myself or any of the Incarnation officers on Discord, and apply on our website for consideration.
---
Cheers, and we'll see you on launch!

If beta gives us the opportunity to try some pre-made higher level (e.g. lvl 40, 50, 60) characters I might try out beta.  I could play around with some character classes I don't have any desire to grind up the higher levels.  Then at launch I'll switch my focus to my main; likely an undead priest.
---
But I'm not going to beta an undead priest just to start from scratch a new undead priest at launch.
---
Sacrificing all the goats today hoping it's friends and family.
---
I said his ideas and opinions after generally right, and that I didn't know what OP was specifically referring to, seems perfectly valid to me
---
It's like people have no ability at all to read between the lines. It's pretty easy to tell what he means if you just think about it for a moment.
---
How is that in contradiction to what I said. Stop thinking anout them, don’t watch them. If people do watch them they apparently like the community or enjoy the stream.
---
Black rock mountain for sure
---
Imagine being so invested in something and then...that
---
Is Disc priest decent for pve and pvp? What about shadow? I really want to play priest but I don't care for holy that much. Any other classes that can heal but are also competitive in pvp?
---
Or save your sick days for actual Vanilla release???
---
Anyone else hating on Kargoz these days? the content was pretty good for awhile, but it feels like months of recycling has led to his content turning to pure shit.
---
No cause you can atleast type out a sentence, let me know how your dump is going
---
Played since TBC. BfA sucks, I cant wait. Leveling on a TBC private server right now.
---
I dont want to play in a classic beta past lvl 20 because I know I will just end up burning myself out
---
These were all prototypes. I ended up liking the way the blade scarred edges looked, and continued it. I believe the Hunter also didn't receive the scars.

I've never seen anyone play a max-level Warrior in classic who didn't also have the exact attitude you'd expect a hardened warrior in Azeroth to have.

Legion was implemented well? Is it good? Well, is every PC being their class leader good? That's not an MMO, so no.

Warrior is about the grind. But it pays off.

I have company coming on Wednesday for a week, LOL. Would be a bad time for me too but I would find a way
---
Naysayer
---
Ditch the mage and play a lock.
---
They said at some point "coming summer 2019" but who would really complain about an early release, lol
---
I hope there won't be. There won't be half as much hype on release if they do a beta.
---
Rogues can easily run away from pretty much every fight. FAP and sprint is like a cheat code for running away. Blind/kick if someone tries to cast cc spells.
---
Preparation to reset all your cds and try again if you failed.
---
Gathering is not an issue but crafting is another. The recipes alone cost gold when you get to the 225+ recipes. Also most people say once you hit ~20 don’t spend gold on anything even skills in order to afford your mount.
---
I think classic was more encouraging to "side quests" (for example, me, as a level 47 hunter deciding to spend ages soloing the elites outside of ZF instead of questing for some reason? or repeatedly running SM for the totally-not-Hunter-mail/axe) instead of forcing you to hit max level and start raiding/organized PVPing
---
I already played classic beta. That greatness will never be able to be recaptured. 
---
Playing on a 19" CRT monitor with a top of the line 256MB graphics card ooooh yeah.
---
At 60
---
I doubt it would happen as there are still many bugs out there to find. HOWEVER....... those bugs could be dealt with rapidly after release as they get reported? Its plausible I suppose
---
Stop spending all gold after you hit lvl 20
---
I hope so, I am essentially retired and while my kids are at school I am free most the day
---
Disagree with flasks. Unless you have a horde of priests running 8/8 T2 or bring 15+ healers with you to Naxx you'll need flasks for at least Saph at least until you're geared. Ideally most high level end bosses would be wisdom flasked in progression phases.
---
As for runes...you do know they are popped like candy in Naxx, right? And that a Scholo run is MINIMUM 90 minutes with your average group, often longer. Runes are really a fucking pain in the ass. Using pserver economies as an example, 1 fucking rune is about 10g. If you use 10 runes in a 4 hour raid (honestly not a stretch at all) you're basically out one full flasks worth of gold.
---
I agree healing is far cheaper than melee but I think any guild requiring their casters to flask for content will also require mageblood/nightfin/runing/potting on c/d which gets expensive -- and they have to be repopped each time in the way that a flask doesnt.
---
I'm in the same boat as you.
---
I can only conclude that there are a fuckload of haters on this sub that just don't want these people to succeed for whatever fucked up reason they have in their mind.
---
The content they are trashing is totally undeserving of the incredible critisisim it gets from redditors.
---
It's not really up to me to "not watch it" as I work with someone who watches it constantly at work. Boss allows it. 
---
So I also have a biased view. Whereas some people are indifferent to streamers, I already didn't care and now I'm forced to watch, which only fuels my dislike.
---
Saving comment for potential application.
---
  not confirmed.  :c
---
I don't understand what faerie fire is going to do to a rogue if he decides to run away. Just FAP and sprint. Gouge/blind if necessary. Use preparation reset cds if you somehow didn't get away yet. And then mount up and go.
---
Rogues who are prepared for PvP do not need to stay in any fight that they don't want to. They pick their fights and can escape any 1v1 fight.
---
There’s no way it comes out tomorrow my dude.  They will milk it with a release date
---
Lol okay dude. Of all the unacceptable practices out there stretching youtube content is on your list... These channels are absolutely community driven. If the content is that bad and outrageous no one would watch it and the channel would die. Especially a channel as niche as classic world of Warcraft content.
---
Yeah this is kinda sad actually. I don't see how this is even slightly inspiring. Putting your entire life on hold for months to get an achievement in a video game that meant nothing once BC was released.
---
Everyone's ten years older.   
---
Ten years wreak havoc on your hands and reflexes. 
---
I'm probably about 80% of what I used to be in terms of speed. Might go up as I get used to gaming again but, kinda doubt it.

Which is to say a controller *might be* when more useful now that the advantage of having a mouse is somewhat lessened, because we're all so fkin old.
---
\+1 for art
---
well what would I even need to buy besides the few skill ranks I actually need? I was already assuming I wouldn't be spending much gold
---
these are classic wow autists we are amongst. Social intelligence isnt their strong suit.
---
The optimist in me wants to say they'll release a short beta tomorrow until the weekend, with actual Classic releasing the week after.
---
I know this is incredibly hopeful thinking, though.
---

Happy to help.
---
I agree, people change their minds. I was against classic when people were asking for it constantly, but now that its closer and I have been on the nostalgia train I am actually pretty excited for it. 
---
I am not defending Towelliee, I personally don't care for his personality, but people do change their opinions on things.
---
"I am smarter and better than you"
---
Those 8 morons that downvoted you have apparently never worked a job where certain things had to be done each day no matter how many staff members actually showed up to work. It's totally fun to work 16 hour holiday shifts in healthcare because assholes got too shitfaced the night before to take care of the patients.
---
Everyone will be in Naxx this time around.  It was a different mmo environment back in 2006. I guarantee half the people on my server didn't even know naxx was a thing nor did they care.
---
Around level 5ish. The beginner quests are in Northshire.
---
They aren't lesser known, but do you expect them to have mobs of followers? do they constantly throw their face out there, and act like they're having cnn panel discussions when someone from blizzard sneezed? You're nit picking terminology. If Its mid early to mid 2000s and I say I like lesser known comedians compared to dane cook, and bring up a popular comedian like Joe Rogan, do you not understand what I mean?
---
It's clear to tell who cares about being a celebrity and building a community around their OWN image vs. who's actually a creative entertainer, who wants to laugh with us, and so on.
---
i think streaming outside of fast paced competitive games like rocket league is BORRRRRING. watch people play for half a mill on the line, and thousands of dollars of advertising with 40 seconds to go, or pay some guy to watch him kill shit in the barrens all day? yawn. it's about immersion with such games, so HOW IS STREAMING EVEN A THING WITH THEM??
---
I hope with that confidence, you’ve never been wrong about anything in your life.
---
Where have you heard someone say they will be playing in a few hours? Best I have heard is 16 hours, thats a bit more than a few.
---
Meh, they don't know shit. Druids have super efficient heals done right
---
Troll holy priest - dinged grinding Timbermaw rep - can’t wait to do it all again
---
Good points you made btw!
---
So similar to what you said, I believe sharding will exist like it did in Vanilla and nothing more.  Specific sharding to break up continents, instances, and other databases as needed.
---
The difference we see more with modern WoW sharding is the excessive use of controlled phasing to really alter the amount of players in any zone, as well as types of sharding that go beyond Classic WoW, such as Warmode. 
---
I try to stick to my belief that realms will still be capped at lower numbers. Maybe not 5k, maybe 8k? We sadly won't know yet, but I'd rather see more overall realms, just being filled at first by the mass numbers interested, and then offer free transfers to servers that begin dying off to repopulate realms as time goes on, similar to how they use to function with realm transfers back in Vanilla, TBC. 
---
I believe that becoming a part of that realms community, and knowing who players were, and making a name for yourself within a server, came from the lack of extreme cross-realm and LFG/LFR content, as well as small realm population/size. I guess in reality, as long as those other factors don't play a part, a bigger sized realm wouldn't be terrible, but I feel like that would take away from that Classic experience.  
---
I could totally see 2 betas, or maybe even more than that! We have plenty of time to test multiple features.  If you look back at the original release of WoW, the game didn't even have druids and hunters 4-5 months prior to its release, and they eventually made it in time.  Anything is possible!
---
Oh fuck yeah I forgot you could farm rep doing those for a bit. Most likely I did the farm grinding cause my buddy that was more into raiding took me along. I remember thinking it was cook I hanging out with his guild.
---
Unless he thinks 16 hours is "a few" IDK what hes talking about
---
imagine being mad that you don't have a healthcare system you can abuse to steal money from your work so you can stay home and play WoW
---
take whatever this chronic shitter on pre-announcement classic players says with a grain of salt.  this oaf has zero integrity
---
what?
---
&gt;The answer to FAPS is a FAP.
---
Not for a mage because mages don't have 30 seconds of sprint @ +70% movement speed that a prep rogue has.
---
&gt;Also sheep works wonders for waiting out the duration of it.
---
You cannot sheep a rogue before you die. How do you sheep a rogue who is stabbing your face when he can kick/blind/blind again with prep/vanish cheap shot/kidneyshot/or use gradgets to interrupt and stun you?
---
&gt;Its the same on druid. It's terrible having somebody blow a FAP against you...unless you also have a FAP.
---
Druids can get away but they cannot stop a rogue from getting away and they can't kill a rogue. Mages basically has no chance against a rogue that's prepared for pvp.
---
in LBRS
---
Tips started with the second part
---
Well, what would they have to test? The server side elements of the 7.3.5 client were a direct result of years of building on the vanilla tech. The fact they painstakingly spent years making sure the spawn points were accurate tells me the only server side tech needing testing is the raids. That could've been done easily in house. Watch a few interviews with Mark Kern. Untested Classic WoW is the authentic experience. They couldn't test Scholomance in house until after release.
---
&gt; If you don't want to talk, don't play a warrior. 
---
I remember trying to level a warrior, and back then doing dungeons was not exactly par for the course. It was possible to hit level cap without doing any because having a solid team that COULD was difficult to organize. Real lack of tanks and healers in those days, especially leveling up. 
---
So I got a random message "Hey, want to run Dungeon X? :)" and I said "Sure." Definitely not going to say no to doing a dungeon! And they probably messaged me because they just need one more Joe to do some damage, I'm sure. You wouldn't message a random person and expect them to tank/heal without even mentioning it. Right? ...Right? 
---
Walked all the way across the map to get there. 
---
We get in the dungeon. 
---
Nobody is pulling. 
---
So I asked "Who's... uh, who's the tank?"
---
"You." 
---
Motherfucker. 
---
I wasn't even prot spec'd. They bamboozled me. 
---
But I didn't walk all the way out here for nothing, so sure as hell I'm not going to just LEAVE now. I gave it a shot, and it went about as you expected it would. 
---
Moral of the story? If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. **If you are a warrior in classic, people will expect you to tank.** It's not fair, and I agree. So roll a huntard like the mediocre shit you are because warriors come with expectations. :(
---
Huntard doing his role
---
People have a real hard on for you guys.

---
As the other guy said, there is a bunch you can do on your own. I mean, just getting to 60 will take you a while. If you aren't trying to "speed run" it, it's easily several weeks of actual play time just to get to 60. The fastest optimized players will still be 4-7 days of actual game time
---
Once you're at 60, there is a bunch you can do solo. You can finish of quest chains, run dungeons, get into pug raids (pug = pick up group, i.e. randoms) or fill missing slots in other guild raids, etc.
---
Just working the auction house is a whole meta-game in itself that can be rewarding.
---
WoW Classic is a very social game, however. You simply cannot do half the end-game content without a big and dedicated group.
---
It's what makes it a time sink, but it's also what makes it great. It's like playing in a sports team. You need to work with those guys for months, form bonds with them, and achieve (lol "achieve") something together.
---
Frankly you'll probably find yourself joining a guild anyway. You don't need to commit to hardcore raiding. There are plenty of guilds that do it on a much more casual basis. You won't progress as far or as fast, but that really doesn't matter. Finding a good group and having fun is what matters :)
---
Look through your tv's settings and see if there is a gaming input setting. My TV from like 2012 has it and it's great

I'm just an old school vanilla player making an educated guess like everyone else. I respect your opinion and I'm prepared to be fantastically wrong.
---
1g please.
---
Ive played both and warrior is probably more fun if you have the time and good people around you. Lead from the front in pve and pvp.
---
That said I will play hunter this time because for the real warrior experience you need to be dedicated, and due to various reasons I'm going to enjoy that casual life this time.
---
What opinion of his is "generally right" because his been exposed for having "insider information"
---
Killing packs of elite lv 25 mobs means you got to be a few levels above.  40+ is advisable.  Ofc that’s not leveling but still aoe grinding.  
---
Stockade is fastest when it comes to grinding wool. 
---
/min. But ofc not aoe leveling friendly.  
---
But Just go for humanoids then.  Avoid ogres as they got more hp then the rest. (Even tho they got a good drop rate on cloth), they are not worth it imho.  
---
The werewolf’s in dusk woods and the gnolls / orcs in wetlands us another option.  
---
I don’t think we got sane data on drop rates.  Only private servers and old memories.
---
Heres 10, stay frosty friend
---
Because producing videos takes time?
---
Blizzard wants content creators to have vidoes and prepared streams the day of. Not giving them time to do so is a surefire way to have a sloppy, misinformed release day announcement. 
---
Blizzard wants their content creators on the same page, giving them the info ahead of time and allowing them access to a rep they can get clarity from would be ideal than having the "voices of the community" (like it or not, they have 10k -100k watching their videos, we dont) be completely disjointed, potentially spewing out mis/incorrect information.
---
Truth hurts. Look at those downvotes
---
Locks garbage af in dps and PVP  at fresh 60
---
People buy dumb shit like pets and crafting material.
---
Such a shame too. I hope he gets a beta invite before some of these band wagon streamers. If there is a beta ofc
---
Die early on (u run faster in spirit form) and res at the spirit healer in DM
---
Damn man... memories.
---
Vendors actually have useful weapons
---
This is exactly why they would want a surprise release. You still want to play, but you wouldn't be able to play if they just randomly dropped it. Starting zones would have less of a load meaning less sharding and a more authentic vanilla experience.
---
it was, for the time. internet meme production has come a long way.
---
&gt; Of all the unacceptable practices out there stretching youtube content is on your list
---
You make it seem like I am on some sort of crusade to rid the world of this terrible practice but it just isn't true. The topic is "hate on vanilla content creators" and one of the problems is filler. I just don't think filling videos is good for anyone but the people making the videos. It's deceptive and greedy, even if some people don't mind or like the filler. Simple as that.
---
Yo are we Coo?
---
I hope people aren't so mind-numbingly stupid that they think a game ported into a new framework, *bound* to have bugs regardless of how much internal Q&amp;A would be done, would release months before the company has already decided it would release, without a private or public beta, with absolutely no press fanfare or ramp-up, *before* the content update of their main iteration of the game.
---
OP is wrong. This isn't a "smart business decision". It would be the single dumbest business decision Blizzard has ever made. All their fans hoping to take PTO would no longer have that opportunity. No ad buys would be done on any major sites or networks. The game would be riddled with bugs, and the community would erupt in utter chaos. Blizzard doesn't want "tricking in" on their servers to avoid server overload. They *want* server overload, because it means the release was a success. They specifically recoded the starting zones to facilitate the burden of a day one launch crowd.
---
This is, by far, the dumbest suggestion I've seen someone make on this subreddit in at least a week. Which says a lot, because I see some really, *really* stupid suggestions on this subreddit. It will not happen, not a chance, 0% ever. It's a hypothesis born of boredom and desperation and not a lick of common sense. Blizzard actually doing something like this would be a worse debacle than the debut of *No Man's Sky.*
---
Examples? Cause I've never seen him have insider information.
---
skin and dont buy gear off of AH
---
there's some cooking recipes that cost 70 copper and convert to 7 silver ish
---
You seem like you need a break from the internet, friend.
---
The comfy lil totem spiral in thunderbluff
---
I think you severely underestimate the impact of the changes they're making, it would be a colossal mistake to release without testing.  There's basically no concept of "safe changes" as far as software goes, anytime you touch something there's a good chance you're introducing unwelcome changes.  With a project this size and the fact that they're basically merging two states of the game I think you can understand how many potential issues there are. There's no way for them to exhaustively test on their own, and what could make matters worse is that most devs tend to do a lot of "happy path" testing, e.g. "nobody is going to do that, so i won't bother looking at it"
---
If you’re not gathering, I don’t see how you’ll mKe any coin. Skinning may slow you down a little, but when your playing 14hrs a day, will it really make a difference, if you take 6 days or 7 days to get to 60? 
---
If you’ve no gold at level 40, how will u get a mount never mind picking up cheap stuff on the AH.
---
I don't disagree that the theory has a BIT of traction but its pretty far out there.
---
Edit: I just keep remembering TipsOut saying "5, we are this close to more content than we could ever hope for" That does sound like more than a beta to me
---
From what Ive learned playing on private servers, by the time BWL hits, alot of people have a farming alt either hunter or mage (especially the warriors). Leveling an alt when you already have a 60 character is alot easier since you can min/max the gear off AH and also boost through dungeons if you have two accounts.
---
If it's an actual release date please wink twice ;)
---
Hell yes. Get to try out my reef axe from BFD on horde scum &lt;3
---
99% of the "content" creators don't make any actual content. Most of them are literally regurgitating the same info that can be found on Blizzards own website verbatim as if people don't know how to read. They are monetizing free information.
---
I honestly think tips is a really good guy. Is there something I'm missing? (Seriously I'm not too educated on his history)
---
Mark Kern and John Statts have both said in interviews that the Vanilla dungeons were not properly tested until after release. Bugs are an integral part of the Vanilla experience. With all the time they've spent making sure textures and spawn points are correct, it's not a far stretch to think that the modern WoW server tools (which were made in response to the vanilla server demands) can more than handle the load.
---
I don't really understand the hate lol, the dude hooked me up with a Legion beta key. Streamers try to be as fair as possible when distributing these keys. So what if they use them to get views? It's their job. They have to hype it up as much as possible. They don't care whether you like em or hate em, but you're talking about them. No such thing as bad publicity. Cheers fellas
---
I'm pretty sure you won't have the 90 or so gold at 40. And to get your mount you can do one of two things 1. Grind some lucrative spot for about 5-6 hours at or near to 40. I normally go to kill panters/crocoliscs in swamp of sorrows. But that's whit skinning (they give heavy leathers) or 2. You can keep levelling until maybe 42-43 and buy the mount then you should have enough by then
---
Niceee. The Alex Jones chicken had me going . You should check out the scorecraft videos on WoWs music, they're pretty good stuff.
---
Who's been doing the shaman guides? Pretty sure my gf wants to shaman and that will go perfect with my wanting to level a warrior.
---
no amount of money would make me watch a turncoat like you. keep pretending you actually cared about classic, the real classic fans know where your loyalties lie.
---
We'll see
---
To be fair, tendies, football with the boys, Breakfast club and Lindsey Lohan in mean girls are all bitchin'. 
---
And Jack n smirnoff suck ass.
---
the madman came through! slowclap.gif
---
Remember when Tipsout said that he would be multi-tasking during the last episode of GoT, as a direct reference to Classic Wow? I almost hope nothing happens so that people can finally see Tips for what a lot of us see him as.
---
Its plausible but seems like a stretch to think it will release tomorrow anything is possible tho I guess
---
Simulating server stress is *much* easier these days then it was back then. 
---
That said yes, an expanded beta does make sense in the context of weeding out bugs, and testing server stress at the same time is just as well.
---
People say they would be pissed...that would last 5 minutes lol. Lets play!
---
I would gladly trade some early launch inconveniences to be able to play now.
---
Thanks. I definitely think skinning mobs as I go will be faster than going mountless for 2-3 levels. This is the advice I was looking for
---
Not all people are min/maxing to 60. Looks like OP wants to level in Dun Morogh because it's _fun_. The train ride will take tops 20min back and forth
---
You’re probably hearing from the vocal minority. From 2005 to 2010 I played a Prot warrior. That’s all I ever knew. This time I’m going to play a class new to me, and dedicate my time to that main. My expectations are low, but at the same time I know I’m going to have a good time by keeping myself open minded. I’ll make new friends and follow them through Azeroth. I look forward to fighting in dead mines again with others who want to make this game a past time rather than a full time job
---
This is going to make this subreddit unreadable for the first few days then. The tears will be ridiculous if some Streamers that this sub spends a lot of time crying about, get early beta access while others are stuck on the outside.
---
Think Ill take a reddit break for a week or so if this is true.
---
Here's the simple reason why it won't happen, as I said in a snarkier manner to someone else responding to me:
---
You're wrong about it being a good business decision. It would be a terrible one. Any product, to be successful, needs a consumer base and advertisement. Blizzard has put out zero press releases, zero ad buys, zero *hints* about something like this. Furthermore, this isn't just a rerelease of Vanilla. It's Vanilla imported into the modern BfA framework, as devs have discussed at length at Blizzcon. It *will* have bugs. Bugs galore. They'd be releasing a buggy, poorly implemented game without advertisement in the middle of the week to a group of fans who have had no advance warning to take off from work or alternatively are still in school. It would be utter fucking mayhem, and Blizzard has never once in its entire business history done something even close to this. I know you and others are desperate for the game to release, but to send Classic live as a literal jumpscare tactic would be monumentally terrible for them in terms of player acquisition, player retention, server stability, bug avoidance, and press buzz.
---
Expect an announcement for beta. Sure. That's a reasonable suspicion. But I would in fact be mind-blown if this happened, in the same way that I'd be mind-blown if my computer spontaneously morphed into a hippopotamus, and I think the latter event is slightly more likely.
---
Because priests never use my "replace health bars with health pies" mod
---
As long as you don't mind going back for bear quest
---
This is likely.
---
WHAT?
---
EPL everytime. I ding 60 sometime during those kill a million bats, grubs, and plaguedogs quests.
---
Same here, NE warrior dinged on the undead side. 
---
Tanking that 5-man required serious situational awareness.
---
I'd be mindblown, I'll give you that... It'd also be pretty dumb.
---
I consider myself a casual gamer.
---
If I'm playing a game that I cant be competitive in as a casual gamer, I usually stop playing it. 
---
That's the only point I have. I'm not sure Classic WoW lends itself much to casual gamers at max level and that might have unforeseen consequences to server populations.
---
Either way, I'll enjoy the initial leveling and shitshow that the first 6 months are sure to bring.
---
I dont know, just take me for example. I do watch Madseasonshow, Tips and Kargoz.. but i just from the bottom of my heart cant stand Assmongold even though he has never done anything bad to me. I dont know why its happenin but it is.. and it might be familiar to others..
---
mage can do it yea
---
the physical dps really need new weapons to keep pace
---
Paladin/Warrior/Prob SHam i only play alliance really need good 2h's or your DPS goes to nothing relative to other classes. 
---
There are a lot of niches where you can make good gold early tho. Like for example crafting things out of leather you bought off the AH for real cheap. THen vendoring. I won't get into specifics because it might not be the same on classic but you can imagine what AH leather not that high above vendor will create. Can just AFK and make gold
---
Skinning is really good because of devilsaur, google it, not a huge deal to ding 60 and go level it either tho. It's basically a limited resource required for melee DPS pre bis. If you truly rush to 60 you'll be one of the first on the server with teh abilty to skin them and mass a giant bank. Controlling devilsaur is the most profitable thing you can do early in the patches. 
---
Then sell them in sets obsene amounts of gold later. And probably at the start too dpeending on how quick the server fills out.
---
Why do people take things so literal on the internet...  a few hours is a general saying where I come from.
---
Yes you are, you're exposed to them through YouTube. I've never watch anyone stream yet I know of several wow streamers by name just because of all the videos that pop up
---
Noggenfogger
---
Exactly, sure in some shooter game or something yeah beta is great, but mmorpg? Build a character, do what you do in an mmorpg: grind for hours then have it all erased and start over?
---
Noggenfogger....skelerogue and good cities/zones.
---
Its a general saying where everyone comes from I suspect. A few means around 3, surely less than 10. 16 Hours is far from a few but I understand what you mean now.
---
If anyone out there is organizing a North American guild for retirees, flex-time workers, night-workers, and the self-employed, let us know!
---
No it’s not. Even if the odds for getting into a beta are 99%, if they people chosen are random, the odds do not increase each time you do not get into one. Statistically, your odds do not increase.
---
&gt; Is it possible to speedrun to 40 with no professions and have the 100g when you get there?
---
It might depend on your class and how expensive their vital spells are, but if you focus on completing quest chains (especially group ones) and utilize some pre-40 item grind spots like Elemental Fire in Stonetalon Peak, definitely doable.
---
I barely played original Vanilla before BC came out, am I reading correctly that the trinket breaks different CCs based on the class? 
---
Druid only breaks - Charm, Fear, &amp; Stun but not Roots, Poly, &amp; Slow?
---
Yeah i know people who play Diablo 2 to this day since it came out, crazy bastards. Lucky them they didn't get their game disfigured and dismembered like us WoW players, it's still the same thing they played almost two decades ago. I might have been playing it still as well if it wasn't for WoW, it just outclassed it for me in almost every way.
---
And yeah those competetive games have infinite replay value, but i doubt there's plenty of people who play only one and for that long. Unless they aim for esport or just really like it, in which case it's a 10/10 game for them i guess.
---
Him and MadSeasonShow are my favorite classic **content** creators.  Like, legitimate, entertaining content.
---
Don’t complain about being on a dead server then.
---
Warriors benefit from gear more than any other class, hunters arguably benefit the least.
---
Any casual player will get a lot of enjoyment out of a hunter, rogue or mage at max level. 
---
Warriors require effort in some aspect of the game. Be it raiding or pvp, you need a source of decent gear. The level 58 and 60 pvp sets are good as is the rep gear (hello Unstoppable Force). 
---
A warrior who never raids, and never ranks/get exalted with pvp factions wont have much fun. 
---
A warrior, depsite gear is delicate on his own, and susceptible to being ganked--more so than any other class. With no transmogging it is easy to identify you as weak and even rogues will take a stab at you. That doesnt mean you are destined to die, but it does mean you need to be a better player to win--gear helps ease that (A lot).
---
sure that's the correct term, but i like the original comment text. it just FEELS better, like when you clean the wax out of the holes on each side of your head.
---
Link to this on amazon? I want to get the right one for classic but see a few of them.
---
&gt; There's no particular sense to it and the hate is completely disproportional.
---
it's a problem for a lot of youtubers. They are paid based on arbitrary limits. For example, you can only show two ads if your video is over 10 minutes. So instead of getting a great, informative video, you get 3 minutes of actual content and 7 minutes of filler.
---
I'm definitely a regular player and I was in it...yes they did. I can post screenshots from the discord from back then now that the NDA has lifted if you're that stubborn.
---
It's all relative, and as someone else mentioned dictated by the employer.  I'm in California (not sure if that makes a difference tbh) and my accruement is currently such that I get ~4 hours of sick time every (two week) pay period, and close to ~8 hours of vacation.
---
Even with taking off time for kids, illness, etc...I have over 120 hours of sick time available and I'm maxed at 384 hours of vacation (after 384 you just don't get anything).
---
I dont follow streamers but will watch a pvp video for the shitzngiggles or to learn something.   
---
From my understanding, the hate for classic streamers seems to be geared toward the fakes that didnt actually play vanilla and the bads who just parrot what they are reading here and claim it as their own.  
---
Plagiarism and intellectual piracy is the new light bulb.
---
May there never be an end agaib
---
Well, between Ythisen's Classicast interview and the dev water cooler, they HAVE tested the crap out of the new build. The initial technical issues were hammered out far before we heard of the project. They had to manually move every spawn point and integrate the database to the new format. A lot of that is copy/paste, not server related. They've also had a lot of time to recreate missing textures. The only things that would be server dependent after the data migration would be to make sure Mob autocast abilities would be functioning as intended (a common issue of private servers). All the other server side elements of vanilla still exist in some fashion in the 7.3.5 client. Threat, energy regeneration, and mana per 5 are all still present in the modern game files. Hunter pet skills were something they specifically said they were able to copy/paste with no issues into the modern client. That tells me the Classic community severely underestimates the compatibility between the two clients. What functions do you see breaking from the migration?
---
I don't mind that on Asmongolds stream, mainly because I actually enjoy his content most of the time.  Most of the twitch streamers who upload stuff on youtube ,like tipsout for example, don't have any actual content.  IMO at least.
---
i dont thing watching Ret Paladin to smash a horse would be nice ..
---
Jack Daniels and Smirnoff all day. If only I can be a troll drood or warlock :(
---
I bought this at a Walden Book store when I was 15. I am not sure your Amazon options but I would search World of Warcraft Atlas. Best guess
---
Well thankfully switching forms removes roots and can't be poly'd while in a form. Druid master class confirmed
---
Yes that is correct
---
Or enhance sham
---
The tidbits of information we've gotten from Mark Kern, John Statts, Ythisens, and now the streamers post summit are the reasons I've come up with this theory. I know it's super far out, and I'm prepared to be wrong. I honestly think we won't see a beta because of all the mounting evidence.
---
The OP asked what is best. 
---
Traveling between 1-10 zones is extremely inefficient. If he wants to do it, fine, great, have at it. But it comes with massive drawbacks, time being the largest among them. 
---
He should be warned his proposed leveling path will take considerably longer, right from the outset. If OP continues to want to do it--yippee. But its only fair to be warned of how much time he'd be spending not strictly playing the game.
---
I bet you my twitch channel you're wrong =)
---
Far be it for me to do know what they have going on in the underlying code but testing is not about predicting what will break, it's catching things you don't expect and doing due diligence.  Making assumptions around testing is a horrible mistake for any software, and worse it's an easily avoidable one.  There's almost no benefit to them skipping testing while there are plenty of benefits to doing it.
---
Also in-house/closed testing comes nowhere close to actual user testing
---
I personally enjoy madseasonshow. But I think he is starting to run out of stuff to talk about himself.
---
&gt; If your still reading this and believing this you should stop
---
?
---
People really should let go of the hope of Classic being released this summer. It's not happening people... wake up! For your health, let it go. Blizzard is 1000% going to delay this game. It's fun to talk about it and whatnot, I agree, but lets drop this whole "summer release" thing lol.
---
Me too. Count me and my wife in.
---
xfire! Yes!
---
What's the go to MH for warrior? 
---
weap. chain or something else?
---
I've mostly played rogue up until BWL so sharpening stones didn't really come into play.
---
That was a demo, not a beta. They specifically named it a demo so people wouldn't get confused.
---
Blizzurd iz no gud at speling.
---
I'm mad that I don't have healthcare system because when I get sick or injured, I'm just straight fucked.
---
And now I won't take the poll. I always read the comments first.
---
Depends what kind of person you are.   
---
Which really is the entire point in the first place.
---
i mean i sure hope so bud
---
i didnt read the text.
---
Can you fucking imagine someone taking a day off to watch that garbage lmao
---
The games longevity is highly tied to the “initial” hype and release. The bigger the crowd, the longer they can run the gig generally. I think blizzard primary objective is to get ur subs and fix stuff later.
---
Bad grammar. This is a troll.
---
Wtf are those pictures
---
Beta was in 2004
---
"Black King Lair"
---
Gold. Thank you for these, Prov.
---
We will see tomorrow. I will be online and ready around 6am PST. I am prepared for massive depression to kick in sometime tomorrow, as Leeroy once said "Alright, times up, lets do this!"
---
Unless you played a Death Knight. Soloing group quests and all that.
---
All classes are viable. Not all classes have viable specs for every role. 
---
For instance, Balance druid and elemental shaman are not viable given how much out of raid prep you need to do to not go oom in 45 seconds and how little they offer the raid. Hunters and Spriest and Feral Druids are viable but not optimal (the latter two off the backs of their support buffs/debuffs). 
---
Play what you want class wise, but know if your class can heal, odds are youre healing at max level content, only warriors can tank all content (and really only druids can tank a finite number of other content (paladins can meme on a few fights)). Youll have 1 spriest, 1 feral, 1 ret/enh per raid (or you begin to really gimp yourself, such that skill becomes needed)
---
You must really like downvotes.
---
1) Your subjective opinion. Show some examples where the bulk of the video content was summed up in 2 mintutes and then they just repeated themselves for 8 minutes.
---
2) Show examples. If you are going to pretend like class or leveling guides are stolen content you're a fucking stooge.
---
3)It's a 15 year old game, there isn't alot of new ideas to contribute. So fucking what if they get somthing minor wrong here and there? There are sometimes discrepancies between PS knowledge that they draw from and how the game actually worked / will work. Name the highest impact thing you can find that one of them got wrong. I highly doubt it's over something important.
---
5)So you hate somebody because of the uncontrolable behavior of some of their followers? Even in your example this shit makes no sense. Throw shade at the specific person for the specific things they did. If a black person steals something of yours are you going to become a racist or condemn that specific person? It's super fucking unreasonable to condem all streamers because a couple of them were assholes in the past.
---
5) WTF does this have to do with the price of tea in China? It has abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with the content people are shitting on right now.
---
6)Speculation is fun for some. Why do you care if they make a video to appease the group of people who like to speculate and make predictions? Don't watch if you don't want to. I'm not a fan of minecraft. I don't hate all minecraft streamers because the game isn't my thing. 
---
People around here like to lump all streamers in the same boat and shit on all of them based on specific things that one or two of them do.
---
If you have a problem with somebody then call that specific streamer out by name and address what your problem is with what ever they did specifically to piss you off, but this whole 'That one streamer bullied their guild into giving them a glaive, so fuck Tips and all other streamers for eternity' shit needs to stop.
---
As the creator of this image, I specifically choose to leave the great Malinko out of both sides of the this.
---
Who the fuck is someone?
---
And you posted this without even reading it?
---
/closed because stoopid!
---
Tips early videos were like watching a video your little brother made to "make it big", not even dissing tips, I thought it was adorable.
---
I'm going to rebut the central premise for a moment. I think you're doing yourself a disservice to race that quickly to 60. It's one thing if you already experienced the full level grind in the original game or played on private servers in the interim, but leveling is half the fun of Classic. Trying to race to 60 with 14 hours of gameplay a day is an empty endeavor unless you're doing it with a full guild for the purposes of cornering an item market or farmable zone.
---
That being said, like the others have suggested, take two crafting professions (preferably one of them Skinning), vendor everything, only buy essential skills from the skill trainers, and theoretically those three things will be enough to get enough money by 40, especially since you're saving on food costs as a Mage.
---
I'd be disappointed if they did that. I want to be available when the servers come online so I can snag the character names I want before someone else does.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but this trinket functionality extended into at least season 1 of TBC arena, and none of them worked against cyclone which was an end of vanilla expansion druid talent.  So there were druids in arena matches popping out of stealth to cast cyclone and the target would eat the full duration, and I don't think diminishing returns were a thing yet.  Good times.
---
It's also hilarious that (frost) mages were a hard counter to warriors, and the warrior trinket didn't remove polymorph.
---
&gt; Basically these are two different games.
---
Very true, the modern version of WoW is so different it feels more like a spin-off made by another company.
---
If you think they didnt extrapolate information from the players, you are funny. I never said it was specifically a "beta" just that it was a test. People gave feedback, they used said feedback to make the game better, they very likely extrapolated information for the same purpose, it was a test.
---
Not for tanking. Trolls have the better racial for tanking and can generate more Threat than a Orc.
---
No. Release is Friday June 21st. 6 weeks after the Beta that will drip this week.
---
It's vanilla ported into a 7.3.5 client\*. You realize that when WoW launched, the dev team didn't even test the majority of the dungeon content and it blew up into a massively successful game? The data they migrated was the map data. They manually entered in the mob spawn points. Then they imported the old database into the new format. The fact they showed that they literally copy/pasted the hunter pet skills successfully (Blizzcon panel details this) tells me you're underestimating the compatibility between the two clients. Also, they've expressed they want to avoid people flooding the starting zones as they would have to shard them. They seem keen on delivering the most authentic experience with as minimal sharding possible. I love how people keep saying that bugs are going to arise. What bugs do you see popping up?  I see mob data potentially being copied wrong or certain mob autocast abilities not working. Never forget that the tools they have today are in response to the challenges they faced in vanilla. 15 years of server side development makes me pretty confident they can pull this surprise off.
---
&gt;And yeah those competetive games have infinite replay value, but i doubt there's plenty of people who play only one and for that long. Unless they aim for esport or just really like it, in which case it's a 10/10 game for them i guess.

Eh, you'd be surprised. You may be forgetting the custom games in SCBW, WC3, and SC2, as well as co-op games in SC2. There's plenty of us who've only played one or another for 5+ years (it used to be WC3 for me, but since 2012 or so it's been SC2).
---
Why do you think so many people are interested in watching that?

DKP everything else.

The biggest factor in a loot system working or not comes down to your players. A performance oriented raid will see all loot apportioned correctly because all 40 players see it in their interest to do so. The more casual you get the more open to carteling the system is. Also keep a tight roster. No one cares if they dont get the first Onslaught girdle if they can be reasonably sure that warrior will be in the guild for the foreseeable future and no new ones pop up--everyone will get one. The trouble is in large 100 man rosters where a 65% attendence kiddo snakes your first BRE.
---
Do you often find people think they do but they don't?
---
more like, I did my research to get ahead of the curve and don't want to share my idea ultimately making my research useless?
---
Thank you for that explanation. Warcraft is a game and the whole idea is to have fun. This image is more of the same. Anyone reading too far into it and getting angry just isn't having fun anymore.
---
I put the Techno Goth kids under the bridge though!
---
The Smirnoff needs to gtfo.
---
Why do people do this?
---
That started at level 58
---
They've built that option into the site apparently.  "You can pay me to take the site down​ and give you a copy  of the information so that you have an advantage during the launch of  Classic."  Kinda irrelevant now that it's actually out there though...
---
From the Patreon page: 
---
###### Ransom
---
$1,000 or more per month
---
Pay  me to take down the website.  I will do my best to make the information  available to you, anyone else who pays this amount, 5 mages in my  guild, and no one else.  May discuss bringing the site back up after  Classic's launch week.
---
Dude, if you think those 30k active players combined on all pservers at the moment is a "majority" you are delusional compare to 14mil active player base that vanilla had.
---
Yeah. C'mon, at least throw some Nazis and Stalin into the Alliance side.
---
I actually have no idea who he even is, but I get tired of people assuming the worst of others because internet outrage is what gets them off.
---
Most of the time the simplest explanation is correct. Calling people shills and providing no evidence when shit is easily explained by a change of heart is a shitty thing to do.

speak loudly into my good ear
---
One can always hope haha..
---
I do think it's definitely a possibility that they would suddenly just surprise release it, especially since it will come free to everyone with a regular WoW subscription and it's not something they really need to hype up all that much. But why do you think it's specifially tomorrow?
---
Legion was very good. Agreed that it wasn’t old WoW but it was one of my favorite expacs. BfA had great leveling zones and that’s about it.

Wait how is the OP wrong because Blizzard sold invites to "tests" anyway? I dont think OP said anything about paid invites.
---
When I learned to AoE farm (which was under WotLK rules) I found that Cone of Cold was a bit fiddly and I could screw it up, whereas Blizzard was close to 100% reliable.
---
So I suspect (could be wrong) that 2/3 IB is a build with a higher skill ceiling but more frequent failure while learning because you missed something with CoC, while 3/3 IB and not relying on CoC has lower top end potential but is harder to screw up.
---
* Should I go daggers rogue if I want a more flavorful selection of buttons to press?  
---
* If I go daggers, does that mean there's much less of a reason to go Human?  
---
* Is there room to get creative with talent builds or are the optimal splits for each spec already agreed on by everyone?  
---
* Is there a "good enough" rogue spec that can be used for both PvP and PvE, or will you always be behind if you try to do both at the same time?
---
IDK man, I am so deep into so many conversations I have no idea what OP said anymore or exactly what I responded with. I may have been completely wrong and off-base, IDK man, lol

INFP - Alliance - Warlock - DPS - PVE
---
Is it possible for me to play feral tank while being kinda softcore? I understand i will offtank and heal/dps sometimes. But will i be able to tank without days of grinding and farming? (that will probably be 1/2 of my gametime so no thanks)
---
Just regular farming while also socialising and maybe sometimes lvling an alt.
---
EPL. At the lumber mill in the east
---
srsly.  Smirnoff is for snow bunnies who think it's low cal xD
---
Watching people that you are not in the same room with play video games is one of the most bizarre phenomena of my life. Just my opinion.
---
I used to destroy 1k needles on my mage when I hit 60. Got a LOT of rage.
---
Ah yes, and ontop of that, let's not forget that pvp trinkets in Classic have a 5 min cooldown as well.
---
Why not play the game and watch someone play it at the same time?
---
This isn't even remotely true.  I had an NDA with Dota 2 when I got into the closed beta.  I have an NDA for Amazon's MMO despite having no affiliation with Amazon whatsoever.  Many games who do randomly invited betas put them under NDA.  
---
And Kyralea is correct, breaking an NDA as a randomly invited person is a non-issue.  Employees and business partners can be hammered by breaking them, but they can't do much to a random person other than revoke their access.
---
I'd be pissed because I've been saving time off for launch.
---
This will be my last post because I'm trying to watch a movie:
---
Let's assume for a moment that 99% of bugs were fixed in internal testing, and the remaining 1% is small enough that they don't mind doing hotfixes in Live. Let's just assume that.
---
You're still dealing with a Triple AAA company, on the verge of releasing a hotly debated game to the public, and suggesting that that company will do so in secret, with (once again) absolutely zero ad presence anywhere, to a playerbase that cannot afford to play it because none of them had time to request off from work and the release is dropping in the middle of the week. It would be an unmitigated PR disaster even *if* there were no technical issues. Ads sell games, and games need players. Releasing Classic tomorrow would mean fewer sales and fewer players. It's just a bad business decision, regardless of whether it's possible.
---
But hey, if somehow Blizzard is stupid enough to do it, then I guess I'll parboil my shoes in a pot and chow down on them.
---
I have my OBS setup, you got it boss. ezclap.
---
Am I the only one that can't find the Druid tank deep dive? I only see the Warrior one with Tips.
---
I claimed no such thing and you can comb my entire VOD if you'd like.
---
Didn't they mark Classic as a Q3 thing?
---
Honestly the best race/sex combination.
---
You are getting downvoted but I think you are right(ish). When I was levelling my paladin in TBC using AoE tactics there were only one or two spots I ever found where I could AoE big packs nearly constantly, like the pirate camps in Tanaris. Everywhere else I killed everything and then had to either sit on my butt for minutes waiting for respawn or go make smaller pulls somewhere else.
---
Spots like the dog/vulture spawns around the bone piles were good value, but you cleaned them all up and moved on, you didn't stick around waiting for them to come back.
---
[They very recently confirmed release to be second half of the year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bk0u4h/classic_wow_reconfirmed_summer_release/)
---
Vanilla topped out at like 8 to 8.5 mill.  You're thinking of Wrath.
---
Um, that’s the golden age of Halo and CoD, GoW, people were playing those games nonstop
---
I can poke a big ol fkn hole in your little argument by saying one thing: Apex Legends
---
I dont think advising against not having a class trainer anywhere near your zone pre-level 10 is min/maxing. Take your unfounded shade somewhere else, too brite over here buddy
---
Oh yeah, i remember them, they play on ndale too but i havent really heard too Much of them lately, kinda forgot about them, i know TL is also NA
---
And you know she's conspiring with Blizzard to get you grounded until Phase 2 for your own good.
---
This is the single worst argument I have seen in a while. The prevalence and overall efficiency of using proper keybinds and strafing has improved massively since 2004-2006. Also, people of all ages will be playing this game, so this reduced reflex argument isn't all that valid. I played in retail vanilla and I'm 23. A lot of vanilla vets are still in their 20s. As can be seen on private servers, pvp will on average be faster pace than what was seen in vanilla. In vanilla, vurtne was a god, but compared to today's standards he would be good but nothing special.
---
Hordes into cheap flavored vodka? Lul girl drink
---
I'm not sure if you're serious or not, but I'll bite. You write as though Esfand isn't aware that ret is bad lol. Trying to play uncompetative specs as good as possible is a lot more interesting than playing your standard cookie cutter build, and I assume that's why he does it. What even is the problem?
---
RemindMe! June 21st, 2019
---
Clickbait titles mostly.
---
&gt; From what I’ve heard, during a classic cast tipsout gets up to go take a shit mid podcast and Josh pointed out that they should edit out his screen for that and they sent him emails that were rather nasty from what I’ve heard. “Don’t you ever criticize us, don’t you tell us how to podcast, where bigger than you”
---
&gt;he has had several planned calls to Esfand for an in-depth look at ret paladins and esfand never showed up and rescheduling quite a few times I’m not sure on the actual amount.
---
&gt;Staysafe was asked to come on and talk about warlocks and he refused; stating that he doesn’t do well in interview environments and then posts a 40 minute interview on his YouTube channel 2 days later;
---
Not saying I don't believe you, I'd just like to be able to make my own decisions about what happened.
---
no were just all fiending... lol seen drama on WoW in 2006. where there's people, theres disputes. ying and yang bitch. angry whispers,ninja looters,guild disputes and splits,arguments in chat....always happened.
---
I didnt read the guide because after playing a mage so many tines i didnt bother reading it, and you’re wrong, brd farming was a thing, it only got changed on pservers because of how it broke the economy, will be possible in classic unless blizz changes it aswell.
---
Thanks for the counterexample. Here's my retort:
---
Blizzard is a known quantity, and they've already announced the game. Not announcing a release date and then secretly releasing it doesn't build hype. It destroys hype.
---
But as I said to OP, I'll cook my shoes up and eat them if Blizzard, for the first time in its history, releases a game or game expac without any forward marketing.
---
You are not prepared to be disapointed
---
Perhaps it's a friggin release date. Upvote me when it happens, not before
---
I think you’re right.
---
Stop with the office memes pls for the love of god
---
We know it's just cum
---
Fireblast doesn’t leave a dot, you drunk kid? You need to be spec’d fire and get a crit. No real mage would waste a rank 1 fireblast cooldown when they can use max rank and do 10%+ hp dmg
---
You could argue that if your content is worth to be seen, you would want as many people you can to see it - and that means you have to play the algorithms. In that framing; not trying to get more viewers would mean, that you don't think your content is good enough to share with a wider audience. It's not easy to stumble into a random video with let's say 200 views. And if it's not good enough for more than 200 viewers, why blame those videos that tens of thousands of people watch and like? Because there are ads that support the creator of the video that put time into making it? If you make good content, you would want people to be able to find it.
---
I was under the impression that cyclone was the Druid level 70 spell; with Force of Nature, Mangle, and Tree of Life being the 41 point talents that came in the TBC pre-patch. I may be wrong on that one though.
---
me as well please!
---
Ok, sorry, big difference compared to 30k
---
My initial hunch came from a developer interview from around 2018 blizzcon where it was said "If we do a beta at all, it will be only a week or two." This makes me suspect that the recent Beta Client file trim was the last build before a release build was made. Also the streamer hype and streamer summit mean we're much closer to release than expected. Without a date at this point means we're most likely in for a surprise launch.
---
I suspect those people would have an alt anyway, since once MC/Ony is on farm a lot of people will be raid logging their mains because there is nothing else to do. I don't think it's because they ran the numbers and found that it was an effective gold-making strategy.
---
I mean, imagine that a warrior can make 20gp/hr and a hunter/warlock/mage 40gp an hour. If you spend 150 hours levelling your alt then you spend 150 hours of grinding just to catch up and break even. Only after 300 hours work do you actually end up with more money than you would have had if you had spent the same time farming on your main, and what are you going to spend &gt;6000gp on anyway once you are in BWL? You're way past buying BiS items from the AH or levelling professions at that point.
---
... il take it
---
Windfury Totem. Perhaps you've heard of it?
---
Meh you will get over it pretty quick when you realize you can see your frames lagging when you move your mouse.
---
Tin foil hat!
---
u/provosorisk was contacted by blizzard to make this!!!
---
Confirmed (speculatively).
---
You said you wanted money, you’ll make more money of dmn then farming wool and cooking mats. If i were you i would level to 60 then start aoe farming for money and just buy the wool and cooking mats off the ah
---
DR was in Vanilla. Why Cyclone was spammable on any 1 target was more than likely due to the 15 (or was it 20) second DR rule.
---
Diminishing returns were a thing for most of Vanilla. They just weren't as pronounced as they became in later expacs.
---
Horde is my OG....undead is bae.....Undercity is a circle......Undead, rogue, boop
---
Non-idiots can realise that they are a lot more attractive as a recruit if they smash DPS. If your guild breaks up, as guilds do, you have to look after yourself. Lots more guilds will want a geared-up DPS warrior who can smash than will want another hunter, I imagine.
---
Daddy likes the sound of this.
---
True, but levelling from 58-80 took way longer for the other classes (at least, at launch when DKs were busted)
---
Apex legends release contradicts most of your arguments. Disclaimer: I doubt it’s released tomorrow as well, but just cause it would be un blizzlike. I think it’d be a great marketing play though.
---
I'm 43 - I really enjoy the different streamers (Tips, Esfand, Stay safe, Frostadamus) and pod casts (Countdown to classic) and discords. Maybe because I'm old I'm not as easily triggered like some of the younger folks are.
---
OMG i cant wait to have half my inventory all Noggenfogger again. lol
---
According to Towel, it was streamers like him that even made WoW Classic possible.
---
https://twitter.com/towelthetank/status/1126854544397348864?s=21
---
LMAO... this is terrible revisionist history.  What a clown show,
---
Hey if horde gets the Macho Man then Alliance gets Ric Flair
---
Druid easily has the best trinket, since they can shift forms for everything the trinket doesn't work on.
---
Unlikely but my mind wouldn't be blown, tbh.
---
I never got past 50 when I played. I still explored most of the world, leveled my professions, and spent a lot of time just BSing with my guild mates.
---
The company I work for hopes that isn't true :). No real policy on PTO, it's auto approved and no notice needed. So me dropping a 2 week PTO notice the day of when we're 2 weeks from code freeze for our next release and I'm our primary code reviewer... not ideal. 
---
I'd probably PTO the rest of the week and work a couple days next week. Maybe even try multitasking a bit, dual screen RDP to the work box while gaming. Not efficient, but doable for some long walks to quest locations or whatnot.
---
OP said level 40. Skinning is bad until thick leather.
---
You might be intrested in my guild. Dmed ya
---
 &lt;Thats Rough Buddy&gt;

Semi-Hardcore | PVE on PVP Server | Eastern US Timezone | Alliance   
---
Hi, we're an easy going, fun loving guild, who plan to explore every nook and cranny of Classic and be in the first 5 guilds to clear naxx.   
---
We currently have 40 players committed, and are on pace for 175 players by late June.  We acknowledge that the first to every benchmark will be dedicated try hards. We're going to be the big party having a good time in 2nd.  Our goal is to maximize fun, and while winning is definitely a lot of fun, it's even more fun to win as a team without some annoying officer whining about that time you got hit by a raid boss's ability, or missed your interrupt, w/e.   
---
We're going to support each other while leveling, we're going to pool our resources so everyone can have their mount at 40, if you're roleing warrior or another class hard to level, we're going to pair you with someone who can make leveling more efficient (pet classes and druid do well on their own). 
---
 When it's time for raid content, we're going to make you watch youtube videos on all the engagements and write a test to prove you know your stuff, and we'll make sure your gear/consumables means we have a chance at clearing.
---
  Once that's out of the way, it's all good. No pressure, lots of laughs, wipe often and have an amazing time.   We believe a positive enjoyable raiding experience will keep players coming back, and keep the guild strong all the way through to endgame.
---
   So all are welcome, we don't have dedicated PVPers right now, but if you'd like to join and create a subdivision for PvP you are more than welcome to do so.  
---
Pm me if you are interested! Thanks for your time :D
---
You are probably right, I just remember getting wrecked by druid/warrior in arena season 1.
---
You might actually want to play a vanilla private server before this comes out so you wont be out of practice
---
Not everything is about DPS, mate.
---
There's literally a video of him reacting to "can casual players enjoy classic wow" that explains it....
---
I was going to but I didn't want to push the Alliance too far over the edge. After all, they know where I live.
---
Orgrimmar.
---
Female undead warrior has the better flip
---
I'm sceptical to this theory too, i just don't think it's a dumb suggestion at all. Consider that Blizzard never released something like this before - and it's going to come free to everyone with a WoW sub right? 
---
So it's a bit different and we can't really assume they will handle it like they usually do new releases. It may be unlikely that it comes as a surprise release, but it's not at all impossible and it's imo fkn weird that you respond like it's the most absurd suggestion you've ever heard xD Like you actually have any idea lol, none of us do, all we can do is speculate.
---
To be fair, I failed to acknowledge the dwarves and their brewing abilities. I welcome all dwarves to Orgrimmar.
---
Bring stout!
---
At release date is literally the least they could give.
---
I don’t care what it’s for, classic, WC3 reforged, a new game anything.
---
Just let us know so we can take time off work haha.
---
There is so much bullshit in this post you should have spread it around to two.
---
Oh come on, you were never a teenager? :D
---
I hate being the guy that bursts bubbles.
---
The reality is people don’t like odd meme specs turning up, doing half the damage (if that) then trying to stand in line with loot council or hoarding dkp for items.
---
Unnecessary skills*
---
What side picks shitty mid-2000's emo? Cause that's my side.
---
Will probably play that actually, don't want to be horde but have little choice. Shame the running animation is absolutely awful.
---
You could call many expansions a violation of features you like.
---
Cata is truly when classes turn into specs: for example, defensive dispel is no longer available on any non-healer specs. You used to be able to dispel harmful magic effects on teammates as a Prot or Ret pally, not anymore.
---
i dont get how bored you are, or nothing going on in your life to waste time making this
---
Taruen /silly &gt; all.
---
Tanaris, arathi highlands, plaguelands, grind spots anywhere, outside end game instances. Flightpaths lol
---
My only questions are, who the fuck are you and why does anyone care what you'll be streaming?
---
I'm mainly an alliance player, but just looking at the picture, I think alliance look the most like the place I want to be of the two.
---
Don't forget about Macho Man. OH YEAH BROTHER!

That was true in 2005. In 2019? Please.

I work 2nd shift so that's my time frame as well!
---
Maybe next to the carebears picture you could just put a picture of snowflakes.
---
I’m with you dude. For Classic and WC3 the game is literally already made, I understand there’s technical things and details to work out but at least give a date it’s been a year and a half already.
---
Just having an alt to send your profession items to is worth it.
---
One Office EU fan disliked this video.
---
You're right lmao. These people here are still living in 2004 they have no idea about the impact of streamers. If it wasnt for you and other streamers we would not have Classic WoW coming. [Trigger warning] I never played vanilla or private servers(because they suck) and up until last year i never thought I would ever experience Vanilla, but thanks to streamers I will! 
---
Don't get affected by what these neckbeards say, they're mad because classic is not ''their baby'' anymore.
---
Of course!
---
Only raided much as Alliance!
---
Thanks for the information!
---
\&gt;or stock it for brotherhood
---
What does this mean?
---
It's been shown that if kept up, your reflexes don't decrease anywhere near what people think. Your 80% speed is simply because you're out of practice.
---
I'm 31 and my arena shooter reflexes are just as quick as when I was 17. 
---
Also, WoW doesn't really require fast reflexes in any meaningful capacity.
---
Thats a lie. Leveling blacksmithing as a warrior during leveling was the greatest waste of time ive done. Even if you keep mining and therefore blacksmithing up to your hero level, and even a bit above. The gear it allows you to craft is always obsolete.
---
 With about LVL24 you can craft your first blue breastplate, and its okey, but it also get obsolete really fast, and its not really worth the resources it costs to make. Id say BS is useful in the endgame if you get good recipes, but it does dogshit for you during leveling. 
---
 I can advise Alchemy to any warrior out there. Ten times more useful.
---
A lot more. You should probably avoid it
---
I prefer tea over that any day of the week. If only my friends wouldn't play horde.
---
The only professions I bother with while leveling are gathering so I will never know this feeling.
---
It probably does FEEL better to clean the cerumen from your tympanic membrane. The holes on the side of your head are called tympanic membranes.
---
Thank you for reiterating my point.
---
All the more reason my warrior needs Skull of Impending Doom against Mages.
---
Examples of what items will shift in value?
---
The main thing people forget is that they buy all their skills at level 30+.  Stop training in skills, sell everything, and pick a gathering prof like skinning, and you should be all set.
---
If you try to buy stuff and wait for the value to go up, you'll hit 40 way before that even happens.  Lower level mats get expensive only when players have tons of gold and no one is gathering it anymore.  That won't happen for a long time since everyone starts fresh on new servers.
---
They are bad at pvp my dude. Rogue food
---
Dont do this to me. Dont even put that thought in my head. Because it wont happen.
---
Holy shit you are salty
---
Some solid points here. Your experience reflects my own
---
Oh god I totally forgot trinkets varied on what you could get out of by class
---
Drip drip drip. Will be media types first followed by drip drip drip here an invite there an invite.... followed by somebody ringing a dinner bell on open beta.
---
In my response? Like what?
---
...You're correct, I thought this must be a joke. But I checked, you're right &amp; this post is a good way of conveying this system
---
Honestly if they don't release it mid-may I'd expect late july/early august.
---
Basically I don't think they want it too close to 8.2 or 8.2.5 for the sake of both live and classic.
---
You're a moron
---
I wish proper controller support were implemented in classic, solely for reduced RSI. A mouse will eventually inflame my wrist, a controller will eventually wear out my thumb. I have to take a few weeks off for either of these to heal. Being able to alternate between the two means I can game more frequently, and is exactly why I have a pc desk setup and a ps4 couch setup.
---
Sore wrist? Console it is for a few weeks. 
---
Gamer thumb? Back to pc.
---
Repeat.
---
lame and cringepilled
---
Lol why do you portray it like a fact when you heard it from a friend and don't even watch streams yourself.. Be critical and make sure you have facts before you state something; if you're not sure then keep it to yourself plx.
---
I know it's not a big deal in this case but it just annoys me because rumors turn into such shitstorms sometimes.
---
Druids have by far the best trinket since their class abilities counter all other CCs.
---
Blizzard should not announce server names so we can have balanced populations.
---
Shadow Blade is a prime example, but any BoE at a twink bracket could be worth some value. Many BoEs will be sold at below market value to offload them. If you can get a cheap Freezing Band too from some newbie who doesn't know what it's actually worth, bully for you. By cheap, I mean under 200g? They can go for over 1000.
---
High-end reagents will be in hot demand. Black Lotus and Devilsaur Leather like I said, but you can also potentially get other alch and mining materials for cheap from people selling in bulk to try to get to their epic mounts.
---
Just... be straight with me. Do I need to call off tomorrow or am I okay just watching from the mobile app at work?
---
No SIR I'M BUILDING AN ARMY! They just don't know it yet.
---
No way. When did he say it? O_o
---
My first character was a Human Paladin (because Diablo 2) but my only 60 was my Orc Hunter.
---
Only shit locks get eaten by rogues. They aim for the priests and mages.
---
Mate, it's vanilla.. you can play with your toes and still be average at the game.
---
SLC PUNK. 😩👌
---
Tanaris of course!
---
Heard from a friend close to Blizzard that the beta is supposedly an open beta.
---
The problem is that you will rarely be able to craft actually useful gear. 
---
Crafting leveling gear is more useful for leveling alts.
---
Anyone remember the wow beta on fileplanet?
---
It's still good.. well.. decent at least..
---
Lol ok Mr/Mrs 'gold reward' 20 mins after my post. I see what you did there. Thanks for my first. Even after grazing the notification I still don't know the significance of it. I'll have to go read it again
---
You freakin goof ball
---
If the Rogue has cooldowns and / or the Warlock is total trash, sure.
---
How will I be able to join Classic servers? I never played WoW ad thought Classic might be interesting. Is it a separate purchase or is it a bonus of retail? How Buy?

haha np dawg
---
Druids would just trinket it and they can go to bear form to charge at them or cat form to catch up with them(Cat form has higher speed than normal humanoid speed), they also have sprint ability on cat form. They also have entangling roots if they are outside. Rogues can not get away from a druid.
---
Also when they run their booty dislodges into separate planes of existence.
---
Depends on your group and class. Also you can do parts of it easily. Like Strath UD really picks up in difficulty in the Scarlet Bastion and after the Ziggurats in UD. You can do a bunch of quests in the starting areas at level 55 or so. Maybe a tad higher as a tank unless you have good gear.
---
No ads that's amazing thank you
---
Imagine watching people play sports on TV when you can play them yourself.
---
To be fair, the devoted of us have been riding the hype train for this game since 2004-2007.
---
Horde are simply misunderstood
---
Not for mages. And Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, or any other melee will have a quest green by level 14 at the latest and their first dungeon blue will be better than any vendor green. The 75s for a level 16 green just isn't worth it. You buy your last weapon in the starter zone generally.
---
It's free money before 40. Every time you kill a beast you get 5s more than other people.
---
Hello, Name: **Exiled** Semi-Hardcore
---
Region/Raid Time: NA - Eastern Standard Time with 2-3 raid days for progression and gear 6:30 - 9PM + EST Server Type: PVP
---
Faction:  Horde 
---
Priorities: Raid First, PvP second but we like the construct of the ability for open PvP.
---
Discord: We do have our own discord, PM if you are interested
---
Rules/About Us: Currently, we are a mature group of men and women. It's a discord where there is freedom of discussion of whatever topics and many of us have known each other for literally 15+ years. Some in this discord are family members and good friends. We have roughly 40 people who will be playing Classic WoW here with the launch expected 4-6 Months(Summer of 2019)
---
The roles of what ever class and profession are open but it looks like we may be hurting for Druids, healers and hunters. In our discord we breakdown everyone's committed profession, race and class. Whisper if you are interested and I will get you the discord information or ask addition questions. Thank you!
---
who cares? you literally will never wipe--ever--for using a shield over an offhand frill.
---
*Countdown* getting in on the memes?
---
What have we created.
---
If you max leveling then no. If you just want to level normally to 60 then absolutely yes. Not only does it give you some good items, engineering/alchemy in particular, but it's also a fun break between the leveling grind.
---
82 feet? goddamn that's big. This is only 150"
---
When you Suicide on an item you are spending all your points on it. You go to zero and everyone else in the raid gets a portion of your points. You're basically paying the raid for the drop.
---
Repeatedly after the shit show that was the demo. He's toying with the "idea" that if he can play beta on a pvp server he'll "consider it" but we all know how that's going to turn out.
---
Implying that cata was good? Imaagine having cata as your first expansion, i played on p servers all of cara until mop.
---
fuckin CREED
---
Now I have to roll horde.
---
Warr is most sought after class for pve cuz of prot. They are also very strong dps and great in group pvp.
---
Many say classic was the era of the warrior, so no, that's not true.
---
Every class back then was playable and fun
---
If anything I'd say read a class quest guide at least and maybe become familiar with the big quest chains, only where they start though, don't spoil it all, but don't miss them either. 
---
Otherwise just ask around if you're stuck without any quests.
---
Did that in the BG to get free honor.
---
I didn’t see anyone else posting this so I leave this here. Wowhead is doing an amazing job with their wow classic site and needs guide writers. Check it out if interested
---
I am not a wowhead employee, just a fan.
---
Also check out their thottbot style!
---
There's gonna be a lot of every class man. Just pick what you want to pick! By the time 60 rolls around a lot of the player base will have thinned, or the altoholics will be onto character #2+
---
Most excited for BGs also but still STOKED
---
Can't wait to level through opening zones with my buddies.
---
Will probably make 2-3 toons before deciding , since I have no idea what I wanna do or what professions yet 
---
I have a feeling I'll just know when I open the game up, but that's kind of naive lmao
---
I appreciate the effort and you came close to a lot here but anyone who played Warcraft 3 knows...
---
Ya gotta grab your swords and fight the horde!!!
---
A beautiful monster.
---
Uh oh he can dish out the podcasts and make memes? Australians are taking over the internet! 😋
---
You vendor that sheeet
---
Desolace was the best one imo
---
Not implying cata was good at all. The drop off after bc was noticeable. The drop off after wrath was severe. Cata at least wasnt dog shit minus the last raid tier tho. Mop was dog shit. Wod was dog shit. Legion was less dog shit than wod and bfa is dog shit but still better than wod
---
Disagree =/= salty
---
He's referring to the original comment he made
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing the live/classic angle. The PTR for 8.2 looks to be a few weeks out from release, so right now is a great time for a release window. Boost Quarter 2 MAUs to boost investor confidence.
---
So it begins
---
How do you do, fellow kids? ;)
---
Wheels of the Leering Cripple.
---
Talking about fresh 60
---
My Pservers guild cleared Mc with 30 people all the time but we sure as fuck didn’t bring moonkins.
---
Just give me the finale... and let me die.
---
Is this the new meta?
---
STV I expected, Barrens was hilarious though
---
We got all the way through Hellfire Ramparts with a 5-man DK party.
---
Female NE idle animation &gt; everything else
---
I c I c. Thanks. That's kinda surprising but understandable I guess
---
Having never played the original games, this certainly explains why Alliance are so popular. The game came out while I was in high school. And with the friends I had, the choice was obvious. :)
---
Exactly!
---
Plus the past 2 patches for BFA had been basically 90 days apart, so 8.2 dropping mid June is extremely likely.
---
If not now, the best time would be between 8.2 and 8.2.5 (the latter in mid september for the 90 day timeline). So late July/Early August for Classic.
---
Otherwise we're waiting until like October and no one wants that.
---
If they do drop Classic sooner I'd like enough warning to be ready to save my names lol
---
How do you skip the last dude??!!  Which zone gets the cold shoulder?!  Is it Silithus?  I bet it's Silithus.
---
Edit: Oh wait, no, it's clearly the Blasted Lands
---
You do realise that achievements on launch (back in 2008) where auto activated account wide if you logged on even 1 toon, the only reason you were to get an achievement from 2011 was back in 2009 they had battle net merger.
---
So either, you had an account that you achieved it on and then started another account then later merged it with your main account and logged onto the toon in 2011 (which is the date of the achievement) which is questionable because you had random scarab lords popping up at the same time along with other high ranked pvp titles
---
Or you bought an account and merged it (likely)
---
This guy speaks the truth.
---
Hah, man you mean I'm not supposed to take the South Park Goth Kids, Shooter McGavin, OR Macho Man Randy Savage seriously!?!? I'm shocked! Shocked I say!! 
---
Great meme, I really enjoyed.
---
There is no such thing as war crimes in inter-species conflict. Further, there is no body supra to the...kingdom...in Warcraft that could enforce such laws or regulations put on warfare.
---
The real world has the international court, the UN, and the US and her allies to impose their will supra to the State (however one may feel about the Status Quo and those who maintain it regardless), and even still war crimes are rarely enforced or punished.
---
In the context of a hostile species invading my planet, there is no quarter. 
---
In that way, I totally understand the Alliance position--"Fuck 'em, it was--and still is--our planet first".
---
The Horde were enslaved and groomed for war on their dying planet. They are totally justified in their war on Azeroth to stake out a place to live so they dont become extinct. 
---
Both sides are justified, the larger machinations are immaterial. The Horde doesnt have a home, and have "taken" some of the alliances home. 
---
In real life, I don't give a shit that you're homeless--you're not sleeping in my garage. By the same token, if Im a homeless guy, its totally reasonable (yet still illegal and against our ethos of property rights) to find shelter, even if it isnt your own--youll die otherwise.
---
I know!! I really wanted that one, but the template I was using cut it out?
---
Classic is included with any WoW subscription so, you'll just need to pay 15 dollars a month for a normal WoW subscription.
---
LBRS
---
Rogue trinket is so bad lol
---
I have no life and want to join a guild like this lol
---
THE PROPHECY HAS BEEN FULFILLED! Long after the demise of the Prophet. RIP Gamespy.
---
That's not true, Warrior is super fun. Tanking is the most complex rotation of any class/role in all of classic. And Warrior PvP is fucking awesome. You can only beat half of classes 1v1, but AoE Fear, AoE slow, and being incredibly hard to kill makes it a blast. Add a pocket healer, and you're golden.
---
I'd honestly be fine with no beta.....keep some surprise!
---
Chances are the NDA ends tomorrow and we will get flooded with video's from testers and a release date.
---
"Few hours" is definitely not more than 10 hours.
---
deviate scale belt :D
---
Ok bro I bought an account, I literally have videos on YouTube of that same warrior fucking around in AV and Stormwind keep lol. What do you want my transaction history from email to email? And why hell would I buy an account with only General lol? Cause yeah back in 2011 that looked cool.
---
Somewhat true yes, but it has nothing to do with casual players. What is there to do in vanilla besides leveling for casuals? There are a couple of dungeons that you probably won't be invited to unless you are in a guild of at least somewhat reputation. In PvP you'll be stomped by premades, raids require a ton of gear, preparation and time. In BFA you can just login and do your content whenever you want to. 
---
So in that respect BFA absolutely is a more casual friendly game and I think Blizzard has been trying to cater to the casuals throughout the years. Let's not forget that vanilla was seen as extremely casual compared to its competition at the time.
---
I fucking love you
---
The woman being denied the hug should be Oceanic Servers, ey Josh? :)
---
Naxx was Wrath!
---
Ty.
---
I came in just before BC and was a casual.
---
I understand you are a PvE guild. Do you plan to play on a PvP or PvE server? If the latter, I am interested.
---
Cheers.
---
&gt; Ten years wreak havoc on your hands and reflexes.
---
XD
---
Haha brutal! But time will tell. Here’s hoping it’s all good on that front :)
---
Dude I had this hideous theme aswell!
---
Just a heads up, the USA requires literally 0 paid sick or vacation time. The only unpaid you are gauranteed is through FMLA. It is not against the law for a company to offer zero paid days off.
---
Winter spring.   Mount rep prep.
---
I'm the weird guy that gets excited about going to Desolace and Tanaris. Those are two of my favorite all time zones that they killed in Cata.
---
Do you live in CONNecticut
---
Hi, I was in this video as Exlater the mage. I remember this video. Great times. Fun fact i was afk in IF when they got me. 
---
See you old SH alliance in classic! (NA)
---
Duskwallow Marsh was my jam
---
Your post is coming off overly aggressive and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since tone is hard to convey over the internet. I'm just trying to have a civil discussion. I'm not trying to argue, I'm just genuinely curious.
---
I don't care so much for an answer those questions though because I like going into something and not knowing all the details. I just figured all the important, big picture, stuff was already answered so I didn't really know there were still unanswered questions. 
---
&gt; We don't know if starting zones mean Northshire abby only, northshire abby + Elwynn or even Northshire abby + Elwynn + Westfall. We also don't know if you're going to see a handful of people in a shard or dozens. More questions the Beta might answer
---
I know they addressed this but I cannot find the post. IIRC it is to be designed so that it's still crowded and you'll see people frequently, just not *waiting anywhere from ten minutes to an hour for a respawn because you are fighting a hundred other people* crowded. I believe it was to be Northshire and Elwynn but not Westfall. Again though, it was my impression that the sharding was to be tweaked live so it may be last longer or cover more zones until the population spread out into the world. 
---
Regarding mods, that stuff can always change between beta and actual release so while a beta might give a good preview, that sort of stuff is always being changed and not really good for reliable information. 
---
Finally, regarding the stuff that is to be the same as vanilla, just because the client is no longer officially available does not mean that the information is entirely gone. Private servers may have tweaked things from the original vanilla release but they can still offer a good representation of the original game. Other stuff, like specific numbers and spawn locations can still be found online. I don't know the best site for that stuff, but [the archived version of thottbot](https://web.archive.org/web/20050916120541/http://www.thottbot.com/) might be a good place to start.
---
An ungeared Hunter can do DM:Trib, when you run out of gold, you just autoshot the King to death. But, solo gold farming on a warrior can get you about 30g/hour. It's mindnumbing though. Especially prot specced.
---
That's a big ole yikes from me dawg
---
AHK can do this
---
Well it's gonna take some time for the economy to stabilize so I imagine even early leathers will be more valuable than normal.
---
Keep eating them ions beautiful boy
---
We shouldn't be avoiding them. We should be gathering, grouping, and when ready, roll the opposing faction (pvp server) and fight them tooth and nail on launch.
---
Hell yeah. Get me in ln that pay-to-cool shit.
---
One small tip that adds up, if you don't need anything from a "choose your quest reward", then pick the one that vendors the highest.
---
Nobody goes holy anymore. You go for Power Infuse and you make all your money from selling it to the warlocks and mages in your raids. 
---
Holy Nova is also a must have spell as you make most of your gold from grinding DM E. 
---
So go something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusVVqobxtcc).
---
That's why the Druid PVP trinkets probably the best one
---
Y-you realize that reddit is exactly that, right?
---
Part of the reason I want to level a Hunter alt for farming is so I can try to get a chance at Rok'delar. I really want to try that quest and their raid DPS rotation seems really fun.
---
I had a blast as a 60 prot warrior. I don’t mind doing repetitive things, and love being part of a team (along with doing what I need to fulfill my role in the team). So I had no qualms about running dungeons and raids, gathering materials, running fresh 60’s through 5- or 10-mans to get geared, etc.
---
Thanks, I love it!
---
Lol @ The Barrens being the sacred child.
---
Good meme buuuuuuuttt...
---
Un'Goro is amazing
---
...I like Ashenvale.
---
The reaction to Desolace destroyed me tho, it's probably the worst vanilla zone (besides maybe Azshara)
---
Ah yes. His right clicking might get rusty.
---
I don't care what they say. Keep them coming. I come here for you not them.
---
What the fuck LOL, no Guild needs that much time to clear raids unless they're terrible
---
So you're telling him not to play a class just because of what it's like when it just hits 60?
---
I KNEW Key was going to be STV.  I fucking knew it.
---
And the rank 14 weapons aren't even that great for healing. Really such a shame.
---
spriest wouldn't win in a 1v1 against a rogue cause the rogue would know better than to try to attack so there wouldn't be a fight in the first place
---
You can always check IRONFIST out.  We are a day 1 classic guild, a good chunk of us are on kid #2+.
---
We are planning to get into MC, BWL, AQ, Naxx but it is going to be in a casual friendly (hopefully) manner
---
We did this in vanilla, everyone who wanted a drop linked their current item for that slot, we'd factor in participation and tracked how long it was since each person got a item. It worked well until AQ where the gear was more pvp oriented. Should we give a mage a slight ilvl boost or a really good shaman an elemental pvp piece?
---
Surprise launch of one of the most anticipated releases in years. Yeah I don't think people would be mad for long honestly..
---
I got an invite to Heroes.  Which coincidentally is the only Blizzard game in 25 years I've had zero interest in and never spent a dime on.
---
Wtf are these icons
---
&gt; It's free money before 40.
---
It's SLOW free money before 40.
---
@ 3 seconds per skin, an hour spent skinning, and leveling skinning, will put you further behind just getting to 40 and killing shit and vendoring greys for an hour.
---
Sadly, unless the variables and coefficients are wildly different than private servers (and I actually expect a few will be) for the most part knowledge regarding specs and their limitations are established fact. Many have pointed out that super casual guilds will take anyone and that is true. What I find odd is while many, quite correctly, point out there will be significant attrition strangely they never think this will happen to these super casual raiding guilds. 
---
Raiding takes a significant time commitment whether while raiding or farming for consumables, repair costs, etc. Failing to progress is difficult for morale. Failing too long and people will leave. That was reality then and it will be reality once these servers open. For every highly skilled core member that is ok with little to no progression week after week there are many more who will either quit entirely, quit raiding, reroll elsewhere or join a better progressing guild. Once a guild starts to lose it's talented core, then dissolution almost always follows.
---
Play what you want. This is a game after all. Just keep in mind that not all specs are good at all activities. That was the blessing and the curse of Vanilla. If you want to join a solid guild capable of progressing and you want to play a meme spec, best to get in as a guild officer. Ultimately that will be your best bet if you want to raid in a less than optimal spec
---
what a fucking joke this guy is.
---
I'm sorry to hear that, stay strong out there bro.
---
Will you ask her what class I should play?  Doesn’t seem to be much info out there.................
---
Not mutually exclusive, tho.
---
Can I trade the cyberpunks under the overpass for the chicken fingers?
---
but enhancement isn't a viable spec!
---
Yo all! I am making a classic guild on the most popular Classic server when it comes out.
---
Add me on steam if you are interest, lets put Britain on the MAP ON CLASSIC!!! 
---
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979429221/
---
Some people have fun by going fast, you know.
---
Fun fact: None of the class trinkets break Hunter traps.
---
can I get an amen?!
---
People so hype no way in hell blizz drops with no notice. Shit honestly I would be kinda mad if they did.
---
classic beta tommorow i lick it clean i lick classic so hard man i lick it like a fishy cant
---
Super important to do this. Weapons usually sell more than armor, and plate sells for more than mail etc.  To get it perfect, download an addon like Informant that tells you the vendor value of items.
---
And who gets the epic mount or the gold making recipe?!  
---
The GM best friend or maybe the officer wife?!  
---
I understant top hardcore guilds maybe dont have this kind of problems, but for the majority of guilds, it wont work.
---
It is kinda annoying, but also bear in mind that it'll take a while to grind your way to 60 and get the gold for a mount. You can of course just survive on your 60% mount for however many months it takes for P2 to roll around, I certainly plan to. Invest that gold into gear and professions or stock up on trade goods that will increase in value in later phases. It's not such a huge deal to be without epic mount unless you're really into PvP, and BGs arrive way after P2 anyways.
---
Towelliee, the guy who literally banned legacy players AND THE WORD LEGACY from his twitch stream.
---
But now he sees $$$ so he's on the bandwagon.
---
He knows he's a D-list streamer, that's why he was begging them to split Classic from BfA.
---
a shill
---
It also says bad taste and street trash. You may have just wanted to be angry.
---
Would macho man play a warrior?
---
