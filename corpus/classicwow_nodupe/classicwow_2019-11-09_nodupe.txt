I have noticed that turning even the slightest will take you out of FD. So let go of all buttons and fd-&gt;trap. In PVE it seems completely broken as your pet seems to keep you in combat even if you set it to passive. Or was it ever supposed to work in PVE mid combat? I didn't play hunter in vanilla..
---
---
---
16% have over 100k gold it says. Like just what.
---
I agree. People throwing out 80/20 figures are talking out of their ass. Alliance seem to be really preparing for P2 lately, with many gank squads roaming the world.
---
Yeah its a wierd comment. Maybe he has a bunch of kids in there. "rU a ReEl GiRl????""
---

---
"Oh loot!!wait lets give it to schwifty, cuss shes girl n'prob pretty"
---
Also, just give us paid transfers.
---
Ok boomer
---
Wrong. Paid character transfers came about in the middle of 2006, before BC even launched: [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-realm-transfer-details-unveiled/1100-6153087/](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-realm-transfer-details-unveiled/1100-6153087/)

---
Free character migrations were also offered even before.
---
Maybe if Grizzly weren't such absolute assholes to the other Alliance then they wouldn't leave. I'm transferring off Stalagg Monday and it has more to do with Grizzly than the Horde.
---
Yeah why do people say this?
---
"Why would anybody want to play on a PvP server and never have to worry about being ganked/camped, enjoy a PvE experience when they want it and rarely have PvP encounters where they have a major advantage?"
---
Yeah I wonder..
---
Lol yeah.
---
I have played both and the underdog regardless of which side is just ruthlessly beat into submission.
---
Kungen of Nihilum has the same rule.
---
Definitely not the most competitive for raid loot, I would say mages have it alot worse probably dps warriors aswell
---
Oh now see you have a proper rival here you cant let that shit stand your gona have to hunt him down and keep this bitter rivalry going, you have possible just entered one of the greatest things to happen in classic now show him why not to fuck with you
---
That’s sad.
---
..? I mean, both sides are? 
---
Theres just 2 imbalanced and frankly fucked servers. Neither side did the right thing and individuals shouldnt be expected to, thats on blizzard.
---
It depends. You 5 healing MC? You'll overheals a lot and put a lot of burden on other healers.
---
10 healing with a sweaty group of world buffs and consumes? Healing meters don't mean anything anyway at that point.
---
Here's some generalizations for you:
---
- men are obnoxious
---
- men are melodramatic
---
- men air their prejudices too often
---
- men stalk girls and obsess over them to the point of causing drama within guilds, especially when the girls rebuff their attention
---
- every time some shitty level 50 is playing like a noob it's some asshole boy who wants to fight with me about my irrefutable knowledge rather than learn a thing from a girl
---
Those are just generalizations!!! But I wouldn't say them if I didn't feel that way.
---
LIG MA BALLS
---
Another way to tell the same story is to say that whenever a mage’s blink is on CD this is a great strategy. I think that’s hardly one scenario, it’s probably a good percentage of the time.
---
This was exactly what I had in mind when I posted my comment. One of my favorite movies of all time
---
No it’s not. TBC was a terrible game compared to classic.
---
Where is everyone saying that they did fine and that server transfers were a fine solution to the mess they made with their small server list announcement?
---
Of all the crazy shit posts we’ve seen on this subreddit about guilds breaking up/drama. None that I’ve seen involved a female. All involved all males.
---
I played when WoW was released as well but I haven't grown a vagina in the last 15 years
---
whoosh
---
I want tbc because I never experienced tbc endgame. They could always make classic+, add the things they wanted classic to have and *then* release tbc.
---
Classic is nothing but a cash grab. Expect the most threadbare support.
---
I am not a slight bit frustrated at other alliance players. I am fucking frustrated with Blizzard allowing 90/10 servers to happen. When things reach 70/30 i will fuck off to easier servers too. There comes a point where the imbalance just is not manageable anymore.
---
Don't forget about judgement. One spell rotation on an 8 sec cd
---
I played more than a decade ago and it was the same problem just reversed. Every server in EU was Alliance dominated by player numbers. Weird that it's the other way around now. My old guild mates started on a pve realm, so I am stuck there (as horde) and there seem to be way more alliance players. 
---
Maybe the mates were right in their decision (I'd pick pvp any day, and I'd chose the faction with a target rich environment every time). It's relaxed and I can't wait for the battleground patch.
---
Unfortunately theres plenty of people who either dont want to change anything whatsoever and there are some who think the old system was genuinely good.
---
Depends on your guilds situation. If you're a guild struggling to even fill 40 spots maybe you dont have much of an option?
---
[removed]
---
Eh anethema is alli filled and seems to be getting worse not better... low/medium population
---
It's hard to anticipate a 20/80 faction balance.
---
RIIIIIDEEE TILL I CAN'T NO MORE
---
If we assume that we can model some transfers as random, then making them one way gives a [Brownian ratchet.](https://https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_ratchet)
---
Maybe your dudes should cause less senseless drama over girls a thousand miles away, then? Lol wth.
---
Not how quotes work but good try buddy
---
"Just don't be dogshit and take em 5v1 like me lolololol git gud scrub"
---
Smh
---
Good on you. RIP your inbox tho, yikes.
---
If they do add wrath I won't be in favor of no changes anymore. Wrath without the lfd would be great, also they could tweak the raids to not be so piss easy.
---
58-60
---
A quick write while on my phone pooping at work. It’s more of the lore/raids/dungs/content they were hinting at or said they had cut from expansions and extending it into classic. Then if you wanted to go into tbc after that and further explore other cut content.
---
I wouldn't say people that play alliance signed up for it. They just wanted to play Alliance on servers that everyone was saying is the authentic vanilla experience. I'm sure that players (especially the casuals) didn't expect this kind of imbalance.
---
Lol, right. Having a few pieces of pve gear means nothing, your focusing on one aspect instead of the bigger picture but it's fine.
---
You only kill green mobs?
---
Onyxia has face
---
Horde want face
---
Face is place
---
&gt;regardless of which side
---
Right.
---
52-54 seems a bit low level to me. You can try it tho and see if you can do it. Runs are fast so you'll know pretty quick once you get to angerforge. Heads up that you need someone with the brd key to do those runs.
---
This is WAYYY too much drama for lvl 35 content
---
Tell me you named it Sahara
---
No. Green mobs are just easier to aoe farm
---
&gt; they are generally nice to the horde
---
just wait 6 more days, report back
---
If you are playing on faerlina stalagg etc. etc. you know there's gonna be queues some times at this point. It should be abundantly clear.
---
Faction specific queues are a good idea, but they needed to be implemented at launch in order to get things closer to 50-50 from the start. Doing it now will just piss a lot of people off and I seriously doubt would end up fixing much.
---
People have already shown that they are willing to sit in long queues to play on the server they want. I agree something needs to be done about the major imbalances but I don't think it will truly be fixed until they start forcefully merging servers together.
---
use the twitch app to download LFG addon or join the LookingForGroup chat channel
---
I must have picked a lucky server. Most of the druids have been pretty nice. The few that do attack are memorable and every time I see them I can look forward to a little skirmish.
---
At the end of the day though wouldn't that still just be grinding your way to max power
---
If you started on a PvP server as a casual you are on the wrong type of server anyways, tbh.
---
People who really played during TBC and didn’t play vanilla until the tail end are invariably those who prefer TBC. And that’s the majority of players. This post is case in point. 
---
Unfortunately that doesn’t say much about the respective quality of the two games.
---
All good. I’m not trying to “dismantle” a guild, as someone stated. I wanted discussion. I wasn’t expecting the negative comments though... Its pretty sad and pathetic.
---
As stated before in this thread outland is another world, so it makes sense that it doesn't look all to much like Azeroth, and that was the thing I enjoyed, every zone was unique. And since this is a fantasy video game, sci-fi diversity is totally justified. 
---
But both zones did great at what they were supposed to do, Outland felt like being in a totally different planet and Northrend felt like being in the far north of Azeroth
---
She could just say that she identifies as a attack helicopter . Problem solved
---
There are 12 guilds on Heartseeker clearing each reset currently
---
Either you become the other or you are sol
---
Thank you!
---
yeah.. also in 6 days i'll at least be level 48 so I will more than likely be cannon fodder.
---
I don’t think the realm transfers are all that bad. I've started my account on a Normal realm and I thought there would be occasional PvP there. I was wrong, people will only focus on PvE and mostly never turn on the PvP flag.
---
I'm one of the people who just want to transfer and have more options for fun.
---
Same, just goes to show how fucking incredible it is.
---
most wont end up 90/10 lol.  the servers people complaining about are 40/60-30/70.
---
The worst part is when you have a late night group and everyone is down with this cuz there is no other choice. I had a group like that, they were all irl friends, they were so salty but they didnt even realise what was going on. It was constant healspam. I was barely making it with mana potions. Since then, I always make sure we dont have a pseudo-tank before I go.
---
Right when he gets sheeped my mind goes:
---
Oh oOH WOMBO COMBO WOMBO COMBO WHERE ARE YOU AT?!
---
50/50 is a pipedream anyways. I think most of the playerbase would be ok with 60/40.
---
There is a difference between long queues and near day long queues.
---
[This ain't no place to be a man!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk9aThIovMA)
---
Lol
---
Another example of “The game was the best when I played it”. Not a very compelling argument when comparing the relative quality of these expansions.
---
Yea I am not sure what the solution is. Personally I still prefer an open council system. Yes, it's prone to corruption, but I think leaving it open could abade some of that.
---
Regardless of the system though, there will always be people that don't like it and leave. There is no way to make everyone happy.
---
Rdruid/war was definitely stronger than Mage/Rog for all of TBC. 
---
Rest I agree with, resilience is what made PvP in TBC good.  It is a great stat, survivability is what makes PvP interesting.  Late Vanilla PvP was literally just who managed to one shot the other guy first.
---
Keep classic wow the same, and any new changes or ideas let’s take that to a new MMORPG game.
---
Maybe, just maybe, not everyone cares about pre-raid bis???
---
Exactly. I’ve had more problems with male players than female players.
---
Well limiting transfers to one faction isn't a bad idea it's just way to late to actually make a difference. The first rounds of transfers needed to be faction locked and Bliz didn't do that.
---
If you didn't explicitly ask and was told otherwise they can do what they like with the drops.
---
Being a PvP player is not mutually exclusive from being a PvE player, ya know?
---
Im assuming you tried these already and they didnt work? I play warlock so i know there is a simple macro for your mind flay question but i dont have it in front of me rn. Maybe try finding the warlock equivalent and just swap in mind flay. For that second question im not sure              /cancelform works or not so try /cast Shadowform and i believe that works as a toggle.
---
People will always complain, Blizzards job is to fix the issue in THEIR game. People are complaining now! 
---
You also call out one faction and make it sound malicious that horde players (who are all individuals and not a clump you can generalize) don’t want to go to an EVEN MORE imbalanced server.  There will be two majorly imbalanced servers and both will suffer in phase 2. There is no preventing that now. The ONLY solution has to come from blizzard.  Expecting players to organize and fix the issue collectively is the stupidest idea that has never worked in the history of gaming. 
---
So apologize but you are 100% wrong.
---
Dont tell me that. I dont get involved
---
Try convincing a bunch sexual fueled boys to not try to impress a girl.
---
I'm just sharing my experience which is usually a divide in the guilds because either an Officer or the GM themselves carry the girl in some way like buying her mounts or feeding her gear from raids (when theres clearly someone more deserving)
---
Knowing me I’d probs lose to a bunch of 7 year olds at basketball.
---
How many creep camps is your fully-upgraded barracks grunt soloing? Think about all of the bosses you could go back and solo if you wanted, at level 60, and then ask yourself what kind of unit you would need to do something similar in WC3. You would need a hero.
---
And people say I'm triggered, damn. You guys are so defensive over your gaming habits.
---
It’s not the meme that’s funny, I said that. I barely know the meme. It’s the fact that so many people took the bait. People are spending comment threads trying to explain probability to someone who 1. Was initially talking about chance, and 2. Who decided to say “Either you get it or you don’t”. It’s really, really funny.
---
To be fair ret was really only good for the last couple months of TBC.  Arena S3 was where crusader strike CD was reduced by 40%, SoV was fixed, and a ton of other smaller but nice changes that made them decent.  Before that ret was pretty painful to play in TBC. 
---
[This Patch](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0)
---
where are you getting those numbers?  its unlikely its 60% i dont think people realize how 60% feels in open world especially large servers.  if its 5k players that means there would be 1k more alliance in the world... that's significantly more alliance in every contested zone.
---
Tbh more flightpoints and better flightpaths and flying mounts are not a need
---
Yeah, I only played BC. But I just was so bad back then and now want to actually get shit done.
---
how about this: free transfers for one faction, but the other can follow if they pay. That must be pitchable.
---
Basically paladins make raids so much easier that everyone has more access to gear. 
---
For example, that pug raid we all did on horde that stopped after garr? On alliance they are probably clearing nearly the whole instance in the same time.
---
noone rly cares
---
Yes I do expect millions of people to adjust accordingly  to fulfill their own desires in any said thing.
---
&gt; You think you will, but you won't!
---
Not sure who OP is, but I'm in one of the best guilds in the world (not a humblebrag, just a supporting fact) and I can say with certainty that his 4 month time line is nonsense. We'll be clearing bwl et al ofc, but there's plenty to be done in mc and ony, and we're a top guild, casuals, and less top end are probably even less near done. OP is probably just someone who got lucky and decked out in gear quickly, but he's guild is probably not kept up with gear.
---
And i dont have to worry about it being dead in 3 months cause a "F R E S H" server opened.
---
Yeah I’m so fucking bad at that so I made sure this time I make 1 class and use it only. Used to be alt kinda guy but something. Clicked this time and my mage is 60 with over 5k gold made in my first 30 days played
---
That's still 50% more horde than alliance.
---
Fake
---
I’d like to see a realm transfer from Westfall as a horse. The balance is way off.
---
Uhh I didn't know at all. I followed my friends who wanted to be on a PvP server and they just wanted to be Horde PvP.
---
Right but you aren't leaping at the chance to honorably meet at a designated time and place (because dirty win trading is dishonorable) with the Horde guilds at your level. You get to engage on your terms.
---
10 health every 5 seconds?  that's OP!  nerf it!
---
dev:  ok, consider it done!
---
He’s probs a warlock. ;)
---
I would leave that shitty guild, any decent guild would give sword rogues prio on swords and dagger rogues daggers over warriors.
---
How do ppl say this? There is so fuckin much to do I feel like at 60 I don’t have enough time to do it!
---
There were Europeans in the guild before Naxxramas...
---
Yes the second one can. It's on the retail engine.
---
This, this is why everyone is calling you a boomer
---
This should be a no brainer.  who is in charge if making these decisions at blizzard?? I will send a letter and direct them to the forums or something.  Blizzard is dropping the ball here big time. 
---
Wonder if they will get it right in TBC
---
They only did that to appease the "hardcore" raiders, that would do nothing but bitch that people could get comparable gear outside of dungeons.
---
And yet, they didn't say anything when the TBC quest greens were better than their raid gear.
---
The nr 1 is gonna follow you no matter what servef you go to, unless you stop being an asshole or stop talking...
---
Some people have completed multiples raids
---
I use 1-12 then shift+1-12 ctrl +1-12 and alt+1-12 
---
Which give me 48keybinds in total; that are easy to access with a 12 button mouse. I use my pinky on my left hand to press shift, ctrl, or alt; whilst using my 3 primary fingers for wasd movement
---
For pet classes I use mouse scroll up to attack and mouse scroll down to retreat. Allows me to control my pet easily.
---
For warrior I use scroll up for zerk stance, scroll down normal stance, I use V to change to shield stance. Along with using weapon swap and shield equip macros, this makes switching stances really easy and quick.
---
i’d give him 4ish seconds before i charge in. maybe don’t sweeping strikes right away. watch your health bar and adjust if needed. 
---
make sure you stay out of defensive stance (has a threat modifier) if you don’t want aggro. 
---
it seemed weird to me that you don’t use MS? i’d do that most of the time and just cleave if i have too much rage. 
---
I think if he’a 10 levels higher than you and you got aggro though, he’s probably just bad.
---
&gt; Both of these cannot be done in classic wow on a pvp realm
---
Both of what? You can't make an alt on the other faction, but you can certainly right click and report the other faction.
---
I'm in an ultra high end guild, none of us are disappointed that pve content isn't being rushed. We're excited for pvp though.
---
I just got my epic mount, bought Krol Blade, bought consumes for about 3 weeks of raids, and go almost all my enchants on my gear &amp; my backup set in case i replace SC pieces. I had like 1.4k g a few days ago...I have 24g LEL
---
Idk what Classic + is
---
Same for me. The only raid I've ever did before WOTLK was in BC a fucking pug of Gruul. I didn't get any loot and was horrible. The only reason they took me in the first place was for the moonkin buff. 
---
Now I'm the healing leader in my guild and we will kill Rag tomorrow.
---
Instead of looking at it like that you should be farming best in slot for whatever your secondary talents are for that class for instants I am a mage so I am farming now all of my fire gear bis. Also farming rep for other factions and different epic mounts.
---
I appreciated your comment.
---
&gt;Petty revenge
---
I think I'd have a dart
---
I'm an idiot plz help me understand joke
---
Ok? And? They rolled the faction with the PvP racials that everyone knew would be overpopualted on PvP servers and now they're upset that Alliance players are going to servers where the game won't be unplayable for them outside cities and dungeons they'll have to spend 20 minutes getting to. 
---
Like you said, its a fact of life. So I don't know what Hordelets expected. The majority of this just reads like people feeling entitled to gank and getting moody that the other faction doesn't want to indulge them on lopsided servers.
---
So after reading the comments. This is a true end all. Like when we posts of ppl getting this we will know if classic will fizzle out and die or they eventually decide to release further content
---
ahahah ok
---
This is by far the most needlessly aggressive response I've ever seen.
---
Dude was just explaining.
---
Good job making sure I never take anything you say seriously lmao
---
https://www.google.nl/amp/s/www.engadget.com/amp/2007/03/20/nihilum-recruiting-females-need-not-apply/
---
I think it needs to be free cross-faction on unbalanced servers. But yeah, paid transfers to follow might garner interest from Activision execs.
---
Guilds that fully clear and farm content end up divided because some officer or GM has a crush on the girl and they argue and start drama with the rest about why she should be carried and prioritized loot.
---
I really wish people would stop saying "your"
---
I dont get involved. I log in do my role for the guild. Log out.
---
Help out with aoe when mana is not a concern. There are some aoe pulls in dungeons where you can use it, while healing your party at the same time. It also generates no threat, quite convenient.
---
Bro is that your experience? Doesn't mean its true lol.
---
Our logs are private
---
Sook
---
I mean, do any blizzard employees even check this subreddit? Otherwise we’re just singing to the choir here lol.
---
I respected at 40 for hemo/prep yeah, I miss the hit rating and endurance talent but otherwise I much prefer it, especially being able to actually lock people down instead of missing energy like combat would.
---
Well, how did you expect ppl to react? Lol if u troll ofc ppl will get pissed, wether u serious or not, not all ppl will recognize that straight away. I dunno why you would be surprised lol
---
The issue is that they're almost certainly relying on other people to support them, and those people, be they parents, partner or the taxpayer, probably aren't OK with it.
---
thanks for letting us know
---
I disagree, the guild already gets the materials doing the raid. We could sell them or save them up to eventually be able to create the hammer. Its standard practice that the guild just builds Thunderfury/Hand for the people who get the required drops. Nobody expects the warrior to go out and farm the gold he going to need for Thunderfury.
---
At work. Will when i get home.
---
that too ;)
---
Most pservers I have been aware of the past 8 years or so also only had 1-3 options which were either just age (fresh progression) or exp rate differences at their core. Many didn’t have PVE options at all, let alone 20+ servers to choose from. The volume difference in servers with classic is huge
---
I've noticed people running dungeons like retail and then we wipe (while I vanish). Definitely more important to let the tank get aggro. Everything in classic is slower. Topping dps meters doesn't matter as long the run is going smooth. Positioning, impatience and spamming abilties seem to be the top reasons for wipes
---
I head that story a lot. 
---
Yet, I've been playing since vanilla, and I've literally never seen it happen, in all the many guilds I've run with. I have, however, watched guys give their guy friends a ton of drops someone else deserved. 
---
(Lesson being: human beings often make subjective, biased, or otherwise unfair decisions, regardless of the gender involved.)
---
I'm not blaming anything on you, personally, don't get me wrong -- but this is a pervasive and ridiculous attitude WoW players cling to unreasonably. Even if it happens every day, which it does not, it would still be dudebro's fault for being a douchebag and trying to impress a girl with pixels. Why is the anger not directed at him, instead of her?
---
Just food for thought tbh.
---
Pretty sure your joke was the edgy and stupid one.
---
My whole guild was fine. Is it just west coast servers or both regions? A hunter in my raid said he was still getting 200 frames.
---
Toughen up buttercup. 
---
You don’t get to go wherever you want and do whatever either. 
---
People have a right to play with and how they like and if your excluded you go somewhere else- that’s fing life and you damn millennials need to get over your self righteousness indignation.
---
Nice for low level pvp. Awful for leveling.
---
Only riding after you? HAhaha, they had a full raid of horde waiting at the graveyards too in case you gave up and spirit res'd.
---
I’ve just never met a guild with that rule before. I just think it’s messed up.
---
Carrot on a stick for flightpaths is 1000% better than flying mounts
---
Classic is not challenging though. You're just pretending like it is because you want to feel good about your skill level. That's dishonest. If you think classic is hard, you're not very good.
---
Well i for one am not afraid to run in and die to ensure another guild doesn’t get it over mine.
---
your alternate timeline idea, basically. There's lots of people who think the same way you do, but the general concern is that the same people who just recently thought BfA was a good idea will still think that things like BfA is going to be a good idea. Which is how your alternate timeline will end up incorporating an awful lot of ideas that seem like bfa did. Voila! you just tricked yourself into getting a sprint towards what made retail meh instead of a slow march.
---
***Lawl tis be gud fry day commander heres an updoot***
---
This crashed the balance on some servers making WPvP an absolute nightmare. They restrict transfers to the same server type (pvp to pvp only for example) so this should've been common sense.
---
Because then their BG queues will be terrible and they’ll have nothing to do in p2, probably.
---
We had 7 the last two weeks and one of our healers is mining dark iron during boss, so...
---
Yeah an all girl guild would have 0 drama. lol.
---
Account sharing is easier than ever and all the big guilds on my server already have it planned. Nothing will be different from Vanilla.
---
Seems odd they wouldn’t just go get their bis neck. Melee is from a quest... pretty easy to get. No one ever expects bkues/greens to be rolled off. Just the purpz.
---
Interesting, looks like I was wrong. They may have eventually walked back on that or I may be remembering their Ensidia days.
---
I like that I not only can disagree, but negate someone else with my downvote.
---
JK..  But I think the main reason Blizzard is opening up transfers to begin with is queue length, which affects all factions universally.   If I wasn't able to get off a realm with huge queue times because the faction I chose, I'd be pissed.  Especially when servers like Skeram, had no indication they'd be super popular on day 1.
---
wtfamireading
---
First and foremost because faction specific queues has no place in Classic WoW. That is a completely different system that would first off kill any imbalanced server, I mean absolutely kill them. If your server is 80/20 for example, you just don't get to play the game, EVER.
---
I feel you on daily quests, but flying wasn't added to Azeroth until Cataclysm.
---
should have passed on the kroll blade
---
I clicked on the image just to post that! Lol
---
They’re always healers.
---
He's being hyperbolic, it's not a stance they take.
---
Lady Katrana must be blasting down houses all over Stormwind with her monster dragon toots
---
So like I said, the guild help sure, helping meaning they assist you in the drops thats fine. You're comparing apples to oranges with hammer and thunderfury, Hammer is replaced its not bis for top war dps, and its not bis for enhancement shaman. Why should the guild be expected to give you all the mats for something thats niche because you equipped nightfall. I agree they should help with it, and you should get eye, but they shouldnt fully fund you. Thunderfury is BIS tank weapon that will help the guild progress through every raid much easier.
---
Yep. Had to refill horde on another server after like a week because my friend has ADHD
---
Classicwow.live
---
Blizzard right now is JUST trying to fix the problem of overpopulated servers. They're not doing a targeted fix at server balance yet, which IMO would have to take the form of server merges, or a racial-based queue.
---
Playing on a faction imbalanced server, lays squarely in the hands of the players who are on that server FOR NOW. Unfortunately, you're probably right that the servers are fucked until Blizzard does something. I'm not naive enough to think that character transfers are going to fix the problem. I'm simply saying that its stupid to blame Blizzard for allowing Alliance to leave.
---
True but if you are a male player it’s something you have grown up with. It’s as common as needing to eat. Once girls joins in the hormones goes ballistic. We raided with some girls in our vanilla guild. And they were for sure the centre of the attention for a loot of my mates lol. Specially the ones that posted selfies on guild team site.
---
They could have seen this in vanilla and give Alliance some pvp benefits that can match Undead’s. They could have made faction queue. They could have done a lot. The same thing will happen now, there will be horde servers and alliance servers. No wonder they made cross realm battlegrounds. But hey, who would have payed for paid character transfer if servers were balanced? No one.
---
I wish my wife was a gamer. Sad life.

Gender is not irrelevant lmao.
---
FPS isn't the problem, it's the delay between actions.
---
More likely than not to be honest. Just like gamers being close to going pro seem to have a higher change of getting banned etc. Just makes your blood boil that much easier.

Gnome Chomsky?

good news, looks like Blizz is rapidly responding to community feedback!

fuckin L O L
---
If the demographic of horde players is higher than alliance (across all realms) server transfers wont work. No where for all the horde to go.
---
Well, to be fair, he also does that to any random orc or troll at like level 8.
---
Leveling is much more challenging in classic than retail, and some of us like leveling. They're different games.
---
Yikes reading people’s comments. I’ve tanked every/all dungeons as Arms. 31/20, easily. No complaints. I get plenty of people asking me to tank their dungeons after running with me too. Currently spam running UBRS no issues either. 
---
Just get competent people in your group and collect the loot. Stay arms so you can quest outside of dungeons. Just wear all plate and have a sword and shield in your bags. 
---
Enjoy
---
They could sell them to the player base as a “we are doing this while keeping the spirit of vanilla in mind” like they sold layering.
---
There might be but they are probably 100% lesbians;) I kinda think that many girls wants the attention of several men;) and they don’t like to share with their sisters.
---
Most HC guilds have this rule. They’re just silent about it and toss girl apps in the bin.
---
Read this as screenshotretard
---
The "low level warrior" isn't even out of character creation so it won't be attacking anyone. The joke is that when you see low HP allys you start twitching in anticipation to go kill them.
---
you are learning why blizzard killed wpvp. herod isnt that imbalanced.
---
You know he is talking about the lore right?
---
Psyched to have one drop for me. Bummed it was only going for 40g. Still sold though, not bad.
---
I don’t get it. Even in Vanilla our raid teams had girls and most of the time they out performed the majority of the male players.
---
If it was down to hardware capacity I'm pretty sure they would have just thrown money at it. Being an enterprise sysadmin myself, I can tell you for sure that 9/10 throwing money at hardware won't fix the issue. 
---
I have no evidence, but I've seen some comments here about lag happening with few people in current vanilla than back in the day. I'm pretty sure at least some of the load issues can be attributed to virtualizing the realm servers, whereas back in the day they had 4 physical servers per realm. Virtualization is great but there are caveats (resource contention) that could cause some of these problems. Not easy to fix. unless you're have a crystal ball.
---
BGs are regionwide, so Heartseeker Alliance will still have instant queues.
---
Should be able to switch factions in your server. Tried horde this time around and the cities fucking blow. I would happily go to the ally side just to dominate my former compadres.
---
Not sure what's worse, an 80/20 server or a 20/80 server. The servers that they are offering xfers too are horribly imbalanced as well.
---
/cancelaura Shadow Form
---
/cast Desperate Prayer
---
Maybe?
---
Feel free to be wrong
---
You greatly overestimate how much thought people put into choosing a server. The US "big streamers server" is an exception, not the rule. I'm playing on Eu servers, we have a few different languages to chose from. Since I was joining a group of friends we had basically 2 options at launch: Join the PvE server in that language or join the PvP server. Soon enough they added more PvP servers and we picked one of those because the queue times on the very first servers were bad.
---
People picked whatever had acceptable or no queue time or simply joined friends who already had characters.
---
It's funny because everything you said I could say about alliance. Countless times my friends and I have left alliance players alone when they are questing, we've helped some of them on multiple occasions. I've seen 5 horde players questing next to 1 alliance and never attack him only to have a level 60 gnome mage (it's always gnome acting like that) show up and start killing the horde guys. I'm never the victim of horde assholes, I'm not a dick myself so I don't enjoy grey killing people who are questing, but I'm sometimes victim of the alliance assholes. It's easy then to say alliance is a bunch of assholes, I'm only seeing it from my perspective.
---
The truth is, if you are on a severely unbalanced server alliance players simply don't have many occasions to act like dicks while horde have plenty. When factions are somewhat balanced the amount of asshole on each side is also balanced.
---
Perhaps, but I think it’s pretty clear Classic fans don’t want a bunch of new bells and whistles - why can’t they just release new zones and new story, perhaps shake up old zones some, without adding all the random bells and whistles like dungeon finder / flying mounts / etc? It’d be “skimpier” than a retail expansion but that’s fine by us!
---
European buddy from Zandalar tribe jumping in, same here, although I feel like there won't be any world farming after layering is gone, as there people farming things literally everywhere
---
You are spot on. Boys will be boys no matter what. It calms down as boys get older and learn to not state their true intentions. But even older men still eat up girls with their eyes. But they hide it and they don’t I’ll not admit it.
---
More like the number of alliance cowards!
---
Come to Bigglesworth. It's 55/45 H/A and the large majority of horde players here suck. It's free honor.
---
Pretty sure you're just pathetic piece of shit ;) 
---
Sit and spin buddy.
---
Seems like you just call everything salty all the time.
---
My entire guild (alliance, of course) transferred from Herod to Hearseeker. Honestly I didn't want to because I knew it would just kill PvP but all my friends went so eventually I did too. I barely even see Horde anymore. If I see Horde getting ganked I just feel really bad for them at this point.
---
I'm tempted to transfer over, is it really that bad? I dislike being on a dominated server this heavily in my favor.
---
TIGHT! You're right!!!!!!
---
If you search YouTube for wow classic shadow priest macros there's a guy with a 7min video explaining some macros, including switching out of shadow to heal
---
Very geared 60 priest here. Don't bother tanking anger until 54 or so
---
I mean, it was typically more than just a few pieces with maybe a couple exceptions for classes that just needed to stack resil just to survive.
---
You said that you needed a large amount of resilience just to compete which was not true. Plenty of classes hardly needed any at all.
---
yea it's sucky not seeing any alliance out there. strongly considering transferring to heartseeker since its alliance dominated even if it is lower pop. i dont need to run dungeons anymore anyways.
---
Atiesh is the reason I rolled Priest. I have every other raid legendary in retail. I NEED to get this one to complete my dream
---
How about you dont do 200 vs 200 pvp
---
blizzard is desperately trying to find a way to kill classic. you'd think it would be an impossible task to fuck it up but they'll still trying.
---
RP-PVP
---
I don't play "classic" but I've played most expansions and even vanilla, I do remember transfer fucking shit up 10 years ago. I just check on this sub to bring back some good memories.
---

---
Cry me a fuckin river. Either grow a pair or go play on a PvE server
---
Yeah doing the math its a .5 second wait for 3 hemos at 100 energy compared to 2 seconds for ss. Seems like a pretty big margin.
---
+70 armor
---
You don’t need an advanced degree in statistics to realize that’s to be expected in a game that’s probably over 90% male.
---
Depends on the level of the enemies, seeing as an equal-level enemy has a 4% chance to resist your spells baseline, and that number goes down for every level between yourself and the enemy (can't find the exact numbers online though). If you could get yourself 3% spell hit through gear, then you'd reduce the # of pickpockets resisted by an average of 400% against enemies your own level, but you need less when pickpocketing enemies that are lower level than yourself.
---
Flying mounts are the single greatest ruination of the game.
---
It's hearsay based on censuses run by a couple of my friends who rolled there. Outdated, though. Most (admittedly very limited) data actually shows an even greater than 60% Alliance skew.
---
Lul up fry doot heres day
---
Alliance moving from Kurinnaxx really hurt us. Now it's nothing but horde camping Mara/BRD/BRS and it's a real turn off.
---
good and honest tauron :)))
---
Anyone know the actual statistics on the split between horde and alliance on all the servers? Is there a source with information/data on this?
---
Their raid times are regular early US evening. :/
---

---
Earthshaker is great!
---
At 52 stick to prison/arena

i think thats BOE, just like the parachute cloak, boots and shield belt
---
Ah, damn. Biggles wasn't my choice either. Got forced there and here I am.
---
Yes, please.
---
I just looked and my guild isn't on there. We're at 9/10 MC with no pugs in our raids.
---
Yeah, definitely took my time.
---
Just hit level 60, enjoying running dungeons and stuff trying to get pre-raid BIS for my mage but the time it takes to get a group together and run the thing is a bit of a time commitment. I'm missing when I could hop on for just an hour or two and quest for a bit. What activities can I do now that are easy to hop in and out of when I can only play for a little bit?
---
I just recently killed her (2 weeks ago), and I just trapped her pet and kited her throughout Ungoro. Go in a straight line and avoid the mobs and the pet should leash. Just stay over 30 yards from her to avoid the lightning and keep using R1 Arcane Shot to keep aggro. Do damage by weaving autos/multishot/Serpent Sting.
---
This strat made her the easiest demon out of the bunch. Happy hunting!
---
Fair enough
---
Where do you get the 10 layers info from? This is from Blizzard
---
&gt;The last time a server in this region had more than three layers was the first week of September, and almost all realms reached two layers shortly after that.
---
And during that time the real highpop servers had 15k queue.
---
Lmfao its a video game you nerd.  Its meant to take your money.  How old are you, you havent realized this yet? 
---
Front of thennew York times Lmfao.  I hope blizzard china continues to piss you off, you deserve it.
---
I'm not sure if this helps you, but what I did 14 years ago was use Freezing Trap first to contain the pet, then used Goblin Rocket Helmet when the trap finally broke. By the end of that, I think the demon was either dead or a concussive shot was enough to hold the pet at bay until the demon was finished off.
---
Personally, I think they should do 2 things
---
1. Allow anyone on an imbalanced side to transfer to any disadvantaged side. Make it free, and let people do it as long as imbalance exists. 
---
2. Allow people to faction change. People are all up on nochanges, but transferring to the lesser populated side doesnt exactly seem unfair imo.
---
Yeah I'm a horde on Skeram and I don't gank anyone unless provoked.
---
They can do damage up until she lands. Then they actually want to get Feared. Tank should be in Berserker tance and pop Berserker Rage to avoid the first fear. Everyone else getting Feared while the tank doesn't is effectively a Threat reset. The tank getting Feared is the biggest failure of P3 transition and so easily avoidable
---
Please tell me you're the guy putting together the group
---
What's wrong with incendius?
---
Ha I saw that earlier
---
Agreed. Playing with a baby is fine. Neglecting an awake and needy not fine. 
---
I have such needy baby .
---
I know but thats not what im talking about here. Im a PVP player and in classic i have to do raids, and i think thats how the game should be
---
ARISE, MY CHAMPION
---
Problem is these servers are now 90A/10H and even more imbalanced than the servers they are coming from.
---
Join the Steam group!
---
I played on a vanilla server for 4-5 years and was sad when it closed. I'd still be playing if it was still up. 
---
Even though classic is 'permanent' I don't want to go through it again. Unless they do new content, then I'd jump back in.
---
In my opinion, blizz missed their shot by waiting so long. If they had launched classic shortly after nuking private servers years ago, it would've been even more popular.
---
Bgs are P3 and cross server any over all faction Pop isn't bad so the queue times wont be bad at all.
---
But I've seen just as many boys do that whispering behind the scenes drama BS. Which is kinda my point. 
---
Shitty people do shitty shit. You notice it more in girls, but that doesn't mean girls do it more often.

Dawhs. Suck it up and find another group lol
---
I love how this is the narrative y’all have created on Reddit about skeram but in reality I’m horde and havnt been to brm without a corpse run cuz of the alli raid camping it all day every day for over a week now 😜
---
I believe fire is the most viable spec to solo those as a mage. Yeah, you need to kill Jammal for Dreamscythe and Weaver to spawn, but not for Hazzas and Morphaz, you can get to those without killing anything else in the dungeon.
---
Ok boomer.

Stop being such an easily triggered snowflake. All someone has to do is say sexism is bad and you people fly off the handle.

"Source"? Are you serious? This isn't some academic science journal. I can't just dig up decades of people ceaselessly praising TBC everywhere. If you've been paying attention *at all* over the last 5+ expansions, it's pretty obvious that TBC gets very high praise.
---
You seem extremely determined to "win" this as if it's some kind of argument, but you're not going to settle this once and for all by having a back-and-forth with one guy on some obscure post in an internet discussion.
---
See the second part of my comment just before? That's me agreeing with you. I like Wrath better than TBC too. *We're on the same page*. In case you haven't noticed, everything I've said in this thread is an observation of what *other people have been saying* over the last 10 years. I have no stake in this.
---
I find it’s faster to mix the two. Some quests have awesome rewards or are great for xp, some quests don’t. Do the ones you want, throw in some mob/dungeon grinding and you’re set

&gt; give Humans EMFH
---
How about you fuck off back to hell where you belong, satan. EMFH is one of the worst decisions they ever made next to OG will

I honestly think it would still be screwed https://mail.gnome.org/archives/evolution-list/2002-January/msg00466.html
---
I mean, you're not wrong. But there's always gonna be somebody that ruins it for everyone else.
---
God damn your insults are insane and honestly uncalled for.
---
I never ganked any allies leveling. Never even fought back most of the time. I joined Skeram because it seemed like a decent east coast pvp server at the time.
---
So now, I get insulted for literally doing nothing against them and now I have to either suffer of a horde dominated server or jump to an alliance heavy one and get ganked constantly? I really hope you're never in a position of power because you do not have the attitude for one.
---
How's your mum's basement?
---
Whatca pointing at?
---
just wait. blizzard is going to figure out a way to ruin classic.
---
How will a faction restricted transfer fix stuff? If server A is 70 Horde - 30 Alliance, server B is 70 Alliance - 30 Horde what what would the restrictions look like? You can transfer to server A if you are only alliance, transfer to server B if you are only horde? Who would transfer into servers like that? If that's the case they may as well stay on the server they are already on where they get ganked to hell already. Faction restricted transfers only work if the community actually makes an attempt to dive into a server and help out a faction that is under-represented, but Alliance flat out does not have enough PvP players to balance out every realm so ofc you end up with a situation like this. If they don't have transfers people will just reroll or quit the game instead of transfering and you end up with the same result, faction imbalances, except now blizzard is losing subscribers.
---
Mage here, I accidentally stole Second Wind, A trinket that increases healing spells and effects in BRD from out priest.
---
Cyclopean band dropped in arena and I just gave it to the priest as an apology.
---
Sorry to hear.. honestly. I understand how that feels. I love the photos!
---
Do you have a source for that or is it all chauvinistic guessing?
---
Depends how much you enjoy fucking around doing pvp.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
IMO if you are just trying to level in peace, then combat is best, if you actively want to pvp while leveling then go sub.
---
At which point they’ll just complain about it as though it’s not their fault.
---
Don’t understand the downvotes. It isn’t his fault Blizzard fucked up the population distribution, and he isn’t required to stay on a server he doesn’t like to appease the masses
---
The moment flying mounts are in the game I am gone.
---
We need Classic+ or else the game will just die again. 
---
They need to poll any changes / content like they do with OSRS. 
---
They can just expand on Azeroth to add content, no need for completely new worlds. There are a few unused zones that could be added, and they could make some story up to add more new zones to EK + Kalimdor once they’ve used those up.  The Azeroth we see on the in game map can just be the “mapped”  areas of Azeroth, and new zones can be discovered and added on with new content or something.
---
But really, if they release TBC next I am gone. It was a good expansion in regards to classes and making a lot of specs more useful, but it was the beginning of the end already by adding flying mounts
---
The alliance straight up camp BRM and Dire Maul all day long. They are ruthless on Sulfuras.
---
Imagine transfering from Faerlina to whatever dumpster server they offer
---
Really should.  Scumbag druid and rogue ganked me during an escort quest.. me, a fellow druid!
---
People like the guy above me exist.
---
Problem is, they'd do it like they did classic. Launch it on patch 2.4.3 and trickle the tiers in. Doing t4/5 on 2.4.3 would be worse than MC is in 1.12.
---
You'd have no challenge till t6/sunwell PVE-wise.
---
Are you Ally or Horde?
---
im tellin' papa blizzard the purple mages are having fun!
---
Haha! :)
---
B a s e d
---
&gt; From Blizzards perspective, doing TBC is the safe, obvious play (and what they'll probably go with due to it's predictability and the lesser resource requirement for the dev team).
---
How is it less resources? It took Blizzard three years to release classic when they had a reference 1.12 client. Even if they have a 2.4.3 reference client, that still means they need to manually port everything over just like they did for classic. The only assets that can be used without modification are art assets.
---
Classic+ on the other hand would likely involve unused art assets and small content patches which could be completed in a fraction of the time it takes to completely re-write TBC to be compatible with the modern client.
---
I don't trust Blizzard to competently develop Classic+.
---
I would be incredibly disappointed if TBC didn't come out. 
---
I love classic, but for me it's pretty much a warm up for TBC.
---
Wouldn't mind a removal of flying mounts, but it's only because so many people are against them.
---
Are your party members higher level than you? Are you wearing threat gear or all mitigation gear? Is your gear decent? 
---
These are important questions. In my experience, your build doesn't matter much in regards to tanking unless you are raiding.
---
Dull and boring vs never getting to step foot out of city.  Those are hardly the same thing.  Most everyone would choose 'A' over not getting to play at all.
---
No it was shit talking.
---
It's mostly just &lt;fury&gt; though. I'm not saying other horde member don't camp brm, but I swear it's always &lt;fury&gt; when I go there
---
Current Blizzard is not able to deliver Classic+. The reason Classic is great is because it is NOT the same people who still work on WoW. They already did a bunch of highly questionable things, Classic+ will be a fucking dumpster fire. The creative freedoms and mindset of the developers back in early 2000's is gone, sad but true.
---
Then move? Point is the people that want to move can move, you can move if you want to. The fact is if you open faction specific transfers you still aren't going to get enough people to willingly move to balance the servers
---
They really need to keep transfers faction specific, and to realms specifically lacking in that faction. Not some free for all. I'm on Pagle-alliance and it's HEAVY Alliance. Horde is straight up rare to see at all some days.
---
But since it's not like that, I hate transfers. It takes people who play out of your overall pool and randomly gives them to a low pop realm that may or may not be a good fit. At least if you have some guidance you could actually balance out the realms. But people on their own are not going to do this.
---
Also, its gotta be to the same type of realm. PvP or RP(pvp) should not be able to come to PvE and vice versa. PvE people have a distinct advantage in terms of farming and would have an immediate leg up taking all their crap to a PvP server they didn't have to literally fight for. Even just selling stuff since prices tend to be higher on PvP I have heard.
---
\*looks at every guild named Laughing coffin\* yes

The USMC spent $100 million testing this a few years ago.

Don't think of Ony as a raid. My spec is 20/31 so can easily join as healer to get it done. I just did 2 runs in Scholo with the FA and it worked like a charm. Very happy with it! 
---
Oh, and Im in Firemaw EU
---
I’m not saying skins. I’m saying your ground mount is a wing clipped griffon. Variation of flight path birds would be cool. Have the colors vary from town to town.
---
While a agree with what your saying, it is simply not efficient not to level as combat sword for solo play. 
---
Also while things said are true tonsome extent, I haven't had major issues finding groups for dungeons. I often start my own though. Only finding a tank can be troublesome during the calm hours.
---
Bur
---
What the hell?  That is a grand ol' dogwhistle of the sexist kind if I ever heard one.
---
My experience:  I've operated in leadership roles/management in my professional and gaming life, Classic WoW was my first experience years ago --- (before we called it classic WoW lol)
---
The only reason drama occurs, is immaturity of any given member and a lack of effective communication between members as well as leadership, and mediation of disputes ( which are inevitable no matter who is in your guild because FAMILIES FIGHT)
---
Inclusivity of different backgrounds and opinions will almost always lead to longterm improved communication amongst these groups as they bond and grow.
---
Okay, so my two cents not being in the guild, and speaking from prior experiences......
---
I've seen this type of group before....
---
This isn't a 'women are the problem' issue, this is a 'the men in our guild cant be trusted around women issue' which most likely generates drama, because the women cant get someone that calls themselves a "leader" to acknowledge what is going on and effectively mediate the bullshit drama the boys are generating.
---
#endrant
---
Agreed. I'm definitely going to try it out again after the squish. The journey should matter.
---
As a warrior I completely disagree. I could tank for you as a fury spec and I'd bet money you'd be none the wiser. You absolutely don't need to be prot to tank dungeons.
---
Hardly, demi-gods and Cenarius and more and more. Pretty much every sentient creature ganged up during War of the Ancients against the Legion.
---
Hey
---
I'm sorry but with "the pet should leash" do you mean that it will de-aggro and be removed from the fight entirely?
---
2000 horde and 300 alliance?  Only 300 horde get to log in, rest in queue with no queue for alliance.  That should make horde choose the transfer and balance the servers.
---
Men are better gamers than women.
---
I end up dealing with a lot of rogues oneshotting but I am not 60 yet. It will be great when I am geared enough to get them back.
---
I play on Grob.
---
What makes you say that? They’ve already dumped a ton of money and man power into getting classic up and running. It’s not like they had to just flip a switch. They had to rebuild a vast majority of the game.
---
Let's just agree to disagree. I don't like you, I don't like people like you, and I feel you were entirely in the wrong here. That's just how it's gonna be, I guess.
---
Free transfers
---
Source /r/classicwow
---
Literally nothing you said is true lol.  It's going to be fun listening to people complain about ranking.
---
I'm considering leaving for the same reason. I have to admit though, on occasion I'll be doing world quests in Mechagon and the other 8 horde players around me are nice enough to let me get my objective before murdering me.
---
Herod is &gt; 60/40...
---
Correct me if I'm wrong because I seem to be the only one doing this.
---
Should non elites in dungeons not be generally prioritized? Their damage can be eliminated in like 1 second of focus
---
Right, so alliance players should be punished by not having the option to transfer, and the bandwagoners who are the causer of the problem in the first place should be rewarded by getting an additional option denied to alliance.
---
All so that horde don't have to play PvE (*The horror!*), which is obviously one million times more important than alliance players *being able to play at all*.  
---
You chose the bandwagon faction.  You chose the EZmode free fight winning racials.  You chose the ultra convenient flight paths, zepps, questing hubs, *warchief's blessing*, all of it.  You wanted the easy ride.
---
Well, you got it.  No refunds, no returns.  
---
Caveat emptor.  
---
All these streamers and posts about opening one faction transfer and the first question I always ask is: *would they take the transfer*?  *Are they taking the CURRENT transfer?*. Of course not, the cost is always for OTHER people to pay.  They aren't the problem.  The last raindrop is never at fault for the bucket overflowing.  
---
Here's the god's honest truth.  Faction specific transfers would do *absolutely nothing* because not enough horde players would take it.  Because they don't want to pay any cost.  They already had a way out - it's called not rolling the obvious zerg faction then complaining about being on the zerg faction.  They STILL have a way out - roll alliance, or reroll horde on an alliance heavy server.

There was always a way out, if they were willing to pay the cost.  We see exactly how much faction balance really means to these whiners - not enough to make them reroll, not enough to make them transfer, not enough to make them stop camping flight paths, only just barely enough to make them constantly ask Blizzard to punish other people so that they never, ever have to change their own behavior or suffer any consequences for their own choices.
---
Thrall: We don't want wars and bloodshed anymore.
---
Also Thrall: Let's name our capital city after the guy who led the Horde during all the wars and bloodshed it caused.
---
You seem to have a solid plan. Contact someone at Blizzard, explain it. Schedule a meeting and you got yourself a nice six figure cushy job.
---
At the end of the day none of us know fuck all as to what/why is going on with their servers.
---
Kirtonos is a great server. As a Horde player, I've seen Ally dominate a lot of world pvp encounters, including when it escalates to full raids. 
---
[http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/kirtonos/50](http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/kirtonos/50)
---
According to this, while Horde greatly outnumbers Alliance, the disparity lessens as you go higher level, until eventually Ally surpasses Horde. According to this site, Ally actually outnumbers Horde on Kirtonos almost 2:1 for characters above level 50.
---
Tattle-tale!
---
Ok, but both are feasible if I respec prot I’m guessing?
---
there are around 44 guilds that clear MC on Heartseeker as Alliance, and 15 as Horde. Can't wait to see what happens over the next few days. Complete joke that this is a thing. Faction balance has always been a problem yes, but apparently Blizz hasn't learned through 15 years that there can be ways to manage it more efficiently.
---
Your point is invalid, though. There were specs for improved stealth. no one goes it.
---
The portion of players who want to play through top end content for memey bullshit to feel like Skyrim where you can "do anything!!!" is nonexistent.
---
Why are they allowing free transfers from Stalagg, it isn’t even highly populated because so many alliance left.
---
Then you're either lying or vastly exaggerating the number of players or thought it was more players than it was. The servers can not handle that many people in combat in one area. We've got a a metric fuck ton of videos aside from the couple you got linked proving it from different people.
---
All the reasons about how easy it is to get  and meaningless it is to have are perfect reasons for the rogue waiting for the casters to get it first. 
---
It is what it is, if you are a loot ninja I don’t like you either 🤷‍♂️
---
The warlock discord spreadsheet says choker edges out star with all my gear accounted for, I think it's the most reliable source.
---
feral druid.
---
Heartseeker is very alliance heavy now
---
Come back
---
It is for an indefinite period of time. Could be weeks could be months, so on.
---
It was loot counciled to me.
---
For those that don’t get it, the above comment spells “fuck you” in binary.
---
Blizzard never learned from retail WoW how to do population management on servers.
---
Idiots.
---
I have a 60 on sulfuras and a 60 on stallag. I wish I could get them on the same server, but it doesnt look like you can pick where you go
---
Don't you get something related Thunderbrew from a quest in Dun Morogh?
---
Good comment right here.
---
Thank you! So pre hoting myself is still very much useful. As a bear it makes sense to help the healer AND pull more threat. Especially since regrowth lasts a long time.
---
Well first and foremost I want to give an F for SWG and the way that gift of a game was desecrated by greed. 
---
I don’t think comparing classic directly to SWG pre vs post NGE is important, it’s really more of an analogy between how vanilla progressed to retail and what went wrong similarly to when SWG went from pre-CU to NGE. 
---
There is a consistent decrease in player agency as both changed over time as developers created more tightly controlled rails for the player.
---
I’d think most would agree that vanilla would score higher on “sandbox” than retail, even if at its core it isn’t a sandbox MMO. 
---
As far as honor farming goes, yeah BGs were the place to do it, but real competitive pvp was not about honor farming... nobody respected you for “farming honor” they respected you for beating their ass in a duel or out in the world.  In this sense, the whole cross realm stuff was an even worse blow to world pvp than flying. 
---
Beating high ranking people who farmed honor in BGs all day out in the world, now that was fun.
---
Pretty much
---
Even a 60/40 imbalance is pretty high. That’s like playing an Arathi basin match 15 players against 10 players. You already know who is gonna win that fight. 
---
In reality, I don’t think it’s been that bad. However, I’ve spent 95% of the time leveling with my friend. When I leveled solo for a bit I *was* getting ganked and camped. So that may be a factor. 
---
I’m only level 53, so I’m a bit worried about heading to Blackrock mountain. But I honestly haven’t noticed too much complaining in chat. I think the main people complaining are trying to solo, which is just a terrible idea as alliance on a PvP server.
---
This is excellent. Ill do this on mob pulls and see how it works. 
---
For bosses, I just did two successful test runs in Scholo with the FA. The rotation that worked best was the following: Open with JoR and max rank Holy Shield &amp; Consecration. Keep SoR up until second judgement is available and then use JoW. Renew SoR, Holy Shield &amp; Consecration and keep them up until end of fights. Didn't went oom and bosses stuck to me.
---
Its funny how juvenile a pve carebear is
---
I feel like we’re leveling on the exact same path. Currently lvl 41 and just did this quest lol. Every time I see a new piece I say “hey I just did that!” Awesome work!
---
No, it got downvoted because Grizzly are a bunch of shitbirds. Don't feel sorry for them for ruining their server.
---
“Shitty people do shitty shit”, well said.
---
could that have anything to do with Hong Kong?

Sorry I should have clarified. I am a druid who pre HoT myself. I do it for threat. I was annoyed when someone told me that wasnt the case. I wanted clarity and i have recieved it. Thanks

[https://imgur.com/VRgoc2r](https://imgur.com/VRgoc2r) I like to use Bartender to arrange my bars to match my Naga thumb buttons. I use Alt, Shift, Ctrl to give more buttons and put the lesser used abilities on Ctrl or Shift.

Pallies are rolling on cloth too.
---
Realm transfers!?!? This isn't classic like.
---
our second raid team approved this theory correct last night. But I still have some question for the fireball, if no one share the fireball damage, what the threat would be then? Our MT got fireball and no one share the damage with him lead him disappear in the threat list, but when I got the fireball while no one share damage with me, the next fireball must be me too. Very strange.
---
The guild I join initially had 60 ish member. After the first month every left of became inactive. I gquit recently but it was sad.
---
How is that fun...
---
Humans have a bunch of useful racials why give them another
---
That guy deleted his comment lol
---
That was the craziest experience of WoW for me. Fully completed it probably 20 times and it was always fun
---
GROB MOB
---
I believe that the main problem here is that most people on the dominant side probably don't acknowledge the imbalance problem cause P2 isn't upon us and they haven't actually faced any real obstacle, so their attitude is dismissive.
---
On a 90-10 Horde server, if X is the number of alliance characters transferring out, we need 9X horde characters to transfer out **just to maintain the shitty server ratio**. To actually start fixing the imbalance the number of horde characters transferring out needs to be way bigger. Meanwhile, when you see someone complaining about the imbalance of their server, they are rarely on the dominant side. 9X won't happen, 3X won't happen, we're lucky if we even see the same number of transfers from each faction.
---
The free transfers should become available a week after P2 launches so people have the time to experience the severity of the problem
---
Mained a rogue from Vanilla-Wrath, also played it on private servers and it’s never felt worse than it does in Classic for a couple or reasons;
---
You’re unable to time your openers right before the energy tick because your opener might get batched after the energy tick instead.
---
Same goes with Adrenaline Rush, making it impossible to use it right before tick reliably.
---
Vanish isn’t always working even tho you are out of range from mobs they will still stay on you, you also can’t cancel stealth after using Vanish without it canceling both effects.
---
I'd be totally fine if it was narrowed down to a couple specific effects tbh. Make it just stuns/incapacitations or something. I just think giving any race a full, free pvp trinket is really unhealthy.
---
Private servers literally figured this out already. Simply don't allow character creations past a certain level of faction imbalance.
---
An easy way to accidentally make it fail is still having right click held down. Even if slight, changing direction cancels feign.
---
Where can we see server faction and population stats?
---
Mythic takes skill. You're just not very skillful but pretending you are. I'm not a retail apologist, I didn't even buy BFA. But obviously everyone calling out your bullshit has to be a 'retail apologist' lmao. You simply can't stand the fact that you were never good at the game, that's why you're getting so butthurt.
---
agreed, better to be on a dying server than have to change your name.
---
All the shit tier ally guilds form Skeram left for there too
---
Luna unit frames will accomplish this, great UI addon
---
Thats all it is, right?
---
I've always thought that when someone "steps out of line" in any of the ways you just described, the woman in the room isn't the distraction or problem. 
---
  She's existing in the room----- the reacting party is the one who can't control themselves.
---
Possibly, but quite a few people seem to be viewing classic as an opportunity to go back and complete stuff they missed out on last time, whether it's because they were too young and didn't properly understand how the game worked before, or because they had obligations with school etc that got in the way at the time.
---
There's a guy in my guild whose attitude is essentially "once I'm sitting on an Amani War Bear in full Sunwell Plateau gear, I'm done - because I will have achieved everything I wanted to back in the day".
---
I wouldn't say there even necessarily needs to be an endless stream of content that goes on forever. Even if Blizzard just did Vanilla and TBC in Classic, that's still a solid ~3 years of content, even if they speed up the patch timeline. That's much, much longer than almost anyone will end up playing most games - and if the private server community has shown anything, it's that the "fresh server" concept seems to appeal to quite a lot of people. I could totally see Blizzard releasing a fresh round of Vanilla servers several years down the line with a reset patch schedule for people to re-experience.
---
I wish I had made an Undead warrior instead of  Troll. Even though berserking is awesome for tanking, undead animations are just so good.
---
I don't regret making a warrior, I regret not making one sooner. I'll probably make an undead warrior as my dps/PvP alt.
---
I never set foot in STV, no reason to...
---
*sighs*
---
Apparently no one remembers what happened. 
---
Blizzard promised before launch that layers would not impact player cap on the server. Hence layers wouldn't have any impact on queue.
---
That decision was more or less forced to get walked back ~1 week after launch. At that point, they raised the player cap and added additional layers.
---
Layering itself wasn't going to cause issues, but people refusing to migrate servers and rampant complaints about long queue times made them break their promise about not overfilling server capacity.
---
Sadly no. The free transfers are offered to help increase low server populations and decrease high population ones. 
---
The original classic model was that you could not transfer at all.
---
Wrath started okeyish, although reusing Naxx was strange.  
---
But Ulduar definitely one of the best raids ever made.  
---
But then Wrath added LFG with instant teleportation into dungeons, Coliseum - most boring raid ever, and strange rotational PvP arena. Where in the end you could not even enter because of "balance".  
---
Ok, there was more boring raid - one that inside castle. Where they added wings, and it made huge difference between bosses and drops.  
---
Plus, in Wrath was added this "raid catch-up mechanic" with buff that increase everything. And flying was added from 74(?) and not 80.
---
Not as much as Shamans iirc. Shamans are so greedy with gear they barely use their own until they're raiding and have a couple tier pieces. Pallies aren't as greedy overall iirc.
---
Giving it to a lock in Phase 2 Ony is pretty legit. Pew pew.
---
&gt;and you can do the quests at 60 for gold
---
Cries in prot.
---
Nice generalization.  Wrong thread.
---
Blizzard won’t acknowledge faction imbalance, if they made transfers faction specific then people just won’t roll on those servers to begin with.
---
they be desperate for phase 2 without layering
---
We still doing clickbaity titles? I see..
---
Idk about you but I rolled horde because I decided to recreate my original main, an undead lock. I chose an undead lock originally because younger me thought it was cool, also I was originally on a pve server. This time I am on a pvp server though. I can't imagine every single horde on a pvp server choose horde because of pvp superiority
---
yeah in 3 more lvls you're an HK target to all 60s
---
It's pretty sick in PvP. PI + shatter combo=dead enemy.
---
&gt; People like to assume all kind of shit and presents it as facts, it's pathetic.
---
thats reddit for you :D
---
Tbh, not having cross faction battlegrounds would be the one reason to encourage people to balance servers.
---
Without that there's effectively none.
---
Y'all must not be tanking.
---
Nice! Keep at it dude, paladin tanking in dungeons is great.
---
They said that this was a joke, they definitely had girls on their team before
---
Never have I put anything else in there, what're you on about mate?
---
So on a 80 horde 20 alliance server with all these newly born elitists (yes, i mean you running around with sapper charges at lv40) camping every flightmaster night and day you don't want to give people an option to continue enjoying their character?
---
I know it's going to suck for open pvp players but with the amount of griefing and toxicity being around it's no wonder people want to leave.
---
It’s all you man! If pvp is your thing then I agree... the play style is a lot of fun. There are some great pve dagger specs as well if your into that kind of thing. May i recommend bone scraper dagger as a pretty solid off hand to start out with. Drops from baron in strat UD
---
Fuuuuck theeee huuumaaans
---
There's actually a tri-spec priest that's pretty sick. It gets the fun shadow tools, holy nova, and inner focus. I'll toss up a talent link if I remember later.
---
Nothing fancy or special really. Just a screenshot I took and happened to enjoy the lighting and general feeling of a proper dungeon crawl.
---
Sounds like the guild has a public recruitment policy if they put it that way.  
---
You got some, right there - no, other side.   Yea you got it.
---
They’re out of touch and have no idea what their customers want.
---
That's just anecdotal evidence. The only time I see alliance players engaging in pvp is why they out number you at least 2 to 1. I've had alliance run away from me cause I was going to fight them 1 on 1 only to come back and stomp me with two of their buddies and then they proceed to camp my corpse. The only people I see abusing the guard agro distance to kill people inside of neutral towns like Gadgetzan are always alliance. While leveling I would constantly get killed by groups of 60s while I was in Hillsbrad. The overall issue is a lot of people want PVP but don't ever want to lose. Hell when the census data first came out severs with like a 5-10% imbalance saw mass exodus because the vast majority of people do not want to be the underdog and would rather effortlessly stomp someones face in.
---
Sorry but that's straight up wrong. Combat swords is *easier* and less complex. It's not better. If you want to run right at mobs, pretend to be a warrior and spam SS then evis it's perfect.
---
But, I level with a hybrid across all three trees that works pretty amazing. 
---
I go down sub first to pick up faster stealth and better crits for ambush, then when I have prep I'll grab Remorseless Attacks before working down the Combat tree. Something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/3203-32030520205-0502520303001/1BAFGJ2Be0B2DeeeeHK1DM2ffp0AD) or if I'm leveling with a few people and doing more instances then a few more combat points to [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/02-32030520205501-0502520303001/1BAFGJ2Be0B2DeeeeHK1DM2ffp1Nq). 
---
Faster stealth means it's actually useful while leveling, meaning I bypass things I don't care about, get in position faster, and am overall more efficient. Improved Ambush combined with Remorseless Attacks means that most mobs have about a quarter health in the first few seconds, a quick gouge and backstab is usually the end of things. A cheapshot/backstab/kidneyshot is also a great option. Actually having utility and faster cooldowns (with twice as many of them) makes taking on tougher groups or tougher mobs solo a breeze.
---
I've leveled 4 rogues to max across vanilla and classic, I've tried every spec and option there is along the way.. my way is more involved and more complex but it's faster, more fun, gives more utility, has strong burst damage, more than enough DPS for dungeons, gives a massive advantage in PvP and is just overall better.
---
Now yes, if you want to maximise your damage as you spam instances to 60 while using three abilities.. go combat swords. If you want to *play a rogue* and level out in the world, there are so many better options.
---
Anyway, people can play how they please... but it just baffles me that people have this insistence on combat swords being the best leveling spec. I've tried it.. the extra damage over time was not worth losing the burst damage and utility you can pick up from other specs.
---
Just my view and I'm a damned good rogue.
---
Nobody, literally nobody would have subscribed to "Classic TBC" or "Classic Wotlk". Classic+ is the only way or they lose it.
---
Casuals don't concern themselves with this, they play the game without planning ahead and looking stuff up.
---
I'm on Fairbanks, should I take the transfer?
---
His target is the right hand side of his cooldown bar...
---
I prefer the concept of Classic+.
---
I started in late vanilla. I consider TBC and WotLK my "home" in WoW.
---
TBC introduced a number of mechanics that I believe caused lasting damage to WoW. The two most egregious are dungeon tokens and flying.
---
Flying caused zone design to suffer--expanding areas with lots of emptiness in order to provide more scale with less world worth seeing. Despite this it made the world feel smaller and less immersive because now you didn't exist in the world, you existed far above it while flying+autorunning+alt-tabing. It made the world less dangerous by completely nullifying above-ground enemy strongholds. The great tucked away pieces of the world like Demon Fall Canyon and the Shrine of the Fallen Warrior were traded in for large functionless vistas like the Tempest Keep ships because the designers knew players would be seeing them mostly from a thousand feet away and a thousand feet above ground.
---
And tokens were the beginning of the end of the dungeon experience. Everthing that's wrong with dungeon gameplay in retail--the unsocial aspect, the absolute minimal amount of effort required, the guaranteed loot serving as a participation trophy for all members of the party--that all started with the TBC token grind. Once tokens were in, then it became about how fast one could earn those tokens. We shouldn't do *that dungeon* because it takes twice as long for the same number of tokens. And we shouldn't do *this dungeon* because it takes too long to find a group. No, instead we should run the fastest, most repeatable, most efficient sources of tokens. Which, of course, then influenced future dungeon design. The players don't want long dungeons, obviously, so everything has to be 20 minutes long with no nuance at all. And the players don't want to spend all this time looking for groups so we should just automate it. And you know what, lets just get rid of travelling to the instance becausd its not fast and efficient enough. Everything needs to be fast, fast, fast; now, now, now. Because if you're not, then you're "losing" and you need to "get good" by embracing the least interesting parts of the game.
---
So if you ask me, do I want all that or do I want more of this open world DnD-esque adventure RPG that is Classic, I prefer the latter.
---
Tier gets swapped around, healing gear is the same for both anyways. Couple rando items like Deep Earth Spaulders shit happens.
---
&gt; Yeah, except players who put in the tiniest bit of research are already doing that.
---
That's tiny fraction of whole population, it won't change much.  
---
Opening "faction-specific" transfer is a big white flag over whole server, visible for everybody.
---
What he said, you really should start doing this in the early-mid 50s.
---
oh no when?
---
Fair point, I'll make sure to remember to ask before rolling on items in the future.
---
so it was an xperl/zperl problem?
---
&gt;players have leveled up and spread out around the world. This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer
---
Key part, they were only changing the layer capacity so that the server load stayed relatively constant. It's far harder to support 5000 players in one zone than it is in 20 zones, but we've been playing the game for months so those gains are long gone.
---
Players aren't spreading out any more, the server-load-per-player is relatively constant. It will likely even increase with players congregating in world pvp hubs.
---
What’s also impressive, is he had to go deep into that jaedenar tunnel to reach those succubi
---
Didn't change anything :/
---
what does DOA mean?
---
Amazing and skilled!
---
When I was done with ashenvale I just followed the quests to stonetalon, did some there and then followed the quests to desolace. The quest chains definitely help give clues about where to go next!
---
It's a double edged sword. I dont know how they're going to do it.
---
I just don’t think Horde would move to Heartseeker because nobody is willing to be the first to transfer. If you could do a pact with 1000 other people sure. But players aren’t gonna volunteer to trickle in.
---
Horde has a major accidental advantage: Dungeons. 
---
When the alliance team was done they ran out of time for the Horde team to work on their quests. 
---
The Horde team in stead worked on finishing their instanced zones which were all conveniently located in in horde Territory making them extremely easy to use instead of quests. 
---
The Horde is better geared and thus were typically much stronger in PvP simply by item level.
---
I haven't messed with it, but can't you make a R1 mind flay/cancel macro? Once you put up max rank SWP, you can't override it, so it could be situationally useful.
---
I mean you just agreed with me except switched the factions. Yes, some places have more alliance, I said horde because in general, the game is very horde dominated and even more so on PvP servers.
---
People who are on a dominant faction will not leave. People who can transfer away from the non dominant faction will do so. This is a problem caused by players and players will never fix it.
---
Basically we're going down the same road as vanilla that led to sharding/phasing and all of that. People might hate on blizzard for that being where the game went, but when players are given the chance to make things fun and fair themselves they never do.
---
Sorry, but alliance bugging out of a 60-40 server to create two 80-20 servers does not make horde who don't want to follow hypocrites. Horde would be transferring to servers in way worse condition than the original server that alliance fled
---
Hah, i was about to say.   That escalated quickly.
---
Hammer, is usually helped, it's upwards of 5 to 10k gold  the things you listed are only a few hundred. Guilds like yours probably help alot more. We are helping our shamans with mats as a guild but they are expected to also put work in same with thunderfury
---
They are not all layered, but they are servers that are almost always labeled as full or high pop during peak hours. 
---
As someone who plays on one of the servers being offered a free transfer away from I can assure you that "high" pop is still way too many people.  Every high level zone is full of people at all times ever since they took away our second layer, and the prices for anything you can't farm in a dungeon have skyrocketed, since there just realistically aren't enough resources to support every player now.
---
I was tempted to take a transfer last time they offered them, but there are several people in my guild desperately trying to level their new characters before phase 2 after transferring their mains to one of the newer servers and almost immediately regretting it.
---
There is no such rule that you have to only speak specific language in public chats. English server means support is provided in English and that’s it, people are free to talk any language they want in any chat.
---
Still don’t care
---
With the whole GUID Ony phase II agro trickery recently, what are the chances that when there is a tie role the oldest GUID wins?
---
You can't even 1v1 because every 15 seconds another horde runs by and is gonna join in.
---
It’s about awareness. Just like all the anti-blizzard bandwagon goers. My point was to shine light on bullshit that should be discussed.
---
It takes some doing to get good at it, but solo DM East Jump is doable SOLO as an Spriest. Yes, you read that right. Solo jump run. $$$
---
Many of us simply opted out of playing on those realms altogether because they were too horde heavy and there was no plan to deal with it.
---
You will never fix this by leaving servers at 65/35 and giving no incentive for the smaller faction to rebalance itself, in fact leaving it alone tends to magnify the imbalance.
---
Give me classic+ with Bloodelves please lol
---
If you’re dps, you do not need to go all out. Particularly while leveling. Part of your job is making sure you are not pulling off the tank. 
---
As a tank, if your dps is pulling off you, that’s on them. Not you.
---
That could explain mine bugging as well; I’ve resorted to using an addon but will give it a try. Thanks for the info
---
But it IS a slippery slope.
---
Really alliance heavy, P2 is gonna be brutal.. wish I could pvp worth a fuck on my hunter.. typically rolled a mage or rogue
---
The people playing on these servers already know that there are major faction imbalances from just playing on the servers.  
---
Who are the people that are going to look at the faction transfer options and NOT look at the Wowhead realm data or whatever (messageboards, discords, etc.) before rolling a character?
---
And again, non-faction-specific transfers have driven faction balance up tremendously more than the "big white flag" for faction-specific transfers would.  If they're not doing faction-specific transfers because they don't want to make the problem worse, doing non-faction-specific transfers doesn't make any sense, because it makes the problem WAY worse.
---
If you remember correctly? wat. Players are greedy as they are regardless of their class lol. Playing a shaman or paladin doesnt make you more or less "greedy", they both just use a multitude of gear types for PvE.   
---
People thinking the alliance are the go-to pvp faction for classic are either insanely casual, talking without merit, or simply don't understand what's happening lol.   
---
Nearly all of the top PvPers from retail are playing horde, and horde racials are arguably better for skirmish-style pvp, which is what most PvP is until AV is dropped. This is why Alliance are generally the winners in AV matches during vanilla WoW.  
---
The fact that the guy said "casual tryhards" is a testament to the empty air escaping his face. Alliance was only the dominate faction for PvP when they changed their "Perception" racial on humans to "Every man for himself".
---
Ret does its best damage in AQ40 and mid Naxx, but even then it's well behind warriors and mages, and slightly behind Warlocks and rogues. It does however pull ahead of the other hybred classes by a small amount. This is mostly due to getting gear with just insane overall itemization, mostly in AQ40, That just has more raw stats than other gear around.
---
You can heal as a paladin just fine with only 20 points in holy. One you have illumination everything else is gravy, so you can spec to holy shield to AoE farm in prot, or into
---
Ret for decent single target farming and PvP.
---
Two replies on the same post. Seething
---
And here we go again.
---
 That is a grand ol' dogwhistle of the sexist kind if I ever heard one.
---
Some of the best leaders I've ever had, gaming or work, were also women.  Because of a tendency to communicate more effectively and be more mature than men.    
---
We have been asking for classic for 10+ years. We got it and now sub count growth is higher then its has ever been in record.
---
In some instances where there is a lot of non elites the holy nova is useful for helping with DPS and at the same time healing people taking damage. Stratholme comes to mind. BRD near Golem, angerforge adds, and countless other situations . It's terribly mana inefficient so I use it sparingly.
---
These are all the reasons I enjoy pvp servers. I dont need the entire world to be a safe space. What's the point of opposing factions if they aren't a danger?
---
But still not mad enough to make a YouTube vid whining .
---
Baiting will unfortunately get you killed quite often in Classic. Spell batching means that you can fake cast, cast an instant, then get locked out from a whiffed interrupt. Feels really, really bad.
---
«Awareness» because people are not aware sexism exist? This is as stupid as the breast cancer awareness crap
---
All dps should hold dmg to no rip aggro or use threat reduction moves if need be. Tanks should hold aggro reasonably unless the group is ripping aggro doing too much. All members should join in for decurse/despell/interrupt assistance when they can. My guess is maybe find a group of players who are willing to help you out learning the ropes. Don't be afraid to read guides to help where you need to
---
Does anyone remember SWTORs launch? It didnt have a LFD that ported to the instance and people bitched and moaned. They wanted to go
---
Agreed
---
I think the reason that palla is miles better than shaman in organised pvp is because in such an environment you get nuked super hard by focus fire. Especially in end-game gear where dps is scaling like crazy while healing/hp not so much, healers can get out-globaled really easy. So paladins with bubble can actually cast some spells in that small timeframe which is more than enough to win those short bursty battles.
---
Also, many high-end pvp guilds are Alliance not only because of paladins but also for gnome racial which is craazy good because as a warrior or rogue with high-end gear and in organised team  you only care to connect for a few more seconds. Not to mention nieche tactical situations in BGs where NE and Dwarf racials can straight up win you the game. Thing is, alliance racials are in general more powerful in organised BGs.
---
As an enhance bro who is currently raiding, the need for MP5 gear isn’t really there for this phase. I can comfortably shock, totem twist and side heal without it, but I rely heavily on mana pots and dark runes.  Most boss fights in MC typically are not longer than 2-3 minutes.
---
Ideally equilibrium should be the goal. (My opinion) this could easily be achieved by a simple algorithm:
---
Open up transfers for 24 hours at a time, do this by setting up a sorted list with A/(A+H). When that value is greater than 0.6 or less than 0.4 transfers become available. 
---
Value&gt;0.6 allow alliance to move to severs with &lt;0.4,  while at the same time allowing servers with value&lt;0.4 to transfer horde to the server with &gt;.0.6.  or simply sort the servers by that value and allow alliance to move down the gradient and horde to move up. There are so many possibilities that all work better than their bullshit lazy options.
---
No, but thanks for the advice.
---
or a guy who lost the ability to tolerate stupidity.
---
They can also be killed without a tank holding them, as their abilities are long, easy to stop, and bypass armor in most cases.
---
Because they’re in the EU and typically have balancing buffs to Ret Paladins and Feral Druids giving the Alliance a better choice of raid and party load outs compare to the horde.
---
Queues are going back to 10k, anyone paying attention to Blizzard's botched server management from day 1 of the name reservation day could have seen this coming.
---
Gear is pretty much everything in classic PvP
---
thursday, they pushed it back to the 14th (which is weird but whatever)
---
Thank you! Her name is Kasey.
---
No their first mistake was going to comment.
---
kaplan? "mirror matches are my favorite" kaplan? yikes.
---
It's about mobilizing a hate mob to harass them or forcing blizzard to ban their guild for discrimination. You're not just raising awareness for the sake of raising awareness you're doing it so that something happens.
---
&gt; I thought the point of dps is to do as much damage as possible and finish the dungeon as quick as possible
---
DPS classes need to manage their threat so they don't peel aggro off the tank. If you have a bad healer who tries to keep both you and the tank topped up, they'll run out of mana and have to stop to drink. If they let you die because you pulled aggro, then you're running back as Mr. Ghost while the team moves on.  Neither is ideal for finishing quickly.
---
&gt; Just heal me so I can spam my abilities and we can finish quicker.
---
You are there to support the tank. He's the center of the group, everything should revolve around him. If he goes, you all wipe. You're a healer's last priority. So the trick is to manage your threat.
---
&gt; I do too much damage I’m playing the game wrong, I don’t get enough threat I’m playing the game wrong. How come it’s never someone else’s fault?
---
Because in both those cases, it's your fault. The tank needs to be all about holding aggro. DPS needs to manage threat so as not to pull aggro off the tank.  It's a balancing act.
---
Try playing a Warlock. You'll learn real quick how to manage your threat while also being a DPS class.
---
Yea but the horde players in Heartseeker don't get to have the same choice of bailing from an imbalanced server and are only going to face even worse odds
---
DPS warriors unloading into melee mobs instead of caster mobs at the start of the pull is one of the major tank annoyances
---
32/19 smite spec is actually pretty strong. You'll likely lose to melee at 60, but you eat most casters with mana burn. And god help people who ignore you and let you spam smite. I've got 20% smite crit chance on my priest.
---
Just ignore them and find a new guild. They are allowed to be dicks if they want to.
---
I keep taunting my mt that I’m gonna keep thunderfury for myself.. im a rogue... obviously I’ll never do that but its fun to mess with him. Im the gm/loot master.
---
shes never scratched it once. Probably just jinxed myself tho.
---
Same problem on EU Shazzrah
---
Priceless
---
Lol doubt well have naxx by june 2021
---
There are kill squads roaming the higher zones. Good luck brother. I'm 52 and not looking forward to p2
---
Crazy how people don't like you because your a dickbag
---
So just some quick tips since it’s hard to judge your gameplay from a post
---
1. Focus the NPC your tank is focusing, don’t just assume your tank can hold aggro on everything. 
---
2. When the Tank pulls, give him a few seconds to actually build up aggro. You can’t attack at the same time a tank attacks and expect not to steal aggro
---
3. As for your dps “stealing aggro” from you when you tank, are you ensuring you’re using your proper abilities? Sunder armor gives a lot of threat as well as your actually Taunt spell. 
---
4. Ensure that your dps abide by the same wait period you do. 
---
Believe it or not, most people feel entitled to bash on others who maybe aren’t as knowledgeable to the game just because they watched some YouTube creator say something or because they’ve played for 10 years and still haven’t mastered basic game mechanics. Be kind to everyone and hopefully Karma rewards you well. Good luck!
---
Ha! Brilliant, just finished this quest a couple of hours ago, damn it took a while :)
---
The issue is that in the guild there are 15 years old unstable teenage guys falling in love or whatever starting drama we never had this rule in my retail guild, but we have had this happen like 5 times and had to deal with it, so while it is sexist and stupid I can understand the guild leadership who want to spare themselves dealing with that shit.
---
Oh, it's been changed by now
---
It's already a prison cause there are no paid transfers (yet). Offering a chance for horde to tranfer off doesn't suddenly make it a prison for alliance.
---
Wouldn't be Classic 😂
---
The only rare thing here is having your toolbar on the side.
---
You can stop posting this.
---
I personally drop 2 points in mental agility, go imp mana burn + force of will. Imp mana burn is a must have, imo. FoW vs Inner Fire is more of a personal choice.
---
You NEED to hold your damage. Dps doesn’t mean being an idiot and going balls deep. You will die that way, and it will be 100% you’re fault. Focus the target the tank is attacking, and download a threat meter so you know if you’re doing your job. 99% of end game content for dps is making sure they do just enough damage to kill shit fast, but not so much that they pull agro and cause a wipe.
---
Your threshold for insanity is pretty low. You should reassess your shit.
---
And yes, those are your options. Ain't it fun?
---
I think it’s because our biggest guilds are wpvp focused and the biggest guild on horde (final boss I think) is pve focused. It seems like you guys are starting to coordinate with other guilds for large scale wpvp and I’m loving it! But I think population wise it’s pretty close to 50/50. I see a lot of horde when I’m out in the world and I’m sure you see a lot of alliance.
---
Modern WoW can eat my shorts
---
I have a 20 Frost resist ring in my bank right now I'm saving for Naxx
---
too late damage is done
---
Ironically, Faerlina feels pretty good as Alliance. The server most people were circle-jerking crapping all over when Classic was launching due to the mentality of "streamers are going to ruin the server". Turns out they didn't and the small events they influence are actually pretty fun (I'm not even in a streamer guild on Alliance).
---
TBC brought a ton of excellent things to the game ... but it also brought a lot of bad. If we could cherry-pick the good and exclude the bad, it would probably work out a lot better in the end.
---
(Just look at RuneScape and Old School RuneScape - they did the same exact thing while also introducing amazing unique content.)
---
Hands OP a dress...
---
For many Alliance players 60/40 is the most ideal because they enjoy being the underdogs. But there's a difference from being an underdog with a chance to fight to just be 5 to 1 unplayable odds.
---
Yeah you are going to get picked on for sure.  Excited for my alt to hit 48 lol.
---
rofl
---
now this is quality content!
---
Quit virtue signalling on reddit. Nobody cares about you or your stupid friend. Move on
---
That's true but I really enjoy the idea of a fight being able to break out whenever, I just wish it was fair fights. I have a horde character on the same server and it's not fun because you know you're always going to win fights
---
Classic+ I think would work best as continual content updates. No 2.0 essentially. No expansion pack to buy but just continued subscription.
---
&gt;* Guards will now correctly be more willing to assist players in PvP combat who have Friendly or higher standing with them. However, they will continue to not assist players with Neutral standing.
---
&gt;* Corrected an issue that was causing Onyxia to fail to clear the threat of the primary target of her Fireball ability.
---
I almost transferred with a few friends but made a level 1 and ran to Org. Shit was so dead. Why would they even try and move us there?
---
Sad part is now we are in a alliance heavy server lol, no regrets tho! Better than getting ganked every 20 mins.
---
As long as all of the skins can be earned through in-game effort, go for it.  If I'm paying a subscription to a game, 100% of the game's content **needs** to be available as part of that subscription.
---
So is cocaine.
---
I recently switched to herb for the same thing. I leveled to 270 herb and leveled to 300 in dme
---
why not just kick the people causing the drama instead of excluding the victim
---
A bunch of mages complaining about grouping up in the hundreds to cast aoe  spells. It's a joke. It doesn't take skill. The victor is random and most of the population doesn't partake in this. So tired of the 50 posts a day about it.
---
I am 49 and feel this, especially since I am about to hit ungoro
---
I’d like to see them continue it as content patches. 1.14, 1.15, etc. not as expansions.
---
Herbs mostly, farmed a few eye of shadow got like 2k from those alone.
---
that was just my annoyed quick answer. Honestly I think people need to grow thicker skin, use your brain a little more, and if your getting ganked a lot in a particular spot then call in some friends or take a little break.
---
as horde on heartseeker, its true.
---
Which pvp servers have underpopulated horde in each time zone?
---
Honestly, I'm in.   💯
---
Dog breeders try to make sure they socialize young pups with humans, male and female and dogs male and female to prevent violent and unexpected behavior when the animals get older and will experience life in uncontrolled environments.
---
A 15 year old can't be taught how to control their behavior?
---
Forcing pvp players to raid seems super healthy...
---
Maybe to be able to also send all lockboxes to it for lockpicking.
---
Swapping in and out of shadow form destroys your mana bar. As shadow, I often find myself in situations where swapping out to heal a teammate is advantageous. I've been meaning to mess with tri-spec for this reason, but haven't gotten around to it.
---
My guild does a one soft reserve then any un reserved items get mainspec rolled on
---
Gryphon rides from Feralas to Darnassus gives you a good amount of time to get a pump in.
---
You can clearly see who logged more hours ingame lol :)
---
Go to heartseeker, tons of alliance
---
On a side note, I never actually understood why we killed those elite dragons on the horde attunement quest chain. We fooled Emberstrife and he gave us a quest to kill some dragons; weren't those dragons essentially "good"? Why do we kill them instead of looking for a workaround? This really bugged me
---
Westfall is about 80% alliance. It'd be nice if we could get a Horde transfer ***to*** it
---
&gt; Corrected an issue that was causing Onyxia to fail to clear the threat of the primary target of her Fireball ability.
---
RIP that discovery.
---
I'm horde on heartseeker as well and finding groups is a toss up.  sometimes instant, sometimes takes so long you just give up.
---
A dirty thief at least
---
Explains how Onyxia threat works once and for all.
---
1. I think you're overstating how much money they poured into it. It was a small team relatively speaking. 
---
2. The main money to be made was already made. Not many people will jump on board when Classic+ comes out that aren't already playing classic.
---
Their initial investment of time and resources got it's biggest payoff already. They're not going to spend even more resources than that building brand new content when it will hardly increase the player base. 
---
If they do make a classic plus it will have to be as an expansion that is sold, just like they'll probably make people pay for TBC+ if it comes out. I bet TBC+ would bring in more subscribers than Classic+ even because so many people consider TBC the best version.
---
Like what? Once you've gotten your preraid BiS, epic mount and gold to last you through the different raid tiers I don't really see much incentive to log in outside of the two hours you spend raiding each week.
---
Trust me I'm trying. I've turned to fishing for worst case scenario if I have to buy one. I'm also raid team 2 and there is another half that my guild mates seems to be working on for raid team 1. Though he declined me tagging along to try and farm one 😳
---
Aww I love your birb
---
Have you not seen the girl remina from olympus that cried about not getting an epic her very first raid and ended up leaving for seven? BTW look at her logs, she sucks. 99% of women are carried garbage gamers. But man oh man those 1% god tier gaming unicorn buttterflies... \*drools\* take my gold
---
There's also the design philosophy of Molten Core that quite honestly doesn't need 40 people at all to complete. You're given sort of a difficulty slider on your own of how hard you want to make the raid given your raid size. It's entirely possible to clear MC with 30, even 20 people if they were geared. This gives you a lot more flexibility in your raid team whereas in current raids, losing even 1 dps is an INSANE gap.
---
i dont get it, just seems like he thanked the guy for an error
---
The real problem with world PvP is that most people don't actually want a fair fight. Sure some do, but most of the time people want to go in knowing that they'll be coming out on top.
---
It's why you'll so often see a player from another faction wave at you... then attack when you're at 5% HP, or when 2 of their friends show up, etc. They never wanted to fight you, they wanted to kill you.
---
I stand corrected
---
Heartseeker is 7:3 alliance dominated. It's impossible to find groups for horde PvE and it's a high pop realm.
---
I'd like them to continue doing phases but to scale everything to level 60. Make new points talents really hard world quests.
---
As a healy priest do I need a tank? Or can I just heal the F out of a rogue?
---
I agreed up until the part that said that Alliance are soft for not wanting to deal with a 60.40 faction imbalance. 60/40 is a massive fucking imbalance at these population numbers, and renders solo play nearly impossible past level 30-35.
---
I would like 25mans too but that's just me
---
just  for farming DM E, or easy pulls helping with AOE, like in Lyceum BRD
---
Furthermore find guildmates through running dungeons and join the people you get paired with more often. Not the ones advertising or sending out random invites.
---
I'm trying to figure out what the point of that would be. I suppose if you flew manually in a straight path you'll be faster than the weird whirly twirly flight paths that exist now and save some time? 
---
I can't see myself spending a lot of gold on a flying mount if that's the only benefit tbh
---
This is a low life comment. Breast cancer awareness brings mad money toward helping people. So does sexism awareness, how do you think women got the right to vote? Protesting and making people aware it was wrong. Wtf is wrong with you?
---
I literally typed out like 7 comments and deleted them before I realized the best course of action was to downvote. This was my chosen comment
---
Honestly, its about balance. I posted something recently about pulling aggro off of tank with my warlock dps abilities and the consensus was pretty clear, i need to pull back on my spamming of dots. Yes, i was top damage dealer in virtually every encounter, and had the best dps, but we also kept having issues and I realized that while it feels good do top damage, thats not what is needed of me as dps. Everyone has a role in the fight and everyone wins when those roles are properly filled. More importantly, knowing your proper role means less overall chaos and less "oh shit!" Moments. Your job as dps is to balance damage and aggro while the tank soaks up the damage and keeps the mob busy and off you while you pummel it. Yeah, the mob might die faster if you do max damage every time, but that is negated completely if things go wrong and everyone has to scramble,  which usually results in more chaos.  Slow and steady is key.
---
Do people not read what it tells you before you submit a post? Using your title as a poll is a violation of intergalactic law.
---
Before DM sure, but right now you can get a way better trinket from a book that cost ~5g from AH and not piss off melee classes.
---
Pay them gold.
---
15 years ago peoole were saying the same thing.  Now WoW has hit record numbers of subs by re-releasing the same game they did back then.   By the time WoW dies, we'd all be dead anyway.
---
I’ve see grown men cry like little girls about not getting loot. Check online, this isn’t a valid argument.
---
You must be on the rp-pvp server, every other server is horribly unbalanced
---
This is the best one lmfao
---
Free realm transfer doesn't sound very blizzlike
---
 Which pserver is this??
---
Reason: Dragon.    Alive.   Has loot.
---
Great comment right here!
---
Hahaha yeah the double Mount pic gives that one away the most :P plus I got her the mats for her vestments, hide, etc.
---
This article is a good example why I never care what people say about something. I feel many are unknowingly justified to like/dislike something just because someone else does. If I like it, great. If not, oh well. I dont see how that should affect someone else or if I should be affected if it was vice versa. People like to predict the worse - so they can be *right*. Its the "I told you so" attitude that is psuedo toxic. Self fulfilling prophecies and all that shit.
---
Thanks for the tip! Now let's see if I can find some help 😅
---
F
---
That’s fine. I just wanted to have a civil discussion about it, but it seems impossible on this testosterone filled sub.
---
Just reroll alliance and *help* the problem, don't just make it worse on another server.
---
Leave out draenie and blood elves also.  Pallies stay alliance, shaman stay horde.  Don't have the blood elf racial/paladins making horde imbalance on pvp servers even worse.
---
60/40 isn't ideal, but it's pretty close to reality when you look across all servers, and it's a damn sight better than 80/20 or worse that many servers are now or will be next week.  And really, when you spread 60/40 across the whole realm, its not *that* bad.
---
see how your addon is recommending that you also post yours for less than 50s? they're using an addon as well and then they don't look at the vendor price
---
Sure did. I tottally remember this. They also faction locked people from transfers in.
---
not sure, but i'd like a permanent solution to change the camera height of my dwarf
---
You're welcome on Incendius alliance.
---
Yes you can do this and this can perfectly be your opinion. It's stupid, but it's possible
---
I get you, but there are gonna be people like that in the game and in this sub. It’s just easier to ignore the assholes and move on.
---
True, like Malganis and Illidan, where only 1 in 10 max levels are alliance.
---
How about you just don't be so insecure, because of people behaving stupid?
---
It's actually the men in that guild who are the ones to blame for being distracted by a female. Maybe for the lack of female interaction in their lives??
---
Until recently we weren’t in the same guild. Every one of our priests except her have Bene now, so hopefully with the Timezone difference she can make our MC runs :)
---
Don't even need a tank if you have a lock. Or just a lot more dps
---
Haha mobile
---
Come to heartseeker, we need you horde side!
---
renew into pw:s is a waste. use a flash heal instead it still has a better heal/mana ratio than shield.
---
Oh well then enjoy your desolate server, glad you can get pvp somehow, itll certainly be the only way 👋
---
Golemagg is full of Spanish speaking people
---
idk wtf you're smoking but bloodseeker is not better or even close to rhok delar
---
Yes he did. that's the joke.
---
the only "help" from blizzard was adding Arugal which they forgot, when the Arugal community is already in a crisis state due to previous server transfers
---
https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html
---
That was my biggest issue. Demeaning women. I can’t believe all the asshole comments on here. It would have been different if the guy said “it’s a boys club, no girls allowed.”
---
How do you level?  Do you *just* do dungeons?
---
Honestly holy nova is great for helping a lower lvl friend level. Running them through WC for example. In day to day use, not so high.
---
Yep, mage and priest :) we were levelling together originally but she met some awesome casual players and... as you can see... I sort of went ham :P honestly I’m definitely PvP oriented but we’re on a PvE server so she didn’t get killed while levelling, etc.
---
...we already played a lot of Rust together, no thank you :P
---
ik but the imbalance is *way* too fucked  
---
i know i could be part of the solution but ugh
---
I've seen 250-700g

I’ve done it for every game we’ve played together :) even little games like Stardew Valley
---
&gt; The retail WoW storyline has gotten so ridiculous I don't even know where to start.
---
That's fitting, sincethe retail writers don't know where to stop.
---
Yes
---
That’s my thought. Definitely a lot of virgins in the game and on this subreddit.
---
That would lead to a lot of bad will towards the devs. People would complain they were forced into playing something they didn't want to. Some just might not have played at all. People like to feel they are in control, and forcing them to do something often leads to more bad than good.
---
Rip no changes right boys ?
---
(X) Doubt
---
What karma? I’ve lost more Karma from this post then I have since first making my reddit account. I could delete the post anytime, but it’s still up.
---
Cool
---
Ignite isn’t going to be pushed off, all the Mages ignites stack into a super ignite
---
Me
---
Generally for big CDs: evasion, sprint, vanish, blind, CB. Not too many instances you’ll use prep solely to get a second use of just one of them. Most appropriate time would maybe be a prep vanish. You can make a macro to use sprint and evasion right before you use prep so that you get some benefit from them rather than just wasting them.
---
So do we still stack up or no?
---
Wotlk added a new class and a bunch of features that started changing the feel of the game including dungeon finder and cross realms and class homogenization. I enjoyed WotLK but it certainly had a different feel the TBC.
---
STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPED
---
I just rolled alliance on heartseeker. Was that a mistake?? Does anyone have any insight as to what the faction balance is like on heartseeker? Or have any suggestions for 50/50 servers to start fresh on?
---
God I hate you people. You’re part of the problem.
---
Look at the hands of the orc
---
You are part of the problem.
---
You people? That is hate speech. Reported.
---
Please do, I do hate you allis are cowards
---
Where’d you get “posting in lfg” from...
---
how can you say that 25 man raiding led to multiple difficulties, lfr, homogenisation of classes/gear and the simplification of talents when none of those things were present in tbc? the only thing you're right about is that 25 man raiding meant more individual responsibility and that you couldnt have as many lazy noobs  riding off the efforts of others
---
This is my wife and I. Same situation.
---
Worth it
---
Just because one guy on the internet doesn't get it doesn't mean it can't be done.
---
Disagree. We moved to Heartseeker from Stalagg as a whole horde guild because stomping 5v1 is shitty and p2/p3 will suffer because of it. 
---
We're outnumbered as fuck right now, but p3 will be amazing. P2 will require roaming death raids rather than bunkering down and holding an area to avoid getting mobbed, sure. But it's totally doable. 
---
If maybe 3-4 solid horde guilds transferred to Heartseeker and the alliance just stayed the fuck away it'd be perfect. I'd love a 70/30 or 60/40 Alliance : Horde ratio.
---
I think it’s worth 500g. Save it.
---
Ignore them. 1st rogue opens at gets aggro and pops evasion, health pot if needed, then when low health use feint to drop aggro or sprint away if it doesn't work, 2nd rogue should get aggro and then pop evasion and health pot, then when the boss is dead loot him and then both rogues vanish to drop all the adds.
---
Helps if your combat and can pop BF and AR to burst him down.
---
Our Orange Arrows will blot out the sun.
---
Wintersaber was a great excuse for us to binge watch Brooklyn Nine Nine together :P but in-game during this time, she was still finishing the level 60 grind :)
---
thanks, priest is a good class u can build it a lot of ways its a lot of fun
---
The "LF" at the begining of your message. 
---
And your missing the point dickbag
---
Read your healer and make then make that call. Not just for your repair bill’s sake but potentially everybody’s. And as already mentioned, a little communication goes a long way; most certainly further than without it. Your threat will be amazing indeed.
---
Man wtf should I do at this point then?  I'm horde on Stalagg and have only reached 26 (clearly extremely casual).  I'm obviously not worried about getting rank 14 or anything close to that, but I would like to atleast be able to pvp once I reach 60. 
---
  Should I stick with it and wait for the realm to inevitably become a pve server, transfer the toon and deal with a shit ton of Alliance players, or start over on a realm with a healthy balance?
---
      Idk, I hate the idea of being part of a super majority faction. I'd transfer. I want to pvp, that's why I rolled on a pvp server. 
---
      This whole thing could be solved by creating a gradient of servers based on A/(A+H).  So on the top of the list you'd have the most alliance heavy server and at the bottom of the list you'd have the most horde dominated server. 
---
     Open transfers for 24 hours at a time once a week, so changes are controlled. Alliance from the top of the list could transfer to servers on the bottom of the list, and horde from the bottom could move to the top.  Over time this would right or at least lessen the imbalances. Once people start to trust the system they would be more willing to transfer. Boom problem solved.
---
That doesn't negate the fact that until now Blizzard was increasing layer size in order to reduce the number of layers.
---
Level squish, removal of the AP/Azerite system I assume.
---
Those were far from the worst grinds in TBC.
---
Buy a tank his epic mount. Then he'll tank everything for you.
---
None of what you said means retail is harder than classic. That's the point you've willfully been dodging.
---
&gt;Maybe you’re super good in retail! Congrats man! But also maybe your reading comprehension is terrible or you’re being purposefully dishonest :/
---
I don't even play retail, you would have easily understood that when I said I didn't buy BFA. Seems like you're the one whose reading comprehension is terrible. Maybe you should stop projecting your own faults.
---
you're still part of a team in arenas though, the difference is you're competing against players instead of killing rag for the 100th time because someone in your team needs onslaught
---
ADHD Generation. I'm guilty of it too. Leveling always sucked.
---
Literally unplayable from 100 people get the fuck out of here... I regularly encounter 2-3 raid groups trying to get into mc at the same time, easily 120 people PvPing without any noticable lag. When you get up to 100v100, 200v200 or 400v400 like you will see with world bosses it absolutely is a problem but servers can easily handle 100 people in a single zone let's not lie and make it out to be worse then it is.
---
All wrong. Fuck holy shield it's only good on single target where it's already not good. I'd try this on a non demon or undead boss like emp: 
---
1. Open with range pull (JoC, iron grenade)
---
2. Apply seal, hit melee 2 times and MAX rank consecrate and keep swinging 
---
3. If it's a small pull tell your DPS to get going. 
---
4. If you really don't want to lose threat wait out the entirety of multiple consecrates 
---
I had my rogue friend dps a baron fight and all did was wait the full 8s duration of 3 max rank consecrations. He has felstriker and didn't pull. People usually don't listen to "wait for two consecrates" so generally I say "I'll tell you when to DPS" if they seem nice or "if you attack before I tell you I'm pulling the room and bubble hearthing to IF"
---
Holy shield is only really worth it for the mitigation, I'd use a lower rank version just to help healers. Or in a fight against a heavy hitting boss which will get definitely proc the 4 charges in the time. 
---
Let me know if this doesn't make sense I'd help in a pm in a better way if you need.
---
Fun fact: I am a lawyer and I occasionally research disability case law. You'd be amazed at the number of reported cases mentioning inability to find gainful employment because of total disability yet they manage to play WoW all day. (Disability / Administrative Law Judges love reading that an applicant is good at WoW but somehow is too disabled to work.)
---
Only indirectly. They were holding total server load constant which had the effect of dropping the amount of layers in lockstep with load-per-player dropping.
---
I love tbc to much. I need to relive that experience.
---
Psst...its The Onion.
---
Yes to more effort more reward, I have no problem with that. But I would rather have the option to do that effort all at once when I have time available instead of turning it into a daily exercise limited in when I can do it.
---
Stalagg alliance here. I essentially can only level when the infinite sea of horde graciously let me level. But they do not. They 3v1 gank me while I'm fighting quest mobs every time.
---
yeah that's what i want to do but blizz released classic instead of tbc, so we're having a discussion about what should come after classic
---
Hmm, I've gotten that excuse before, RIP your relationship.
---
It'll tire out. For sure.
---
Yes that’s the understanding I had, until I told people I will be going as dps not tank when people told me “bUt FuRy TaNk Is As GoOd As ArMs”, then I tried to go fury tank and people were like “fury tanks are useless, and we want a real tank for our group”. So it just seems like what ever I do people gonna have a problem with it.
---
And a guild loses 1/8th of their members? Won't happen.
---
Yeah even blackstone at 50 isnt gonna get replaced until the MC ring or painweaver.
---
52+ you might as well farm your BiS and let exp be a byproduct.
---
No.
---
Wow! Amazing art. Wish it could be my wallpaper.
---
Wait our planet will have it's own barrens? Is this an official wow 2 release date?
---
Good advice, I will keep it in mind.
---
pm'd
---
As Alliance it sells very well, up to 700g.   
---
As Horde, you are lucky to get 300g.
---
That might have been the problem, our healer was shadow spec. But I will from now on.
---
Pussy
---
It does look cool but they are not exceptional. As tank you can easily farm ubrs and call it a day. It can go very high for right buyer but most tank can't afford it
---
They've seemingly realized that and fixed the problem. Nihilum did the same back in the day.
---
I restarted game but bow skills are not working.
---
&gt; When you get up to 100v100, 200v200 or 400v400 like you will see with world bosses it absolutely is a problem but servers can easily handle 100 people in a single zone let's not lie and make it out to be worse then it is.
---
Well that's my experience. I'm 100% positive that it was literally only my raid + alliance raid + some randoms wanting to go UBRS there at the time. 
---
For sure not 100v100 atleast.
---
With that said there might have been a lot of people outside blackrock mountain or questing or something similar but we were definitely not more than 100 inside.
---
Best way to find guilds is just to pug and meet people you like
---
Not doing WoW Classic was originally the "safe obvious play" promoted by Blizzard big honchos.
---
Personally I'm fine with any server between like 60-40 to 40-60. I think joining anything more extreme is a detriment to your own experience, even if you are on the "advantaged" side.
---
I mean they did free character transfers before dire Maul launch during “original classic”. Eventually allowing paid character transfers during “original classic”.
---
That's the point, casuals can't do any of that, they can only play a bad garbage version of the game. In other words, its bad for casuals, unless they dont understand anything and they are fine with performing terribly and losing. If that is true, then every game is good for them yay.
---
80% duneons
---
Good question. It’s super viable at low level, but not sure when that stops being the case.
---
Maybe something like lvl 10
---
This is why I say:
---
#DON'T CAMP LOWBIE AREAS
---
If you make life miserable to level, people will just leave. I'm on an RP server I kill elves on sight due to RP, but I kill them *ONCE* if they are grey to me, then I move on.
---
And I don't go "hunting". If i see one because I'm passing through, oh well, die. But I don't to go hillsbrad to shit rock level 20s as a 60. It's a bad investment of my time.
---
Are you saying all the opposing faction would have to do is recruit some lowbies to run into some active AoE to mess up their rankings?
---
Yup definitely some basicaly-game-theory at work
---
literally every pvp realm is dominated by horde. this is going to be a shit show.
---
That doesn't make sense. They want to develop and support that game that will make them the most money - which is seemingly Classic at the moment.
---
The shield specialization adds rage every time I block, improved revenge adds stuns which reduce incoming damage, one hand specialization should increase rate generation from damage, imp shield block allows me to have shield block stop 2 hits every 5 seconds and avoid crushing blows

This is the vedio i just uploaded on youtube that showing it's not working
---
Blizzard absolutely does not use cloud computing for their servers. 
---
Generally cloud computing is for scientific or business computations that need raw throughput, not for latency dependent tasks.
---
Everything I explained in my previous post is exactly the case. I work at a  major game publisher and this is what we do.
---
I have enough arrows in arrow bag
---
falls off before 40
---
It still doesnt belong on reddit.......
---
I also like the idea of adding heroic dungeons for lower level players like heroic deadmines at lvl 30 vs the lvl 18 norm. Boosting the med game as well as end game to entice new players and people rolling alts. I really did like the look of TBC outlands tho. The big floating rocks and giant mushrooms were all so awesome when I first got to lvl through there.
---
Oof forgot to censor his name in one spot :D
---
Paladin's are THAT strong???
---
Reason?
---
You have it backwards. They were dropping the amount of layers which had the effect of keeping server load (relatively) stable. (although it's not super stable judging from large scale pvp events)
---
So you couple the solutions together.  
---
Step 1 - Limit queues by faction.  If the max realm pop is 6k that means 3k Alliance and 3k Horde can be logged in.  
---
Step 2 - Open up realm transfers for the dominant faction.  
---
Now the dominant faction will actually want to transfer because they are sitting in queues.
---
There is a corporate agenda to program literally all of us, with each strange/confusing/questionable move they make. I know that sounds like fear mongering insanity, but one day, the corruption will be exposed. They legit want us to be frustrated. It’s a cycle they put an audience through, and it guarantees the audience comes back for more. It’s all calculated. Think of how smart and capable blizzard is, and yet this shit happens over and over.
---
its about the value applied.  if everyone already has the buff, you did nothing but refresh the timer.  nothing was added, so no value.
---
No they wont lol, we have a live example skeram/heartseeker it was 60/40 at launch, ally got overcamped, moved to heartseeker that is now 80/20 ally favored. But No fucking horde are moving, so dont say bullshit that ur faction would totally go 80vs20 when they obv wont
---
Did I not make it in a civil manner when I explained to the poster that what he seeks is in retail? How is it gate-keeping as well? Grinding rank 14 isnt easy by any means, stating facts, by telling them so and that retail has *literally* what they seek, is not being uncivilized. Again, you are really reaching to try and find a "reason" to remove my post, just admit you cant handle power. Have a good one.
---
Is Herod heavily slanted towards horde? Is there a way to know the alli/horde ratio of each server?
---
What are you doing exactly?  Just hopping down and farming lashers using what spells?
---
...is this a copypasta?
---
I would love a classic + with the new Karazhan and stuff. never TBC
---
yeah, it's an old game but a lot of players ( including me ) did it all wrong the whole time lol. 
---
Heroic strike costs 15 rage + the rage of the next swing (≃ 25 rage total ) just for a minor damage boost on 1 hit. That makes this spell nearly useless at low levels , even more if you play with a 2 handed weapon. 
---
You can bring it back in your rotation at higher levels when rage generation isn't a problem anymore, but for now it's better to stack sunder
---
Hunter, specced 20/0/31. It's really fun to have a rogue jump on me and then realize they've made a terrible mistake
---
I'm not completely sure, but if you don't specify a rank in your macro, I think it automatically uses the highest one available.
---
Yes, keep all the ores you get to prep for leveling engineering.  
---
  
---
None of the blues you can craft via LWing are worth investing in when you can replace them with dungeon blues (or quest greens a little later).  
---
As a rogue all you want to do is make sure your weaponry stays current, the rest doesn't matter too much.
---
Thank you for your awnser, i'm currently only needing the fucking chest from last boss UBRS and after 20 fuckin runs didnt even seen it drops lmao..
---
Happens both ways
---
I respect the full T1
---
lol
---
Heaps of swords available pre 40 I don't know what you're talking about?
---
Do you believe that it is possible to criticise a country for its policies and actions without criticising the citizens of that country for their race?
---
I can't. It's poorly designed. Even though BLZ specifically promoted that spell in TBC's opening cinematic, it's still a waste of mana. I'd go disc instead for the spirit buff.
---
I quiit if bc come out reliance is the worst shit ever.
---
I have been saying this for 15 years. Finally someone that agrees with me. You have all of these cool areas that you can tell were built with the ideas of having more content in them. Azshara has these big walls and gates around the Furlbogs. You have dragons that never really get fleshed out. You have the world tree, Blood Elf lands, etc. I wish they instead built out these areas and reps, made more 5, 10, and 25/40 man dungeons in there.
---
One of the huge draws of Classic is that you don't have all these extra zones diluting the population.
---
Yep, just go to the keep..
---
Either way
---
Everything comes to an end eventually
---
I switched from fury tanking to 26/5/20  for AOE tanking dungeons and it's much easier holding threat.
---
I dont blame you, but i had to try xD
---
The last one fucking killed me lol
---
I agree and never said they were on equal ground, my point is that this is a bad situation for everyone.
---
Holy fuk, you're a lost case.
---
Yeah that's sadly true
---
Server reset deleted my rare pet I had camped for weeks. But enjoy the best subscription month you ever had blizz you deserve it /s
---
It actually doesn't. Those campaigns profit the owners of the "charity" and brings next to no money to be spent on actual cancer research or support.
---
So yeah you're just making rich scam artists richer.
---
True, good save. I used to teach Earth Science and Biology.  The teacher in me wouldn't let me keep quiet.
---
Guys, how do you solo a pack of 2-3 mobs including at least one ranged caster below Lv20? For example, defias, murloc or gnolls?
---
What? I do my weekly raids on the weekends and that's it. I keep up with my gear progression and everything else is for fun.
---
You're commenting in a 3-day-old thread. Surely there's something better you could have spent that time on.
---
It seems pretty obvious to me but
---
1. Lower queue times
---
2. More competitive world PvP
---
We've been using a fixed price DKP system for a few weeks now and it's been going great. (Highest DKP wins if multiple people want an item) We were using Loot Council but it was leading to issues and drama, mainly due to the text that loot was being decided by officers and people wanted a bit more transparency since it's very different to retail.
---
We use Monolith DKP and it pretty much does it all for us, we keep backups of everyone's DKP etc just incase something goes wrong but it's been smooth for around 5-6 weeks.
---
We took a lot of time to go through all of the items and gave them a cost based on their value, for example Vendorstrike costs next to nothing, and Mageblade is very expensive. At least this way people can decide what items they value, if someone wants to wait for 6 weeks to save up their DKP for a Mageblade that's fine, we have other mages that are prioritising other items whether it's for PvP etc. Another example is a lot of our priests are saving their DKP for benediction, which is fair enough but the priests that aren't as bothered about it are managing to grab plenty of tier, rings etc.
---
&gt;we try and achieve a 50/50 balance?
---
I highly doubt other people are actually looking for that when coordinating server transfers. They're looking for 55/45, which immediately snowballs further once other people from dominated servers find out.
---
&gt;see grown men cry like little girls
---
Maybe stop being so sexist yourself, dude.
---
Jungle remedy
---
Well???
---
I went Skeram-&gt;Earthfury in the first round of transfers and I'm happy on EF but I didn't move my alt, who is now 60, with me, which I regret. So I'm just holding out hope they open that pathway again.
---
&gt;deep into that jaedenar tunnel 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Look at that
---
Ah that makes a lot more sense. I'm druid so I purely thought about stealth being the primary reason you could duo. Did not think of any and all of the rogues abilities . Thanks
---
Retail style is completely different to vanilla. Shadowlands is basically Wildstar in Azeroth-ish world. It won't suit Classic.
---
You can realistically tank anything before BRD in progression gear with disciplined DPS and a decent healer. With pug dps, anything past 40 is going to be challenging.
---
You can tank further on. But it's like any other memespec. It'll work sub par, but you can make it work with overgearing and effort.
---
Sounds like the solution is to offer free transfers, but only if the transfer brings a serve closer to balance.
---
If they really want to fix things, only allow transfers that balance both the server being left and the server being transferred to.
---
Blizz allowed players to create more characters then servers could handle. Instead,  they should have closed the server when it was full and opened a new server. 
---
In addition they should have made a formula fit charter creation that kept the horde alliance ratio in balance.
---
Just don't come to Heartseeker. It's already over 4:1 alliance here.
---
&gt; but combat swords is #1 for a reason
---
Sure it is. Because it's easier and the people who did all the theory crafting determined it was the highest damage potential, so that's what's in all the guides, so people who google "ROGUE LEVELING SPEC" see it and use it without ever trying anything else.
---
&gt; This is some illogical thinking my guy
---
Like I said.. I've been there, done that, tried it all. 
---
I'd be more than happy to discuss anything you think I wrote that was wrong. I like to learn and I love the rogue class, which is why my reasons for what I do come from a ton of research combined with a lot  of experience. 
---
I've leveled a bunch of rogues, doing so quickly and efficiently every time. I raided from Vanilla to Wrath, usually at the top of the charts, and am back in MC/Ony right now doing it again. Yet any time this comes up all anybody can give me as an argument against what I've learned is "the guides say combat swords..".
---
But, you have a good one man.
---
If those aren't his only reason, they sure we're his first 2.  This discussion wasn't intended to be about the exclusion of an individual, it's about the sexism of it - the girls just can't do as good and theyre responsible for drama - 
---
concept which was backed up by some posters here and in the prior post.  In this post some of them just dropped snide comments and downvotes because they can't successfully, publicly defend their sexism.
---
who?
---
Why?
---
Im still im shock blizzard didn't add an rppvp server to east coast until the day after launch
---
Have you met Reddit?  What the hell doesn't belong on Reddit?
---
Gotta ask .. purposeful good place reference snuck in here?
---
How often does a company get a chance at a do over. To distill the best from the missteps and release a superior product?
---
Just releasing TBC, what a waste of
---
An opprotunity. All the big work is done - all the assets are there they just need to be rebalanced, contextualized and transplanted.
---
K
---
The Horde on Heartseeker don't want to be fighting 1v5 either, and we don't even have the option to leave.
---
Also, almost everyone in the world has a wow subscription! 98.3%!
---
It's almost as if online polls are biased. Most of the players who visit reddit of wow are level 60, who would have thought.
---
Forum goers on average are more interested in a game than the average player.
---
There's a little button you can click that lets you tell youtube that you're not interested in a video/that entire channel. It looks like three little dots stacked on top of each other and you can find it on the right hand side of the thumbnail on the youtube app, and below the thumbnail on the website.
---
I was trying to farm elemental fire today at Arathi, two 60 horde tried to gank me and failed. They continued this for another 2 tries until they finally just got 2 more horde so it was 4v1 and I had no chance. This is the first time ive been there in 2 weeks that the place didn’t have 5+ horde, and only because it was at 7am in the morning. 
---
Every single elemental fire farm spot is taken by the horde on my server, so much that the elemental fire are selling for 5g each. This is the same for basically every spot that has something farmable, the horde own the spot and alliance have to go somewhere else.
---
It doesn’t even need to be that much of an imbalance to happen, my server was around 60-40 last time the census thing worked yet because there’s more horde they end up winning any open world battles simply due to numbers. Even if you have a group of 5, you can clear out the farm spots but you can guarantee 10 horde are going to turn up and wipe you.
---
nice, yeah I was looking into the tri-spec but wasn't sure how it fared  on the pve side.
---
There really should be aswell, it seems every server over x ppl get kinda toxic / Rush mode. Its fun to see how the level required for dungs go up if theres more people, its a joke, and People talked about the classic experience but atleast its true for lower pop and its not even slower to find dungs
---
I mean, gathering 30 ears for some random goblin IS seemingly insignificant, at least in the grand scheme of things. ¯\_ (ツ) _/¯
---
Same thing with me. Found out that I joined the same server as the other guys who played in my old guild that originated back in vanilla. Got invited and was so excited at my luck to be playing with old friends. Most of them stopped playing and the guild slowly died.
---
It was a rollercoaster of emotions as I felt I needed to let the guild leader know if I wanted to enjoy Classic I needed an active guild. I was so worried of upsetting him.
---
Turns out he felt the same and he disbanded the guild and we both found another guild together and having the most fun.
---
Why do people think business decisions are based on pure cost minimization and risk avoidance?
---
So all those problem sets I did to find maximized cost flows and revenue curves, coulda just picked the lowest cost/less risk values from tables and been done?
---
I didn’t take a lot of business, but
---
You have to take some for Econ degrees and this whole narrative seems pretty cartoonish.
---
Yeah man, my fault for doing it but fuck.  I logged on to 2 hour queues everyday forever and i was like man I have like an hour to play max, it popped up with a free xfer and i was ok cool boom.  Immediately messaged them once i realized how dead it was and asked them to roll my account back and they said no.  
---
Cool, again, my fault, but its literally dead man.  Im just gonna play some RDR2 and wait for pokemon cause im a 30 year old man child.
---
That's all I need."
---
Thanks!
---
I did this a few weeks ago. 
---
I had trouble doing it the way most others did it so I just ended up kiting them both at the same time. Not saying that’s the best strategy but it’s what worked for me.
---
The fel hunter runs faster than Simone so I would save concussive shot and scatter shot for the fel hunter but otherwise would kite and dps Simone. I rotated between them. 
---
Kept Viper sting on Simone as much as possible. Cheetah on whole time. You out run her easily with it so you can get some Multi-Shot + auto shot rotations in their every so often. I killed Simone, ran to her body, looted her head and got hit by fel hunter but then just FD’d. Didn’t need to kill the fel hunter. 
---
This technique is just mana demanding. I went to Felwood and farmed demonic runes for more mana. Also bought scroll of intellect and elixirs of dragonslaying. Don’t forget food buffs too. Take your time with it. I did this solo and kited her from the most southern point counter edge clockwise all the way up to Marshall’s Refuge area. Just dodge the mobs and don’t Multi-Shot the neutral ones walking around. 
---
People say kite around the lake but for my technique you need to take broader turns. The lake requires too sharp of turns and the mobs will just swim and catch up at a quicker rate.
---
Was personally the most fun one for me because it was a lot of multi tasking kiting 2 mobs, dodging other mobs, and managing mana.
---
Even if you do that you will not be able to get the mount at 40.  There are not enough quests to get you enough rep for a cross faction mount.  You need to turn in a ton of runecloth to actually get there.
---
Sim it on bloodmoon and let us know. But it's brutality  and mirah.
---
What? What has that got to do with his point? Why did you post this irrelevant shit comment instead of responding to the comment you replied to?
---
If anyone is interested, I’ve been testing out AoEing Lashers as a lvl 55 Holy Priest after I saw it on a private server video.
---
Definitely works on Classic. Just need 6k mana.

Gnomes are trash
---
okok ty for awnser ! do you think I should put crusader on mirah song or fiery ?
---
I wanna follow up on this. I'm a tank, and I get really freaked out anytime I lose any aggro (as I should), but. But if the dps gets aggro off of a caster should I not worry too much about it?
---
And if you had the choice to have both, you’d use the mace, 100%.
---
Yeah my subscription isn't even on the current expansion.  The odds I'm going to pay to move up to shadowlands are essentially non-existent.  Classic is great for now, but if they fuck it up, I'm just straight up gone.
---
Keep leveling, when you get into mid 50s head to winter spring and grind for rep there. Get white tiger mount.  Winning.
---
Vanilla doesn't have as much communications as retail does. Hardware progress would nullify the problem allowing hundreds of players to PvP in the same place. But instead Blizz runs it on cloud potatoes so the problem persists.
---
Fiery on mirah or crusader? i'm loo on money
---
Wait there are people who  aren't clinging to the idea of classic+??
---
&gt;  We all respect each other while questing
---
Enjoy it while it lasts, you've got one week.
---
A rusky bot got into the wrong sub?
---
Being low level 50 is the actual worst place to be. Good luck.
---
And should i put fiery on mirah or go big dick and put crusader? i'm kinda low on money haha
---
I wont lie, explaining the relationship between distributions is probably one of my favorite things about statistics
---
And Space World 2: Electric Boogaloo, and Dead World.
---
Horribly naive. On retail faction balance was better, and there horde had +10min queues and alliance 0min, and that's with the mercenary system. Expect 15 minute queues for horde and 0 minute queues for alliance.
---
That’s pretty interesting, doesn’t feel like it though but I hope it’s true.
---
You may not care, but the tank and the healer does. Trust me.
---
I play exclusively from 8am to 4pm at work during the week. Sometimes I play a bit Sunday AM. I find it funny I probably never see 50% of my guild, but the ones playing during the hours I play are super chill because most do the same thing I do, play at work.
---
Question to everyone, how do you balance all realms, when all realms (pvp) are horde favoured? Everyone wants their server 50-50 but that will always come at another server being 70-30 or something.
---
Once you have naxx on farm, you won't use any consumables.
---
Or at least you won't need to use them except for speed clearing.
---
Crusader always if you can afford it, if not fiery is fine in general.
---
This picture is so low resolution I think a potato could’ve taken it better
---
Crusader on both
---
I do. I don't want TBC. TBC was fun, but it brought two things to WoW that I despise. Flying mounts, and arenas. I like battlegrounds as the main form of PvP.  I agreed with Kalgan back when he finally admitted adding arenas to WoW was a mistake. I also despise flying mounts. World pvp died in TBC until the Isle came out. Then it was only happening there. So yeah I'd much rather have Classic+ than TBC.
---
There's a LOT they could do with classic plus. I'd even be game for them re-doing certain expansion landmasses like Northrend except make it classic. Meaning no level increases, no new talents, nor new abilities.And of course no flying mounts. Use the assets, zones, and dungeons/raids for sure but re-design them for classic WoW. This could be cool as hell if you ask me. Will they do it? I can't ever imagine there's even the smallest chance, but a guy can dream.
---
How about better to just unsubscribe then to reward a company that punishes you for being a customer that has faith that they won’t fuck things up? 
---
That’s assuming you’re being sarcastic?
---
If you want to check if someone is online on the other faction, you can try invite them - if they're offline nothing happens, if they are then it'll tell you that you cannot invite enemies
---
If it's going down fast, yeah don't worry about it.  Throw a concussion blow on it if you feel like it's gonna be more than a few more seconds
---
It's cool, everyone has their own preferred system.
---
I personally like open council because keeping it open means it's less likely to be corrupt, and allows gear to be distributed in the best way. Let's say some class is 1 piece from their set bonus, you can make sure he gets it over someone who might have gotten it with EP. I think if you have enough dedicated people it's the best way to do it, and if I were going to seriously farm classic for gear its the best method (corruption being the biggest weakness). If everyone knows everyone gets all the gear at the end of the day.
---
List it for super high and keep lowering the price a little until it sells.
---
Why is it “cool” to be irresponsible, you clearly can’t make the best calls in a raid when you only have 5 hours of sleep a night. 
---
Solve the problem, raid at work!
---
Apparently you have no idea what barrens chat is...
---
And I will remain...

ERPing in Goldshire
---
Why is this moron upvoted? The vast majority pick a faction because of friends or they like the races more.
---
Except I don’t think at all that it’s 55/45 all servers. Even if they balance all realms it’s gonna be like 60/40
---
Casters first, always. Healers especially.
---
What the fuck is this? Please describe to me how I “created” this problem, when servers started out as a 55-45 imbalance and shifted to a HUGE imbalance once transfers to heartseeker were introduced.
---
You won’t be going to a server where you “at least have a chance”. You’ll be going to a server with WORSE imbalance than stalagg and skeram.
---
It is the best, but the commitment required is too much. The day I won eve was the day I learned how to be productive.
---
Once again your missing the point
---
Once again everything your saying is reaffirming that your a dick bag
---
The grossest part for me is that hoj dropped on my very first "arena/anger/golem" run, and i lost the roll to the 1 other guy rolling. Now I know ill never see it again.
---
The entire argument hinges on a single data point. You can't take one release and call it a trend. Look at the content for P2, do you honestly think it'll be the same pace as other far larger phases?
---
That is not what the post was suggesting as an option.
---
Ok
---
Is there an accurate place to look at realm stats? All the ones I’ve seen are broken or haven’t been updated since September.
---
90% of the things done in this game are done while watching Netflix unless it's your first time doing it. Nothing in classic wow requires your full attention outside of PvP.
---
Bless both of you guys. Stay strong (especially for her). Good luck, friends.
---
I mean put crusader if you can afford it
---
How many people said “I want to pvp” “I’m gonna play horde for racials”? It’s definitely a player created problem. In the natural state, all realms should be 50-50 if no one knew anything about the game.
---
In reality, cause of all these guides and videos and knowledge, everyone who wanted to “seriously pvp” choose horde.
---
It's far from not being a very unlikely scenario. It's statistically improbable to see 5 drops of everything but the item you need when all drops vary between 14-12%.
---
Why do you think that has happened? Due to server transfers or just how it started off. Which side do you play on there? Is it s big issues for you?
---
Hi mate,
---
It looks like you are playing with the english client amirite ?
---
However your name is chinese, so I am guessing you created that with the chinese client?
---
Just interesting :)
---
Thanks and grats on 60 mate, I will be 60 today or tomorrow.
---
Hm yes world of smallteambattlecraft sounded better anyway.
---
Classic + is the only way forward if they want to continue taking people's money. Tbc will only last for a limited time
---
&gt;Imagine you and your buddies decide to form up a horde pvp group, and you run all through Searing Gorge, all through Blackrock Mountain, and all through Burning Steppes and don't see a single alliance in a sea of horde. That's bad. 
---
Swap the words horde and alliance and you have what is already reality for many ally players. Why should they have to stay in that same situation? What other solution can you come up with?
---
amazing brother 💪💪
---
Our sun isn’t even remotely large enough to create a black hole. It will expand as it dies consuming the earth whole.
---
So like, flight paths?
---
Lmao you're a cunt
---
I'm on a PvE server, but all my experiences of getting trolled in some way have involved literal trolls. Think that says something.
---
lmao yeah you're Alliance so you don't see the Horde getting bukkake'd nonstop with camped flight masters all over and entry into BRM being a right pain in the nuts.
---
Great tool, thanks.
---
It’s not a pure PvP game.
---
PvP realms are PvPvE realms. You can’t get from 1-60 through PvP.
---
Creating the silos is what began splitting the game into a bunch of different side by side games in the attempt to be all things to all people, which leaves you in the end being nothing. Retail.
---
I’m a million more times interested in PvP than Raids, but we’ve seen what happens.
---
Yes.
---
I've never won 1 single roll when i raided from classic to wotlk, never found any epic or anything worth selling in AH!   
---
Luckiest i've been now after launch was finding a 14 slot bag!
---
Haha it would be so funny if they open faction transfers and nothing changed, cause every last horde player is waiting for other horde players to do it
---
Since there is no room for discussion I'll just say you are misguided
---
The problem is there are more horde players than alliance on EVERY server. It's like 60:40 on average. Servers better than average will be okay, but any worse than average servers are clearly imbalanced.
---
Transfers just spread the shit out and make all the servers bad.
---
In my opinion, the best way (other than specifically forcing people to switch) is to just let some servers be horde dominated. Some people want to play on a dominant faction. Those people will concentrate on the most imbalanced servers and tip the scales anyway.
---
You're doing the opposite of that, trying to save Herod and Skeram, but those servers are already dead to anybody who wants an even matchup, and no amount of transfer restrictions will get people looking for a 50:50 server to join alliance there.
---
Yup. All the spam in trade chat.
---
I'm a hunter. I have xbow from ud strat. I also got strikers mark in an mc pug. Guess what, strikers mark does more overall dps. I find it funny how people think hunters shouldn't get strikers.
---
Because its easy to get to 60. It only takes time.
---
There isn't some skill challenge to get to 60 lol.
---
Kromcrush has felt pretty good as alliance, just worried it'll get worse with the transfers
---
idk why but I really hate people that think whoosh is cool
---
And I will be there... Asking if anybody just mentioned Thunderfury, blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
fighting the good fight - need more horde on heartseeker!
---
Not anymore. They busted the census addons in september by removing the functionality they needed.
---
Oh I’m on Sulfuras. I had a few fair fights and it was actually fun. I can’t wait to be 60 too so everything is a fair fight lol
---
Which is fine but also a big difference than someone who has dedicated some kind of intent into anticipating the healer role, even a little bit more.
---
But that’s probably a more rarer circumstance anyway. 
---
For what it’s worth anyway, anytime I’m on my way to a dungeon portal I always try to remind myself that I’m probably gonna die or come very close to it in the near future (from a dps point of view). I’d imagine I’m not alone there... lol so don’t be afraid to experiment!
---
Good luck have fun out there!
---
That's because despite the faction imbalance, Skeram has some top guilds on both sides. Neither wants to just let the other side have it. Especially when it comes to world bosses going live. Honor coming in won't change that. We purposely attacked the horde during their raid times to wipe their world buffs. If that isn't a big "fuck you", I don't know what is.
---
You will be a dishonorable kill to level 60s until level 48 where you would be fair game. So you got plenty to do, and if you stay at this pace battleground will likely come out and everyone will be murdering each other in said battleground. Don't worry, just play like you have been and welcome to PVP that does come your way.
---
In retail all players are funnelled to rng game content. Even a causal player will hit level cap, and do endgame activities. As such, he will end up doing the dailies and weeklies and eventually get into whatever content there is. That’s why, in the end, they will end up doing weekly/daily content. 
---
In classic, a casual player could easily take 2-3 months to max level, more like 4months if you ask me. Even at max level you do the dungeons in your own time and farm gear, you raid once a week or something. Whatever gear drops, is the best shit already. You can be “done” for the week. Will you clear MC in 1hr hardcore style? No. Will you clear MC in 3 hrs? Yes. Even 40 people in prebis can clear MC, it might take 4 or 5 hours, but that progression is permanent. The items will be the best item for another 3-4 months. 
---
You don’t need to endlessly farm flasks or pots etc. At most you need 1-2 fire pot a week. If you don’t plan to pvp much you don’t need epic mount or pvp consumables.
---
Send me your Logs god gamer rogue
---
Thank you for your input.
---
I think that's your computer bud.
---
Lol killing lowbies isnt a dishonorable kill. Only civilian npcs are.
---
Go birds!
---
Thank you for your advice.
---
You calling it BiS cause you gave up on trinkets and rings or?
---
It won’t help if he’s pulling agro from aoe spam with WW and SS.  Threat meters so your threat on current targeted enemy.
---
Tiny plates might help as they replace nameplates with colour codes to show which adds you have agro on.
---
But basically, warrior tanks have not good aoe threat abilities.
---
 If you immediately charge in and use SS-&gt;WW you are almost guaranteed to get agro.  Open with single target dps on marked target and save aoe abilities for when the tank has built some threat on everything in the pack
---
There are some servers with 70/30 ratios, and there are a lot of people that would rather play on a low pop server than be in the 30% during phase 2.
---
Moving far too fast imho. Needs more prolonged suffering for that real classic experience. We're completely skipping the full bag space and I won't even get to relive the I left the key I needed back in the bank and need to fly 30min roundtrip fun.
---
Too real my characters calves are sore.
---
Well fuck. Everybody sub 58 needs to fucking hide.
---
Why shouldnt the warlock roll on it?  It was eagle?
---
Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.
---
Hah, keyring now twice as anticipated as world bosses
---
Yes wait till BWL AND AQ 40comes out and you can forget about Naxx
---
The purge is about to begin
---
Thank you for elaborating on it.
---
OSRS is completely different game and has its own problems. I play it too. And we are talking about horizontal expancing if it was started back in 2004 and had 15 years of it done like current retail. It's not feasible.
---
THE SIEGE HAS BEGUN, THERE’S NOWHERE TO RUN
---
Alliance should transfer to Kurrinaxx . Medium pop, the balance is not as bad as other pvp servers, nor as high over all. Never had queues, but it’s certainly nearly full at peak hours.
---
Copyright infringement says what?
---
Just make friends with people you come across and focus more on your friends list than what guild you're in. The time will come when you're asking why you're not in the guild, rather than if you can be in the guild, and that'll probably be the guild you want to join.
---
Also don't forget that Discord is the new teamspeak/ventrillo.
---
"Take a little break" literally every day, when I've only got two hours between work and bedtime as it is. "Call in some friends." Oh, all these servants I have just sitting around waiting to drop what they're doing to be my personal army. Nobody has anything better to do with their time than loiter around the Barrens, babysitting me while I quest.
---
Holy shit how many brothers do you have to craft that!
---
Luul. Here's.
---
I've also been playing a rogue for the better part of 13 years, and i too have played many specs.
---
Combat swords in vanilla and BC, Assassination/the overpowered HaT builds in wrath, and probably my favourite build to date would have had to be sub during WoD, that was some great change of play style which was a welcome change to combat/assassination, the main point with all of these builds is they were the highest dps for their respective times, its not about 'reading guides' - its about water being wet, dont try reinvent the wheel.
---
Scholo
---
Get Cadaverous, unless you're going for 6 Shadow/2 Devilsaur it's just better.  
---
That said, I feel your pain. I saw it drop twice when I was chaining UBRS to get one, I won the second roll after 20-30 runs but out of 10 painweavers I never won one. I was rocking a Blackstone and White Bone Band until DM came out.
---
plesse tell me how soul link is not low skill compared to any other lock spec
---
Thank you for the advice and going into detail.
---
Kirtonos is the best server.
---
This is crazy, yesterday I was just walking into Badlands for the first time on my 35 human warrior and just started killing mobs like I normally do, I aggroed Broken Tooth and some other Lion and was killing them both as I didn’t even notice BT was anything special. A hunter ran up and started yelling at me to please stop so I figured he needed it for a quest and started to run away to drop Aggro. He eventually tamed it and gave me 1.5G which was dope. Hearing all these strategies about taming BT is something I never knew about and find it crazy I just managed to waltz into him and not even notice he’s a special mob XD
---
NOPE!
---
Usually, there are reasons for the faction imbalance. Horde mercilessly slaying the even slightly weaker faction will cause that faction to just leave. 
---
Reap what you sow.
---
try having a mage/rogue tanking timmey in strat living then we'll talk again
---
Yeah, now I am 51 I can get the 11 in arms to get that talent and then 40 in prot
---
Then you’ve just recreated leveling with ilevels.
---
Like, what?
---
I actually regret not going horde this time around. I miss being a shaman. Never played horde vanilla. I'd reroll but my dad's alliance with me.
---
Only Kodo and Wolf. You have to be exalted with Orgrimmar to purchase wolf riding and the mount.
---
It's not a race, this game has an end and even if you take a lot of time to level/gear, people will be there waiting for you, whether they like it or not.
---
&gt;EZmode free fight winning racials
---
Uhhh sorry, are we talking about the same faction? Have ever played with Paladins? Speaking as a former Hordie who nows plays Alliance, Paladins are completely OP. No comparison in PVP or PVE against Shaman. Alliance is EZmode except for the horrific faction imbalances here on NA servers.
---
Yeah, I think it's closer to 0.4 since gorosh only has 8%, then sgc 5%.
---
TBC was a mistake... should have just kept adding new content. So much unfinished content in Vanilla. The kidnapped Varian questline that just got hand waived in wrath of the lich king, Karazhan, mount hyjal, dragon isles...
---
?
---
dont know what you mean. so you mean all the end game dungeons are bad because you need more gear to do various ones?
---
I started late September and am still 46, but I have a job, which apparently isn't a prerequisite to buying a computer and WoW.
---
I understand you keep moving the goalposts, sure.
---
Tokens are a retail thing.  This is classic, where there will never be a shop for fear of the playerbase revolting...and they would.
---
Point being there is a hundred ways in which classic ISNT being monetized in the way that blizzard would like exactly BECAUSE the playerbase wants the classic experience......and blizzard are willing to accept that in return for several million more subs.
---
Do you actually believe there is an innate bug with your toon? Because you should know, there isn’t. As everyone has said, it’s RNG.  
---
Since you asked :D For myself, Hypnotic Blade. Did the library ten times over two days in the last week - saw it drop once and lost the roll to a guy who didn’t know it existed and, coincidentally and I suppose appropriately enough, was running and offhand with no main hand. When I asked him why he didn’t have one he said, “Just haven’t found one I guess.”
---
&gt; the only thing that matters about you getting an invite is what loot you need. 
---
Negative. Mages are often sought after in order to provide free water to the casters (finding water in a capital can be a real pain in the ass). They are also brought for CC/AoE in some cases (BRD emp runs for example, mages are almost mandatory).
---
But other than that, and maybe a hunter or mage to kite drak, no other class' utility is mandatory.
---
Standard combat daggers - combat swords has a higher damage output but I prefer daggers (just think they’re more fun) and the loot competition in raid is way less.
---
I’m not trying to say people should do any of what I said there end game, just that leveling combat swords is extremely meh and uses basically none of the utility of a rogue.
---
Even with the Heartseeker debacle Stalagg is still not unplayable...yet. I can only imagine how nice things would've been without the Heartseeker moves :(
---
I’ve tried macros for shackle undead that will allow me to shackle a target and then reshackle same target even if I am no longer targeting it.  This macro sets your initial target as a focus.  I remember using this kind of macro in kara way back.  Is this possible to do in classic?  None of the macros I e found online have been working.
---
Once people get naxx on farm hopefully we'll start to see meme specs like shaman tanking.
---
Dal rends MH im sure it doesnt exist.
---
There aren't any more balanced servers. Either you transfer to an extremely unbalanced (but Alliance heavy) server like Heartseeker, or you take your chances with the actual ghost town servers like Earthfury and Arcanite Reaper
---
op is having issues with threat. Block chance does nothing for that
---
As long as they scale it down to lv 60 then sure. It could be a 20 man raid like ZG or AQ 20.
---
Great video, love the classic vibes
---
Exactly
---
Would you mind sharing the gear you use for it?
---
Absolutely not. Neither pvp or pve, that juicy 5% extra swing with the armor proc.
---
Classic+ and the potential it would have, makes for wonderful day dreaming. To me, it wouldn't be hard to understand what aspects of classic would need to persist in order for the new content to be successful. Expanding the universe on a new path while keeping to classics core values could yield an amazing new journey through azeroth. I really dont see it as a risky move if blizzard included the community in the development and future paths they planned go create. This would avoid missteps and ensure it was what the community wanted. 
---
Unfortunately, I have to reel my idealism back in and tell myself the probable outcome will, if anything, be TBC. Which is great within itself of course. My fondest memories were TBC. I would certainly play TBC if they released it but the prospect of a new version of wow in alignment with classic values is such an amazing thought. 
---
It seems to me that you could expand the current classic-verse with content and still maintain admiration from those who love the game. It seems even more doable when you consider that you wouldn't need to push the game/systems like retail has done with every expansion release.
---
Nice video! I'm really considering transferring here. I'm currently a horde on stalagg where we outnumber ally by quite a bit..
---
Will I regret sending my level 38 rogue there?
---
I played last two weeks and couldnt wait for Classic to be released
---
Took my shaman 21 runs just to see the ravenger drop once. I was also trying to get the scarlet crusade tabbard from 34 to 43 doing nothing but SM, never saw anyone get it.
---
OK dumb question but how do you pan the camera towards yourself like that?
---
Change “we don’t see” to “we’re praying that”.
---
When their prayers are wrong they have a choice - cater to the 3 mil subs 45m rev/month) or lose it, because it’s not getting funneled into retail, lol.
---
Hold left click and turn mouse :)
---
Put your arrows into 1 stack you bag space masochist.
---
Because Blizzard said so
---
You do less damage though. If all you're doing is sinister strike + slice and dice, you should be using swords. Again, if you find a crazy good dagger you can use that, but there's way more good swords than there are good daggers.
---
The only problema for shaman tank are raids of 20 40, the 5 man are easy
---
You do understand that this is a positive thing for many people despite you not liking it, correct?
---
Stagnation is a much better option than TBC. We know what TBC leads to and it sucks. Just ride out the good game for as long as possible.
---
Ended up the same way in BfA but with the resub for Classic, i have finally managed to push through the daily grind and unlock dark iron dwarfs!
---
lmao why are you shilling so hard jesus christ. literal fucking idiot
---
A 40/60 faction split means 50 percent more horde. Not even remotely a small imbalance. 40/60 is in fact fucking horrible, and many realms are even worse.
---
Population imbalance isn’t just a classic wow thing it existed in private servers as well.  For example the largest pservers Northdale (Alliance favored) and Kronos (Horde favored )were severely imbalanced .  If you were to go on their subreddit you’d see tons of threads about the imbalance.
---
Because of rep, gold, building my T0, and true faith pattern drop.
---
Thanks for the reply. Yeah that sounds about right. They were threatened by her presence so close to Orgrimmar, plus his crush Jaina, so that makes total sense, haha
---
That's not the business model of a game with a monthly subscription fee.
---
On one hand, I know the struggle to try and stack firewater, on the other, it's just one kill.  
---
I dunno the prices of firewater on your server, but it's silly that he was being so stingy about this when realistically you make way more gold just pickpocketing BRD than camping the chief.
---
Have you checked out the daily questions threads? You'll sometimes see a lot of the same things being asked, but there is a lot of good info there and can pick up things you don't know.
---
its really the crossrealm aspect that ruins lfg systems. it creates anonymity.. if it was single servers using lfg systems then it would be fine
---
It's not weird. Horde racials are clearly way better for pvp so of course pvp players will flock to the horde. And paladins aren't enough better than shamans in pve to make a difference.
---
It's all to gain a benefit financially when people want to transfer later.
---
You're gonna eventually find it boring killing the same 5 or 6 alliance players on your server because they're literally the only ones on there, so you'll pay to transfer.
---
At the beginning you'll think "Oh fuck yeah. im winning everything! They dead. He dead! that murloc dead. everybody dead! so easy! and fun! WINNING IS FUN!" then you'll get bored coz no challenge.
---
1) Learn how to take screenshots  
---
2) Do you expect reddit to know what server you're on and have that data available?   
---
3) Was this just a low-key brag post?
---
Wanted to update on this, apparently they made it so the GUID trick doesn't work anymore. Can you confirm?
---
Can you elaborate? I'm in grizzly and as a guild we don't treat fellow alliance any specific way. I'm presuming you've had bad experiences with some specific members?
---
This isn't World of Easycraft.
---
Or it was just a joke

Battlegrounds slit WPvP throat and Flying just buried the body. And no you didn't, try again.

If you don't have a wand yet walk your butt to the AH and get a level 13 one.

But why would u do all that and not get a chance at orbs.
---
Tagged him while on the flight path from UC to Kargath today. If you spam the target macro you should see him as your flight goes over his spawns. Was pleased to see him still there after I flew back to Hammerfall.
---
Man so glad I’m my own tank
---
You mean the first one, not all of them. On Sulfuras healers are a dime a dozen. Maybe even less in demand than some DPS. Tanks are in demand, so therefore healers can be replaced if they demand an orb, where as nobody wants to lose a tank.
---
No, I'm afraid you're missing the point, sorry. The entire deal of the fight is that there is no threat reset. A dps could have 50k threat when she lands (even if they do **nothing** after she's landed), something that a tank can never compete with during the duration of a single fear.
---
Of course the tank should do his very best to generate as much threat as possible in the beginning of Phase 3, but you have to play smartly during Phase 2 (with the *actual* threat resets) in order to be completely fail-proof.
---
They banned a guy for flying to a different continent and then logging onto his account with a new IP days later, lmfao. GL account sharing.
---
Out of all the R14s I came up with none of us account shared, we just played 16+ and we did it in its original iteration which was one per week. It's % based now so the bigger the server the bigger the brackets.
---
The hypnotic blade sits in that small dead zone where there are no reasonably obtainable major sword upgrades until vanquishers/sword of omens. When I got it it was a 10 dps upgrade on my offhand.
---
Stay on your side.
---
Not gonna lie ...
---
You have shit etiquette and shit integrity. I'm done.
---
I got a Logitech G502 mouse not as many buttons but still a great mouse imo
---
Why not let paladins swap for shamans and vice versa? Seems fairly straightforward
---
This is wholesome, you made me feel. All the upvotes to you. Stay strong and stay away from everything trying to kill you in Aus
---
Arenas, the time PvP was fun.
---
That’s for marketing to figure out

---
This. Blew my mind when I saw how he did it.
---
But will they let me switch my character from a west coast to an east cost server....I was an idiot when I first logged in
---
Ah, maybe I can't really remember who I talked to but it wasn't that many. I did find one of them running around a server tagged up in a guild by themselves, lmfao. Forgot who it was, someone in the discord though.
---
Congrats man. You mentioned first shaman on server but second overall. Did a ret beat you or did a warrior make it?
---
If you’re guild allows hots that’s a big yikes. Your dps especially melee should be fighting with the buff cap with world buffs and be pissed as shit if you hot them at all.
---
And after were done with naxx a week after release and PvP has turned into a shitshow of bursting everything down?
---
I’m a fury dps warrior, I still tank the endgame dungeons regularly.
---
As long as you know how to tab + sunder mobs, taunt on CD, mocking blow, and use your other abilities to keep threat you’ll be fine.
---
Have a very fast 1h sword and a shield to equip for areas you need it. 
---
Also, my #1 tip is to get engineering to where you can atleast use iron grenades. LOSing pulls and then throwing a grenade to stun the mobs and generate threat on them all is great.
---
Later!
---
What? 60/40 on each server is obviously better than the wildly out of balance servers we have now. You're only outnumbered 3 to 2. That's not that bad.
---
And if you want to take it a step further pvp servers can have a forced 50/50 ratio where either you cant make new characters or you get put in a queue. 
---
There are ways around this. Demand solutions dont just point out issues.
---
&gt; the two worst classes
---
pfffffhahahahahaha

I will be there asking where Mankrik's Wife is.

When you turn it in they say he's gone on a "diplomatic mission"
---
You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about. The game IS partially server side..
---
There are optimizations that can be made in client code, server code, the network layer, the OS layer (RAM/storage), the DB layer (the efficiency in time and space at which queries are mare and data is saved), and many other things...
---
They think she’s 20 level’s lower and fighting a mob.
---
Wow so this is retail huh?
---
For some reason I actually really like this screenshot, it reminds me of the old in game promo-screenshots Blizzard would post back in 2004-2005, good stuff, Ken!
---
there's nothing in the mage changes that patch that would affect the ability to do this.
---
Which has literally nothing to do with tbc.
---
Your points are very sound; however, the one advantage of classic+ is it’s superior long term potential. It could act as the springboard to another 10+ year content journey (albeit a riskier option).
---
Do you honestly think anything in tbc bar sun well will not be a joke if they do a phased content release?
---
By nature, having bis everything from the previous tier would make the next a cakewalk.
---
Why are you responding to 4 month old posts?
---
Stop stalking
---
Oh boy, curated crits.
---
TBC releases with t4 and t5 available. Neither would be a joke for "progression" if released in the proper state. Not to mention the heroic dungeons we'd be grinding for the first few months. Perma 2.4 ruins all of that.
---
You don’t have to reroll though? Just look for a server which is alliance dominated you can free transfer to and take your whole guild and go there.
---
Thou shall not pass
---
Yes that’s how the 30-40 zones where.  
---
Totally prevented leveling.
---
They have at least like 7 fucking years to decide what to do with the trilogy expansions in their back pocket.
---
I'm sure they'll think of something, or we can just call it a good run and chill.
---
Did this on Monday, kited her around the hot springs with cheetah and serpent sting. Initially trapped the pet then just scattered whenever it got close. After killing the demon, I feigned and the pet despawned. 
---
Pet will not leash and hasn't for a few weeks since the group pulling hotfix.
---
I am lucky. I work home office and can pretty much schedule my work hours how I want to.
---
I killed golem lord 14 times and didn't see his boots once. Not unusual for a rare item like HoJ, but it supposedly has a 37% drop rate. So that is incredibly unlucky.
---
Got it on the 15th run.
---
AoS 2?
---
Because I'm not here for classic wow. I'm here for tbc and wrath.
---
Im 30 in a few weeks. I would die within the first day or two of sleep deprivation. Dont get old, kids.

Rend for PVE, Shroud for pvp
---
Even 2:1 I feel would be manageable if the ratio was the only thing you needed to worry about but it has a sort of compounding effect.  On my main 50:50 server people really pick their battles, even if most just go for the cheesy strat of only fighting when victory is guaranteed it still makes PvP an event.  
---
On the 2:1 server where my alt is the PvP is incessant.  It's not just double the amount of PvP it is truly just constant.  On my main server 2 equal level players in a questing zone will tiptoe around each other, better to keep up with the rat race than slow each other down.  Even if you bump into 2 or 3 solo enemy players they're often still quite reserved, as long as you're not competing for their mobs/resources they don't want to start a war in a zone that's only going to slow down their progress.  
---
On the 2:1 server there's no such joy.  Picking a fight with the less populated side isn't a careful consideration you need to make, with possibly some sacrifices even if you win.  It's just a no-brainer choice to go in, with a very high chance of a friendly player passing by to lend a hand and almost no chance of an additional enemy player turning the tide against you.  When I started counting the friendly vs enemy players in every zone for a few days the numbers didn't marry up to the 2:1, it was closer to 5:1 per zone (and I even went as far as turning the spy addon off in case of bias) but I don't have any reasonable explanation for why that is.  
---
If that anecdotal experience is true then the Horde probably feel like they have to take advantage of every PvP encounter they come across, no knowing when they'll see another Alliance again.  For Horde what feels like an occasional and (very importantly) reasonable amount of PvP every few hours for the Alliance player its just a torrent of abuse coming their way to the point you feel like a mouse scurrying along the walls hunting for scraps and trying to avoid all contact with the packs of cats roaming the house.
---
BG will be cross realm. There will be no waiting time for both sides.
---
I didn't get into TBC or many of the x-pans, so the pet battles I don't know much about. Im indifferent about them I suppose since they don't interest me much.
---
Why would ppl want your names? They're not even the original ones....
---
&gt;tfw private servers run in EU basements could handle large scale PvP but multi million dollar company blizzard cant 
---
 
---
Blizzard are incompetent. They knew these sorts of fights would occur in classic, and did occur in vanilla. The aq40 launch will be a mess if they don't fix things.
---
Varies heavily by server. On mine, I sold it for 320g to a bank alt who already was selling one in AH for 450ish. I then saw him trying to sell it for 400g for the next week, not sure if he did. During that time someone else put it up on AH for 300g.
---
But I am on a mediumish pop server as alliance. On a high pop, it could be 400-500 or more.
---
I love this
---
Layers, queues and realm caps are all related but technically the realm cap is what directly sets the queue, not the number of layers
---
Neck is bis too? 😂
---
Are you really that fragile? You blow yourself up and correct me twice, then figure out you are wrong and act all like a victim? No we didnt just sat that, you told me twice i was wrong, despite the word "arcane power", and arcane power dosent really sound like a frost talent does it? You didnt care to spend just 2 seconds checking if you could actually be wrong, before having the guts to tell someone they are wrong twice. I wasnt super rude, i told you you were wrong, and then you still corrected me, then i asked if you were stupid. Thats how the world works.. Toughen up if you wanna go around correcting People, when you dont care to know what the hell you are takling about first, cause then people will, according to you, be "super rude" and hurt your precious feelings.
---
What’s it like being a boomer?
---
Yeah that's fair, I found it not too bad running the typical pvp spec for prep. 3 piece NS helps too.
---
I didn't say you need to put effort in for classic, my point was that you absolutely do not at all have to do it for retail. You said casuals "have to do so much stuff daily and weekly." This is just straight up completely incorrect
---
look at the price of devilsaur.
---
Unfortunately it’s what I experienced there. 
---
And that was I. The areas where you normally just would see occasional pvp (20-30 zones)
---
Once you got to stv / ah  /des (30-40) you hit dead water.  In stv I can describe it like 1-3 groups of hordes corps camping you while another group was sitting in all the gy (to kill you when you give up). 
---
When your xp / h drop down to perhaps a single mob 300xp   Your basically in reverse.   
---
Now the addon have been broken for quite some time and starting at 33:67 I would guess it’s a lot worse.   Especially with free migration.  As I migrated I can’t really check. 
---
What I found in stv/ ah was a total road block that was made by players a roadblock that causes migration / quitting/ rerolling
---
I‘d love to see them do Classic+ but I have 0 hope of it actually happening.
---
If they release TBC with no or no meaningful changes that will be the end of the journey for me.
---
What server?
---
I agree, however I think Blizzard wanted to bring in all the zones from WC3 eventually, so think Northrend and Outland was a great way for them to so just that, and also continue those storylines. All the extra zones in Azeroth didn't really make too much sense lore-wise at the time. Compared to now where they just make up lore without too much background.
---
Its good with inner focus or in mage parties where you have to wait while they drink anyway.
---
This is why everyone makes fun of people that are mass exodus'ing away from their pvp servers. We only ended up in this situation because so many alliance players that did roll on those servers didn't actually want to pvp and as soon as they realized it wasnt going to be a "tip toe around eachother" forever they started leaving en masse, causing this chain reaction.
---
Either way he's wrong. They don't have the hardware for it. If they did, there wouldn't be queues even with layering.
---
On my realm it is exactly the other way around, so stop crying.
---
Loot ofc
---
I cant see why blizzard should worry, when so many players dont give a shit about server balance.
---
Like pvp servers. I know you guys want WOTF and orc stun resist. But with some servers being 80/20 in horde favor, and people still joining horde side on these servers. I really think the playerbase have a larger responsibility, than they can handle.
---
But but but blizz, fix my server :'(. 
---
- you done fucked it up yourself, why should they?
---
Horde is more popular on PvP servers. Alliance is more popular on PvE servers.
---
I think some of it is the Horde racials are better for PvP. Some of it is the fantasy aspect of it - if you want to jump out of bushes and murder people, you might prefer to be an Orc with an axe than a noble human paladin.
---
Good comment.
---
Raid healing is more fun than raid dps. However in pvp dps is more fun.
---
Yea.. those are the people who couldn't handle grouping up to pvp so they left their server lol. Think of it that way. They're basically free kills on average.
---
Happy customers are paying customers. Balance don't mean shit if people stop playing!
---
You got camped one time? Oh nooooooo.
---
Guilds wont stop farming bwl even after aq40 and naxx is released tho, mainly because of the insane trinkets that drop from bwl. MC will be farmed for legendaries and recipes. ZG Will be farmed for bis enchants for head and legs.  I’d say that it’ll be quicker to catch up, with at least your main, the deeper we get into the game
---
tbh i searched "wow reddit" on google and it was one of the first titles that popped up under reddit on the google search so i clicked
---
This is blasphemy, you have committed the greatest sin known to the world; of Warcraft.
---
Go and slay 10 people of the opposing faction to atone.
---
Make anyone that is at least 10 levels lower count as a dishonorable kill lel.
---
Hate to say it bud, but my guild from Stalagg-A is coming to Heartseeker on Monday
---
He wasnt asking.
---
If you can get anywhere from about 45 to 50% damage mitigation without a shield, and you're mainly tanking mobs that are equal or lower level to your character you can go 2h arms and tank just fine.
---
If you're struggling to get enough mitigation without a shield start inviting pallies exclusively and ask them kindly if they will use devo aura since it helps you tank better. And have a weapon swap macro ready so you can switch back to a shield should you suddenly need the extra mitigation from your shield.
---
Avoid doing dungeons or parts of a dungeon where the mobs are higher level than yourself and try to avoid the tougher bosses like emperor in BRD until your level matches or exceeds his level.
---
Don't rely on websites like Icy Veins for advice on talents or gear. A lot of the information that I've seen on there is not always as reliable as it ought to be.
---
Wait did I hear Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
Thats quite unfortunate i wanted to learn from a rogue god and also when you are so Fond of daggers why you not playing dagger rogue in raids?  I feel like you are not that decent then you think you are.
---
Between my last two years of school and work after graduating...I have quickly learned the 'engineer's schedule'. 
---
4 hours of sleep is normal, 6 hours is great, and 8 hours is just too much now. Makes great for raid nights.
---
Because something you guys don't seem to understand is there's alot more to this game than a few weeks of world pvp lol. Transferring to a tiny server so you can wreck noobs sounds like a great idea until you're 5 people short of a raid group and the only 5 people available on the server and mouthbreathing turds that can't be trusted. Now you're fucked for the rest of the game, gg.
---
My first UBRS run the truestrike shoulders dropped, rolled against 4 others and won with a 29, was so hyped. Worst part is most other people were almost prebis and I was all greens
---
He means the fireball dot gets removed
---
I am very quickly realizing that I cant not handle these late night raids
---
I wanted to lay down in bed at 630pm....
---
Yeah no one who has worked in the business could possibly theoreize about the mystical ways of Blizzard. Shut up and stop posting you oscillating moron.
---
Bindings for Thunderfury
---
Works
---
There are 50 healers per Tank out there. And Tanks dont need ANYTHING from Strat. So why would they run it? You'd prefer spending 5 hours getting a group instead?
---
Nope too boring. When I go ham things get wrecked and everyone is happy. If tank leaves I replace him doing the same as I do as dps :)
---
You can't run a census anymore that capability has been durable for over a month, so not sure where your numbers are coming from.
---
Combine faction locked transfers with faction specific queues. If a server is 70% horde 30% alliance, only allow slightly more horde online than there are alliance and put the rest of the horde in a queue, open transfers for horde only to a server with the opposite situation like heartseeker. Alliance don't have to be out numbered, horde don't have to be overpopulated, even weirdos who enjoy playing the overpopulated faction have a reason to xfer off.
---
Absolutely
---
A layer or server can only support so much load.
---
Player capacity depends on the server capacity and the load-per-player. If neither increase, it can't go up.
---
The early capacity increases were possible because load-per-player dropped massively as people spread out so that there weren't thousands of players in the same zone any more. Stacking many players together scales server load exponentially while having players spread out alone in the world scales it near linearly.
---
I see this posted often and it's complete bullshit. There is no possible way that every single pvp server across all realms with exception of one came out horde dominate by accident. Everyone claims to be the one following their friends but reality shows something very different.
---
Got it after 53 runs. Carapace, MH and oh all dropped. I got finkles that run too.  Hope.
---
I was thinking it looks like one of those climate protests xD
---
Faction specific queues, someone playing horde on one of the insanely imbalanced 90/10 servers would be sitting in queue for hours when they could xfer to a similarly sized alliance favored server and play instantly.
---
Lol I doubt anyone is happy with your bullshit. Might as well replace the tank with another dps. Honestly, as a tank, I wish you idiots would just get a 4th dps to begin with. I hate getting duped into babysitting your groups.
---
If there's a caster in the group you really have to rely on LOSing him so you dont get hit with spells, and even then its tough taking on that many same lvl mobs
---
&gt; It could act as the springboard to another 10+ year content journey (albeit a riskier option).
---
Except they've got pretty much that amount of time laid out in existing content.
---
They could easily go from Vanilla - Cataclysm and spend nearly 10 years doing it in Classic and spend that whole time building a new game.
---
Their IP isn't going anywhere. They just proved they didn't even need to make a new game to breath life into the community.
---
I doubt they are worried about the long term potential.
---
... Go to blizzards website.
---
The majority of servers is PvP (19 PvP vs 4 PvE servers) and about 60/40horde/alliance across the board on PvP servers, with a few (one?) outliers. 
---
PvE servers are alliance dominated, but I doubt this will offset the amount of overall horde players.
---
I don’t really care when I tank myself. I just use taunt on CD. And if dps grabs aggro it’s their fault. 
---
Healer works overtime but they is their call. Tanking and healing is stress as fuck but that’s just the way it is:)
---
Just saying you can't play horde on a horde dominated server and complain about the inbalance, and concurrence in your own faction. You have the solution at hand, if you decide not to take it then stop complaining. It just takes some big guilds to make healthy servers.
---
And they make servers for 10-20k. Smart devs
---
Oh yea, if the 0 watching streamers playing wow weren't enough spamming this subreddit... lets all watch a dude asleep at the login screen.
---
18 vs 38
---
Thrall wants to go balls deep in Jaina.
---
39th run scholo haven’t seen witchblade yet. I feel your pain. One time wand dropped and i lost also
---
She fly in air phase 2 and shoot fireball at highest threat going down the list and reseting each persons threat that’s targeted. 
---
When you’re doing ony splits (20ish people) either have a fury warrior that didn’t get fireballed tank her when she lands or the main tank gathers whelps from one side and no one touches them and he builds his threat back up hopefully not taking long enough to where the main tank gets fireballed a second time. Do a combination of these 2 methods and it’ll be a joke.
---
Yea it will. 
---
Blizz will either continue the expansions (trash idea) or create new content (sketchy....but possibly ok).
---
Either way it will still be around.
---
The biggest problem with this is that it still spams you, it just doesn't pop up in the middle of the screen, instead your chat box is spammed with "YOU HAVE DECLINED JOINING OOGABOOGABUYMYGOLD GROUP!"
---
I guess it's better than having it pop up in the middle of your screen.
---
You're overcomplicating it. Blizzard gets to limit the server capacity to whatever number they choose regardless of the load. If the load gets too high there will be lag, but the load does not set the server capacity. The servers right now are more full then they can handle to give players a smooth gameplay experience and blizzard could increase server capacity if they wanted but it would hurt performance. It's not "impossible". I mean there is a limit where the servers will completely crash but blizzard gets to choose how close they get to ride that line.
---
Captain Tauren is on the case!
---
Do you think I have time to take down another NS/HOTW druid? We're a pain in the ass to kill as it is...
---
I did. It is not there as far as I see. The support stub is two months old. If you know the parameters, speak up please
---
They can set the server capacity to whatever they want yes, it's just a question of how often they want to have gamebreaking server performance problems.
---
You'll see a huge amount of complaints on this subreddit especially from people on the larger servers about that already and it will get a lot worse without layers.
---
And now you are on the side with the 7:1 number advantage. Feelsgood right?
---
Definitely brut MH Mirah OH crus on both this shit increased my dps by insane amounts now I’m just praying for viskag :(
---
Picture not dark enough.
---
Clearly thousands of people agree with me or they wouldn't do it
---
My gear is pretty good and I have been winning many rolls. But I still don’t have the scarlet tabard that I would have swapped all my gear for. Looks before best gear imo. But the game does not like me too.
---
Did a few with a warrior yesterday, he was 60 and i a 60 holy priest, we 2man pretty easy, i say for level 52 you do need a group, or at least a mage because those packs can stack damage pretty fast.
---
Also pay attention when u run up to the arena, you are only 52 and you run close by some packs with fire elementals, they hurt.
---
The nearest Alliance graveyard is usually at the other side of the map.
---
On Grobb, a server with near 50-50 balance (think it was like 51% alliance), I find PvP frustrating enough. I couldn’t imagine it on a server that had that kind of imbalance. I’m really liking the decision to roll RPPvP, as RP skews Alliance and PvP skews horde and they balance out pretty well.
---
Nice thanks man! Gl with that
---
Give us classic+ !
---
I'm in the same situation.  You all think Dal'rend MH + Brut Blade OH is better than Brut Blade MH + Mirah's OH?
---
Correct use of nsfw? Helping the community?   Have an upvote
---
You either force me or I will make 100% selfish decisions;) and I am not alone. Balance can only be obtained if it’s done by blizzard themselves.
---
Brut mh and mirah oh is def better
---
More that current blizzard, as a company, is far 2 incompetent to pull it off
---
I shouldve unlearned mining and replace it with herb after i got engi to max and i shouldve leveled my mage twink
---
Only the mounted guards in EPL will fight IIRC.
---
I mean in classic as well. He can’t be the first
---
Congrats. 🙂 I need 70 mithril and then I'm done as well. Did you farm in Arathi?
---
Yeah we're on the same page here. Our point of disagreement is that I think you were arguing that layers are not a fraction of total server pop? But why not? Nothing you've said here rules that out
---
Pride comes with many faces. The important thing is that it feeds your self esteem:)
---
If 30 is old you got a bad time ahead of you 😂
---
And now here in classic, the reason this bug is only being addressed now is...? No way this guy is the first to have it
---
It’s definitely a float and not an integer, and the value that is displayed is the truncated value
---
That doesn't change my point at all even if that is true
---
Their updates for DPS gear isn't as large as rogues imo, but they also only have like 6 upgrades in MC and every single one is fought over by every other melee class.
---
Oh I did, sure. Does blizzard? Go on, ask yourself that, answer it honestly. You want this to be a problem about me, but it isn’t.
---
Ah, wasn't sure if that was the case or not, since sometimes they wouldn't for me
---
I've explained that part several times, mostly quoting Blizzard who did the same
---
* Lots of players in different zones/layers = server load increasing linearly with player count
---
* Lots of players in the same zone = server load increasing exponentially with player count
---
The second option forces FAR lower player caps to avoid gamebreaking server performance problems.
---
A giant world filled with endless pointless grind is exactly what wow is tho. It would just be that, but more.  
---
And i dont see why "dead". If the world is too big you can have less servers and more people on each worlds?
---
That would lead to giant living world filled with "endless pointless grinds" which is basically the game.
---
A blue post saying that “a secondary determination is made” is basically a non-answer that means “we don’t want to tell you.” Don’t pretend like this means they make a secret hidden roll instead of using a float in the first place
---
&gt; Assuming I’m good and holding aggro, what level would I stop being accepted as a tank for 5 mans? I’m looking to do something out of the norm for fun. :D
---
Shaman Tanks are my speciality, so I'll share my two cents on the matter. Shaman Tanks are viable and YES they can get enough mitigation and health to be able to tank Raids. I suggest reading this https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150 Dungeons are very trivial, you could tank dungeons with a 2h weapon. Raids on the other hand are more fun. Recently, all of MC was tanked by a Shaman Raid Tank.
---
you realise that some (a lot of) people REALLY enjoy hardcore progression raiding, right?
---
This
---
Thank you! Maybe that's the point though?
---
People were hsing FR on Vael? It was a 3 minute dps race you should wear your best dps gear.
---
Is horde on stalagg kinda boring? From my perspective the alliance doesnt offer any sort of challenge. Its frustrating as ally because if Im ever trying to go to MC or BRD there usually a gank squad so i have to body hop a few times to get to the instance. Other places in the world horde are mostly chill, but not always (Washed Up is scum as far as Im concerned). Every now and then ally will make an effort to hold some ground (and thats what I want in WPvP, both factions able to hold their own) but most of the time horde just outnumber us by at least 2 to 1.
---
But i disagree. Because i have a neat trick up my sleeve. I made a guild. And we run MC raids. And since im raid leader... well i always get a spot
---
It's not that Paladin is significantly stronger than Shamans. It's just that even a bad Paladin, can still provide high value in the form of blessings and auras. A melee raiding with even the worst Paladin can extract blessing of might, kings and salvation before a pull. Then that Paladin can heal without having to do that in combat, doesn't matter if the scrub paladin heals the wrong target.
---
Try getting a scrub Shaman to drop the totems in a timely manner, in range of the targets he is supposed to be buffing and then heal competently. Both players can provide 60 fire resistance, but the paladin can do so in a 40 yard radius and apply it before the pull happens, the Shaman can only do it in 30 yards.
---
''Pugs are easier on Alliance'' is a better way of putting it. These issues don't really exist in decent guilds.
---
&gt; Good question. It’s super viable at low level, but not sure when that stops being the case.
---
Half way-ish into Naxx. (It will depend on how certain naxx bosses are coded)
---
Happy to answer anymore questions.
---
I want to see a massive bug list
---
Realm cap can't entirely limit peak load unless you're unreasonably cautious in setting the number, it's just the first line of defense
---
Yes, but it still buffs me. Could have broken it up to 2 pie charts or a Venn diagram - just feels icky as is.
---
Correct answer is brutality blade and thrash blade
---
Women need more sleep than men. Maybe logical since they tend kids and that is hard as fuck. I am happy to work as long as my wife tend the kids:)
---
Good luck with Phase 5 war effort in a 95-5 server.
---
This is a brick wall situation imma stop
---
no i just want tbc everything else i dont care about
---
60-40 is already brutal. It means there's 50% more of the dominant force. Retail server trends show us that imbalanced servers only get worse, especially reaching certain tipping points.
---
so i think it's worth the investment
---
&gt; True, with how broken Ony has been on Tuesday we accidentally tanked phase 3 with a shadow priest lol. No one could pull aggro even even when the priest was oom!
---
The limits of a priest raid tank is up t'ill AQ. Naturally, it will demand a great deal of effort on your part for it to be possible.
---
Happy to answer any more questions!
---
I wonder if Gnomes are really wise or just intelligent. Trying to reason Horde is pointless.
---
Results aren't 100% accurate
---
Exactly which is why the realm cap doesn't get tuned every hour. We agree on a lot but I still don't understand what any of this has to do with your base point that layers are not fractions of server pop. Why not?
---
You know battlegrounds are not P2 right?
---
lol but its ok to charge for portals and what not?
---
why does it make someone a greedy scumbag if they are selling a service?
---
See, the thing about numbers is how little people pay attention to them.  A 60/40 H:A ratio means Horde have 50% more players than the Alliance. Alliance is already fucked on servers with that ratio yet people don’t seem to think 60/40 is that bad. Pfff, fuck that.  
---
I was a die hard believer in PVP servers when I started playing during Vanilla and all the way through when I quit retail during MoP.  Always rolled Horde. 
---
Classic isn’t even remotely fair for Alliance players on PVP servers.  For the first time in my time playing this game, I’m considering rerolling on a PVE server just so these micropeen asshat teenager Horde players will stop ganking me when I’m 20 levels below them and obviously just trying to mind my own business. Fuck everything about this setup.
---
Just get a tank friend to res some orbs for u
---
Classic+. 
---
Classic already fulfils the nostalgia criteria enough.
---
The spitting out of content and people knowing about it all already makes it both hasty, unchallenging and very predictable. Just going through the motions.
---
It's just a logical principle, the state of every player needs to be communicated to every other player. So n players near each other require n^2 state communications.
---
The design of classic wow dictates a minimum complexity of n^2, so these other complexity based 'solutions' are simply not applicable. In order to make it work, you can reduce the cost of processing a player, and/or increase the servers capacity. Blizzard seems to have gone in the wrong direction on both fronts over time, leading to the current situation where a server can't keep up with the expected usage.
---
Some purists might like to complain that this offers only linear performance improvements, but they forget that big O has an implicit constant term which you can often reduce, and n is at most about 100. Also, private servers have already proven these numbers of players are practical and Blizzard has just dropped the ball on code performance and server hosting.
---
The priest won the roll. That's why they deserve the 200 gold. Why is that so hard to understand? No one gets fucked over. You literally can't get ninjaed if you always roll Need on blue BoEs and epics. You roll and if you win, you win. If you lose then someone else wins and you have no call to whine about it.
---
Its more like int and spell dmg for pve :)
---
His comment was about hordelets whining and then you replied and did exactly that. Surely you see why your comment is hilarious.
---
Looks like almost everyone who support this is playing server-majority faction.
---
Of course they will be ok with that, they don't have their choice removed.
---
The choice is removed from the minority, and so its they that need to be asked. And if the minority is being transferred away - this is their answer.
---
Then my wife loves me for something else;)
---
they could do both you know...if i were them i would keep the current classic as is.
---
Then set up servers for a classic +
---
Some progression servers which will be wiped.
---
And then TBC servers, then you can have your pick of what you want to do and not have people pissed off.
---
Easy. Sideways progression. Instead of invalidating Naxx gear they just add another raid that gives gear thats just as good.
---
Holy shit. I have a parrot named Casey. She's a blue fronted Amazon though. Also hangs with me when I play.
---
Who and why even creates this shit? I don't believe anyone plays this.

I regretted leveling a rogue while I was gearing him cause of all the "reserved" issue. Now that I managed to get what I wanted I love it. The class is superfun, both pve and pvp, and it does a lot of damage. The only downside is that you can't pve and pvp with 1 spec (I mean, you can, but your efficiency will be bad).
---
Almost all pvp servers are horse dominated. Almost all pve servers are alliance dominates. Horde has kickin pvp racials, alliance has paladins. I think the motivations are clear.
---
Crusader, no doubt
---
TBC had it right IMo. You could just spam BGs and eventually you’d get decent gear that let you hold your own in PvP and get by in PVE. 
---
I remember it taking a bit longer to get a full set. When I last played in WOD a full set was a couple of days of playing, but TBC took a few weeks (did I remember that right?) 
---
Whether we get TBC or Classic+ I would like to see a system where it takes a very long time to grind honour gear, but you don’t lose progress. I wouldn’t mind taking 5 months to get a full epic set if I knew I could get it just playing casually.
---
Most people ratios are extremely unreliable. There won't be 20 minute BG queues for horde. You're delusional if you think so. The most recent census put overall horde and alliance at something like 55/45. Horde will get 5 minute queues at the worst. 
---
But whatever. No point in discussing it anyway. We will see soon enough.
---
It's bizarre how Blizzard acknowledgment of the problem (overall) was limited to the Hall of Fame achievement. It's something that makes me very salty. I don't want to play Horde, but if I wanted to do something competitive in retail, it's that or run into recruitment problems. It spilled into Classic and Blizzard did nothing when they could (queues, transfers).
---
my personal opinion is (based on 10+years of wow sub) they have to skip p2 and add battlegrounds. that reduce the server load, peoples can start twink alts and peoples who don't want do pvp on that given moment like on the chain of u/lbrs will not be forced to do it. world pvp is cancer if no goal like get a worldboss, etc. nothing else just mass ganking.
---
it means the model and texture for the unit needs to be loaded locally
---
I play for looks. But blizzard was smart. They made many bis the most good looking;)
---
Just pick up where Naxx left off: Kharazan. We even got Atiesh to port us there. But I mean the "real" Kharazan, crypts and all.
---
Then there's Uldum. Then Hyjal and original Caverns of Time.
---
So much content still to release without having to go to Outland and its flying mount bullshit.
---
If they release TBC, then Orgrimmar and Ironforge will be ghost towns.
---
The OSRS world PvP problem. It’s not 2005 anymore, people arent PvPing for fun. They have a goal they want to meet and will meet it as fast as possible, regardless of how little fun either party has.
---
World PvP in MMOs doesn’t work anymore. People have ruined it with their inability to treat WoW (and other MMOs) like a game instead of a way of life.
---
This argument has been answered so many times now it really is getting old. Private servers have no obligations when it comes to server security infrastructure. The game engine is old as fuck, and is the sole reason(imo) why sharding has to exist in modern Wow. Blizzard bent over backwards to create the authentic vanilla experience, so do you really think they would decide to leave this kind of issue in if it was easily solvable?
---
No offence mate but you haven’t actually said anything other than “no swords better”, so I think that’s probably a good idea.
---
The thing is, you’re asking the leadership that brought us to today’s state of the game, to suddenly do an awesome job at Classic+. If you go the TBC -&gt; WotLK route, the game doesn’t get too fucked until the last part of WotLK. Not to say I didn’t enjoy parts of every expansion after, but they never stuck like Vanilla/TBC/most of WotLK.
---
Point being, if you ask these people seriously to do Classic+, you’re fast forwarding towards BfA state of the game within months, at best a year from the moment they start releasing. While going the ‘easy’ route guarantees the old school quality of things we’re gonna get.Blizz are never gonna do the Runescape thing. Those guys actually care about their players and know they rely on the players as much as the players love to play their game.
---
I AM FORSAKEN
---
So you don’t have to care do you?;)
---
Why
---
&gt;do you really think they would decide to leave this kind of issue in if it was easily solvable?
---
Blizzard has constantly moved away from optimisation. They had plenty of time to figure out work arounds, and did none. 
---
What evidence do you have to suggest that the added supposed security features are what is causing such lag? 
---
Or is that meaningless speculation?
---
How are ratios done by census unreliable? It's actually more reliable than anything we have, especially if done often. 
---
No point discussing because you call me delusional while proving to be wrong in basically every claim you've made. 
---
The census you mention is the Wowhead one which had very incorrect data. Like everything with Classic, they rushed content without double checking and without amending the incorrect information.

They are reducing the online player caps and offering transfers away from the overpopulated Realms.
---
Bit of a change of topic but I've been thinking about rolling horde on Grobb. How do you guys find it?

How's the PvP and rp on horde side?:)

Classic doesn't have Blood Elves.

Maybe level an alt to 35 for alch? That's what I did.

Auctioneer is not automating anything. It takes effort to make use of it.
---
Spy however? Yeah it's stupid and should be broken by Blizzard. It is going to provide a huge advantage to people. I mean it already does. It's not even like it take's effort to use it like Autioneer. You just automatically get the alert.
---
I'd like to see an example of Spy from vanilla please.
---
The moment they announce TBC, I just cancel my Sub. No interest in redoing the flawed expansion cycle, such a waste of time
---
That's cute, try being alliance on Gehennas EU. It feels like like it's 80-90% horde as they have taken over all zones. I have never played on a server this bad, if it wasn't for my guild I had left long ago.

---
&gt;Yeah people throwing around random ratios on reddit is totally reliable.
---
&gt;The most recent census put overall horde and alliance at something like 55/45.
---
I have the census of my server, done 2-5 times a day at the same time a Horde player did it on his side. We have very reliable numbers and they differ from the Wowhead ones, which had basically the same source, but they didn't bother crosschecking. You can find similar info in probably any server Discord.
---
You're right, there's no point discussing. You're very far from being able to actually discuss something.
---
It kind of is. College and University are the new high school if we're talking about how far a diploma will take you. In addition those who graduate from College or University make on average 10k more than those who don't. Of course that could relate more to the class of people going into university and college rather than the actual outcomes of getting a higher education, but like, its important. Going to College or University especially if you don't start off rich is giving yourself a leg up whether your degree applies to your career or not. Learning is always valuable and dumb pieces of part have power in our societies whether we like it or not.
---
The Dunning-Kruger effect was strong with this one.
---
What is spy?
---
Wada is a G
---
Well seeing as how everybody unaminously supports this, we should have it in about a decade of being told we think we want it but we don't.
---
Problem is after you get full naxx gear you just going to blow through it likes it mc.  If you add any new raids to classic people might be expecting them to have the difficulty factor of mythic retail
---
I think it’s more that some wanted to change Classic into a Megaserver game and convinced themselves Blizzard would not reduce the caps. Often, people will take the conclusion they want and work backwards to get it. Just a human thing.
---
Or let you mount if you aren't flagged for pvp

What is the max range you can get for attacking spells? With the talent?

No way in hell

Priest is the best class in the game, and the most important in PvP as they are the only reliable magic dispell. Protect your Priest (Shamans NS them before they die)
---
I know this is an old comment, but for whatever reason I am seeing it. Just wanted to say that I am so damn new to the game. My boyfriend got me into it for the release of WOW Classic, and I LOVE it. It is so much fun - the levelling by quests, dungeons, the fucking grind...it's all pretty great.  Like you said, it IS fun and it IS a vast world to explore. Anytime you do anything more than a few times is bound to get boring.
---
I just hope people can remember the excitement of the "first time", because I will not :)
---
However at least here most people complain about the speed. Shows that it is loud minority out of the reddit population that complains.
---
Skeram what up, love seeing wada randomly out and about
---
Good to know, thanks for the info!!
---
Did you guys noticed that the issue is nostly in US?
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/GUID
---
Almost but not quite - for players it's given to every character, based on time of character creation. This number does not change throughout WoW's lifecycle. For every other character, npcs, instanced or not, a new ID is given for every respawn. I believe ot works the same way in Classic, but I could be wrong. 
---
I should add though, that I have not checked the GUID threat resetting of Ony's fireballs specifically (i.e. looked up both players' GUID beforehand and see who gets their threat reset). A common alternative explaination (rumour?) is also that, if multiple people are hit by a fireball, only the person with the lowest threat gets their threat reset - which of the two ideas are true I don't know, but the GUID sound plausible to me, at least.
---
In any case, having two tanks soak up every fireball targeted at the maintank, and you should be fine (*and* avoid the fireballs targeted at other players, in case the GUID explanation is true, I suppose), leaving the threat of one of the two tanks intact.
---

Are warriors really that awesome? Care to share your experience?
---
Dont say that, I initially planned to play tank and sold thrash blade :'(
---
Thanks mate, I meve r played a warrior in vanilla (Holy priest) so I'm learning as I go
---
This sounds like exactly the system i want to use. Is there any way you can show me your specific values?bitem costs, dkp per boss etc? That would be super helpful.
---
I would love it but think of it from blizz point of view.  Most people will be ok with tbc.... and tbc is like fuck all work for them compared to classic+ which is a large amount of work.
---
The likelihood of classic plus happening instead of tbc is basically zero.
---
Is Arty the rogue  a Texan named Chuck?
---
If horde can't find alliance to honor farm, they may set up shop somewhere killing lowbies to provoke a response. Unless you're dungeon farming I don't think there will be a best time to level until bgs
---
Yeah people hating on dm release just shows how ridiculous their opinions can be. It has minimal effect on raid strength and would provide almost nothing if released later. Sure complain about pvp coming but hating on dm release makes you look like someone who just complains because they enjoy complaining.
---
Gosh was wod launch bigger than wrath launch?
---
Lolbbq was my first choice name until it was taken.
---
Yeah at that point they should just update the flight paths or let you hail a passing Griffin if you're close enough to a path.
---
I'm 60, I play around 30 hours some weeks, most weeks more like 15-20. I think it's moving way too fast. I've cleared MC once and haven't leveled proffesions yet, also 400g away from epic Mount
---
Did you need any points into the improved stealth talents?
---
I was ganked the first time I went to moonglade. I was pretty mad
---
Classic+ would be great, but blizzard would run it straight into the ground just like retail. Mark my words. I have no trust in this company anymore. They’ve lost all of their good devs who poured their heart and soul into the game.
---
Give me TBC. We know it was already good.
---
#nochanges
---
Just go play retail if you're somehow unhappy with something that's been in the game for 15 years. Auctioneer? Was there in Vanilla. Parsing combat logs? Was there in Vanilla.
---
Next!

How is it in the gray zone?
---
Congrats on the vendor loot
---
Question for you, how is it finding groups late night? Currently still on stalagg and play at night due to working third shift, and from about midnight until early afternoon trying to find a group for anything is a pain in the ass
---
As I understand it, his point is that even if Blizzard had infinitr hardware resources free, there is still plenty of reason to spread out the playerbase into layers simply from a gameplay/design perspective.
---
30 players queuing up to kill a quest boss still sucks even if you have zero lag.
---
The issue is that people on the overbalance side have been absolute cunts for the last 3 months and are now complaining that people are leaving, what they would much rather is force the very same people they have made leveling miserable for to stay so that their own BG queue and honour grinding is easier.
---
Fuck them
---
If you've been a twat and running rough shod over the smaller faction for months then fuck you, you made your own server a toxic shithole evey time you ganked a low level, camped a FP or killed quest givers to troll. Reroll or shut up.
---
Very sorry for your loss bud. She's in your heart.

In the horde version of this prank they just kill you with 10v1 and corpse camp.

The tooltip for prayer of fortitude says it adds 53 points of stamina, however the buff says stamina is increased by 43. Is this a bug? Or is the final amount modified by something? I'm sure I've seen the buff actually say 55 before.
---
I hate having to interrogate your own faction because you want to help them.
---
&gt;Alliance is EZmode
---
Some people will say the strangest things to justify why they rolled an UD character along with 45% of the realm.
---
As someone with a 3.93 GPA, this is not a winning strategy. At best, you pass.  I see people do this crap all the time
---
No one will do this because they want to be the bigger side, they just want enough targets.
---
This happens way too often, more with quest items for me.
---
Oil of Immolation works wonders for this quest.
---
You wouldn’t transfer to a disadvantaged side. Why do you expect anyone else to?
---
I remember years ago reading some comments that WoW (Vanilla) was so far ahead of everything available then - how true.
---
It seems to be mainly luck finding a guild that's a decent fit, but it does depend on what you are looking for. Look out for strange wording in guild recruitment ads and don't ignore things you don't like the sound of because they are red flags.
---
I ended up joining a guild that was advertised as being for people with families who want to still raid and that's worked out pretty well. Still very luck based though, have one of those GMs that has the perfect attitude to lead a guild and has years of experience running guilds on "other" servers
---
My experience with guiilds that are advertised as being "fun" guilds is that, yes they probably are fun but they also have a tendency to attract people that don't like to commit to even attending a guild 5 man and will struggle to make up a raid roster.
---
Only people that are adamant on tanking should have trouble finding a guild. You should be able to find guilds playing one of the best DPS classes in the game and if anything we are now in the stage of the game where people are dropping out and guilds need replacements :)
---
closest you can get is a macro that if you’re mouse is over something it’ll shackle it as priority, and if you have no mouse over it’ll shackle your current target. these are easy to find online with a google
---
Automatically gathering information you would otherwise have to manually keep a eye on?
---
Nothing, I got lucky (at least so far) that the server me and my friends rolled is not too bad in faction balance.  Probably around 55;45 horde;alliance.  Pretty happy with that since you roll alliance to be the underdog, u just don’t wanna be like 80;20.
---
I heard something that if you switch before doing all profession quests there is a bug where you can't switch to a new. Something like that read it yesterday cant find it again
---
I told you I have my own sources because I compiled the data myself. Do you understand that this is something you can do yourself? 
---
I'm not spouting any random ratios, these are the ratios coming from my own research and the research done by people in the different Discord servers. There was a decent compilation in a now-deleted spreadsheet called "realm_balance". Wowhead took the data from a website where people submitted their LUA files without taking into account all the potential factors that could skew it. They didn't bother cross-checking with updated information found in Discords. That's why their data was terribly wrong. They also included level 1s, inactive players and so on.
---
You can go into any random server right now and do a census. If it's a normal server, you can repeat the census at night and I can guarantee you that the ratios are very similar.
---
But this would require you having to do something yourself and use your brain. Are you up for it?
---
Does mages iceblock break the stun affect?
---
It’ll be an excellent time to level an alt as long as you are leveling below level 48
---
Ill give you one more chance to reconsider your OBVIOUS mistaken position before i drop a hilariously basic, elementary math equation that proves that that is EXACTLY what you were saying.
---
Imagine how dumb you will look hahahaha.
---
Do damage on hit buffs from both buffs and items, such as Thorns and Lightning Shield, and  Essence Of The Pureflame (etc) work whenever a melee hit it attempted on you, or does it have to contact and cause damage? I.e. miss and dodge wouldn't trigger the damage? How does parry work?
---
It gives an advantage in terms of the information being compiled and displayed for the user, but you're correct, the info is already there.
---
Isn't there an item that gibes you frost and shadow resistance that drops from a basilisk in STV
---
So basically you think Classic players are elitist and that we're somehow not better than retail players. You're saying this in spite of the evidence to the contrary.
---
Vanilla veterans and Private Server players were the driving force behind getting WoW Classic made. We went up against a horde of nay-sayers - including the devs themselves (must I remind you of "you think you do, but you don't"?).
---
Activision Blizzard just had their quarterly earnings call (as is further described over on MMO-Champion.com) where it was revealed that WoW Classic brought back more players than ever before in WoW's history. This means that not only were the Vanilla/Private Server players right about everything, but we were also objectively correct about what makes a good game.
---
In terms of being better than retail players, it all depends. We don't want any changes to a game that is close to being perfect as it is right now (in spite of bugs), yet some retail players are trying their very hardest to bring in "quality of life" changes that in the end will result in this game becoming just a BfA clone at level 60.
---
When we're talking about skill, must I also remind you that Method were unable to not only reach World First level 60 (that was done by a gnome mage named Jokerd from Sweden), but also couldn't clear Molten Core or Onyxia before the Private Server guild "APES" did it.
---
I think your presentation in itself was interesting enough to have me listen to it, but I strongly believe that you're wrong about the premise.
---
That's just me.
---
put a queue cap on the horde side of the total alliance and you'll see transfers pretty quick.
---
6/8 SC is on par, but when you start getting raid gear you lose a huge amount of dps by not having the 6p bonus unless you opt to not use your shiny new raid gear.
---
That’s why the “typical” pre-bis list is better, more flexibility.
---
Warlocks are stupidly hard to fight as a hunter. He only has that cool down to kill you anyway
---
English
---
When you surround yourself with maggots, all that's left in the end will be maggots. Good luck on enjoying the game in the long term because you took the shirt term advantage of grouping with the people willing to be the biggest cunts.
---
My server (Skeram) seems to be one of the few (if not only) server where the tank population is saturated.  Very rarely see anyone looking for tanks with the exception of scholo and DMW.  Often see tanks LF heals/DPS with 1st orb reserve but they take quite a while to fill, if they do at all.
---
Whats stopping them from simply making another retail version? I mean, does anyone actually still trusts blizzards capabilities of making proper games?
---
I certainly dont.
---
Then make it harder than Naxx.
---
&gt; New expansions should not have 10 new levels, but 30 to 50 new levels and large maps. 
---
I'm not sure they have the wherewithal to do that.
---
Go play retail if you want crutches.
---
Classic is vanilla, #nochanges
---
That’s the point. We use computers to automate because they are better and faster than we are. The API is open to read for people to make addons against. How is it unfair to optimise the consumption or usage of available information?
---
Clings onto? You're a presumptuous dick. We have literally no indication of classic+ or TBC don't pretend like one is the default possibility.
---
TBC introduced flying, so fuck TBC. Also the capital city in BC was really garbage, and the only good raid was kara. If the servers change to TBC this guy at least will leave. That's of course all just my opinon
---
I would suggest firing up the old wowhead. Scroll a pretty bit down to get to BiS loot list, which dungeon/boss you can get them or which profession etc. Helped me alot!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
Theres plenty of changes already
---
As someone with a 2.93 GPA, this is a pretty amazing strategy. At best, you get a degree. I don't see enough people doing this crap
---
I mean this just isn’t really true.  Sure sweeping strikes is nice but it’s not up for every pack unless you’re pulling slow as fuck and arguably flurry is better anyway.  There are specific levels where arms is better, for example while using ravager it’s probably better but outside that fury is far superior for keeping threat on multiple mobs while also pumping out great dps.
---
Tbf that has been the standard setup for humanity for the past few hundred thousand years, longer if you keep going back.
---
"Why are you trying to tell me that I can't PvP if I don't want to raid?" 
---
Yes, this is an MMORPG, not a PVP game. If you want to play PVP without having to raid, why not play any of the PVP games? Its unhealthy for a MMORPG that your most efficient playstyle is sitting in town queueing for instanced content.

It's almost universally agreed that you need 1 point in improved shield block for bosses. I know you want to get crit for the trigger but can anyone who's actually experienced, talk about shield use in the rotation.
---

---
&gt;  They want people to come back to retail, not expand the classic base. 
---
Like 1% of people that are playing Classic will ever, ever consider going back to retail because of Classic
---
And wowhead only exists in its form because the information is no available through the api in the same form all the other is.
---
Blizzard made an open api that your lua code can ask for information. That’s why I have a hard time seeing it as unfair. A fishing bot is unfair as the game and/or api do not supply functionality to do it.
---
That sucks! A friend of mine told me they actually roll behind the full numbers. So he might roll an 86.7 while you rolled 86.5.
---
Still sucks tho :/
---
Still op
---
Better yet they should make it so you have to run vista to play wow classic. With a 5 mbps connection and use a quadro fx11000 GPU. #nochanges. Oh and you gotta actually buy wow classic game for 60 dollars and install using cdrom.
---
Yes you should have to raid to do PVP. Explain why u wouldnt play an actual PVP game instead, with actual balance??? 
---
Its unhealthy for an MMORPG that your most efficient playstyle is sitting in town queueing for a instanced room, not once having to leave the town in the open world for no reason.
---
Yeh but he never mentions how shield swapping affects your rotation
---
Where do you get 15 FR on cloak?
---
Nice.
---
Most of us are millenials. A 38 year old is a millenial
---
I'd write an actual response but you clearly don't know how to read.
---
So instead i'll just say this:
---
People know more about WoW now than they did back then.
---
It’s a huge issue - should people not talk about it to appease you?
---
could it be that most people dont want a balanced server and just one where their faction is the dominant one ? I am guessing the most people are casual players with only a couple of hours to spare. so everything that makes their playtime less stressfull benefits them. easier to find groups and steamroll the other faction in pvp
---
You scumbag. What kind of atrocities did you commit in our sacred forest? Death to the forsaken! And death to the horde!
---
Not even remotely.
---
Extinction Rebellion
---
Glad we are pushing the PvP patch with a disgusting amount of PvP related bugs in the game. Some of these bugs would've been hotfixed within 24 hours, back when Blizzard actually cared about players more than dollar signs.
---
They should be implementing faction based realm transfers.
---
Interesting. From my memory Vael was a 3 minute dps race and i dont recall healing to be an issue. Since not wearing FR gear = more damage to raid = require more healing. People die consistently on that fight which means less people that need to be healed as the fight continues.
---
Auctioneer doesn't give you a message the second a snipe is available.

You're thinking of TSM.

I lost hope after 50ish runs im just numbly running it and wake up somewhere during the rend fight now.

Gz on your fake sword though.

It came in a 6 disc set - remember that?
---
All my old farm spots are overrun by horde.  I won't be staying if they open transfers (even paid).  I love to PvP but I hate to always be the underdog.  I just want reasonably similar numbers, even if alliance is outnumbered a bit.
---
Hahahaha, great bait and switch Blizz. You actually had me believing you were fixing the guard spawn rate, which is immensely overtuned compared to Vanilla.
---
Besides if you only want to do PVP, if you want to sit in town queueing for PVP, why not play retail????? If you dont care about the world, the RPG aspects that the game has and the reasons why people prefer classic over retail, why not just play retail?
---
First of all, you wouldn't. The insane amount of information swarming through the logs, makes that impossible to keep up with, while playing the game.
---
I use Spy, because why wouldn't I? It's insanely OP, and should not be allowed.   
---
It gifts you free awareness of things you can't see. I'm leveling a mage by aoeing in the world, and it has saved my arse so many times already.

I haven't had any luck with Warder Stilgiss and his godforsaken [Boreal Mantle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11782/boreal-mantle).

If the fuck is this raging loonball getting upvoted ahahaha
---
If you are standing in a pool of water that reaches your knees, you are knee-deep in water.
---
It is often used as a metaphor for having more of something that you want/intend. I am using it to say I may be too busy playing Classic to have time to play Reforged.
---
If you want to sit in town and just queue for PVP, why not do that on retail? If you dont care about the things that people like classic for and just want to sit in town queueing, why not play retail, retail does the queueing in town for instanced content beautifully.

200-300g.
---
&gt;A source is something you publish online. 
---
No, it's not. Don't make up definitions for words. I have even explained to you how you can become your own source.
---
&gt;Not something you do privately for you. 
---
I shared it with the people on my Discord, as I was running the census at the same time. Some other people ran independent ones as seen [here](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/faction-balance-info-for-some-realms/80423). The data for my realm was similar to that one. 
---
&gt;As long as you don't publish it, with explaining the method you acquired it, it's practically worth nothing.
---
I have told you already how this was done, but I will repeat it so it's very clear. We (me, Alliance player together with a Horde player on the same realm) ran the census addon several times a day (morning, noon, evening, night) for over a week (every day of the week was included), at the same time for maximum accuracy. The census addon uses the /who functionality to count the number of players, their class, race and level. Then it displays it on the screen. [Example](http://cdn-wow.mmoui.com/preview/pvw71309.jpg). From this we got a very fairly accurate picture of the server back then. Via this data we could see that the Horde outnumbered the Alliance at every level range past 20, that the average Horde player was higher level than the Alliance and that, at that point, something like 85% of the level 60s were Horde. 
---
The more you run the addon, the more accurate the information will be. At the moment, only level 60 characters are relevant. The addon can't run the /who command automatically, so it requires more attention. 
---
You can easily run a manual census right now without any addon just using the /who command with some conditioners. Of course it won't be that accurate, but it will give you a fairly good overview. 
---
There was a website where you could upload the LUA file generated by the addon and it would aggregate it into population graphs. This is the website that Wowhead used as a source and it's really fault. There was no control on when the file had been uploaded, by which faction, how often and so on. Wowhead ran with it and didn't bother cross-checking with information that is very easy to obtain (although would take some time).
---
The gatekeeping is strong with this one.
---
I definitely don't want TBC. Looking back, it was the beginning of the shit show. Dead world pvp, new stats needed for pvp, daily quests, it was the beginning of the end.
---
Faerlina already has over an hour queue at prime time and are losing their 2nd layer. People want to play not sit in queue.
---
I've been casually leveling an alt on the side for a while now, and from what I've seen any lvl 60 who goes out of their way to gank lowbies will get bored super fast. There's just not enough low level characters out there anymore. You could literally end up sitting in the Hillsbrad fields for 20 minutes without any Hordes coming through.
---
You are not prepared
---
If you’re a dude you can say goodbye to your testosterone levels sleeping like that. Source: fucked up my own testosterone levels sleeping for 5 hours a night for over a year thinking I was getting almost a whole day more a week than people sleeping for 8+
---
Turns out sleep is very important, who knew?!
---
In that case yeah, I agree. I can also agree that it *spoils* a bit of the World PVP spirit, but that's subjective.
---
I hope you never wrote an academic paper. You can't cite yourself as source. A source is something published anywhere, where people can freely access it to control your claims. You doing something privately is an experiment. You can't cite it as source. And you definitely can't use it as proof for anything, unless you publish it.
---
I'm not saying your numbers for your server are wrong. But your server doesn't matter for future battleground queues. Every server counts for it. PvP and PvE alike. Plus then it also matters who even wants to do battlegrounds in the first place. No data at the moment proofs there gonna be 30 minute queues for horde. And considering the history of the game, there were never so long queues after cross realm battlegrounds got introduced.
---
Boreal Mantle will last you to BWL or Rank 10, so keep farming it.   
---
But for now,  Kentic Amice is better.
---
&gt;Tanking and healing is stress as fuck but that’s just the way it is:)
---
No, no its like that because of dps who don't care.
---
You don't see how parsing an incomprehensible amount of data into something useful in a situation versus other players is an unfair advantage?
---
I like how people complain about spy, but things that LITERALLY LET YOU TRACK BUFFS ON PLAYERS isn't complained about? Y'all okay?          
---
I assume popular streamers haven't been giving their opinions on enemy buff tracker add-ons?
---
Killing somebody below 48 doesnt count as a dishonorable kill. DHKs are only when you kill civilian NPCs
---
"This is I"
---
you can blink out of a stun, dont waste IB on it
---
Shadowlands is WoW 2.0 - it's the overhaul that changes everything how the game is played when a new player starts the game.
---
And yet they've never been able to do something like this. Stop pretending this isn't unprecedented
---
You know where they have more gates? Retail. See? Going there really does solve everything. It totally makes sense for people to constantly suggest others go back for any and every reason.
---
Loot
---
Where can I find a proper sim tool for Classic?
---
It really isn't. Pservers were closer, which says a lot given their myriad of issues.
---
Theres not a lot Blizz can do. If across all servers the balance is 60/40 horde favoured theres no answer to this except maybe giving people game play reasons why they'd want to roll alliance.
---
Unless theres some PvP servers out there that are ally dominated but I dont think there are.
---
Scientific studies of sleep shows that less than 7 hours per night is cognitively impairing and detrimental to longevity. It can impact your lifespan dramatically. 
---
Enjoy being an engineer and making things that don't work in the field so mechanics hate you. Or get proper sleep and use your brain and make practical solutions that are viable on and off the blueprints.
---
And it will remain so forever outside professional world first teams that have an efficiency close to real life special forces. You just have to cope with it:)
---
Dude I fell asleep at like 11 and I woke up at 3:30 and started playing wow because I couldn't sleep xD I'm off for the weekend though woooo I'll just take a nap later during my gaming break xD oh and after I eat my daily meal of meat sticks and doritos lol
---
"enough" ? Yes. But good luck finding a group. that tolerates basically 50% of a DPS class. You basically do less damage then a holy priest trying to DPS.
---
It was blatantly obvious that Herod was going to be heavily horde favored. All of the surveys showed it at 60-70% horde and yet people on this sub still insisted on "muh streamer-free server."
---
That sword and hoj... I didn't even get hopeful when the boss would die. I'd seen it not drop so many times that it's startling when it does drop. At least I could duo farm hoj 5 times an hour.
---
I'd rather see a Warcraft movie like this!
---
Don’t forget Fear Ward which singlehandedly negates the most dangerous mechanic Onyxia has. A good tank who can stance dance is incredibly rare. Don’t ask me why, but most tanks refuse to go berserker stance, even though Ony melee hits for like 20% of their HP.
---
A dwarf priest who would literally do nothing but Fear Ward is still worth taking.
---
My family does not pay me money. So if I want money I will have to get it outside family. 
---
Some guys love to take care of kids and they can do it. If they find a woman that loves to work.
---
I agree that it changes the game of world pvp, and maybe not to the better imo.
---
World boss is like one giant rare mobs. The first group hit and kill it get loot.
---
That giraffe lol
---
No. The data is available to them to do the same and hence not unfair - an equal advantage yes.
---
Alt? My main has just hit 30...ill probably be hitting stv when p2 comes around... Fun times
---
The space is misplaced. The actual title is "ogres layer"
---
It’s not stronger but definitely easier to do well with. RDruid Warr will always be the most common comp in a top 50 list, but almost never the r1 team.
---
Just spam dungeons.
---
Nothing on the warrior discord about it at the moment
---
right now it's super alive. today alone my guild fought another two guilds for gurubashi arena, had a guild dueling tournament, joined a horde raid on Stormwind and Ironforge, defended raids on org and Thunder Bluff. RP wise it's pretty dope too but rather casual which is much to my liking
---
most actual pvp games like bdo (which i play) either start or end up pay to win.
---
and i like the combat in this game. just because wow was mostly PVE to you doesn't mean it was mostly PVE period. BG's, world pvp, and arena were all major parts of the game.
---
This is not a scientific approach approach at all, judging from this video and the documents u linked in the video. I would def recommend you upping your method if you want it to be a university-level analysis / review.
---
So what do you expect now? That we engage on endless discussion, how your privately gathered data is the proof for the overall faction balance of every server in every region?
---
You wont be dw tanking or with a 2h at later levels anyways.
---
Both thorns and lightning shield tooltip say ”when hit”. So misses and dodges do not count and therefore do not cause damage. EoPF however says ”whenever struck” so it burns even if the attack misses. Im not sure does EoPF only proc on melee attacks.
---
No. Slippery slope, this is how we ended up with retail in the first place.
---
Nice and illegal too?
---
This is what they should have done, but Blizzard have really let the faction balance problem rot. I can't believe they are taking no significant action in both Retail or Classic to amend this or at least try to improve the situation. They must consider that it's not a problem at all.
---
They wouldn't force you to play certain faction. In fact during vanilla most players were PvE Alliance. Modern WoW has about 80:20 ratio in Horde favor and it affects Classic as well. Few people like faction reroll.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMqhT8DM
---
Tfw paid realm transfers were ever a thing, like they have a guy walking somewhere with a usb stick and it isn't an automated copying of a few kbs of data.
---
However I agree though that they need to be based on existing faction populations and/or total server population.
---
I do zf zombie runs in 2 pulls. Iceblock, frost nova, flame strike,CoC, AE a few times, CoC, frost nova, flame strike, CoC and AE till they die, i use the mana ruby for both pulls too. Boots minor speed enchant too.
---
This is true, (and for me that is probably going to be Naxx this time around) however there's no doubt that the honor system in vanilla is atrocious. Putting a requirement of 12 hours or rapidly losing all your progress is just stupid.
---
Holy shit, have my poor sleep habits for the past 15 years been the reason I can't grow a beard?!  I should get tested for low T...
---
Me and the other offtank were so caught up protecting group from this guy's skeleton adds (after getting destroyed by them last time ( that we failed to get credit for the boss kill. Little did we know it's take 30 minutes to respawn :0
---
No. This is how we ended up with the abomination that is retail. Small changes here and there over a long time and now retail is a mobile game.
---
AV rep rewards buddy.
---
It shows multi shot bonus dmg as 5 piece on gear in this vid but classic is 8piece? Maybe im just missing something here
---
Hmmm no ? I dont' get why I'm being downvoted. All I'm saying IS shut the fuck up if you can't back up what you're saying with tangible informations. I'm not saying he's right or wrong but presenting things like he know WTF is going on behind the scene.
---
Yeah, this is what i did. Put on passive and just do any dungeon. I did strat ud for rep and seems pretty popular, even easier when u say you dont want gear
---
Mhm we have heard all these arguments before. And then we were left with retail as a result. 
---
No changes. You want new models, go to retail.
---
The lag isn't a ping issue. Your clients requests are getting to the server same as theirs. It's the severs response that's delayed which is why in some of those videos the pov character is able to move freely while everyone else is standing still, then rubber banding around. That's the server responding and your client updating your view of everyone else. I live close to Chicago as well and regularly see &lt;20 ping, but when 10+ raids are in the same render area everything just crawls to a stop.
---
Druid tanks are actually awesome for spellcleave as they're great for AoE threat, have an instant cast ranged pull with FF and a battle rez and innervate if things go wrong
---
FeelsBadMan :(
---
You're surviving on 10 hours of work per week?  The fuck do you do?
---
"It's totally not an unfair advantage, you can just use the same add-on or make your own!"
---
"Automatic healbot where you just tap a button to perfectly heal isn't unfair, you can just make your own or use it."
---
"Botting isn't unfair, you can just make your own or use it!"
---
"Gold buying isn't an unfair advantage, you can just buy it or farm your own."
---
Your argument is so fucking stupid it's straight up hysterical.   
---
I sure hope you are being dishonest, because the alternative is being too stupid to functionally live in society.
---
&gt;we're just getting TBC itself
---
We were also supposed to get just Vanilla, but here we are talking about TBC. And when TBC is here, we'll be having 1000+ threads on whether we should go straight to WotLK or somehow integrate it via TBC+.
---
The point is, once the ball is rolling, there's no stopping it. There is no way that you can guarantee that TBC will somehow be the red line that'll satisfy everyone, when there are hundreds of thousands of people glamoring for WotLK, Cata etc.
---
There's like 2 servers with the bigger faction isn't horde by a huge margin you can just saw "if you're horde and do that"
---
Because humans already have sword spec and stealth detection. Undead doesnt have much outside of will.
---
Yuck, I hate ARPGs
---
Casuals and their filthy jobs
---
Dal Rends are pre-bis for hunters, once P3 comes out. Agi enchant is sick.
---
There are only 3 EU PvE servers, while Nethergarde is also layered, it's the lowest populated of the 3.
---
Yeah I couldn't loot a drake for the ony prequest (obvious bug) and GM told me I was in a raid group. Yeah no shit I was in a raid group, it's a raid quest all other drakes worked perfectly fine and my whole group could also loot it
---
That’s right! Blizzard incompetence. So glad you can see that.
---
Eh here I was thinking that I picked horde just cause I think trolls look cool and I like the mounts. Guess I was wrong!
---
Thanks, this was what I was wondering. I guess it’s also similar in that if the whole raid that had the first tag dies then another raid can tag it while it is still not at full health?
---
It's all situational. If you're in a situation where the Cold blood evis will kill the opponent and you're otherwise likely to die, it can be worth it.
---
This hit hard. My bird died a year ago next month. I still think about him every day.
---
She was really lucky to have you.
---
Except Paladins are way better than shamans in BGs and group PvP, so it's not that black and white of a decision. If I played warrior I would definitely rather be alliance because a paladin makes me unstoppable.
---
Tell Kasey she is a good bird from me!
---
Can I borrow your tin foil hat some day or are you using it a lot? I'd like to feed my paranoia using that hat
---
That's my point, you do have the choice. Again Vanilla always had repeatable quests, for example the cauldrons in WPL.
---
You can do them if you so choose, or take a pass on them. It doesn't always need to be done.
---
I don't see the argument being made here. You can absolutely get by without doing any sort of repeatable or daily in both Vanilla and TBC. 
---
The argument originally was that someone made a comment saying they would leave if Vanilla got content like this. It's incorrect and a staple of the classic community. They pretend to know about Classic and are vocal about how it should be handled, but they really have no clue what it had and didn't have.
---
At the end of the day, if you don't want or like dailies, that's fair and you're entitled to that opinion.
---
Thank you for making my point. Of course, I am neither a Boomer nor a Millennial.
---
The right one looks better?
---
Show me on the doll where the horde touched you.
---
Most people get revered with Argent Dawn for the +5 fire resist enchant for shoulders. Exalted unlocks the +5 all resists too.
---
Have fun with bg que times on a 70:30 server 😂
---
I don't expect anything from you to be honest, seeing as you're incapable of holding yourself to the same standard you hold others.
---
Just level then.. this is a non issue lol
---
Oger*
---
I liked the idea of Dalaran, but making it the hub for all of the game was a mistake. I feel like it should’ve been another quest hub
---
what’s the balance on arc reaper?
---
Your life sounds like absolute garbage but ok
---
Imagine being this stupid.
---
I completely understand what you are saying, the point I'm making seems to just fly over your head.
---
No one is saying this is easy, it's not. A lot of people are playing classic wow for the mmo feels. Blizzard is getting paid to provide classic *nochanges*, while their have been many they have stayed true. World pvp has and always will be the end game content for many players, aka; the entire reason they are playing the game.
---
When the end game is broken and unplayable (as little as a 10v10) can start to lag and create choppy gameplay, this is a broken product were paying for. The original classic wow ran fine.
---
You keep talking about meticulous logging and checks on every action, if this is what's causing it, then it's unnecessary and can be removed. If it's not it's the engine, if it's the engine it needs to be fixed, the longer they wait the more people quit. Yes it would be hard and expensive, but that is what they are getting paid millions per month to do.
---
For anyone wanting Broken Tooth, 5am server time is a good time to look for him . He was being camped by multiple hunters one night so I went to bed . Woke up the next morning and he was just sitting there in the first spawn I checked.
---
I’m very pro classic+ and filling out all the empty zones that were initially scraped for TBC. However if they are going to add anything to the rerelease of vanilla my bet would be on a form of  classic TBC. Could be that the add the lvl cap and make all classic servers TBC like before or they make another set of servers with the TBC and all new toons start at 58. 
---
I’ve been disheartened about Blizzard’s lack of effort and resources devoted to the Wow classic launch. And am starting to believe that as much as we all hope for new content, there won’t be any. I really hope I’m wrong but who ever is calling the shots doesn’t have the soul of the game in mind like the original creators. 
---
No matter what they do there are going to be large obstacles to overcome, and lots of ppl will be upset. It’s the nature of the beast. I wouldn’t be surprised if they say there will be nothing after phase 6 and give us phase 6 after 11 months at that. 
---
Either way I’m really enjoying classic and so grateful to have it like it once was even if it’s not exactly the same.
---
I think the plan right now is wait and see how the servers look in six months or so... Have you tried opening a ticket and asking for a sever transfer?
---
Exactly this. Create the group yourself and do the searching helps a ton and I find it to be somewhat more successful than lookig for one.
---
That server has had free character transfers [since September](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295184/free-character-transfers-for-eu-classic-wow-servers-coming-on-september-20th). Why are you trying to spread misinformation?
---
You are delusional, retail pve and pvp players poop on all private server players. Method was never going for WF. Apes would get smashed by Method if they went into retail and attempted to compete with them.
---
Wada is a LAD
---
If I was Blizzard, I would release TBC and Wrath and then go with Wrath+.
---
Um no eventually paid transfers were a thing back in the day ...
---
gnome's sketchy. back to you guys
---
This is exactly what occurs every Tuesday and Thursday at my house. Exactly.
---
I mean isn't that what a mmo rpg is? Its trying to make those stats as good as possible.
---
And hence since it's not built in the client, but a 3 party creation it gives a edge. 
---
You cannot decipher all that information manually so you automate it, for easier gameplay and a advantage. 
---
If those addons were purely UI or cosmetic would they be as popular?
---
"The Black Pearl had no survivors."
---
"No survivors? Where did the stories come from I wonder?"
---
I have not noticed any difference from 5set or without. The pull strat makes a difference though in if they're linked or not
---
No they don’t. Please point me to where blizzard states you cannot traverse the combat log?  
---
Since they provide api fictions COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED and COMBAT_LOG_EVENT which addons can query?
---
From perspective of someone who hasn’t played retail since Cata, and only seen the shadowlands release trailer— could you elaborate?
---
You owe your future self some quality sleep. Try setting bedtimes and being strict about quiet after hours. 
---
https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/circadian_rhythm.htm
---
I never did any Raid, and this will probably be a dumb question, but it interests me:
---
A raidgroup are 40 players right? If the Group killed ragnaros for example, will/can 40 people roll on the loot? Is that the reason, why the endgear is so rare?
---
Cosmetic addons are pretty danm popular. Blizzard has api functions for getting the log man. Read the api description.
---
Guilds nowadays mean nothing
---
Exactly - don’t start a guild unless you want to *run* a guild. It’s a lot more work than you’d think.
---
Proper spellcleave setup is Warlock for Eye, priest to shield eye/Heal people, and 3 mages for AoE madness.
---
I bet you did well on essays
---
I bet they dont do faction specific transfers cuz they want factions unbalance aka 10% alliance and 90% horde servers (for e.g), so there will be less wpvp, so less lags, less whining, and ofc less money spending on servers.
---
I'm a fury warrior. I feel most groups avoid another melee dps after they have 1 or 2 already, mostly because other melee don't want more competition for gear.
---
So basicly u want to get carried gg
---
But...why?
---
I've also switched to DME jump runs,
---
However if I were to charge for tanking I would want to make 50g/hour factoring what I get to auction/vendor.
---
So 20g in loot, toss up 30g. 
---
I also come in with consumes (10g+ each run) and put work in to getting the run done smoothly-asap.
---
As a warrior the consume grind is the extent of your free time so it makes sense to me that a less gold intense class who needs your aggro to pony up.
---
As for the prices, seems legit, varies based on the players not the servers though.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6461/slime-encrusted-pads
---
HP4 is my favourite stat personally.
---
It’s also very much about looking cool.
---
It's still a $14ish ARPU on 3 million subs. To put that in context, from earnings:
---
&gt;Blizzard revenue was $394 million lower year-over-year against the comparable that included the release of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth. Operating income was $74 million with an operating margin of 19%.
---
Their total company quarterly OI is $74 million and classic represents $42 million of top line.
---
What is the single most wanted class and spec on horde now for dungeons/raids overall?
---
You seriously think 80 out 1000 players are High Warlord?
---
For the beauty of the gesture, you know...
---
The mental gymnastics here are hilarious
---
I got my eye duoing with a rogue, mistresses are fairly easy, although you still may want to line of sight them to save mana (and lower downtime). Felguards can hit really hard and can almost global a rogue in mediocre gear. We were essentially kiting them with me taking aggro through mindblast/swp and the rogue spamming feint and using double crippling poison for 100% uptime.
---
Its sammy
---
Lmao i have been playing classic on a shitty laptop from almost 10 years ago.(the thing has windows 7 on it) funny thing is i have had no issues running classic on classic settings.
---
Just throwing it out there but people might call you out and tell you not to use Mortal Strikke on bosses as it's the only one of the high priority debuffs that doesnt increase or deal any damage.
---
Yeah bud so you have to play with people your level. Competing with warriors/hunters for gear isn't quite a fair complaint cause rogues can grab a lot of great pieces that warriors/hunters can't rely on, just takes research/work. I'd recommend a guild of similar play-style/committed players that you really fit in to and you should have a better experience with dungeon groups if they're guild groups!
---
Good luck!
---
yeah why u lying kid
---
Cool RPing bro.
---
Had to run DM West 27 times in order to get a Distracting Dagger. Idk the odds of that happening but i'm sure i was fking unlucky since It has ~20% droprate.
---
Will never touch DM West ever in my Life. That sheet gave me PTSD
---
Based on what I read in this post I didn't click the link just the down arrow.   Have a nice day
---
This would be what I would support as well. How about gear for the classes that get “pigeon holed” very rarely do we see raiding elemental shamans. I haven’t seen hardly any boomkins in classic. The raiding elemental shamans I see that rock dps in raids are wearing greens that boost nature damage.
---
This is one bad build if ive ever seen one, hf missing fears all day rofl.
---
Devolve*
---
Undeniable facts:  
---
\- there are more horde dominated servers (most PvP servers) than there are alliance dominated (PvE servers and Heartstriker)
---
\- Horde queues more than alliance, so even at 50:50 faction ratio, horde has longer qeueus than alliance as proven by every pserver in the past 5years
---
Thanks great community here!

It's a somewhat gamebreaking addon that warns you about enemy faction players near you. You don't even need to see them as it scans the combat log and reports their names, class, level, amount back to you in a handy window.
---
Probably shamans. Very wanted. Highly sought after, you can fit many in a raid and at least on my server its a serious shortage.
---
I haven't tried it.  Thanks for the suggestion.
---
No issues. Just one faction or guild gets all world bosses. That imbalance funnily can lead to balnce itself.
---
also made everything in azeroth irrelevant. And those horrible ugly areas... :/
---
And retail proved the last 10 years that you have no queues on both sides. So what is actually your point?
---

Sorry for the stupid question, but I dont understand the context. Mind explaining?

I was one of 2 Priests in all purpose experts (another guild) and we had an agreement I got the t1 and he got tier 2 first as he wanted it, Im sorry that you are clearly jealous of my gear. I would love to actually talk numbers as I have video proof and evidence, and logs, with my performance. You can watch video evidence of me landing fear all day if you would like.
---
But they'll still be competing for honor with their server, which is overpopulated, so they'll have to pvp tons more to stay in the upper honor ranks. On a server with lower population for your faction this could save you 10-15 hours a week, for months, on the pvp grind.
---
Well you were meant to be my healer...
---
The 'B' would be lower case though.
---
Fellow alchemists, do you sell the Oily Blackmouths, Blackmouth oil or the Free Action Potions directly? What works better for you? Where's the bottleneck?
---
I clearly mention the success of Classic. I'm only pointing out, through observation, that the vocal minority of the Classic player-base bring about a real sense of elitism.
---
I really really appreciate your input and completely understand where you're coming from!
---
sure, you still don't have any hit on your "pvp bis", so yeah grats you managed to roll the dice the right way, but trust me it won't be fun any time it doesnt work.

I mean I duel people outside and win 95% of duels on stream, why would i need hit gear? i dont miss anyway? I have more health and mana than an entire caster can do in a rotation with proper shielding, im done with this conversation you can check out the stream and learn something, or you can get beat out by a bigger fish, the results will speak for themself
---
And yet your logs show that you never went into MC with only 2 priests, not sure why you even try to lie like that rofl. And no you don't land them all day with this stuff, that's not how maths works.
---
Retail is ded dummy
---
Because All purpose experts group 1 does not log? Weird there are guilds that dont log. Ive done mc every week since week 2.
---
You mean swap around gear like not wearing onslaught girdle?
---
When I said pre-raid DPS gear, I meant that I am wearing pre-raid DPS gear + a mix of t1/t2. There are plenty of low demand threat items you can take without taking onslaught girdle from the Fury warriors.
---
Get mad breh.
---
I feel you. I stay up sometimes but usually work is too exhausting and I need rest to function. I also hate feeling groggy, some people are less affected by lack of sleep. It makes me a zombie lol
---
I played every expansion as alliance and horde and had never over 5 minutes queues since the start of battlegroups and cross realm battlegrounds.
---
The continuous jumping tho!
---
I'd like to see the new dustwallow quests that they added in TBC in Classic.
---
If you don't raid, I've a particular fondness for the enchanted thorium set
---
I'd wait to grind our Maura, for the chance at the ace as well as the BIS ring. I found the axe drops pretty often myself.
---
When osrs creeps into every aspect of my life
---
Now climb the 270-300 thorium wall.
---
as i said, no one cares about your duel when you will miss fears on2 wars charging you.  I'm sure your premades will find it so fun to have the only priest on the serv that can miss fears.
---
Eh a lot of people acting like its the end of the world for leveling. Bit overdramatic if you ask me. This *may* only be the case for the very overpopulated servers. The med-high ones people leveling can go questing/grinding in the many other areas available to them if theres competition they cant beat.
---
We will see where we both are and who hits rank 14 first okay? We will just let actions speak and not jealous words. I would love to watch you play, or what is your character name so i can look at your logs?
---
I play Horde on Fairbanks and frankly, Alliance are just as guilty. When I was leveling as a warrior I got shit on by every Alliance Warlock, Hunter, and Mage I encountered. Y'all made it personal with your itchy trigger fingers.
---
Stop defending corporations. They don’t care about you and they never will
---
The Ravasaur trainers too!
---
You have to restart from scratch to have a real WOW 2.0 otherwise it’s just an expansion a bit more ambitious than the others.
---
I guess Ill drop my mp5 gear and start stacking mp4 instead
---
LOL
---
Not waiting on friends to catch up, because they don't.

If you like the default UI but just wish the profession frames / quest log frame / trainer frames were double-pane and larger, Leatrix Plus is the best bet.

---
Sometimes i wish i could murder people through the internet. That would have been one of those times.
---
Honestly your deal for all Tier 1 when their is only 2 pieces of Tier 2 in the game seems pretty greedy. I haven't dove into your guild logs or anything cause IDGAF, but that sounds like some tilted loot rules.
---
Put in less work for more gain and release TBC servers with doing some simple copy pasting? Or design classic+ and put in a fuckload of work and money invested for the * chance * at success?
---
I dunno about you, but I'm leaning towards TBC from that logic.
---
Also, a lot of people are anxiously awaiting arena, and actual playable and non-garbage class design (which TBC/level 70 offers).
---
I love a good deep 10 hour sleep 🤣
---
wtf is q3 ?
---
the warrior from another guild. we had to shout at him for 10 mins to stop :S
---
It is and is not really important at the same time. If you are on a pve sever it does not matter as long as you find an active group to play with. On a pvp server just be ready to get camped and have less people to help.

Tauren hunter.

Working on pre raid BiS. Reading mixed opinions on DWarceb Hand Cannon vs Carapice spinebow. A DHC appeared in my bags yesterday, any feedback?
---
This is my first time playing WoW if there is an easy way to explain it.
---
This guy gets it
---
Classic + over TBC for sure. No flying mounts, no resilience and no stunlocking rogues for me !
---
Why are you loling?  It's true they increased the caps one time like the day after release and caps have remained untouched since then.  I incorrectly assumed the new higher cap was supposed to remain unchanged because blizzard had said they wouldn't increase the server capacity even though layering allowed them to because it would be unsustainable.  Blizzard did exactly what they said they wouldn't and now everyone has to deal with the unsustainability of it.   Layering still has no correlation with server capacity beyond blizzard choosing to decrease the capacity down to its regular level as they reduce the servers to 1 layer.
---
That was at the start of the game, and just while we got the first 3 pieces, he got the first 2. I won the first roll on the pants and we made the decision from there. Good guilds priotize stuff like priest 5 pc t1, we all have t2 helm, gear is never an issue. We talked about what we wanted between priests, the only 2 people who can use the gear, nobody in the guild matters when it comes to a piece of gear only 2 people can use. We handled it as adults. I took benediction first, he took cauterizing band and both t2, we had different priorities.
---
Healing druids seem to be in demand a lot. They are pretty crappy in raids atm, but guilds dont want to waste loot and they get better later. I think getting a fuckton of gear with resto druid is really easy atm. My guild recruited one resto druid guy at level 55 and he dinged with like 5-6 epics.
---
I mean I haven't even spoken to anyone and have been getting spammed none stop. 
---
The problem is absolutely not being able to completely block the channel invites.
---
You can start doing Maradon. Princess is only level 51. Get the gatorbite axe and your blackstone ring.
---
They dominate basically every single PVP server, at least in EU.
---
I get up at 4am for work. Lately I've been logging off between 12-1am and barely getting 3 hours of sleep. This game is destroying me.
---
So your solution is for all players on the minority faction to just leave? In your world, PVP would not exist because the entire opposing faction left the server.
---
lorewise ally are bad ppl compared to horde , like intentionally bad.
---
Your alarm clock is going to ring and you’re going to grumble, “Too soon Executus, too soon.“
---
Yeah just wait til mara cause you'll want the ring from princess too and rotgrip is right after anyway.
---
After that I'dtry and get the axe from emp in brd
---
Ranged attack power is normalized in this patch. Therefore Rohkdelar is much better even in PvP and no amount of attack power is changing that.
---
LUL
---
It will make your fire blasts hit harder in pvp but if you aren't minmaxing dont worry about it
---
And my point stands. I automate whatever I can either by addons or macros. As long as it’s open from blizzard api I do not see an issue. I also notify whomever I soulstone fx.
---
I respected and praised all gold buyers before reading this "Unpopular Opinion" thread.
---
How so? I thought horde invaded Azeroth
---
If a guild lets bullshit happen among their players the guild itself is part of that bullshit.
---
Right now in Classic, you can bet that the population is heavily influenced by the population in Retail, where anywhere that is remotely competitive is heavily skewed towards Horde. Alliance outnumbered Horde in vanilla ([The Ratio](https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Ratio). 
---
&gt;If you are around town, you’re more than likely to see a Horde tattoo on someone or a bumper sticker. To be honest, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an Alliance tattoo. 
---
I have never seen either, but the Alliance logo is a lion (used by royalty of many different nations since forever), harder to draw and so on, while the logo of the Horde has a more simplistic, but emblematic, shape and form.
---
I think you're referring to Snackybox?
---
Omfg thank you.
---
Better PvP racials and more appealing races.
---
Yes actually, I’m glad
---
Because it is obviously a very different class and playstyle. Might as well allow them to pick any class instead.
---
Omg this is too accurate. 💯
---
Horde players tend to be much stronger about faction identity in my experience. Alliance players tend to be more "let's just play the game". 
---
Horde is dominant on PVP servers but not PVE. I think the more outwardly "evil" appearance of most Horde races appeals to the types that want to get into killing other players. 
---
Also, Undead are pretty cool.
---
But where do they transfer then, since most servers are horde dominated?
---
It's one of the few games that paints the usual monster races in a much more positive light.
---
What other game let's you be a heroic bullman or even an orc? Veeeery few, if any.
---
I use my mouse for almost everything. 1-12 with shift modifier makes 24 binds, then i also use q r e f v with shift modifier and that makes 34 binds. Enough for most everything
---
It would be nice to be able to see the server statistics at least to be able to make a logical decision instead of, "oh im outnumbered here MAYBE it will be better there". Sure theres the cencus project but im sure Blizz would be able to give out some more accurate numbers
---
&gt; visible for everybody
---
no it isnt. its only visible to the dominant faction. who wont know weather it's a whole-server thing or a faction-specific thing. the smaller faction wont see anything, so will be unaware that the opposite faction is being offered transfers unless they look it up or are told (which you posit would be a tiny fraction)
---
This post makes no sense on mobile
---
Also i dont know why everyone assumes 48 will give 60's honor according to this it shouldn't.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0)
---
"If a player attacks a player on the opposite faction whose level is 10 or more levels below his or her own, then he or she will not receive any contribution points for that honor kill."
---
51 would be the cutoff.
---
&gt;The issue is there are more horde across all servers than there are alliance. 
---
Source?
---
No transfers, no changes, no phases. Jk lol back on private server since a month seeing how a mango in a Moscow basement is better than blizzard to run a server.
---
Couple's Goal.

You owe yourself sleep. Knock them out with rum. Or a fist.

---
Tbh undead is only op until everyone gets their trinket.
---
Farm gold in dm e and raidlog until bg release
---
I did the same, except I didn't get a single golden pearl making it truly not worth it.
---
Except hair.
---
the horde symbol just looks badass ok? 
---
And so do undead rogues, orc shamans with 2h axe, tauren warriors, undead locks, etc. 
---
Let's not forget that we have the best racials for pvp. We are the offensive side while alliance is defensive. Shaman get purge to dispel the enemy buffs while pally get dispel to dispel themselves/ally of harmful magic. 
---
undead priest have offensive spells vs dwarf priest which is defensive.
---
I play ally on stalagg and am moving my horde 60 off it Monday at 11am. 
---
Try again!
---
Dont play an elf. Welcome to RP servers.
---
After trying to get some golden pearls for an enchant, this statement is very accurate ^^
---
Sure, but it's not really needed. There's no competing with other players in PvE aside from getting world first. Otherwise it's just completing the raids and getting the rewards. A thing that's absolutely super easy even without R14 gear.
---
Comparatively, if you wanna get an edge in PvP in classic you must do pve to get the raid gear or else you'll not have a chance at all. Plus have engineering. It's not really the same thing as gaining a few % more dps in PvE through getting R14.
---
How do you get the quest to start?  I have 230 bs and im lvl 48, what am I missing?
---
Tanks are fury warrior in disguise because they won't get to raid otherwise.
---
I dont know why no1 is talking about the fact Blizzard (pre classics success) was planning to do crossrealm BGs, (non vanilla like,) since they probably felt the game was gonna be dead af and this is the only way to do BGs.
---
if you make BGs in-realm only you really help fix the faction imbalance. big queues for the bigger side, makes ppl both want to leave the big side, - and join a server with few allies. for EZ honor gainz.
---
It should have been a system that had different areas working together in order of this priority:
---
* Proper planning of the required servers
---
* Faction-based queues
---
* Free transfers locked by faction
---
The reason why free transfers are even happening was because the amount of servers originally released was minimal, so we have ended with several mega-servers and an attempt by Blizzard to spread the population from those megaservers into newer servers. For EU-EN, Golemagg, Shazzrah and Gehennas are considered mega-servers. It's not a coincidence that those were the first servers to be released. The next ones in the list that are either mega-server or close to that were released around 15 hours after the game launched (Firemaw, Mograine, Razorgore, etc.). For the most part, there's a quite solid link between the age of the server and its population. 
---
With the first step having failed, then you're already in a bad situation. Considering the population of servers two months in, I think that we can affirm that the original planning felt very short. If more servers would have been announced mid-August (name reservation period), then we'd have seen a better spread of the population resulting in free transfers being less needed.
---
The 2nd point is about queue manipulation. The queues should have been faction-specific so you attempt to have the same amount of people from both factions at the same time. That'd mean that, in EN-PVP servers, Horde would have had longer queues. They could have been notified that the queue for Alliance characters is X, for Horde Y. This would have encouraged people who were a bit on the fence between both factions to lean Alliance.
---
The last step are the free transfers. We don't know how it worked behind the scenes, but to answer your question: nowhere. If the server faction balance would go through a certain threshold, the transfers from that particular faction should have been automatically closed down. 
---
I don't have a problem admitting that I'm really salty at how poorly Blizzard has handled server health overall in the history of WoW. Dead servers galore, sharding actually killing any potential advantage of being in a dead server, cross-faction raiding taking too much to be implemented and don't get me started with faction balance, which continues to get worse and worse.
---
Yes you can and you probably should automate as much as you can... its however never been the point of this discussion. 
---
The point has always been whether addons like I spy take automation to far, to a point where it changes player behaviour, and gives a unfair advantage for those who use it
---
Triple digit iq
---
Am I missing some context?? What's classic+?? Is it different to currently wow classic? Sorry I'm a newb...🤔
---
My guild has two raid groups full clearing MC and we have 0 raids uploaded to warcraftlogs.
---
WoD was the biggest launch ever aside from classic, even beating out the launch of retail vanilla. TBC had ~10.5 million subs and wrath launched at about 11 million and peaked at just over 12 almost 2 years later. WoD launch saw a 5 times bigger gain in subscribers than wrath launch. Not surprising to be honest as the WoD trailers are some of the most epic ones they've ever put out, and also the idea of going back to outland excited many after being stuck in Pandaland for the past 2 years. I'm not gonna lie, after 2 subpar expansions, I was incredibly excited for WoD, as many others was. We were all let down though.
---
If people get pissed not getting any items for a few raids they might be too focused on themselves rather than raid progress and guild progress. Also, if this happens in a DKP guild, you are bound to surpass people in DKP before long. 
---
DKP hoarding only washes so long, since most guilds don't transfer DKP from one tier to the next. You can't generally skip all MC loot and use that DKP to get full next tier from BWL while raiding in all greens and blues through MC, performing worse than if you'd gotten some upgrades.
---
Loot council is PITA and very hard to keep objectively fair; especially if your roster keeps changing and even more so if people have the "me first" attitude. 
---
Just in my experience. DKP is IMO the most fair, but giving MT and OT prio to make things easier for both healers and DPS.
---
Nah, retail still forces you to go into the best raids to get the best pvp gear. At least it did in 8.2 and 8.2.5. The best and completely broken trinkets, for example, were from Mythic bosses BDA and Crucible of Storms.
---
r/pointlesslygendered
---
Never seen a mage do 50% of a groups damage, a decent rogue will top 40% regularly.  
---
AOE pulls are for trash monsters, and trash damage dealers excel at them.
---
tell that to those who are still speaking as if bfa is the only retail one.
---
Talk to the master blacksmith (or.. one of them that's hammering away), and they will tell you to talk to the armorsmith or weaponsmith bois, then you get the quest from there. Trick is, after you get that you have to talk to the Mithril Order guy in SW, but they dont tell you that lol
---
Faction change in classic is impossible, because paladins and shamans exist. It would be super unfair if everyone gets to change but you can't, and even worse if your whole guild decides to switch.
---
You don't need to target them at all, since it's a mouseover. You can mouseover the model, or the party or raid frames.
---
I apologise if I’m not communicating clearly then. What I mean is that as long as the automation is within boundaries of the rules (by supplying the api) it’s fine. Fishing bots fx are not.
---
60 Rogue here, I raided only the day I hit 60 and mc th next day.
---
1.) By 2x tarnishes Elben rings from a hunter doing tribute runs.
---
2.) buy satyr bow from dm E from a warlock doing runs.
---
3) do the quests for mark of Fordring.
---
4.)make your own groups for the rest. Takes 10-15 mins tops. This gives me the ability to keep AORtards out.
---
I’ve made heaps of friends by making my own groups. I bring good banter, relaxed atmosphere( don’t care about wipes or fast runs) and offcourse help out my group with food consumes and deviate delights.
---
Tanks have added me to their lists and whisper me now when I get online for runs!
---
That may have worked at the release of classic but you cant lock people out of their high level chars for hours at every time of day
---
They really don't though. Rogues outdamage everything except warriors pretty effortlessly.
---
Not him, but I raid 11pm-2am because I'm east coast in a west coast guild (8pm-11pm raid). Or at least I used to, in BFA it stopped being worth the effort.
---
I'm thinking of leaving stalagg for arc. It's medium pop atm, but it's about to go up. Heartseeker is crazy alliance stacked
---
Majority of my guild is 30+ with kids, so its impossible to raid earlier because the kids are still awake.
---
I’m a human in real life, I found the lack of diversity on the alliance side uninviting. Humans, tall pink humans, short bearded stocky humans and short big eared bald humans *meh*.
---
Also I find the horde lore very interesting.
---
And all 5 warriors will be fighting for BRE.
---
Warlock Item
---
the whole point is to stop there from being even MORE servers where the balance is 80-20.
---
I agree the whole everyone needing rogue gear is pretty crap, but there is not much we can do about that.
---
Back in vanilla. Tanks used to be the default party leaders, and most would still prefer it this way. However, due to the fact that, as a rogue, you will have a very hard time getting in groups for your pre raid BiS, you will have to make and lead the parties.
---
When I'm being lazy, it can take me hours of spamming lfg to get into a single group. When I make the group, it gets put together within 15 - 30 minutes.
---
Finding an awesome guild can also help. Ever since joining my awesome guild, I've not pugged a group in over a month and a half.
---
&gt;Ya'll are mad dumb lol
---
Nice defense, but you were really wrong in that post and you continue to be wrong here.
---
I have never understood this. If you group up to make a game, establish a company why the fuck do you doom yourself with an upcoming lawsuit like this?
---
Look at warcraft logs. Rise, reign and Dawn are all top parse guilds. Also they are ally on  skeram
---
Appreciate how you sail evil appearance and not evil.
---
On my realm, buying the oil and Selling the FAP is the most profitable. You make a slight loss on fish to oil.
---
Just raid less people jeez
---
Come to Kurinnaxx! We need more alliance!
---
If you ever want to tank, just pick warrior. If you love being independent and value quality pvp gameplay, pick mage. If you want interesting raid rotations, pick rogue.
---
Not super helpful, but that's what you gotta expect.
---
BGs are not crossrealm.  That's retail
---
There's a lot of people that keep saying things like "I remember" or "back in vanilla"
---
I just wanna be clear that that has absolutely nothing to do with this discussion. However bad vanilla servers were (which they weren't, in a lot of ways they are ***vastly*** superior) has nothing to do with the fact that this is 2019 and a game released this year should not have problems that are this dramatic while the game is played normally
---
Fyi it's much harder to gear a mage than a rogue throughout all phases and they're a lot more gear dependent than rogues. Pre BiS is kind of a grind because warriors want the same gear, but once you start doing raids it gets a lot easier since you're mostly competing with other rogues for gear. It's even easier on horde because most warriors are orcs and want to use axes.
---
Filthy their and jobs casuals
---
Servers are fucked. Hype level is zero. Fuck blizzard.
---
Totally new to WoW, I have a level 7 priest and I wanna be a healer. Can I level efficiently healing? Or should I level as a shadow priest and respec at 60?
---
You're not some special character with a backstory, you're just asshole #37 that's killed that player today.
---
Where I use to work everyone worked 12+ shifts everyday for half the year. Some days off you get called in and you’ll never have the same days off as your friends  -Per management
---
Thats because Heartseeker is the Server that all the large PvP servers dump to. The Alliance flee from Stalagg and Skeram to it.
---
Hellscream drank felblood, The orcs that drank the blood gained immense power. They were losing a war and this helped the turn the tide. The cost was expensive though. The ones that drank the blood were now under control of mannoroth the demon. The demons invaded azeroth and made the orcs go through the portal to invade. Once on azeroth. Thrall and Grom hellscream went to mannoroth. Grom ended up killing the demon, saving thrall, and freeing all the orcs of the fel bond that he brought up them at the cost of his own life.  
---
The orcs were now stranded in azeroth because the portal back was destroyed. classic takes place like 15 years after this event. During the 15years. the alliance put orcs into concentration camps and pretty much treated them like slaves, even though there was no way for the orcs to leave azeroth and go back to draenor.

Undead are pretty evil.
---
Even murder their own faction repeatedly for a variety of reasons.
---
If it’s allowed, for me it can never be unfair since everyone can do it. Being right is different to me, and even though I do use spy, I don’t think it’s right and I fear it will have detrimental effects on open world pvp.
---
Hahaha literally me and the wife last night as I first subbed.
---
!
---
The twitching hand.
---
&gt;So why don’t big horde guilds transfer to alliance dominated servers then?
---
As someone who is on an early ally dominated server that spammed how good our ratio is for the first sets of transfers that absolutely happens.  
---
Im just not saying what server cus its full and solid, Horde need to get their asses to Heartseeker.
---
Only against the trash.  Against bosses, rogues will outdamage a mage every time.
---
Ah 100% didn’t even see it haha
---
&gt;So there was always going to be a mafia.
---
No there wasn't. It's only a mafia if you're colluding with the opposing faction, which is not a given for people that follow the rules of WoW.
---
It's useful if you don't want to get slapped by certain bosses, only really applies at 60 though.
---
Yeah and they always attack me when I try to defend myself after being attacked first. Annoying as shit.
---
because to admit that there's a faction balance issue means that the pressure would be on to fix the *cause* of the imbalance.
---
And in the case of WoW, it almost always comes down to Racial abilities. Ignoring the state of Classic WoW for a second and focusing on the broader issue of both versions, that's always been the root cause. The highest tier players run the numbers and find out that one faction (or more specifically one or a few races of that faction) have a notable advantage over others, so they flock to that race for any advantage possible. Sometimes it's for a World First Mythic kill, sometimes it's for the highest rank in Arenas in a given season, but the fact of the matter is that one race usually has a noticeable advantage over others (usually somewhere between 1%-2% advantage, so not really *big*), and at that highest level of play any legit advantage is still an advantage.
---
But that trickles down. The highest tier players swap to that race/faction for the competitive edge, then the next tier of players do so because they are chasing the same dream. Then more dedicated players start to follow suit because that's what all the "best" players are doing, and suddenly the numbers start to grow in favor of one side. Then the community goes full blast with it, and starts to swap over because everyone else is doing it and they don't want to be left out, and pretty soon any discussion of "i'm new and what faction should i play" is flooded with the dominating faction while the minority keeps shrinking and shrinking. 
---
In Retail they can mitigate this in a number of ways by merging severs and introducing cross realm play. The tech is there and they've been doing it for years, so the only time you really feel the imbalance is when you're out alone in older content (where most players aren't really active anymore) or you're parked in one of the few spaces that isn't cross server enabled. These are all relatively recent solutions to the problem, but for the most part they work and have kept the game going for as long as it has, and if any issue arises that is too big for this to work, then they still have the ability to tune between hotfixes, content patches, and expansion releases. 
---
But Classic is a different beast, for two big reasons. First is the community aspect. The nature of Classic is based around a point in time where the game forced you into more social interactions in order to keep progressing. That's just how the game was, and that's how Classic is as well (to an extent, as now we have more consistent means of connecting outside of the game than we did back in 2005). And by trying to mitigate the imbalance issues, you end up corralling people into a few servers and letting low pop realms die off for good, which leads into the second point.
---
The "no changes" approach. Because the Community and Blizzard themselves are completely vested in keeping the game "as it was", you can't really do anything to mitigate the problem aside from culling servers and forcing people into more active ones. But it still doesn't *fix* the problems that are causing the imbalance, it's just a bandaid.
---
In order to truly fix issues like racial abilities and class imbalance, Blizzard would have to make a substancial tuning pass. More specifically one that is *completely different* than what was done in the past because, thanks to the advent of private servers, the meta game has shifted significantly. Burning Crusade brought the biggest change (outside of the pre-1.12 balance patches), but that's not Vanilla content so it's not going to make it into the game. And even then it didn't do much to fix existing problems so much as it just shifted them to new places (like Arcane Torrent for Blood Elves being one of the major shifts for Horde Imbalance from 2006 onward). So in order to make a worthwhile improvement they would have to shift the game in an different direction entirely, which is a major change for the community, and a good way to alienate a lot of players who joined up *specifically* because it was just like they remembered it being.
---
I think it's possible that the community would be open to it, based on how OSRS was open to the changes. But at the same time Blizzard isn't exactly hinging on Classic to keep itself in the black, so there's much less incentive to basically run and maintain two separate versions of the same game, especially since it would also open the door to new and exclusive content only available for Classic WoW. And of course that would eventually compound into much more significant changes (like expansion level content updates), which means Blizzard is throwing *more* money into Classic, which can lead to a lot of business decisions that would further fracture the player base between both versions of the game.
---
Not true at all... most stalagg alliance guilds are expecting to do some serious world pvp inp2
---
The highest pop servers still have hour-long queues during peak hours, even with layering. I'd expect the return of the 3+ hour queue with layering gone.
---
But, if people toughed it out through a month of 3+ hour queues and another month of hourlong queues, I doubt they are going anywhere. They're already committed to that server. People will just use remote desktop apps to queue up from their phones a couple of hours before they want to play.
---
High chief respawns on a 7ish minute timer. Anyone farming for firewater knows this. He is also guaranteed to drop a firewater, while the rest of the mobs seem like it's around 10% or so. It's not hard to do a circle and come back to the cave with time to spare before the chief spawns.
---
Dudes a dick though. Could have agreed to let the lowbies have it for a firewater, or just let a single one go. The other week I helped an opposite faction lowbie kill the high chief for their quest.
---
0-48 should be OK, but I'd suggest avoiding STV nonetheless.
---
Interesting, never knew that. And I just learned from looking it up, that low testosterone can cause insomnia. Self perpetuating cycle right there, and explains a lot of gamers lmao
---
Honestly, I just want them to scrap current retail and come out with a new expansion that isn’t trash. Or a WoW 2. I’m enjoying classic, but I really don’t have any interest in spending the next several years continuing this 15 year loop. I want new content...that’s good.
---
So based on your options, I’d certainly prefer classic+ over TBC.
---
But not on Bloodsail. It's almost like being back on Silverhand except I'm in the opposite faction now.
---
As a whole in the past, I’d disagree. They wanted to live. Being hunted constantly and treated like monsters, within their own faction, would sour a lot of peoples attitude and would make it easier for a usurper to get a following. I think where they gone with sylvanis is out of character and they’ve turned me off of their lore which I thought they’d never do
---
The best shot rotation for DHC is 1.4 dps less than the best shot rotation for the spire bow (when naked).  If you had a +gun skill racial DHC would be better, but since you don't the spire bow will be better.  Also the proc on DHC uses ammo which I didn't even realize until this week.
---
TL:DR The Horde lore.
---
Okay grab some coffee, this may be long for this question, but I like it so here we go...
---
When I first began my Blizzard career, I was playing Diablo 1 &amp; 2, Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness and Starcraft 1.
---
I enjoyed all three of these games and if it wasn't for Diablo 1 being my first Blizzard game than I would have never found Warcraft and so on, but I digress.
---
What drove me to Warcraft was hands down its lore. Getting instruction manuals that were littered with pictures that some of the developers and artists drew in these things were just incredible for a 10 year old boy. Which is also what led me to always following around Chris Metzen. He drew most of these pictures before eventually turning into the we all knew him as a few years ago.
---
I actually started out as Humans in Warcraft 2 because (yes, bear with me, I was 12) I thought the elven archer/ranger unit was awesome. The way the story plays out in most of Warcraft 2 you think the Orcs are bad, until you realize in Tides of Darkness it is not that way. This opened me up into the lore of the horde and thus following it into Warcraft 3 &amp; The Frozen Throne. 
---
Now I'm not saying the lore on the Alliance side is bad or that there isn't any, I just like the lore of the Horde races better compared to the Alliance. I started as Alliance in 2005, but about 4-6 months into The Burning Crusade, I finally had a max level blood elf shadow priest and never looked back. Always been a Horde dude since then. I try to play some of the Alliance toons that still stalk my character lists, but it lasts maybe 20 minutes.
---
I encourage all of you to read the quests, clickables and letters/mail for delivery quests in game. There is some amazing stuff in those items. Not telling you how you should play, but if you got time and are not in a hurry to level this stuff should be read.
---
Sad to say too as much as I love this game's lore, I have never read the novels. I would like to, but I always say if I have time to watch a movie or read, then I have time to game and I prefer to do that instead.
---
Take care and I hope you guys have some thoughts on why you love the Horde too.
---
You should have mentioned raid bosses, you're gonna confuse the poor warrior :D
---
There are about nine billion addons out there that pulls stuff out of the combat log to highlight it for you in various ways. But apparently the one true form of playing WoW is to read the log and find it yourself. Hell, why even allow any addons? When I use bartender over standard actionbars my field of view increases. That's unfair. It's unfair to use threatmeters, players should do the math in their head during the encounter...
---
Insomnia too, apparently. Which is kinda fucked when you think about trying to solve the problem
---
Kunda = pussy (mean way) in czech language; its funny every time i go there
---
Hey Wallflowerenriq,
---
I did killed Simone 2 days ago here is what I did. Mark Simone and turn on AoTC, place a trap down and pull Simone with an Aimed Multi-shot combo and followed up by a concussive shot. This allows her pet to get trapped so you  can create some distance between them. Use Arcane Shot Rank 1 to keep her aggro'd to  you while using serpent sting to slow damage her down. When she casts her spell you should be able to out range her with AotC and put an auto or 2 into her. After about 30-40 seconds her pet will catch up to you while you  are kiting Simone, simply concussive shot / scatter shot when he gets close and keep kiting Simone.

For this fight you should only need Major Mana Pots. Good luck! Message me if you need any help. I know these guys can be a pain.
---
I played only Alliance until recently. Decided to roll Horde and honestly, it all seems better. Better starting areas, better accessibility, better people. I kinda don't want to go back to my Alliance toons.
---
That and that Engineering is mandatory.
---
PVE =/= low pop
---
More specifically, the one with the Trolls..
---
Do you have the Xbow already?  If so, I'd sell the DHC for epic mount money.  I'm sure somebody here can give you a good damage breakdown comparison, but I doubt the difference will be that big.
---
Apes is alliance.
---
There just going to roll classic chars into shadowlands and force you into retail lol, jk but not jk.
---
I don’t think that’s true. I tried BfA for a few months a year ago and quit. I came back for Classic and I’m having a blast. That said, I’d still like to give Shadowlands a chance, but it’s certainly a short leash.
---
Filthy hobbitses and their ring
---
Being on the losing side is cancer wherever - you can't fuck up ppls game time and then complain when they don't stick around to let you continue fucking up Thier play time. 99% of my PvP encounters have been higher level Vs low or grp Vs solo - the few 1v1 fights I have had,  win or lose have been fun - otherwise it's just annoying.
---
I believe it only consecrate that cannot bcs it is considered a dot.
---
I need more an inspiration than an answer.
---
Had the most entertaining and frustrating experience leveling 1-60. Nights wasted for that one more creep, random squads uniting for quests and well....you know what I'm saying.
---
Now that I\m 60 it's like I'm playing a totally different game, one that I don't recognise and don't really enjoy.
---
I usually camp zones farming felcloth while spamming LFG which doesn't give me the same satisfaction as in the early game. You get contested farming, you are at a 10min travel time to the dungeon, people are running these late game instances on autopilot so the social and intimidating factor is depleted.
---
And knowing all there is left is min maxing myself on lottery odds which when I think about it doesn't really empower me on an individual level, because I still won't be able to solo these dungeons, will rely on mana, heals, etc.
---
And all this playing a warlock, a fun class. 
---
Thinking of rolling a warrior.
---
Sorry for the rant in this thread.
---
Derpyslurpy Jenkins.
---
There's no roles in classic, that option seems like an artifact from the modern version of the game
---
I would say true but you dont have a girl
---
What if I can’t sleep for 8 straight hours because I wake up after 6? I also know that going back to bed after you wake up is also bad
---
Oomer*
---
Pvp is just dogshit in wow. Its only unfair battles.
---
PVP = killing people while massively outleveling them or outnumbering them. Epic. I honestly have no idea how people get any joy from killing somebody who is just going to brd or doing some quests in stv.
---
Hmmmm. Im prety sure if you coppy his question in google you wouldent come up with a result.
---
Jobs their and casuals filthy
---
Be diverse and sell all three
---
Which is nice so you can still report the account
---
&gt; In addition, very few players asking for a Classic Server have really thought through just what they’d be missing out on. Below is a list of key features introduced patch-by-patch up to the launch of Warlords of Draenor.    
---
As I was reading through these, I hit TBC and was thinking, "that's not bad, that's alright, don't like it but didn't break anything". Then I hit the WotLK notes and my thoughts ranged from "not breaking or anything" to "that sucked, horrible, big mistake"
---
instantly hotfix Ony, meanwhile bears still get mana burned in bear and cat form
---
You're right.
---
But you should try playing football with 11 people against 3 sometime.

Sold 2 for 525g and you could do the same as long as you have no competition. It may take a week or 2 to sell but just be patient

Plan is to start raiding an hour early so we have time to get their :3

"If you didn't want to get corpse camped by skull lvls why did you sign up for PvP? Just go to PvE or stop whining lol"

I like monster people. Alliance in classic only have the night elves for me.

For every person who says “I got pulled back” there’s someone who “will never go to retail”.

I wish the flowers in DM would've dropped black lotus.. But alas only purple.

And then you get banned, and come whine about it.
---
The fact that paid transfers, or at least reversions, aren't a thing is actually ridiculous. Idk why I would move and risk having the same experience you are when Kromcrush is thriving and I can find groups within minutes. 
---
There may be queues on raid days and weekends, but damn, I can't imagine being enticed to move when I've been here since day one and I have no idea what the experience is on whatever shit-ass free transfer realm is available.

Lucifron German: 80-20 horde alliance
---
I used to be on the TBC boat until I figured out Its full of mentally inept people that don’t want to promote the longevity of Classic, split the community and play the same shit over again.
---
&gt; Why is it “cool” to be irresponsible, you clearly can’t make the best calls in a raid
---
It's MC, they'll be fine.
---
Brave and bash
---
Oh boo fucking hoo.
---
Back in vanilla most servers were vastly dominated by alliance, my server us magtheridon was closer to 70-30 alliance favored. You got used to and good at just always being grouped up and fighting off bigger numbers.
---
If all you need is rent and food, then yeah 10h seems like it would be enough.
---
At least he's not Sweden Shaman.
---
Yep, you can and they will instantly change servers.
---
Gnome racial is no where near as good as WotF or Hardiness. Fears and stuns are far more disruptive than snares and slows.
---
For anyone saying a 60-40 balance is okay... Try rolling on a server where you're the 40 and you'll definitely see that it is not okay lol
---
Did grizzly make a youtube vid or something?
---
Honestly they should just let you take an ability over from retail if you swap. I'd really like Divine Storm and holy power. I'd go to a faction imbalanced server if I could AoE them all down like farm mobs.
---
The only alliance race I like is Dwarf.  I used to think that night elves looked cool, but NE males now look wonky and lame.  I'd have for sure rolled alliance if I started playing wow on my own, but I joined with friends who played horde so I rolled a cow.  Lots of people roll horde in spite of the fact that they'd prefer to play ally, because of friends.  Horde is accepted as the strongest PvP oriented faction.  
---
Back in vanilla, I believe horde was under populated to begin with because most chose the prettier factions for their character aesthetics and nice cities.
---
In classic you have to raid to get the best pvp gear. The two go hand in hand.
---
2 vs. 3 is the closest we will ever come to balance between alliance and horde. Would you rather have this or 90/10 server? The answer is obvious to anyone with a single brain cell.
---
It's good for making the other specs seem good
---
Why the fuck would we take a random transfer to a server we might hate when there's no way to go back or transfer to another realm if we fucking hate it? Your argument has always sucked and it's 100%Blizzard's fault how this played out, sorry.
---
That's the problem that no one is seeing. say blizzard only allows the horde of a full server to move out. what happens to the alliance guy who is sick of long queues and would rather move to a less full server? do we just let them suffer on a server that takes 1 hour to log in, only just to get camped to death on log in? If he is one of the few people who are willing to move servers, he should be allowed to move, since this will improve the queue times, right?
---
The thing is, if blizzard limits server transfer to one faction, then there will be people who lose out. If they don't limit the factions, then other people will lose as well. There's nothing blizzard can do without upsetting others, and people don't realise this.
---
for open world that setup is perfect, especially as a nightelf.  
---
growl and bite consume a tiny fraction more focus than it' regenerating.
---
in group content with a tank, you go with bite+claw for more deeps.
---
Good luck! It's quite the journey!
---
Hello, looking for mage advice.
---
Is there a possible spec build that will allow me to aoe farm, but also do some single target questing when I feel like it?  Single target damage feels really slow/poor when I'm in full aoe spec so I was wondering if there was a good middle ground build that could be more of a jack of all trades player that can both aoe farm and still do ok single target damage without having to respec each time?
---
Maybe you shouldn't make negative assumptions about people's lives who you know absolutely nothing about.
---
Epic mount is very important for pvp/everything. This should be priority.
---
They should just announce that servers won't be cross-realm BGs until phase 5. You'll see a lot of people (especially the lower faction side) refusing to reroll.
---
sounds like the warr's problem.
---
Where I'm from nobody really gives a shit about what your grades were. Achieving cum laude has some merits but even then it's hardly a factor. The demand for programmers is so high that they don't have the liberty of being picky.
---
9k upvotes and counting...... just kidding activision doesn’t give a fuck about its player base. Amiwrong? Down vote me pls
---
The queue should be for each faction aswell. That would help a bit.
---
He's a smug jerk, yeah, but who the hell even cares about the HK thing? It has absolutely nothing to do with Classic. Go rant your stupid politics somewhere else.
---
And? it's ally to horde problem there lol.
---
You’re only making it worse leaving Herod
---
Pre sylvanas they still fucked *everyone* at the wrath gate, and experiment on their faction.
---
Forsakens whole stick has always been us first then the horde since they are convenient.
---
It's the reason I chose horde forever ago. Then for this time around was a combo of wanting to play shaman, again, and many friends also wanting to roll horde. 
---
I do miss my BE pally from BC and WotLK and that was almost enough to get me to roll ally. Plus never played early game ally. I did a DK, which started at 55ish, on ally back in WotLK. 
---
However now I have some minor regrets of not choosing a different class to level and gear up to 60. Sadly my large amount of free time is gone this year and I'll likely just use the 60 shaman to fund my twinks. Twinks are probably what I missed the most after WotLK killed them. With the introduction of gaining XP you had to opt out of XP and be placed in a separate pool of others who did the same. My queue times went from 10 minutes being the absolute longest for an AB to 40+min for just WSG. 
---
PS if you are into twinks pick up the BoE's now as they are mostly stupid cheap. Bought most all the rare and epic items for a 29 priest and 39 hunter for around 150g total. I'm expecting many of those items to probably triple or more in price come phase 3/4. (Like my tiger strike mantle I just got for 7g.)
---
My servers 60-40 and i really like being the 40. Already have 1 60 and another level 45 too. It makes questing more fun when you can kill enemy players left and right. Took out 2 hunters and warrior today so far
---
Sounds good, thank you for the video. I didn’t know it was that time consuming but I agree with all of you.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I wish more fury warriors would tank TBH.
---
The best is when you accidentally buy crystal vials as a lowbie for 3g then try and vendor them back and only get 20s.
---
That's a lie this server is alliance dominated but I'm down for more allies!
---
The real LPT is always in the comments.
---
im a 3,6k hp and got killed by a boomkin inside  BRM within 3 sec. they lack of efficiency but damn 
---
The Burst is real
---
Is there really always that many horde on pvp servers? I always played on RP servers as horde and Alliance always outnumbered us .
---
Should use +7 agi instead of riding skill. Riding skill for PvP though.
---
bgs are cross realm in classic. Look it up.
---
Slack with prebis, not slack inside dungeons...
---
Who is this?? Lol
---
I just wan't TBC since it was my favorite expansion.
---
I am not confident at all, that the current Blizzard would be able to give me a classic+ experience, that would satisfy my needs like TBC would.
---
This is always so confusing to me. I see this sentiment a lot. "I only sleep 4-5 hours a night and I don't have any issues" but then complains about being sick all the time, never has energy, has put on a bunch of weight, always in a neutral/bad mood. Like... How much more warning can your body give you?
---
Except you dont get banned for buying gold
---
wat
---
Troll race does not exist, everyone is playing undead if it’s possible for a given class
---
That's because the alliance pretty races, big shiny cities and Tolkien tropes act as a great filter to pull in the lowest common denominator.
---
I want TBC.
---
But, I think classic + would have been more successful long term than classic, and launched with even higher number of subscribers than came back for just classic.  As long as they didn't go over board on quality of life improvements, and adding new content.
---
Do you use every opportunity to put people down when they’re wrong  instead of educating them? I simply didn’t know it was THAT time consuming.
---
The plane had good enough WiFi to play!? What airline is that!?
---
Of course it isn't fair. But you do think that people actually thought about this problem for more than 10 seconds?
---
That's basically how Silverhand ended up being except it is/was RP. It was one of the original servers  and probably 80/20 alliance. Ques started getting bad. Then  transfers opened up and it become like 90/10.... At least it wasn't a pvp server but it started to suck finding groups even as a horde tank at times.
---
/r/titlegore
---
American airlines :)
---
Great video! How many stacks of runecloth did you have to turn in for Darnassus Exalted?
---
Wrong, it's a Blizz problem. If Blizz had let the players choose to have queues, my server would be fine. Instead, Blizz decided to meddle with my server by allowing people to transfer off of it because they didn't like our choice to overpopulated, and now as a result it is way too unbalanced.
---
Sweden shaman is a meme spec. Danmark shaman is BIS
---
You will never see a real screenshot of a golden pearl because they actually don’t exist
---
If someone didn’t say “I specifically want this item can you not roll” ahead of time why would anyone know not to roll.  
---
Not everyone cares about this stupid and pointless bis lists is my point.  Some people just play the game and don’t min max.
---
That’s impressive.
---
Unless you let anyone in your guild who can use it roll on the item who had 90% or greater raid attendance, you took advantage and disrespected everyone else in the guild.
---
Haha! That’s great.

You’re high if you think resil was a bad idea for PvP.

And this is why golden pearls eventually rose to as high as 100g on some servers back in vanilla.
---
$30 CAD after taxes, and it's not even a lot, I still live paycheque to paycheque.

My friends that work in the trade made like $40-45 an hour.

I continually invest almost all my gold in consumables preparing for PVP. I used to run a decent liquid gold balance to be able to buy high value BOEs or recipes and whatnot, but I've gotten basically everything I want at this point and/or am willing to wait on the rest until after ranking. I've started stockpiling liquid gold again, slowly building up a reserve, but it's strictly for respeccing during phase 2.
---
Just sold one for 70g today so I’m considering going back and farming more..

Started as dwarf in vanilla when i was kid bc my dad was one. Always wanted to play tauren but it was a pvp server.

When my dad stopped playing I switched servers and went tauren. My retail account is 90%, classic is 100%.

Its simply the coolest race

Tldr: Tauren!

Bootyful.

Isn't horde just green humans, tall blue humans, dead humans and cow humans?
---
Sorry to hear.  Did they even out after correcting you're sleeping pattern?
---
Except you are paying it forward to people who were not on stallag
---
I don't want TBCs butchery of my WC3 faves, Shattrath, flying, or resilience/arena tbh.
---
Running UBRS a couple times sounds like a great time compared to doing multiple awkward non-standard BRD runs. Maybe that's as annoying as finding 4 world dragons, idk.
---
Damn brotha, what guild? 60 NE hunt in Stalaag and simply staying bc of my buddies or id be out
---
Or Norwegian Shaman, that would be a shame...
---
are the higher ranks not more damage/mana? why would you downrank if this is the case?
---
... make your own groups ...
---
Heck I've had a level 60 since literally day 7 and I don't want phase 2 coming out this early. I was expecting week 2 of January tbh.
---
Nah, its manageable. Yes, ally outnumber us 5 to 1, but you get used to it. Corpse runs at dungeon though. Dont expect to run anything without a fight
---
They also bring a lot more utility to a group. Strat undead is a lot tougher without a mage.
---
My guild uses EPGP, and it is super fair. Works out really well for everyone
---
I just refuse to take furry warriors because i know im gonna need a tank and that sweaty bitch coulda been it and rolled on furry gear.
---
The horde are the coolest looking factions and coolest casting animations... the only reason I rolled alliance in classic was familiarity and nostalgia
---
Dont really know how to advice you except by giving a insight of my own experiences as a rogue:
---
Rogue was a bad choise for a first char in classic and I learned that at lvl 60. Every group is full of melee dps and alot of classes have the same preraid bis gear. 
---
My salvation was getting into a "good" guild but nothing is perfect. My guild is a big group of IRL friends who tend to mainly just group/play together and I am not part of the inner circle so they didnt really help me with preraid gear xept for HoJ which they helped everyone in core group get. So preraid gear was kinda sluggish as a rogue 
---
but
---
I got to 60 in the first month and managed to join first few raids and got to core status which was a game changer.
---
We roll for loot in raids and council legendaries and bis gear. Im fine with that. It works for me and everyone seems like equal in raiding. Havent seen any abuse by council and everyone seems to be on same page what is bis for every class. They dont require you to bring every possible raid consumable actually nothing if u dont want to but some are nice to have.
---
So there isnt a "perfect" guild but mine is pretty decent and as a Rogue you really need a decent guild. Hope you will find yours.
---
*You have summoned Spurdo Spärde* Haha Benis :DDDDD
---
Why don’t you look for a guild on the server you are currently playing? It’ll take you at least a month to hit level 60 on a new server and get geared for raiding, and even if there is a guild ready to take you right now there is no guarantee there will still be a place for you there in a month or two, so you’ll end up being alone again especially if it’s a trash tier low pop server.
---
Yes but I wasnt in a plane
---
fair enough, you got me.
---
That's not entirely true. The question didn't ask about the absolute timing of DMs release, it asked about the timing relative to PVP being released. I am very happy they broke out Dire Maul and released it separate from PVP but I also think both DM and PVP have been released too fast/too early.
---

---
He meant which spec have you rerolled resto from
---
Yeah back on track now but I did several things. I cut down on how much I was running as long distance running can lead to elevated cortisol (stress hormone) in the body which in turn inhibits testosterone production. Started taking ashwaganda and ginger supplements to help lower cortisol levels, aim to sleep 8 hours a night, eat properly including correct amount of dietary fats, lift heavy at least 3 times a week and shit as much belly fat as I could, drink less booze :)
---
Tauren Is the race that fits with my personality irl
---
I’m a hunter using thorium arrows so it’s even worse for me when I farm. Kills are 4 shots or 2 silver. sometimes a kill nets me far less than that in cash drop.

Denmark clearly.

Spec into improved sap, I believe it is subtlety (I am not sure, I never played classic rogue). I make my own groups frequently, and I will substitute a mage for a sub rogue. It’s just comes down to CC tools which become more and more important as the dungeons become harder and harder.
---
Lmao that’s cute . Actually one of the times I wasn’t ganked I waved first ! Hahaha I can try that
---
Wish I could give you another gold.
---
You can't get 50/50 in every server. The compromise is evenly distributing them to get the best possible ratio. Fact is there are more horde than alliance. Only way to balance it out would be to force faction changes and that is bullshit.
---
I wanted to roll a priest and the best options were Dwarf and Undead.
---
I ain't playing no midget.
---
I’m sorry, lol. it wasn’t by me I find that totally despicable and rude
---
Dont you mean by fire be purrrrrged
---
Happens all the time!! I tried to run ZF the other day. Oh it’s 8pm i should be good by 9-9:15. 10pm I’m bout to pass out.
---
we have 1 core team team and we roll for gear.. 
---
legendaries and some bis gear.get loot counciled
---
so far so good
---
I like how the term boomer evolved from baby boomer generation to just anyone who is above 30.
---
I guess "genexer" didn't have the same ring to it.
---
Explain pls !
---
I would gladly leave Heartseeker as an ally. People that say we all just want to be on the winning side are completely wrong, I want a healthy balance on each side like the game was meant to be played. I don't even mind being out numbered a little even like 60/40 but for the love of god just get me off of Heartseeker.
---
I assume people in the military don’t get to sleep a lot? It’s nuts, studies (some dude mentioned them in a Ted talk so cant link them) showed that having less than 5 hours of sleep a night for an extended period lowered people’s reaction times the same as having 5 beers.
---
Yup lol

Hi there- when you say warrior it too dependent on how will it’s life be in end game, can you elaborate on that please? 
---
I don’t have a problem with tanking at all, but I’d rather dps and fury is very viable.
---
I was on discord voice chat with my BF, who introduced me to wow, and I was like "are you KIDDING ME?" haha. Like yeah it's a pvp server, I get that, but it's MOONGLADE. We're supposed to be friends here
---
"Obviously" is a pretty loaded term. Our big alliance guilds will never go to such a terribly weighted server. We need targets and an allowance pve server doesn't seem like the best place for that
---
Thank you for the silver stranger!! My first post that hit it big. Big in my world. Thank you!!
---
I hate it.
---
Blizzard said they created a cap based on how many they thought would eventually stop playing. For example, if they assumed 80% attrition by the start of Phase 2 and their target server size was 10k (making up numbers for an example), then they would allow 5 layers of 10k; if more than 50k tried to log on, you get a queue.
---
Full pre-bis rogue here. Make your own groups is how I did it. It was relatively quick and painless. Don't be afraid to reserve a piece also. Casters/healers won't mind and usually the tank/dps won't either.
---
This is too real
---
I believe 7-8 hours is cool. This is also assuming it’s ‘quality’ sleep too, not just being in your bed for that amount of time.
---
I just really wish blizzard stepped in and made some rebalancing tbh. I think game lacks versatility.
---
Rolled because of a work buddy. Got off it because of the barrens chat. Also the mentality of "I'm a badass because I'm horde." Taurens were not enough for me to stay horde.
---
Because it did. Wotlk is the *beginning* of the end as it started a ton of bad trends.
---
This is not really a class problem. It is just what the game is at level 60. 
---
Maybe try playing some other game for a while until you feel like playing WoW more.
---
In your settings you can block in game channel invite all together. A lot of ppl just do that.
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself
---
Because Tauren are huge and make shields look bad ass.
---
Yeah man it can be a hard thing to sort out. I started taking a zinc and magnesium tablet an hour before my planned bed time to help me fall asleep and it really helped. Like all things thoughyour body gets used to it and they eventually start feeling less effective, but for that initial time that you are trying to change your routine it can really help.
---
I wish i did!
---
Root of cause: Camping &amp; Griefing
---
I have every piece on the BiS list as well moron. I have every blue piece for priest from every dungeon, and almost every single piece obtainable from raid. I have Archivist Cape of Healing, 1/10000 Cape as well as hide of the wild, You are really as jealous as you can be. I am speaking from a point of my own testing and personal experience, and you are speaking from jealousy and a tier list. I looked at that list and tested it and its dogshit, the fights last 30 seconds anyway, you could heal that in any gear. you said it yourself, 150bh is what they used to raid in. When you get all of the gear I have, you can test it and form a knowledgable opinion, but it looks like that will take awhile since you are so unpleasant and bad at the game. If ur as rich as I am, I can afford to Dark Rune, Flask, and Mana pot on Cooldown. Gear is irrelevant if you are good at the game, and thats why I have the most int in the game, check the facts and educate yourself
---
One kid here!
---
Yeah as a warrior tank my ideal group is definitely a mage and a warlock first for that aoe, portals, soulstone, summons.
---
Its not like I dont like playing with rogues (or hunters), but they just add very little utility and are therefore not priority.
---
European shaman is a meme
---
Please people stop saying unpopular opinion
---
Best AOE bar none.
---
Between the 3 choices, Mage. It's fun and has a lot of versatility. However if you really want dps, try a Warlock. Mages, Rogues, and dps warriors are a dime-a-dozen, but good Warlocks are harder to come buy and are very powerful in pve and pvp.
---
Actually been married for 3 years.
---
Balance was never viable in classic so why would this be a "ok boomer" meme?
---
We use rotating loot council with PVP free rolls on items that aren’t useful in PVE. Works for us! Weeds out the newbs who expect purples every week and seems fair to the rest of us.
---
I have my suspicions when people pull this one.
---
Dude i havent touched this game since TBC. Left for a reason. Pretty sure its classic (with or without tbc) or nothing for most of us.
---
If the responsible people won't start guilds you only end to with irresponsible people starting them!
---
I thought paladin would be a less played class. But I often have groups with 2 and sometimes 3 of them. This is levels 20-35. Are there generally plenty plenty of paladins?
---
Yeah, same thing happened with my guild. We merged so we all left
---
Hope you're having a good flight brother. grats to 60 btw!
---
What is Blizzard's stance on people who... multibox/bot? I don't know what the correct term is. I'm referring to when you see a person running around then he has four obvious characters not being controlled by a player.  Sometimes they have cheeky names like Warlocka, Warlockb, Warlockc, Warlockd.
---
I would think this is somehow against TOS.
---
Absolutely this.
---
Im not commenting on what's better because I don't know, but if you ever want an item back you vendored/deleted you can go through item restoration.
---
It is. You can turn off PVP by turning off warmode tho. Horde was dominating warmode phasing so blizz increased the warmode bonus for alliance trying to get more people to do it.
---
I actually remember that name, although I don’t recall the shield incident.  I’m sure you’ve gotten better since then! Hope you’re doing well dude
---
I would imagine more people will play retail than you think.
---
Thanks for the fucking laugh ahah
---
Can you re-stealth after cc-ing your target? 
---
I see macros online for gouge/sap into stealth, but it never works for me (whether I macro it or activate the skills manually). I’m always still in combat, even when I wait 15+ seconds into the sap. Is this a PVP only thing? I’ve been trying it in PVE exclusively so far.
---
Right !!!! I know !!! I know it’s a PvP server too but it’s MOONGLADE. We all friends in moonglade!!!! I was making the pikachu face the first time it happened. Especially cause the person who ganked me also ganked a lvl 12 buying spells. He let the lvl 12 finish and he let me get to the fp then BOOM ded lol so rude
---
Exactly mate. We comtracted a study years ago into my branch (Warfare Officer...the ones who 'pilot' warships, basically) and the academics found that reactions and thinking were equivalent to a 0.05 BAC after prolonged periods of 5hrs sleep a night or less.
---
I remember some weeks where I slept 6-10hrs in 3 days during assessments. You just shutdown.
---
During initial training (when you go out-field regardless of service) I distinctly remember a guy in my squad trying to give orders and reason with a tree due to sleep deprivation.
---
I am a civilian now, so love not having to be a work by 7:45am!
---
For an Arms PvP build, which enchant are you all putting on a two hander? Crusader? Lifesteal? Weapon chain?
---
Other than the detailed post explaining my reasoning, none of which you refuted...?
---
Play how you like mate, I think this discussion has run its course.
---
Probably an enchanter. Those disenchant to 3 greater externals sometimes.
---
&gt;The Burst is real
---
The *Boom* * is real
---
Fixed :p
---
Testosterone should be the last of your worries with low sleep, really. Studies have shown that not getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night greatly increases your chances of developing Alzheimer's.
---
I did not know that feature existed! Thanks a lot!
---
But unfortunately I sold it too long ago, should have reacted earlier!
---
You collect at most 1.5 levels of rested at cap afaik.
---
I don't know whether to be scared or intrigued.
---
While the chances are incredibly small, a float could still equal another float. The only way to foolproof the roll is to loop until one is greater than the other.
---
Sounds like you might be depressed.
---
That time during your levels when you get to wear robe of arugal
---
Lol. Huh. I would have imagined you'd instead roll on a more balanced server!
---
Dear Blizzard,
---
Give this playerbase their classic thing as long as they pay. They won't do retail and you know this. Retail is what our kids play.
---
This stuff is like music. We all have our generational vibe. That means a classic+/TBC vibe. Stick to the classic game, with classic mechanics, classic (im)balance, but add more zones and flesh out the old ones.
---
This is what we want our music to be. We'll pay you good money for it too. Acknowledge that and we are looking towards a long and happy marriage.
---
#NOCHANGES REEEEEE
---
Really though, that would be nice.
---
Popular opinion: Quality post. Truly.
---
Every class have their problems mate :)
---
im not sure why you brag about pve perfs when you post a pvp spec, and you are too dumb to realise that what you show is probably not even the best pvp items in your bag.
---
Each layer is meant to replicate, to a point, a healthy server back in vanilla. Quote by Ion:
---
&gt;Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---
Layers had several objectives:
---
* To avoid overcrowding in the world overall, as that would make quest really difficult and it would put extra load on both the client and that particular instance of the server
---
* To avoid having to create a large amount of servers that would potentially end empty once the tourists have left. 
---
* To be able to manage what they consider a healthy expectation of a population come Phase 2, when layering is totally gone and everyone is on the same layer. This is the main point here.
---
This means that they had a dynamic server cap in mind (not technically, but from the point of view of health of the server in the long run) which took into account what they considered would be the drop off. In example, if on a Wednesday at 20:00 the max amount of people online should be around 5k and that the expected player retention will be 8-12%, then they knew that they shouldn't let more than 50k players online at the same time in the server on a particular date. Any value past that number would land you in a queue. 
---
So we have two factors here:
---
* Total max amount of people in the server on **day 1**, taking into account the retain rate and what they consider a healthy amount of people. This amount will be reduced until what they consider a healthy amount of people for a layer. Which is the next point. 
---
* Max amount of people per layer, taking into account that they absolutely had to remove layers by Phase 2, which means, reducing the amount of layers with time. 
---
Where does this leave us? That there was a max amount of layers and that this value is dynamic, as it started at a number (let's say, 10) and they knew they had to reduce it to 1. That means encouraging people to migrate to less populated servers (and queues do that). If they would have allowed 100 layers per server, they would have never managed to reach the amount of players they consider ideal for Phase 2. Think about it, you could have a server with 500k active players on release day and 10% of them stay playing. Because there are no queues whatsoever and there are layers, they are ok playing there. They never migrate, so Phase 2 comes, there's only one layer and you have 50k players active at the same time. This is a very exaggerated example, but this is what they wanted to avoid. 
---
Quote by Ion:
---
&gt;So yes, when you're talking about five digit numbers waiting in line to enter the world, that's enough to fill a couple servers servers, which is why we're bringing servers online and encouraging folks to move.
---
So let's say that you have Server A on release day with a max amount of 50k people in the server, 5k people per layer (using this number) which leads us that the max amount of layers on that server is going to be 10. Once all layers are filled, they do not let more people in because of what I described above, you don't want to encourage too many people to set root in a server that is already at a maximum capacity. They want you to migrate.
---
So, what happens when you start reducing layers? Because you **have to** reduce the amount of layers. Each layer can still hold 5k players, but the server cap is then reduced. It was 10 layers * 5k people = 50k cap. Now there 5 layers, so the total server cap is 25k. And so on.
---
Because at some point, server cap (active players ) will be equal to layer cap. 
---
Why you're wrong is because you think that layer creation is a loose, dynamic, kinda automated process. You think that if there are 35k players online, there are 7 layers. If there are 10k players online, there are 2 layers. That's not how it works. We know this because we understand how this works, because we've seen and tested the amount of layers available, we've seen that after a reset there are queues in some servers that hadn't queues for a while, etc.
---
I will ask you a question.
---
Why are there still queues in some of the layered servers?
---
Making it worse for the alliance I can hardly find a group with or worse for the horse who gank mercilessly?
---
So?
---
I love tbc and wrath, but it's pretty clear vanilla wasn't actually finished before tbc came out.
---
Because you are playing classes, not speccs.
---
Depends on your server popularity, goes for 1k+ on mine.
---
Exactly what I did
---
While I get the authetic experience and all, it really does suck that some classes just have to be awful as dps. I think they could retweek the numbers but then pvp will be more of a nightmare versus the hybrids. If played correctly they are scary because of the utility.
---
Major mana you peasant
---
Because overkilling by 1500 damage isn't mana efficient.
---
this is so accurate it hurts
---
Stop farming the most desired items and just go for the next best thing. 
---
Go dagger instead of sword, get whatever dagger mainhand and distracting dagger offhand (or use green questing one that gives +4 weapon skill). Zero competition. 
---
Buy two DM north rings, 60 total at most. 
---
Shoulders from strat live instead of truestrike etc. if you think it's too hard then I don't know what you want tbh.
---
I’d assume there are 6 fireballs??
---
in which case the stats on it don't matter right? of the tiger isn't more valuable than whale if it's just being de'd. I'm just surprised looking at AH right now and tiger is listed way higher than others

Are you in America? Hoping the NHS in the UK will catch up with TRT as if T levels drop by 1% a year I want make my mid 40s before I’m clinically low.

I rolled Faerlina because I see it as being the most stable and populated server for NA East as my next best bet would have been Herod and that server already has massive imbalances, so it seems like my decision was right.
---
Thank you friend. I did try dropping combat with esc each time, but this has been exclusively soloing mobs in PVE. That’s probably my issue.

From the comments main WoW sub, I recalled why I made this print out (and that it was actually 2005, not 2006).
---
&gt; Oh  my god! Another comment specifying that this was likely at the   Stoutlager Inn made me remember why I printed this and why he's lying on a bed!!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I recall this was my  first journey from Teldrassil to Ironforge. I remember the corpse runs  and the journey through the wetlands to be this epic awe inspiring  adventure. Finally, I was running out and seeing the world beyond  Darkshore. I remember experiencing this deep immersion with my  character, where I had felt this was the furthest from home I had ever  been. I felt sad to say goodbye to the land I called home, but glad to  leave Darkshore. It was the first time I had made it to the Eastern  Kingdoms in the game. The first time seeing the snow and mountains.  After arriving down the path, looking up at the gates of Ironforge, I  imagined how hungry, tired and thirsty my character would have been  after this epic journey. Before heading into the big city of Ironforge, I  would grab a meal at the local tavern and pull up for the night. I laid  down on the bed, warm feelings stirring inside, and closed my eyes. \[print screen\]  
---
&gt;I  probably think I was restricted on my WoW hours, and printed that  moment on my wall to look at to remember that epic journey my character  did. This actually must have been early 2005, because I had not made any  Gnome/Dwarf characters yet (as that was my first time seeing Dun  Morogh). I remember running there so I could meet a friend who just  rolled and see that side of the world.  
---
&gt;Thank  you reddit, I'm so glad I posted this up because it has reactivated the  feelings I really felt in that moment when I printed this. I had  honestly just completely forgotten!
---
In p2 like i said. Don’t dot in p2. My locks dot in p1 and don’t refresh in p2. Our melee do more than white hit in p1. Our melee stay under her in p2. All we can do is yellow hits though. Whit hits are too far away. In p3 we all get up on the ledge and it hepls avoid a lot of stuff. Melee has to get down for p2 though.
---
Sadly they will never learn it seems... and I think for a lot of people they’ll be in for a rude shock come phase 2 when they see how people react to being ganked at every flight point and camped all day and night for honor... they will in fact leave. 
---
Turns out people don’t do things that aren’t fun and having some annoying moron who powered to 60 exclusively in instances to avoid PvP camp them all day with a group of friends and scream at anyone who complains “if you don’t like it fuck off”. They’ll transfer out or reroll and the population issues will get worse.
---
But such is life. They’ll certainly only blame everyone else for it all anyway.
---
...and why is that a problem? Why do you care if WOTLK and Cata servers also exist? They don't affect Vanilla or TBC servers.
---
Your house might be a little empty for the moment but your heart will always stay full. Enjoy the game time together till you two can see one another again. I wish you all the best.
---
I knew the mace was good, but damn I've been using it a long time and didn't appreciate how much I'd use it when I got it. Congrats, luckily as a priest you'll upgrade to Benediction before ya know it! Signed, a shaman waiting to compete for an aurastone hammer
---
This gets thrown around a lot but it seems be. false. 
---
Currently there’s about 44 alliance guilds actively doing MC, to the 11 horde. There is currently no way to census players accurately, but open world suggests about 4-5 alliance per horde, which seems to match endgame content.
---
Don't forget Remove Curse is needed for Strath and Scholo.
---
Do they though? o.o
---
Worse for alliance. I havent really had any issues other than leveling launch. I gank horde all the time. No mercy
---
Server is fine and fun to be on. Never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a group. AH has plenty of mats and the economy is fine. We have MC and Ony on easy farm at the moment. Slightly alliance favored but it’s pretty damn balanced
---
You will never get high warlord doing pugs
---
Yeah im thinking about transferring my Alliance characters on Faeralina to Stalagg or Skeram. Hopefully other Alliance do the same.
---
Obviously it's all the talk about servers that's giving you high latency and crashing your game.
---
Brainwashed criminal thugs
---
his situation is a bit different.   
---
He did what I did. I leveled up gnome engineer. Did the quest that gives you a gnome member card. If you drop engineering and relevel to 200+. Then go to the gnome in steamwheadle and click the book. the book lets you choose specialization again without having to do the quest again. You can even rechoose gnome if u wanted, the option is there. IF you choose goblin. You do not get a "golbin member card". the gnomish one stays in your inventory. If you get rid of the membership card. There is no way to get another card at this time it seems.
---
a good boomkin doesn't good oom, wish people would stop spreading this outdated OOM notion.
---
Its definitely horde favored but not much. Just isnt  as fun playing solo
---
Pretty bird.
---
Ura rogue with mining and herb?! Bruh just run figure 8’s in silithus and and watch your bags fill with ore, stone, gems, and flowers. GG.
---
Of the tiger is good for feral druid, and druid only cares about the stats. I am not sure what the prices you are referring to are, but a leveled green of the tiger is quite good for feral while leveling.
---
Not true at all; I'm (still) Stalagg Alliance but I can tell you that server factions were very imbalanced even before this exodus happened. Prior to the exodus, it was very near (but not quite) a 2:1 ratio in favor of horde. Now, it's closer to 3:1. In the above dude's example, he references a 40 man horde raid being toppled by three alliance guilds that needed to get into BRM; on servers Stalagg is currently that just doesn't happen. If the alliance are able to gather 120 people, statistics show the horde will be able to gather closer to 300 for the same amount of effort. It's not a matter of 'teaming up' because we do that plenty; it's a sheer numbers game.
---
nobody downranks for those 1 minute MC fights. Things will look differently in the next few raids.
---
Nor is it fair for heartseeker horde to watch more alliance transfer over when it’s already 1:4 horde:alliance, but here we are.
---
If it bleeds, we can (and should) kill it.
---
No one likes anyone who says facts don't care about your feelings with an emoji tacked on.
---
I just find all alliance races boring. Humans are boring (also their lore is meh) and I don't see a reason to play human in a fantasy setting anyway. Night elves are drama queens (but at least their lore is interesting, also Malfurion is my favorite character), dwarves are okay and I wouldn't ever play a gnome cause I'm a nice guy
---
Trolls and tauren are awesome, orcs are ugly but they have the best lore by far. I never liked undead and I'm glad Sylvanas is now a villain in BFA. Alliance races are just unappealing; Personally I like draenei more than any of the vanilla four, at least they are part of that awesome draenor lore
---
What's the context, he says "back" so it looks like he made the call before and is just giving an update.
---
It seems wrong to overly blame the community for blizzards bad design choices. Horde have several amazing racials, and are ascetically designed to be the savage pvp race. 
---
You can’t design what is essentially a pvp faction and a pve faction and act surprised when the pvp faction is skewed on every pvp server. Blaming players for rolling the race designed for their play style is so ignorant to overall game design. 
---
I can’t blame the last raindrop but I can blame the 3 inch bucket.
---
going for the sweet pvp bonus on poh for max pvp efficiency :D
---
I am so bad at reading signals and I don't want to face the truth behind problems. 
---
What you mention above is all what I do bad. Thank you a lot.
---
Found the Dane.
---
Do they randomly shit anywhere?
---
I dont know if I would call the questing zones good exactly. They werent the worst by any means, me having to look up a map to remember the names, really says a lot honestly, compared to TBC where I can remember nagrand, netherstorm, shadowmoon valley, hellfire peninsula, zangarmarsh, terrokar forest, blades edge...whatever? Anyway, could just be me, but the zones in northrend arent too good.  
---
Moving beyond that though, I think wotlk really rides hard on 1 raid alone and that is Ulduar. Probably one of the best to ever be done, but the issue is that its basically the 2nd raid in the entire expansion and arguably the first because Naxx already existed.  
---
So right off the start, wotlk started off by rehashing content, you can make an argument that its justifiable, im not here to argue that but merely stating a fact. Cant forget about Malygos and obsidian sanctum, they exist but are largely whatever, then ulduar comes out, which is 10/10, but afterwards you have ToC which literally had you just kill bosses *and* if I remember correctly was time-gated. If I also remember correctly, so was Ulduar but I can be wrong. I *do* remember ICC being time-gated though, which is why I stopped playing eventually, by the time Arthas was a killeable boss, I was so tired of running the first parts of ICC I just didnt care anymore and it practically was killing my guild as others were bored too.  
---
And thats just the pve side of things, I forgot to mention how annoying it was to have Arthas tied into a ton of quests and dungeons as well basically saying "You cant touch me nephelim", like alright bro I got it. But for pvp, you had DKs pretty much break the balance of the game and I dont know *when* they were fixed but I do know it wasnt during this expansion. Terrible.
---
Horde = Offensive, Alliance = Defensive. It's pretty scary to have a night elf hunter + stealth pet or shadow priest come out of nowhere and blow you up
---
Is it insecurity? I mean, what's wrong with acknowledging the truth?
---
If you get enough fire resist it can but at that point you will do much less DPS.  Most people have DBM with a timer that when wrath of ragnaros is about to go off they back out of melee range and wait for it to go off then run back in.
---
In London, they get their heads bashed in.
---
This is all super enlightening. I never would have thought. I truly assumed it was like a weird “rebellious” attitude or “I want to be different” thing. I appreciate everyone’s inputs and I’m gaining more of an understanding.
---
WoW pvp isn’t for you. There will always be an excuse. Someone will always have slightly better gear, one extra person, better mount, engineering while you don’t, etc. And even if none of this is actually true, people will make up reasons. “They had 2 healers and we didn’t” “Paladins are OP we can’t win” “They got the jump”
---
“Fair” world pvp isn’t a thing
---
rip 100g later on
---
Which is why i also favor the same racials on both sides.
---
Pretty sure you have to get a certain number of HKs to count towards it.
---
Many companies have dedicated support teams. The original programmer or team is generally responsible for bug fixes to their code for a period of time , but once something is live and that team has moved on another team takes over maintenance fixes because the original team / programmer is now allocated to other new feature deliveries. It would delay future work to have them constantly doing fixes.

Also, if I am level 20 warlock, is there a way to make alchemy profitable on that level? I harvest any herbs that I find on my way but I don’t know if I should sell them in AH or process it through alchemy and sell potions.
---
Oh, one last thing: how do herb bags work? I saw people in AH selling them. It was called herb pouch, I’m pretty sure. Is it useful or I should stick to usual bags?
---
The FR buff?  Yes, and it also stacks with FR totem as well.
---
I might later today!
---
I’d like to think so, but it’s still up for debate... I’m doing well, and I hope you are too. My time in TA was the pinnacle of wow for me. :)
---
There's huge risk in doing tbc.  Plenty of people DON'T WANT to follow the same failed path (toward retail).  The moment tbc is announced they're gone for good, and they're not going to go to shadowlands.   They don't want the things that retail has, and tbc means that the game they want to play is not going to happen.
---
I'm also a spriest but plan on switching to holy soon. I also have a 59 priest that I leveled mostly holy and it wasn't too bad actually.
---
Shadowmeld is quite defensive, starshards is more of a lore based spell but you can use it while hidden in a bush or behind a tree because it has 360° casting
---
Have you look at what's coming in Shadowlands at all? Shamans are getting totems again, Paladin auras are back, DK stances, etc. They're bringing back a lot of the little things that made classes more unique. Also, retail raids have always been better than classic. You don't get stupid fights where you need 8 tanks with a particular set bonus just to down. There are very few classic bosses that hold a candle to even the worst retail bosses.
---
You've obviously never felt the pride seeing The Barrens or Org the first time on a fresh alt
---
&gt; blizzard choosing to decrease the capacity down to its regular level as they reduce the servers to 1 layer.
---
source that they are reducing server capacity while removing layers or are you just talking out of your ass
---
Its only about racials. The rest are casual player decisions that dint matter anyway.
---
As if Murlocs and Naga don't have enough ships of ours to silly-dandy around in as it is!
---
BGs were cross realm at the end of vanilla and I could still wait 15-25 minutes.
---
I'm on a 55/45 server and it's fun! Last night BRM was being gaurded by horde like 10ish anyways. Our team for UBRS rolled through them but a couple of us did die. Great way to start the night imo.
---
Reee people dont conform to what I deem as acceptable behavior.
---
Doesnt matter if it seems that way or if it really is that way, as long as the result is that the otherside gets beat so hard that they dont want to play there anymore.
---
Its like if you played smash against a friend and just murdered him every time, doesnt matter why it happens. Hes pretty unlikely to continue playing with you.
---
And just to be clear, your opinion is equally anecdotal. Using it as an attempt to discredit what the other guy said just means your argument is also pointless.
---
Im sure we can take what each other say on good faith.
---
Gotta go to where that quest you abandoned is, not the 1st step. It's probably the ghost in Tanaris you talk to while a ghost
---
Nice, gonna get this then.
---
I get to be a cow who turns into a bear or a cat.
---
Because silithus isnt an enjoyable zone for alot of people. So perplexing I know
---
Boomkins are fuking deadly in PvP. They're like siege weapons. Nuke and dead.
---
You are about 15 hours late and add nothing, just like all the circle jerkers downvoting in this thread based on what video game faction they are 👍
---
If you make 30 an hour and live paycheck to paycheck you have to take a hard look at your finances and re do literally everything. Because you are doing something seriously wrong and you need to change now.
---
When they collude with multiple horde guilds, yes. If you’re not a member of those select guilds, you’re fucked.
---
Unfortunately I feel like this would be the case on any server unless you went like Eu if your from NA. But even then ppl would be at work/waking up. If I got that right anyways lol
---
Boomer is a mindset
---
Yeah I agree. Try and find a group to roll with! See you next week in the world :)
---
I would just go look it up on wowhead, or download questie. Wowhead will give you a quest by quest breakdown of the chain, and questie should put an ! on your map where to pick it back up again.
---
Realm caps likely will be reduced across the board
---
That means I'd have to get the Videre Elixer again. Or maybe I can just die?
---
hi im a single dad with 5 kids, 3 jobs, a broken car and 2 other hobbies plus i have to work out regularly. can i still raid, be rank 14 and get scarab lord? thx in advance
---
More people play horde than alliance in general
---
Personally linen I don’t sell.  Everything above that is worth selling on the AH.  
---
Herb bags tend to be cheaper for larger bags but they can only carry herbs. I would stick to usual bags unless you’re using 6 slot bags rn.
---
My b, loaded the thread last night and read it as 2 hours ago lol, sure am late.
---
I have questie already, but can't seem to find the !. It's possible it could be the ghost that you can only see when dead. I'll try it out.
---
I honestly stopped playing because of my irl friends getting left behind in levels and I was getting burnt out. So I started playing csgo and osrs again. After 2 weeks my irl friends quit and started playing retail. After the 3 weeks I finally came back not feeling as burnt out anymore. Found the guild like this.
---
ARRRRRR TEH BLACK PEARL!!!
---
Thanks 😊
---
Warmode was pretty bad too for BFA. After a few weeks I was one of the only Alliance I would come across with it turned on, difference is I could opt out when I wanted to. But I could be doing whatever only to get ganked by several horde. Now in Classic, I dont think Bigglesworth is terribly imbalanced by the feel of it but I hardly get ganked in a 1v1. 2 or 3v1 sure. But the only 1v1s I get are the fights I pick. Now trying to level my boomkin and he gets killed by kids 20 levels higher than him constantly in Duskwood. Horde attracted the minmaxers hard this time after retail imbalance for years.
---
More alliance pussies inc to the PvE server!
---
Alex Jones is controlled opposition. He acts this way to discredit all conspiracies and discussion of them. Anything else you want explained to your smaller than average brain?
---
I might be in the minority here, but the minute they announce TBC, I’m gone. I like Classic WoW, I like the medieval-esque look, I like the 40man raids, I like not having flying mounts. 
---
TBC may be my most disliked expansion. I hate the look of Outland and the way all your gear glows like the goddamn sun. I hate the smaller raid sizes, that make things feel less epic and make raiding more of an elites-only activity. I hate that the writing is so bad that half of it had to be retconned into just being a hilarious misunderstanding. 
---
But most of all, I hate the thought that Blizz will just casually wipe out all the progress I’ve made and set my character to zero again. I worked hard in vanilla for my raid gear, having to throw it all away was kinda bullshit and I don’t want to do it again.
---
If it stays unbalanced for a period of time and the outnumbered faction gets shit on then a lot of players will simply stop playing the game.
---
So you have 2 situations:
---
1. People leave the server to not get camped 24/7
---
2. People stop playing
---
Either way, you will never have balance on your server
---
Alliance run BRM on Stalagg because they organize.
---
represent
---
A shame, I was really looking forward to some 200 vs 200 lag free wpvp.
---
Fuck silithus. Its a depressing zone with its lame color pallatte. Then you have really annoying mobs everywhere, plus the damn silithids themselves and their shitty purple caves.
---
If you're getting punted against Rag, you're standing in the wrong spot.  Your back should be facing a wall so if you get punted, you hit the wall and stop your momentum instead of going flying.
---
No, it doesn’t
---
What herbs you smoking bud?
---
Problem is when you make your own group people expect you to know how to run the dungeons and to take the lead.  Also to know which classes do what. I barely know how to play my own class, I still don't know what like 1/4 of the classes in game do.
---
I  used LFG for a tank for stratholme after waiting forever with no replies I get a whisper "hey I'm a prot paladin can I tank for you"  I didn't know wtf to say the only tanks I've seen so far have been bear druids and warriors but hey maybe paladins can tank (I know they can heal).  So i said ok he can join, he says he will only tank if he gets all the orbs I didn't even know what orbs were (turns out they are an ingredient for enchanting). 
---
I didn't know if demanding all orbs was reasonable so I asked in party chat and two of the other guys said ok and healer said fuck this and left.  At this point about 20 minutes had passed. After healer left everyone else dropped group.
---
I ran it with my guild later and no hassle at all - that would be my advice find a guild that is recruiting rogues.
---
No duh
---
Yeah, this isn't out of the ordinary. When I hit 60 on my rogue I struggled to get in groups because of the competition for loot. It takes a ton of patience, but in reality every class is going to have to compete for loot other than prot warriors. What worked for me was finding a fresh guild oriented towards getting gear and starting my own groups for dungeons. Since there are a ton of rogues, always be kind in your groups and you might make friends that'll help you. Doing 1 nightly dungeon for a specific piece (due to tough working schedule) did wonders and now I'm close to full prebis. Best of luck to you.
---
Grats
---
This isn't even close to a sample of the average player base of wow classic.   It's mostly pirated server ppl.   Also, it's being reported as a bug or issue that needs resolved so more people are likely to upvote it.   
---
Reverse Checkmate
---
As a mage I'm rolling vs like 8 people every raid. Went a month without getting a molten core item until I decided to join a guild with a loot system, but even that is kind of slow because we have so many mages who want items. 
---
Also warlocks and shadow priests absolutely fuck you in PvP, as do good druids but thankfully those are scarce
---
This is great! North and his fellow group of spergs, better known as &lt;GRIZZLY&gt; create a terrible experience for their own faction. Said faction then transfers off of server, further creating more imbalance. North then creates a surprisedpikachuface video, crying for Blizzard to "right this wrong." 
---
Good job &lt;GRIZZLY&gt;, you played yourself! If you wouldn't have treated classic like you did the private servers you might have been able to enjoy this game in a years time. I personally cannot wait to see how this all unfolds.
---
Bonus points if she got upset that you didn’t stay up until 1 am every night because she didn’t have to work until 11 AM, meanwhile, my ass needed to be up for work at 5am; and if you started nodding off she accused you of being an old man, meanwhile, she literally cannot get out of bed without 9 hours of sleep at a minimum.
---
NO CHANGES BOIS
---
What's the bug with the Battle Chicken?
---
There was some solid object you could create with engineering, forgot which, and people got banned for using it to block AH.
---
It's very much not 50/50.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=14&amp;minLevel=55&amp;realm=4647_Grobbulus

I mean &lt;Flat Azeroth Society&gt; does exist.

---
The crash only happened once, which was when I gave up for the night. My game was running fine for about an hour, but once I moved from STV, I started lagging and disconnecting every few minutes. As others have said, this is likely a software/hardware issue.
---
LOL stop whining, your fault.
---
At some point there was some solid object you could create with engineering, forgot which, and people got banned for using it to block AH. You could also do other cool stuff with it, like a stairway to heaven.
---
I have no clue what I just watched but I fucking love it
---
#nochanges (ignore the tons of changes already) people hate play the spec in retail but I'm classic say spec is ur identity. Honestly Respec costs and system suck but you won't get discussion here because this is subreddit has too many tards.
---
I tried to hit 60 by discovering Stormwind as horde, but it only gave me 8 xp and I was 34 xp away, so I said FUCK IT and TPed to Moonglade, flew to Winterspring, and killed an owl. Yay...
---
Please tell me someone recorded these bare Knuckle brawls
---
latency?
---
Literal racist. Tried to form essentially the KKK in WoW.
---
Is that actually a requirement to be a devilsaur mafia? I'll be the first to admit I don't have a private server history but I'd never heard that was a hard requirement. Everything I've heard just implied it was a group of people controlling the devilsaur spawns and supply.
---
Yep. I played solo on Stalagg Alliance during 8am-4pm weekdays and even during those times I got regularly ganked by Horde. And not regular ganked, the camped kind. Or the higher level with a ‘go back to retail’ macro kind. And they always had the ‘I’m either a shithead kid or troubled adult’ character names (Thailadyboys, Feetpicsplz, various slang for dick)
---
And this was back when the article came out with server pops and Stalagg was the worst horde dominated server. 
---
After the article and transfers, within a few days it felt like half the alliance transferred off. The population in cities noticeably shrank. Our guild waited a week and went too. Can’t even imagine what that server looks like now.
---
This boomer IS okay.
---
Because that's the trash retail mentality that ruins the game. 
---
I know I'm being hyperbolic, but it is.
---
People want an RPG.  Not a fucking esport.  The game encompasses all facets of play and separating them does nothing but divide the players and the world.
---
You can get relatively equal gear for high level pvp that you can get for high level pve.  Some pve acquired items will be the best for pvp and some pvp acquired items will be the best for pve. 
---
That's the way it should be.  It promotes both styles of player to participate in each side.  No one is being forced to do shit.  You're not forced to get a specific piece of gear. 
---
Stop trying to separate everything.
---
"no I mean where did you respec from"
---
"Thunder Bluff"
---
Doesn't increase the damage dealt or HP.
---
However, the level brings other advantages. The chance to hit should be higher. The chance to be hit - lower. It will also detect rogues from a fair range, as it is 3 levels higher than them.
---
Only guild left on the server? Lmao. Horde on Stalagg are like children eating crayons. Grizzly, Fusion, ToW, Turbo Bus could wipe out the entire horde population if the opportunity meets
---
People scream “no changes” they get no changes. Now they all want changes... I get that would be cool... but we got what we asked for
---
I kinda like it. BRM won't be as bad on Tuesday without the honor system in place. Basically a 1 reset reprieve from the slaughterfest we know it will become.
---
I want to change the keys to command my pet as a hunter. But i cant find it in the options. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Google said there is a seperate section but i dont see it.
---
Lol. The classic 9-1 matchup.
---
With only their base kits and no pots. Im losing to frost mages 10 levels below me
---
So why don’t they do it the other way around? They should have a big campaign to get Alliance TO the horde dominated servers. 
---
“Calling all Alliance in the fight against the horde! Your allies are being overrun on X server and need your help! Free alliance transfers to take up arms and to help your fellow allies not get surprise buttsexed every time they leave Stormwind!”
---
And cancer
---
I found this guy’s yt channel and I’m a little disappointed with the complete lack of results or demonstration. By my own reckoning, no amount of proc fishing and consumables brings you close exceeding a standard ranged hunter. This only seems reasonable for someone already stuck with Nightfall duty.
---
Gatekeeping, stirring shit, and failing at trolling in one comment? YIKES!
---
It’s a pretty good balance IMO. Im horde though so it’s gonna be a target rich environment 😎
---
It will forever be like this. Its biology. Fight it all you want. It’s futile. And look around you in the world. Everyone of substantial power lives by these “rules of nature”
---
late to the show and already been posted mate
---
I just simply wanted to be an orc.
---
Some guy on the internet doesn't speak his second language as well as I speak my first XDDDDD!!!!!!!! Gotta get some internet points outta dis
---
&gt;Blizzard can stop channel invites by essentially a flick of a switch.
---
So can players.
---
In not denying that, but I was never a "no changes" fundamentalist.
---
Dude. She bitches at you for paying attention to her SIX hours out of the week? You should’ve ran then alone. Principality, not the fact you were playing wow.
---
boomer = enemy of the modern comrade
---
&gt; If it stays unbalanced for a period of time and the outnumbered faction gets shit on then a lot of players will simply stop playing the game.
---
yes. which is why preventing servers from getting balanced is an important thing to do...
---
Hyuk hyuk, DAE marijuana?!
---
I hit wand and watch netflix on phone or 2nd screen
---
I have it! It deals about 20% more damage on basic attacks and has about 20% more HP(still quite squishy, definitely below 1000 HP)
---
It also has a new fire attack which deals ~100 damage and applies a stack of Flame Buffet. It casts that one quite often.
---
The Flame Breath attack is being casted a lot more often too(which hits for 300). Mithril dragonling uses that one too, but in my experience much rarer.
---
The real kicker is that they don't share the 1 hour cooldown timer. So you're not using it INSTEAD of a Mithril Dragonling. You're free to use them together. Not at the same time, of course(1 minute shared cooldown), but overall you'll be able to have summons available more often.
---
The normal  Dragonling(non-mithril version) deals about 50% of the Mithril's damage(40% of Arcanite's) and doesn't do the flame breath at all, so that one kind of sucks. Still better than nothing, I guess.
---
What? It was a joke, I have no idea what you're on about.
---
Yes, I am on skeram alliance side. Our economy was cut in was almost cut in half by the amount of transfers to heartseeker.
---
0.0001% chance of 3 people rolling 100.
---
Dual spec would be neat. Even if they made it so you had to visit a class trainer and pay 5g. Still better than 50g with an absurd decay.
---
I don't think this had much to do with a potential language barrier.
---
Quite the lengthy excuse!
---
Anyway, enjoy the consequences :)
---
Playing this game 15 yrs and TIL....
---
Imagine overthinking it to such a degree when in reality it’s because orcs look cool
---
We were gambling hard last night
---
If one mob resists and you have ice barrier up just resume normal business. If 2 or more resist you have to cold snap and nova them again. 2 or more will eat away your barrier too quickly and burn your health and mana trying to aoe the mobs. Get Dreadmist set in Scholo for easy gear that has high int and stam. Always have a mana ruby up just in case you need extra mana. If you have questions lmk! DBM says ive done it 204 times now haha
---
&gt; No one whoncame back for classic is going to funnel to retail.
---
There's no way the suits at Activision understand that. They see classic as the original star wars, people who experience it will want to buy the new one.
---
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe some people made a post about this joke before you?
---
Protip: find a healer and make friends with them. Help them quest and give them the mana pots you find. If they have an alt offer to carry their alt on a dungeon.
---
Now instead of looking for a group you start the group and you will have your healer, filling out the rest is easy
---
But the free transfers change nothing. The game is not designed to have balanced servers.
---
I would keep herb/alch if you already have it, alch at max will always make money. In classic it is probably the most reliable profession for gold because flasks and pots will always be in demand.
---
Tailoring isn't terrible, there's a few ways at max to make money from it but mostly it is to craft a few select items and then people end up dropping it and picking up something like...alchemy lol.
---
The soul pouch is nice but also not needed until later in the game when you start to use more soulstones...keep in mind that these herb/soul bags take a bag spot and can ONLY hold the type of item they were made for. So you give up bag space for other things, definitely nice later on when you need 24 shards but at level 20 you basically have like 3 abilities that use shards so, having actual bags for quest items and stuff is better.
---
Also, alchemy is good for warlocks too, you can craft potions and things that will boost your armor or give you health regen
---
This guy’s post is spot on. As a warrior
---
I always have to tank 5 mans, but I’m trying to grad Pre-BIS for raid attendance and rogues are my main competition for gear.
---
That being said, I always pass gear to rogues and roll on prot gear as main spec if I’m tanking.
---
I def think they could do this for some specs.. I would love to see arcane mages viable :(
---
To be more specific, it's the node on the island at 44.6,56.8. There is a patch of elemental water that spawns there, and the thorium, and you'd have to fish while waiting on their timers
---
I just hit 41 andni feel like my questing areas are stalling. It looks like finishing up STV is all I have left for greens / yellows. Do I just continue to grind dungeons as a priest?
---
Sounds like you were part of the problem
---
Take meds schizo
---
Key Binding - Action Bar - Per Action Bar
---
An example of one of your macros would help.
---
Ya we broke up cause she was overbearing. I literally raid logged for those 6 hours a week maybe a few late night hours doing islands and shit and she said I cared more about WoW then her.
---
Now swim to that island south of tanaris.
---
Last sensus and according to wow sensus site there are more alliance players.
---
Wish I'd known this last night when I had to go see that Duke Hydraxis jerk!
---
Yup. I quit quite early in BFA. I figured I'd log in and see what was in store for the 15th anniversary. Flew down to tanaris to talk to the dragons, tried to do the anniversary event. Not high enough ilvl. Promptly logged out with no intention of logging back on. Still putting in dozens of hours into classic. Have no interest in shadowlands either.
---
So, im a level 56 sham and im following a combination of icy veins and wowhead BiS gear for Ele. But ii also like healong and keep healing gear. I've neber raided but im lookong forward to it. 
---
My question is the pre-raid BiS gear something i want to wear into a raid, or will i need a certain number for Fire Res?
---
Are their any raids where I can stroll in with my healing gear, and won't need Fire Res?
---
Elemental fire isn't expensive because horde camp all spawns, it's expensive because a lot is needed, it is 5-7g on most populated servers. That being said faction imbalance is definitely æ large problem
---
Some people will buy a green 'of the bear' or whatever gear as a stop cap. Imagine still using a level 40 item since scarlet monastery? It is way easier to buy a green now for 3 gold and be a decent upgrade until you get that Scholo Drop.
---
Most people rolled Alliance back in retail vanilla and want to change it up this time around. In addition, all the wannabe PvP tryhards like Horde for the racials... all in all the prevailing sentiment in the Classic community is Horde favored, which has an influence on the few new arrivals as well.

---
Rogue life man. Glad I got my bis early. At least you can but tarnished rings for 35g in dire maul from hunters
---
Lmaoo I saw you motherfuckers! I ran up and just watched for like 2 minutes before I logged 🤣
---
I didn't ask for no changes. I played on Kronos which had 5g respec cap. It was great.
---
Wow I've never seen someone write so much and be so confused.  It'd actually insane to me that you think the server cap was 50k at one point.
---
&gt;You think that if there are 35k players online, there are 7 layers. If there are 10k players online, there are 2 layers. 
---
This is most definitely not what I think, in fact is almost the exact opposite of what I think which is that the cap hasn't changed since they increased it on day 2 and I've said as much multiple times.
---
If you can't even grasp the most basic things I've said please don't write essays....  Holy fuck dude
---
Be ready for downvotes but I don't judge you. You don't need to have a lot of gold but you would like it. If you can afford 1day paycheck for some descent gold, go for it, farming is easy for people who has a lot of free time to kill, not for everyone.
---
Any attempt at clarification that starts with “did you read my earlier comment” is pretty impolite. It’s also just funny that it would serve them well to follow their own advice.
---
&gt; Horde on overpopulated servers: HAHAHA RED IS DEAD FUCK OFF IF YOU DONT LIKE BEING CAMPED FOR HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also Horde on overpopulated servers: Where did everybody go? Guys come back I need you to farm honor! Come be a glorified NPC!
---
this is true and makes me chuckle, it goes both ways. its a self made issue. act like assholes and wonder why no one wants to play with you
---
because trolls
---
Yes. If you have +0 spell power then the highest rank is the most mana efficient in terms of dmg/mana.
---
But as you get more spell power the lower ranks gain almost the same damage increase and cost a fraction. The higher ranks are more effective in terms of damage/sec but slowly lower and lower ranks will surpass the higher ranks.
---
I'm plaiyng a rogue right now and am almost fully preraid bis. All but  3 items are preraid bis, and those that aren't are second best at minimum.
---
This is honestly just a part of gearing in classic. Yes, I compete with a lot of people but that's just how it works. If I need an item I just spam the dungeon until I get it. For example I have over 100 UBRS rend kills and still not my mainhand. Guess what i'm planning on doing today? That's right, getting the Mainhand.
---
In the Guild I am right now, they are heavily focusing on Melee power thanks to windfury totem and at least 3 groups are stacked with warriors/rogues and a shaman in it. We clear MC under an hour easily. Some places are just better for casters than others. For example I spam Scholomance for the Shadowcraft set but the only other Melee I take is a tank because there are so many encounters that are easier with a mage/warlock than if you have a 2nd rogue. 
---
The upsides of Rogues in PVE is that we can avoid threat issues due to our toolkit and are generally harder to kill for encounters, have practically no downtime since we don't need to regen any resources and have insane burst damage with blade flurry. Our top rogues break 1k DPS on certian MC fights.
---
That's pretty much it. If you are a casual and don't have the dedication/time/will to make your own groups and spam those dungeons for that gear then rogue is probably not the class for you.
---
Yeah I just left one of those "dead" guilds. It had been 3 weeks since anyone but me and another warrior logged in. 
---
Least I found an active raiding guild now and already done my first night of MC with them and gotten a set-piece.
---
&gt; guess what most tanks are? Fury warriors in disguise.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
The issue is someone will have to watch the kids (daycare) if you both work a full time position. Lets say for example you and the wife make an equal amount of money and are both equally responsible for paying your bills: You both then have less time with the children and they are instead being raised by the state/daycare/school they go to. It causes alot more issues (especially very early in childhood development) for both the mother and child if the mother is not around. Our hyper focus on equalizing everything we can find is actually a harmful process. Mothers should at the very least spend a great portion of their time in early child development.

the top bar is TitanPanel

Epic Mount is your Best in Slot until Phase 6+. It is BIS for PVP and PVE.

Wow classic has incredibly low bandwidth. I played on a 4g tether no problem last week.

I doubt that, but I'm simply not following enough games to really know.

Football? Nope.

Counter Strike? As far as I know, nope.
---
League of Legends? As far as I know, nope.

WoW? As far as I know, Sweden has a profile because of Kungen. Don't really know of any Scandinavian big timers apart from him.

Yeah I thought that might be the case. They fall off in the 30s...
---
Nobody except devs should care about where other people transfer to, it just happens that being the majority faction is more benefical so there's no reason for people to transfer.
---
How do you know this and how can I learn more about hit?
---
&gt; Its hard to choose PvP as end game goal without PvP system in the game yet.
---
Imagine if you could pvp the enemy faction of the joy and knowing you were making other players mad after killing them over and over again. Never mind I guess we need a "system" in order to pvp ...
---
Wow community... *sigh*
---
That's not a reason, then the price should be 500g.
---
Gratz on 60, what’s the name of that add-on across the top of the screen?
---
We’ve had a boom kin consistently be on the top 15 dps for our rag clearing raid every week.
---
They arnt bad. People hate too much
---
U mad bro?
---
I dinged 60 a week and a half ago, i specced holy at 55, went with spirit tap and imp wand.
---
For questing its not so bad, takes a bit longer to kills mobs but not by much.
---
For dungeon im really glad i did, it is possible to heal dungeons in shadow but to make ur life alot easier go holy.
---
Stratholme and scholoman are really much harder then what you have healed before. More fun tho, even you dont look up from the bars haha.
---
For me it was fine to level als holy, just take spirit tap and imp wand, and some holy damage talents. Respec to 21/30/0 at 60
---
They're viable on short fights where mana isn't an issue.
---
Once the fights start to last longer in BWL and AQ40 they won't be able to keep up as they go oom pretty fast. They weren't called 'oomkins' back in the day for nothing.
---
Sounds like the rest of your raid is pretty bad. Unless you bring 25 healers.
---
What are everyone’s thoughts on blizzlike private servers? I just got on one that is 3.3.5 WOTLK and is 5x exp from quests and mobs and gold from quests and 7x tradeskill. Having a good time it’s new just launched and was retarded easy to install just make a webpage account and download the zip from mega and run the exe and use the webpage account creds. 
---
It’s at wowportal.net 
---
I love classic but I don’t love vanilla my nostalgia is for tbc and WOTLK
---
You can just die to run there
---
It's more fun to play on a server that has 80% of people in your faction. Why would anyone in their right mind pick the less fun gameplay experience?
---
Danish guy here, it's 100% not a language barrier issue. He just misunderstood the question/Doesn't know how context works.

Let me tell you kids, back in my day, we had it so rough... or so much better, i can't tell anymore. anyway, every day, we would wake up at 2 in the morning and go to the table for breakfast. we all lived in a closet, you see, so it was one room. and we would ask, me and my 64 brothers and 27 sisters, "what's for breakfast mum?". she would smack us all with a shoe and say "cold beans". and if we complained and said "but we had cold beans yesterday" - because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say "tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say "you bloody kids are late", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say "ok line up kids", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask "whats for dinner mum?", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say "rotten cabage". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say "im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say "ok time for bed". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say "ok kids time for your pocket money". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said "oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. "you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said "no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. "mr henderson," said dad, "i have some kids here who need a good whooping". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said "right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout "oi you bloody kids, its curfew". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to school.

Not my story, but I saw a guy post on here on how many runs it took him to get his Savage Gladiator Chest. It has a theoretical 8% chance to drop off of Gorosh the Dervish, who theoretically appears 20% of the time as the boss of the Arena. Personally, out of 42 arena trips (child's play) I've seen him once. There's a .014% chance of that, yet there it is.
---
Now, before I share the ending of the story, let's look at the probability of getting this chest. It's 20% (or .2) times 8% (.08) for a total chance per run of arena of 1.6%, or a 98.4% chance you don't get it. So it's fairly rare, got it.
---
It took him over 600 runs (I believe the number was in the 640s, but I can't recall exactly) to get the chest. So, plug that into my calculator, and the chance of it taking that many runs to get the chest is .0033%. Damn, that's unlucky. Also, he is far more dedicated that I am.
---
you can! 5/x/5 is the best leveling talent build until 44, when you can get both shadowform and wand spec. [it would look something like this at 39.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05-22505100212-5) healing focus and renew are optional, spend those points on whatever feels right. also, feel free to get imp SWP if mobs take longer than 15 seconds to die.
---
you can heal everything easily, you can frontload damage with holy fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; Mind Blast (-&gt; Smite), then switch to wand and let spirit tap pretty much always run it's full course, while killing as fast as possible. throw in a renew or heal as needed, but I'd advise against shield, it's extremely inefficient.
---
This is normal and not class specific. The change from constant progress and adventure to slow and patient grinding. It's normal to run a dungeon 10 times to end up losing the roll to even an off-spec. It just takes some time. When it all comes together after a few weeks, you'll find yourself geared up and confident. That being said, I do know that rogues have a tough time in certain instances and raids. From my standpoint though, they are my favorite physical DPS to invite to a group (I usually only have one physical DPS in my groups, in addition to the tank).

Your nick explain why you don’t understand it.

Warcraft III Thrall

We’ll see how it works out with Classic. So much of the stuff people have seen have been wrong from private servers or memory.
---
I am. I love being on an alliance dominated server. Rarely get ganked, can focus on PvE without issue, and when I wanna PvP I can easily find someone to gank. It’s perfect 👌
---
How can I have a discussion with someone who doesn't understand my argument at a fundamental level?  You literally just told me I think then polar opposite of what I actually think.  If you can't understand the words I'm typing what's the point of typing them.  
---
Bye buddy
---
Yes. That's why I said almost.
---
The formula is spell power * cast time / 3.5.
---
So rank 10 of a spell that takes 3.5 seconds to cast get 100% of +spell power. If rank 5 takes 3 seconds it gets 3/3.5 = 87% spell power. But since it costs less than 87% of mana it gains more dmg per mana than the rank 10 for each spell power you get. 
---
Instant cast spells get 50%
---
Oh, than actually his experience is fairly common.
---
You got it from the questline that’s starts in blasted lands and then you have to enslave one there at the end of the questline
---
The horde are a band of misfits. Hated by the rest of the world they band together and create their own family. The orcs were literal slaves to the alliance following WC2. The alliance are literally the bad guys in wow.
---
What? Maybe Grizzly once a week. Since the P2 announcement, horde have literally been camping both entrances with dozens of mages
---
Yeah it's literally one hour of farming
---
Why are you yelling at me?
---
There's a book you have to read to undo the Gnomish engineering specialization.
---
Yep I found that on my server. That area is super good fishing because there are so many pools that spawn fast. No stonescale eels, as the area is the lower level area. 
---
But that one wreckage just taunts you haha.
---
I dont like the flying mounts. I dont like the shared city. I dont like the welfare epics that starred in tbc, and pvp was insanely unbalanced. I was able to arena and bg and never leave the capital city and get a full set of end game gear. I hated that they took away 40 man raids. It was imo the start of all the negative things wow became. Karazan was a masterpiece though.
---
You guys are malding.
---
Anyone else come in the thread, read OP's responses to people, and decide to downvote everything he said?
---
o.o
---
And Danish gamers are not arrogant but above average in terms of skill?
---
It’s still often used incorrectly, but basically if you find yourself dismissing somebody younger who says you’re wrong and is backing their claims with strong, often well researched evidence, you’re a boomer.
---
the stop channel invites still shows the channel in the chat. If blizzard removed that we'd be cool
---
Classic+ would be nice. Keep level cap at 60, same general gameplay mechanics, but flesh out zones, add more content, and do a balance pass on bad talents.
---
In terms of damage, they are both awful. Arcanite Dragonling is only used in AQ/Naxx for the fire damage debuff it puts on the boss.
---
TBC is so much better solely because hybrids weren’t l2heal.
---
dAe NoChAnGeS
---
execpt there were changes regardless.
---
Only if the lower rank is before level 20.
---
The expense of respeccing leads to weird hybrid specs, like the 31/5/15 arms tank spec of warriors who tank but also pvp. It forces you to make choices, choices that matter. 50g is not that bad to farm if you really want to swap specs. Yes, if you want to swap specs whimsically every dungeon, or in a dungeon, it sucks, but you really shouldn't ever need to do that.
---
I'm not saying he doesn't understand the meaning of the words said. But he didn't understand the context. OP says 'from' meaning 'from what spec to what spec' when the other person thought he meant (you are) from (where). The subject of the sentence was implied and he didn't correctly guess the implied part.
---
Implied context is part of language.
---
not really such a big issue today since the bossfights are much shorter than back then
---
&gt; 21/30/0 at 60
---
My favorite.
---
He said expensive not impossible.
---
Its not about playing a slightly lesser spec. Its about trying to play a significantly lesser spec, which is only god awful because of the "hybrid tax bs." The game doesnt have to be like this. Theres no reason that the hybrids have to be relegated to healing. Its just dishonest to act like they are only slightly worse than warrior/mage/rogue. Theres a literal toxic mentality around meme specs and theres no real reason for the hybrids to suffer this fate other than some butthurt developers joined on last second to make them bad. I dont mind if my boomkin is not top dps, I just want to play it reasonably well.
---
You seem really upset for some reason, sorry if I hurt your feelings. I made a joke and didn't read all the posts.
---
Anyone can see which ones are real and which ones are trapped before you open it.
---
If you have to ask, you’ll probably never see loot from a world boss anyways as the top guilds in your server will have it locked down :/
---
If you are farming use cheaper arrows .... it will save you money.  The DPS loss isn't that high right?
---
Hunter
---
You’ll be doing decent if you have the knowledge and mechanical prowess of like a venruki or xaryu but if ur just a 2k rated player or below ur going to get slaughtered with a few cheeky kills here and there on below average opponents.
---
The game doesn't reward you for playing on the minority faction. You're better rerolling or transfering.
---
Oh that just triggered my memory of the event yeah. Thanks for clarifying.
---
That's pretty zesty all right
---
&gt;Swedish gamers are arrogant but mediocre
---
Now, I might be biased because i'm Swedish, but imo I like playing with swedish people, in most cases swedes are pretty skilled, now - arrogant, you're totally right about that one lol.
---
You need to cast into the node not to walk in .... -.-
---
The folks on the 20% side dont get to play much as is.

Sadly, not really. He's in this thread though talkin a little shit to these fakers as ysrl: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dtbmer/dont\_worry\_i\_saved\_us\_from\_bfa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dtbmer/dont_worry_i_saved_us_from_bfa/) talki

Depends on the class, it can be 2 hours of farming for the worst classes since professions aren't a viable dedicated activity.
---
What i meant with it is that from what I read in your post I get the vibe you only want to have warrior for the tank reasons wich would mean focusing on finding a group in end game and if that doesn't sucseed it  feels like wasted time? Ofc warrior dps is great and all but because of how you put emphasize on tank then forbthat purpose doesnt feel like it would be the good choice.
---
Your AOE farm spec is what you're looking for. The only thing you lose is frostbite but your damage should be the same.
---
I'd sell that for as much as you can get. You're missing out on guaranteed spell power from other weapons for an occasional non-scaling 100 damage and inconsistent mana regen.
---

Roommate in college was a feral druid offtank/dps from BWL to Naxx

I saw Boomkins into aq40 also.  One was a ninja so that's why I *really* remember.

What exactly does phase 2 mean?
---
Neither. I rent ($1500/mo) plus have kids in sports.
---
Join a guild as it is forming, with people that seem cool. I joined one when it had 15 60s and no main tank, because a guy I quested with in Un Goro was chill. So I said I’d tank. A couple pug heavy MCs later we are full guild run, downing rag, establishing the real loot system, and people are excited
---
**AND CAPSLOCK MEANS I'M RIGHT AND NO ONE ELSE'S OPINION MATTERS**
---
Which isn't true, higher heals are universally more HpM efficient. You downrank for the convenience of healing various tiers of damage.
---
What’s the going price? I bought some during wotlk. Gold was super easy to get past that imo. With honor system launching, I won’t be spending too much farming. I’ll take the easy way out any day. Fuck the haters
---
Why aren't the hordes transferring if they want to go to a more balanced server?
---
Kids, learn from this man and remember to keybind
---
Top 15 DPS out of around 25. If you're just talking about Rag, then the ~10 melee you have won't be doing full dps, so essentially oomkins are still bottom dps there.
---
I love rogues in my dungeon group. They don't spaz out AOEing everything and making elite mobs run around everywhere except for where the tank is. With a rogue in the group, I know the current focus target will melt fast.
---
To be fair, what doesn’t give you cancer? Seriously. It seems like everything is tied to it somehow...
---
Not saying you shouldn’t get sleep, you definitely should. Just more of an observation I’ve started to see.

Could have helped on the condition he got the firewater.
---
Do you play only on laptop? How does it run Classic?
---
Got characters on Firemaw and Gandling and have never seen the (queue: free migration button) so I assumed. Well I was wrong I see, fair play. 
---
Not trying to spread misinformation, just not paying attention to blue posts and just my own experiences.
---
These websites don’t work at all lol. It’s funny how false those stats are. I play alliance and I’ve never felt at disadvantage to horde. Ever.
---
This is just a normal occurence if you play ally on Fairbanks.
---
As a horde on heartseeker I don't want to bail.
---
I just want 3-4 solid horde guilds to transfer in, and no alliance to transfer in, and we'd be set.
---
That font though...
---
The answer is to level a mage and grind ZF.
---
Full group of people who needed the quest, accumulated because he was hoarding all of the kills so these people all ended up waiting together for a chance to get the first tag.
---
I ended up getting lucky by guessing when he would respawn, popped Blood Rage and made a hamstring macro that targeted the chief, and had just enough rage to hit him with it the moment he spawned.
---
Care to eleborate what this mean?
---
Thank you internet explorer.
---
That's amazing lol
---
Except their dps, or ret dps is not only 20% less. I like the versatility, I like the skill ceiling of managing a class with a lot of abilities. But theres no reason for the hybrids to be significantly worse when they are played well. Significantly worse to the point where people laugh you out of the dps spot for dungeons and raids.
---
I play an MMO as a human to showcase HUMAN SUPREMACY
---
we need to put those mindless savages in their place or the world itself will be destroyed.
---
I didn’t say or insinuate hybrid class DPS is “only slightly worse than [top DPS classes]”. I said and insinuated a DPS class in an off spec is still fun and viable. But since you want to go there...
---
We have a raiding Ret with BRE — he’ll probably move to Nightfall later on. We have a raiding s.priest that does just fine. And I raid as cat and am constantly in top 5 without MCP. We don’t yet have a moonkin, but I suspect we will before long.
---
All three are hybrid DPS clearing MC in ~90min, and having a great time doing it.
---
The game has flaws, it has for 15 years. It’s not changing at this point. **And it’s not like we didn’t know what we were getting into when we rolled our class/spec this time around...**
---
Find the fun in what you have or be miserable.
---
/r/uselessredcircle
---
Same, I don't buy gold but because I'm a mage and I kind of like to do chill DM farm routine while watching whatever I feel like to watch. I don't know I just like it.
---
You can pin point it. After Ulduar was cleared and you had to do Trial of the Crusader 4 times a week on 4 difficulties
---
Try thinking about what you would be if you wrote a novel about your character... like, not super in depth, but it will draw you towards the archetype you'll be most invested in. Screw weighing things like warrior investment costs, and mage farming abilities... that won't keep you invested in your character, and with the little time you have to play,  you will need the extra love of your char to keep the grind going.
---
Both.

He didn’t even drop a Firewater so it’s definitely not a guaranteed drop.

About an hour is explaining fights, so once we have no more pugs, it’ll be probably 3

They weren't all that important in TBC, WotLK and Cata. Did hardcore raiding and ignored them for the most part.
---
I agree, I was commenting on the part about faster BGs Qs for these realms
---
Storyline from warcraft mostly
---
I just don't bother getting upset/salty over poor rolls or bis. Sure, it's nice to get that item but often I just look for a middle ground item just because I don't wanna spend all my time looking for something that only gives me an extra say +15 healing.
---
I was fortunate to be overgeared for it and got by with a few Mana pots and the oil of immolation
---
Wait. Do you even play on Stalagg? Almost every Wednesday the alliance control BRM. They are very organized for the smaller faction and come out on top a lot..
---
I’d say no. No chance.
---
Your first drink too? XD no offense just kidding :P
---
&gt;kills all players and npcs till itself is killed
---
Not anymore. Once you lose control and leave the area, it does the same thing the Infernal does and just disappears. Also, you don't need 5 people. Curse of Doom has a chance to summon one as well.
---
Terrible is pretty harsh. To me, terrible means they are doing more harm than good. I see no reason why a raid couldn’t have one or two in it and do just fine
---
Rank 10 is obtainable by anyone that focuses on PVP to rank.
---
Anything higher than that and you're entering "No-Life" territory.
---
those are the Philadelphia Eagles. A garbage football team that plays in the NFC East.
---
Because I think the PvP in retail is dogshit, obviously.
---
What’s the point of your comment if you’re not going to contribute or be constructive? Does it boost your ego every time you act all arrogant? Life will teach you lessons my friend.
---
Phase 2 is going to be ~~Dire Maul,~~ world bosses and honor system. ZG was Phase 4.
---
Play cat.
---
I got rank 9.75 back in the day with only playing a few hours a day. However if you take a week off like I did, it will be a large setback.
---
I wasnt over geared for it but i went in to make sure i could see everything and completed it relatively easy. I ran oom at one time, but my regen was high enough i was at 3/4 by the next wave.
---
Yeah this sounds about right. Being cynical with blizzard is really the only way to be to avoid getting your hopes crushed
---
Layers/Sharding do not belong in an MMO. If you cannot make an MMO function without the use of those systems, you have no business being in the MMO market.
---
Angerforge would be pretty frickin hard with a 52 tank =p
---
At your level you may want to try and form groups to clear out the prison wing.  It is all level 48-50 elites with a handful of bosses.  Then you finish it up with Arena.  
---
Or you could do arena as much as possible (until instance reset limit) and then clear the Prison wing only at that time. 
---
Clearing prison will at least get plenty of XP for the group, I think 3 or 4 bosses including the arena boss, and plenty of cloth/greys and a chance at greens/BOE Blues
---
Yo shadowlands looks legit though. Wish the talent system was more like classic though.
---
Who the heck sleeps at 9pm when they start at 11? That’s a shitton of sleep, man.
---
&gt;  allowing people to transfer off of it because they didn't like our choice to overpopulate, and now as a result it is way too unbalanced.
---
Right. Which indicates that very few people actually want to play on the less-populated faction. This is not a Blizzard problem; it's a player problem.
---
&gt; This player choice meme needs to stop 
---
It's not a meme. Everyone is paying the same fee to play. Server transfers were part of Vanilla. If you make players choose between not being able to play because their servers are imbalanced, or not being able to play because they cancelled their subscription -- they will all ultimately choose the option that saves them $15/month.
---
Blizzard knows this and is not stupid.
---
I don’t drink much. It was a friend’s birthday party.
---
It's both of those things! How can you say it isn't a PvP game. Isn't there PvP?  
---
One again, because you apparently still havent read this: the most efficient playstyle is not sitting in town queueing for PvP. You need to engage with the world a LOT to prepare for even the instanced PvP
---
You might be able to get away with being “naked” if u take off your chest/pants but you’re still putting yourself at a disadvantage
---
Ok boomer would have sufficed.
---
Lmao just give it up, man
---
Now I want to see a raid of lvl 1 rogue "twinks" (mainly just weapons with fiery on them lol) running around killing as many people as they can. I guess one aoe would wreck them though....
---
I expect the burnout to hit once the casuals clear BWL and realize there's not much else to do. The switch to wanting TBC will follow swiftly afterwards.
---
Don't think so unfortunately.
---
I believe wow classic was/is an experiment. That would partly explain why Blizzard didn't devote enough resources to classic. I want to believe that Blizzard understands it was a successful experiment and giving the playerbase what we were asking for turned out to be very good for the company profit-wise. 
---
Sadly there is no way they can do everything (Classic+, TBC, TBC+ etc) while also working on retail but there is that sliver of hope that they will try to make something interesting based on community feedback following the success of Classic
---
OK Better so alc only harm you;)
---
No, it's more grindy. Grinds aren't necessarily challenging, and kill 20 of these and loot 15 of these 500 times over isn't challenging.
---
You misread their post.
---
Yeah this guy telling you basically that prot won't help you tank?  
---
It helps your threat generation a ton.  It does add additional abilities like the revenge stun.  Improved shield block 1/3 helps you get crit/crushed a lot less.  If you're serious about tanking more often than not at this level, you should respec prot and just go all in.  It's EASY to start instance groups as a tank you won't  have to wait around long at all.  Set your hearth to Kargath, clear out your bags as much as you can, and go for it.
---
Excellent point my friend, never heard anything like this before and it’s VERY true. This comment might be what everyone needs to hear.
---
I was also told battlegrounds are coming in phase 2. Can anyone confirm or deny this?
---
I'm a purist so I would prefer that WoW had an economy that was unable to interact with real world economy. Obviously this is very wishful thinking. I still wish that Blizzard would crack down on gold selling / buying hard.
---
Same thing with botting. Been leveling alts late night the last week and I see quite a few bots running around. I find it hard to believe that Blizzard doesn't have the tech to detect botting.
---
NA is a meme, period.
---
I remember being fuckin mindblown of the fact that the song wasn’t actually sung by wow players back when i was a kid...
---
You mean t1 hunter w/ BWL bow and R14 stat sticks?
---
At least the rap was sweet.
---
heartseeker is very alliance heavy.
---
I enjoy my characters, its why I play them. Not trying to be rude or anything but I highly doubt you are top 5 dps as cat on most fights in MC, unless your raid comp is just ignoring the significantly better classes/they dont have much experience. Its just not how the game works mechanically. I am happy you are enjoying feral though, I love the druid overall too.
---
I like rogues in my groups. And I'm a feral druid. I like ao robe to open doors and boxes. I just never see any. I'm convinced theres 4 rogues on my server in total.
---
But they are also thinking about their new expansions. How could they release shadowlands and classic plus at the same time? Arent the ppl working on classic also working on SL too? I dont think theyd split their manpower to work on two expansions at the same time.
---
Rogue/mage DPS is where it's it. The cc makes everything so much ezier.
---
One person flipping coins is not a good sample. Try to think of it as the whole world flipping coins. It’s more likely to be closer to 50% that way. Sure, weighted die exist. Maybe weighted coins? 
---
Also I don’t think the rng in WoW or any other computer can ever be perfectly random but it’s close. 
---
Anyway my point was mainly that OP themselves even stated that the drop cane up after 12 runs which, if really wanna base the drop rate off personal experience, would put the rate closer to 8%, which isn’t so far off 13% to think your character is somehow cursed.
---
I could see the argument of it being unfair if the add-ons were gated by anything, but atm the only people not using add-ons are choosing to not use add-ons. If you don't want to use freely accessable tools don't get upset when other players do.
---
I am in college and it took me 3 weeks to hit 60...
---
I've been regularly staying up till 1-2 and waking up at 6 for over a decade. No particular reason; it's just my schedule. I'm always refreshed. Makes fitting wow into my life quite easy.
---
Nice!
---
Which server is this out of curiousity? Thinking or rolling some Alli toons
---
what happens if I delete a character and  the next day somebody else makes a new one with the same name?  Or are names reserved for some time after deletion
---
Like the comment in this thread, reconsider your financial situation, because you shouldn't live paycheck to paycheck with that income.
---
How?
---
How are your grades?
---
What else do you use to compare these expansions? Sub count puts WotLK as the best. This sub is an echo chamber that has certain aspects of WoW they pick over everything else disregarding anyone who doesn't participate in this discussion.
---
It doesn't matter. Everyone only has 6 days in the first week then.
---
&gt;but they just add very little utility
---
until you come across that locked chest =p
---
&gt;the only reason to expect queues is if there's a lower cap
---
or because layers are related to server capacity
---
Exist.
---
Heartseeker is definitely a massive alliance server. As a horde player, its sad standing outside of SM and watching alli groups running in all day while I'm trying to fill the last spot... with dps.
---
I'm playing horde but one thing I absolutely despise about them is for some reason no race but orc can wear shoes.
---
Just guesses afaik. Most guesses are Jaunary - April.
---
I was clearly talking about pvp racials...
---
I think he’s completely wrong in one critical aspect. 
---
&gt; When there’s a 2:1 ratio, it will compound and turn into a 5:1 ratio, and then 10:1 until it’s unplayable. 
---
While that’s 100% true, server transfers aren’t the cause of this. If you’re “not having fun” in a game, you don’t just stick it out because there’s no other option. **These players will either quit, or reroll on a different server.** And the most likely option here is just straight up quitting the game. Few people want to spend 200 hours of their life grinding in a game, just to have it all wasted and having a horrible experience at the end. 
---
The solution to this problem is combining servers, which they’ve already talked about, but hardcore (and uneducated) players insisted that server community is a higher priority.
---
Wasnt it the anvil? i think i recall an anvil or something like that being an actual physical object.
---
I dont think it existed in classic tho. The one you are talking about.
---
Thunderfurry. I'm only one of so many so this is just my opinion from what I see!  I'd say it's 55/45 in hordes favour ( I know I said 50/50 but it does feel that way to me but other might disagree).  There's a few bigger guilds on alliance side I'd say the biggest is me and the boys. I think there up to 3 full raid teams and building a 4th?
---
Ironically enough, it's now used by kids to describe everyone above 30 regardless what they think of younger generations.   
---
       
---
As long as you disagree with what is being said, you're a boomer.
---
"haha slurs are humorous"
---
Add a /purr in too after the meow
---
Boy would that be true and I hope they balance the raids to make sure that doesn't happen.
---
I’ll be heading balls deep into the lag and pressing arcane explosion a lot. Seems like a good idea.
---
Only we can say it with the hard R.  You can only call us Zooma
---
Play a mage my friend. You will have tons of fun and come to realize how silly every other class is when they lack the ton of utility to any given situation that mages have. I've played alot of classes. Always envied mages for their portals etc. Now I play one myself and truly feel that I've waisted sooo many hours in this game that mages simply blink right past. 
---
And someone else recommended you to make a warrior alt later on. I can fully support this idea. Way more fun to play a warrior that you spoil like a phantasillionaires (that's alot I guess) cunt of a son. 
---
Mage is the only hero class in classic. You won't regret it ❤️
---
Its been like that for a decade plus.
---
Gouge/Sap/Blind into stealth only works in PvP because you drop combat. In PvE the mob keeps you in combat the whole time.
---
That's just not true. There's no fixed number of players at each rank. It's all relative to the player pool and separate for each faction. There will be far more R14s with higher populations. If your server is 90% horde, horde will have a lot more R14s.
---
&gt;Is this gonna consume me or I can achieve it over a time?
---
up to rank 8 it's doable,  but rank 9 to 10 (or 11) will consume you. The problem for many people is, upon reaching rank 8 they are already really really bored by the repetitive play needed to rank, and THAT is the point you have to get into top gear and double your efforts.
---
You don't need prot to tank 5 mans.
---
I'd be alongside Heisenberg_IRL, the game should be the game and any real world currency mixed into it just feels like not playing the game.
---
Ofc I understand the appeal, but it brings down the integrity of the game
---
For comparison our pre bis Boomkin pushes 200-250 dps with buffs/potions against Rag. 
---
Our mages deal about 350-400 with no potions or ony buff. They hit 500+ with ony buff. It really isn’t comparable sadly :(
---
Danes are not very smart. Nothing new
---
Then everyone would be in their correct spec every time. It's part of the game to wipe and then you realize your priest is shadow or your shaman is enha. Also tests the limits of the classes and what the talents actually do.
---
you would think the default frame should but I could never find it.... looking into addons right now though, healbot seems pretty popular
---
I'm horde =(
---
You stated that you played “every other weekday”. Is this a troll? You are aware of the fact that you need 12h/day to go high wlord? 😂
---
Same as usual 15 years ago , no changes \^\^
---
Fingers crossed some of the horde have a brain and transfer their guilds over so they can actually PVP
---
Or we all just start at 1 and build a server together from the ground up.
---
That's the only way to understand what the Danish is saying
---
3.93 gpa
---
Goin PvE is the right move though, depending on what's your goal in the game. Any system that rely on internet people not being scumbags is a shit system, World PvP will never (as in, only is very rare and specific occasions) be enjoyable
---
Lawl
---
Short Answer : NO
---
Slaughtering a whole tribe of trolls for their ears is insignificant?
---
Imagine chugging for e whisky like that
---
True, but for the boomkins it arguably isn’t fun. The design of the game in phase 1-5 goes against their spec, and it gets worse when fights get longer. It’s cool the devs included a meme spec but it would be cooler if it was a fully fleshed concept instead. 
---
I say this as a 0-30-21 specced Druid. I’d swap in a heartbeat if Boomkin was 50% stronger.
---
Walk up to it slowly with your mouse over the crate. Inch towards it and watch the tool tip for the box. Once you’re close enough it’ll pop up in the tool tip saying trapped or something like that. If it never pops up as you keep inching closer then you’re safe to open it. The range to see this is usually like a foot or two just outside range that you’d be able to open the box at.
---
But isn't it inefficient running around so much?
---
Looks like you've laid out the reasons for why it's all Blizzards fault. Because they could just y'know, bolster up the servers instead of being cheap.
---
Nope, I was not aware but I am now.
---
Gotta get someone to do this for my eye of shadow
---
I used to think online guides for gear were the end all be all. But in my 2 runs I've done of endgame things have dropped and I'm like wtf this is just as good if not better than what's widely recommended. So now I just use my own judgement.
---
no. cross realm bgs is where the fun is
---
You're not making any sense.
---
Canada doesn't use food stamps and I fail to see how any of that is relevant whatsoever.
---
Saying "You shouldn't live paycheque to paycheque" to anyone without knowing all the factors is not only ignorant but extremely insensitive.
---
I know people making $15/hr more than I am and are living paycheque to paycheque while saving for down payments.
---
That's the whole point of budgeting and saving....you make the most efficient use of your income each month, that's what I'm doing.
---
Doubt it, but consider it a free name change.
---
You all deserve unplayable servers for being lemmings.
---
It's like 30 seconds of f swimming..
---
No one with a brain thought it wouldnt.
---
People can't tell the difference between viable and optimal and ignorance is the mother of hate
---
As a mage I much prefer being in a melee cleave than a spell cleave, also put in the effort and make your own group
---
&lt;3 you too big boy
---
Yes you can be, and people have been.
---
only being able to pull 2 mobs at a time instead of 4 mobs at a time isn't "more challenging", it just means makes it more of a grind.
---
Can always sheep them though
---
At least you're able to get it back now. I didn't even know about that, always assumed you had to contact blizzard before. Guess things like this have happened a lot lol.
---
Orcs = Angry
---
Undead lady = Crazy
---
Lore = Deep?
---
I think furies believe they need to be prot to tank
---
Exactly. And honestly, I’d argue 90% of guilds have no reason to force optimal builds. They arnt competing for world firsts and being that high stress and that high amount of picky just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
---
I’d like to see folks just relax and enjoy the game. Sure, when I see my fellow hunters doing half the damage I’ve done and I havnt raided in a month and am rocking beastmaster spec, I’m going to sit down and ask what’s up, since they can and should be beating me, but I’m not gonna hate on them. I’m going to try to help them and figure out if they arnt doing something correct. That sort of optimization is fine!
---
But sitting there and forcing people to change their spec is a bit too...I don’t know, try hard? It feels like folks are just too caught up and forget to have fun
---
Blizzard clearly has engagement metrics.  Just because populations may seem equal doesn’t mean the active player base is.  To make the PVP system “fair” (impossible btw) you need +/-1000 (round numbers for ease) of each faction with even distribution through the level tiers.  You can encourage that by locking new character creation to accounts that A) don’t already have a character there (read: not alts) and B) you can only create within the faction that is currently needing to boost population.  You can also add queues based on demographics: if too many horde are on at peak times, queues are shorter for alliance characters.  It encourages people to play the way you want them to without forcing them. You can still play Horde on an imbalanced server, but you are choosing the longer queue.  Meanwhile the alliance is getting in instantly.
---
Also, Blizzard GMs should be engaging with guild leaders of active, involved guilds and offering to move them to targeted servers that need help.  Even if it’s full pop to full pop. Moving 100 horde raiders to a full pop server that is moving 100 alliance raiders in return done enough times balances things out a little better. It will never be perfect, but to pretend they are powerless is silly. I play alliance on Blameaux, and whole the server feels more or less balanced, I don’t have any loyalty to the server whatsoever.   If Blizzard asked me and my guild to move, I don’t think anyone got Blaumeux tattoos or anything.
---
Edgy darklords ofc
---
smh when will this sub learn how to screenshot
---
That is me on Classic it’s weird
---
A $4,000 pc is a potato?
---
There are a bunch of missing spawns on that map.  https://classic.wowhead.com/object=175404/rich-thorium-vein
---
Haha and you think it’s the games fault?
---
But if you take a vacation, anything more than 1 week, you'd have a large amount of decay on your ranks, no?
---
I wouldn't mind seeing more non-cloth good gear for casters/healers. Hybrids are already sub-optimal as dps, no need to force them to compete with cloths for gear
---
Just don't get how u have so low fps. Baffled.
---
+1
---
I love the open, "country" feel of Kalimdor, I love how open-air and easy to navigate Orgrimmar is, I prefer the zeppelins to the tram and boats and generally like the locations of Horde territories better, and something about seeing a mismatched, ragtag group of Orcs, Tauren, and Undead or whatever just feels like "hell yeah, here come the boys" to me. Idk if that makes sense. I like the Alliance too.
---
I just dinged 48 on my druid last night. Right now I'm 1/31/7, with LotP for questing and leveling. What level should I respec to a better HotW/NS spec? I did a mara princess run last night for the first time and had a really tough time keeping everyone's HP up without going oom. Not sure if it was just the group comp though (3 dps warriors 1 rogue, so no buffs or fear resist, all ~50). Should I respec now if I plan on doing a lot of dungeons going forward, both healing and tanking?
---
You don't need to tell people that you're quitting, because nobody cares even a little.
---
Just quit and move on. No need for a rant or any whining.
---
Lol thank you
---
I just hit 60 a week or two ago with my first ever wow character. I pretty much only dungeon ran from 35-60. And I made the group 99% of the time. Spend 5 minutes reading a dungeon guide. Then lead away. It’s not that hard.
---
Well Archeage was like that so I stop playing that and played unchained instead
---
It's too bad talk can't come to thunderfurry. It's maybe 55/45 with horses favours and a few more alliance would be healthy!
---
Over 500 everywhere. Never had a drop somewhere.
---
Apparently it is because none of us are having this issue.
---
Pun intended but I wanna know too, probably will just google it since reddit is pretty much google but you are waiting for people to google it for you. Or you come here to pick arguments.
---
Exactly this.
---
Hell, $30/hr in Toronto, Ontario vs $30/hr in the suburbs or rural Ontario is a HUGE difference.
---
I know people who've taken jobs with $20,000 a year  paycuts just so they could live in more affordable areas.
---
He's saying get to rank ten, take vaction from work and no life it to rank 11. Probably have to be quite a vacation though.
---
As a dad, I'm fullt expecting this.
---
Gnome for any melee class. If you’re ranged you want a paladin healer over a shaman healer. 
---
Stoneform is a good enough racial to justify just spamming gnomes and dwarves with the occasional Druid. Escape artist is such an insane racial
---
Most times they'd PAY whatever is in the chest to have a smooth run that a good group would otherwise provide. At least with the utility it saves time and possibly repair bills.
---
Dont feel that way, we need more arms and fury warriors to tank instead of expecting to run 5 means as dps
---
Haven't had to do this except at the very end of some fights. Usually innervate pots and dark runes keep me up at max
---
What laptop is that?
---
Once WSG comes out you're on bouncer duty. That shit ain't fun.
---
Hot air balloon huh?
---
never gonna be 4k, maybe 400
---
Yeah I should just google but yeah know ask and forget about it then get curious again when someone else comments such as yourself lol
---
Fortunately I don't have any brain dead children who feel like this in my guild
---
No one that matters plays a 15 year old MMO for actual PvP
---
This is 100% true. Source: i raid as a chicken.
---
Sounds like a scrub. If he’s killed him 1000 times he should know the spawn point. I haven’t killed him in a while so I forgot about the adds... but if theirs adds you just spam right click his spawn point.
---
So that mage is about to die I gather?
---
Hunters who are good with frost traps are amazing too.
---
Mate / Lock / Hunter is a ton of fun.
---
"What were you before?"
---
"A gnome warlock in BFA"
---
How do you remember the months in which you started and quit playing? I can’t even remember the year I started unless I google when wow came out
---
He wasn’t even killing the unnamed mobs during the spawn timer so yeah I would agree, he was a scrub.
---
You'd be surprised.
---
I haven't had these issues on Grobbulus. Addon errors can cause serious FPS drops, though. Are you using any? Which ones? Are they disabling your error frames (I hate that shit so much)? Many retail addons will not work in Classic due to Blizz intentionally gimping some of the API access. After maintenance yesterday I also noticed one of my addons doesn't work correctly anymore so they may have changed something else. Try disabling addons and see if the problem resolves. If not, since this is not a problem most people seem to be having, it's likely a hardware or software issue.
---
If you can play retail but not classic then it's probably not your setup, though. They use the same engine.
---
"Hey I know invaded your world and waged a war of extermination against every living thing but we totally didn't want to so it's ok if we take over some of your sacred lands and clear cut everying we see? What it's someone's home? Well... We can't get home so... We're just going to take yours. "
---
I just like the locations, tribal culture and lore way more than the Alliance. You can see if you play both faction's starting quests that in Vanilla WoW, Blizzard spent a lot more time fine tuning the Alliance zones and quests. There are simply more quests (even profession quests) on the Alliance side and they flow better. Even with all this, there is something much more inherently satisfying about playing Horde. The camaraderie of the Horde races and their downtrodden, underdog pasts really shine through. Try making starting characters on both sides and you will see that as a Horde Character, you feel like you are an underdog made to be part of a greater cause than yourself. I've recently tried making an Alliance alt to play in between raid resets/consumable farming, but it's so hard to get into the character. The Alliance characters just feel like generic fantasy characters.
---
In short. Lok'Tar Ogar! For the Horde!
---
Okay, so my problem is I'm not backing out in time.
---
Lol pugs no shit you’re not having a good time wtf lmfaooo
---
Gottcchaa. I took it as "take a vacation from ranking". I'm dumb haha, that makes way more sense. Thank you.
---
Spending 2 hours in any dungeon is slow af and you seem to be a slow person. People like you are horrible to group with if you just want to get stuff done.
---
You can go invisible on bnet, problem solved. Or remove friends. Or tell them no. This is a you problem not a game problem.
---
You are probably correct, wow classic is not a game for you.
---
What gpu/cpu you running with? Also try running a registry cleaner like ccleaner and clearing your cache folders for WoW. A quick Google search can aid you in both of those. And turn,shadows down/off. Those and sunshafts always used to wreck my fps with my Rx380 gpu.
---
$400 for Utilities!!!!!! That's expensive as F. I only pay 150
---
not a gold buyer or seller, but i fail to see the problem with either. i'd be curious to know why you feel this way, based on this thread most agree with you so I am in the minority lol
---
Funny thing is +1 loot system was posted on reddit lol
---
Sounds like either a problem with an addon or your computer
---
Can I get a link on the judgement thing?  I’d like to know more.
---
Dude just tank as fury, you'll get insta groups, have no loot competition, and help 4 other people end the search for a tank
---
can i be the guy who thinks this guy missed the joke this time
---
You're 100% correct.
---
Now we are discussing how to mitigate this issue. You can't just tell people to man up because they don't think logically.
---
Poor owl died for 34xp...F
---
To expand on this for the unaware. +SP and +healing spells apply equally on all spells (Unless they were taught below level 20 i think, and is why Paladins are the best tank healers for raids, because Flash of Light at 1st level is a level 20 spell).
---
So if you have +100 SP and cast a spell that does 50 damage and costs 25 mana, you do 150 damage (6 damage per mana). While a spell that does 200 damage for 100 mana gives you 300 damage (3 damage per mana).
---
b) Set yourself to invisible in the battle.net software.
---
Deep Balanced, Deep Resto makes good off-healing/pvp spec
---
No Oomkin though
---
They should make queues for the imbalanced faction to force balance
---
When you have 3/3 imp Blizzard the slow from coc doesn't get applied unless the slow from Blizzard is gone. 
---
You should start at 22.
---
Then organize a mass transfer to Heartseeker, the only PvP realm that seems to have more Alliance. 
---
Horde in these threads are being entitled and demanding Alliance stay in a situation they dont want to put themselves in. They want Alliance to stay, they want faction queues. Its a player problem but when it comes down to nut cutting time, I'm seeing no real movement by Horde players.
---
I would be careful about choosing Scholo as a benchmark. With casters, silencers and mana burns + half the bosses have some sort of aggro drop it's far from ideal or normal dungeon experience for paladins. Strat is better here.
---
If you look at the flight times, aren’t those the same time to destination? Lol
---
There was an addon for Retail called Ovale where you could things like this very easily. It's not supported in Classic, though :(
---
You could make or find WeakAuras to do what you're looking for, though.
---
I seen! I started reading and was like yeahh I'ma just not worry about it lol
---
Yeah, that WF totem is pretty big. If I forget to drop it, even for ONE mob, I don't hear the end of it
---
This is it folks, the meme has peaked, it will never be used better than this
---
Yes, although there is some evidence that it only works when out-of-combat but testing is incomplete (and very rare in the first place).
---
Well no, NA will have less pvp days on first week than EU.
---
&gt;Millennials live and die on their catch phrases
---
The irony is as thick as your head.
---
So true. Wars roll on eberythung
---
I love how every solution is to make the other side fix their problems. Why don't you stop being a victim and do something yourself to fix your own problems.
---
&gt; Or tell them no
---
Unheard of.
---
Me... Last night.  Was doing jed runs for the dmg trinket.  The group was solid so I stayed up til 2am when I had to wake up at 630 to get my kid to his tee-ball game.  Outrolled 4 others on the final run to get it.  MEGA WORTH!
---
I'm having the same issues as you and I think part of the problem is from being on a highpop pvp server:
---
a) I get the impression lower pop servers are less meta heavy/toxic and pve even less.
---
b) just add people as character friends? It is still an option right? 
---
c) make an alt on a pve server and take it slow, you might be pleasantly surprised with other people's attitude and interest in content a speedrunner sees as mundane and boring.
---
Good luck friend.
---
It wasn't called wowcrack for no reason
---
You realise that those lots of people wasnt until wrath right? When Blizz started to cater to the end game treadmill to appease that group. Most players didnt raid in Vanilla and even more players only raided Karazhan and some Gruuls in TBC. It wasnt until wrath that the raiding end game developed. Which was also the peak of wow. Guess what happened when things got difficult in the beginning of Cata? Mass exodus.
---
A lot of the issues you stated have some simple fixes like being invisible on battle net. From what it seems nothing is really going to satisfy you. At the end of the day if it doesn’t interest you than don’t plan but people like you will most likely complain even if you get a burning crusade or wrath remake. While I do agree some retail players play classic with retail mentality and best believe that will happen in bc and wrath
---
Sort of like Smart Republican, he understands the problem, phase 2 will be a fucking disaster, but wants to implement a terrible plan to fix it.
---
I always fly high
---
And it turns out they "don't have high enough level to open it"
---
If horde wanna pvp they are welcome to come to Thalnos where it takes 200 horde to push 60 Alliance out of brm.
---
A guild like you are describing is not gonna need any fresh off the boat 60 rogues
---
? I thought Flash of light has lower spell power % on each level? Didn't I read wrong
---
Is there a working good trinket management addon?
---
Doing the Lord's work
---
Its a bop but thx anyway.
---
Same here. Absolutely no issue with Pugs. Except that I change to SoR with SoC judged on bosses. 
---
I usually need to drink after a boss fight but normal pulls result in a so minor mana loss, that I can sneak in a few sipps when the mage is oom and that's enough.
---
~$180-$190 Hydro+Water
---
~$100 Gas
---
$100 Internet
---
Now they’re coming !!
---
I've ran scholo a few times and have yet to see it. Got Shadowcraft chest before even seeing cadav. chest so I decided on 6 piece rather than wait for cadav and truestrike shoulders.
---
I did that.  When I'm in game people still seem to know when I'm on.
---
isn’t twinking getting geared?
---
Pretty much my thoughts as well. I'm slowly getting some alts up.
---
This right here is the solution. It blows my mind blizzard didn’t implement this. It’s so god damn simple and would solve so many problems. Oh that pvp server is 70% one faction? No you can’t create a new account on that dominant faction until more people roll on the lesser faction. Roll on the lesser faction or pick a different server.
---
&gt; chance at anything remotely approaching balanced world PvP.
---
No, more like you don't want to be camped.   The number of people that give two shits about wpvp is about a 1000 times smaller than you think.
---
Agreed. I was doing BRD arena runs, and the tank was talking 2 minute breaks between pulls. At the beginning of the dungeon I got “yelled” at for opening gates before everyone was there. And I solo’ed the first 52 elite and the tank and healer combo proclaimed, “Let him die! He’s pulling without our permission!”
---
Like... it’s my 50th run of the same dungeon. We all out level the beginning of it, and I really only need HoJ to finish out my gear. No need to force a run to take longer for your “pride” as a tank.
---
They cant use pots etc
---
As a fury, tanking as Fury is just a pain in the ass. It’s definitely doable but it’s not fun and not how I prefer to play, given the choice. 
---
Your threat is lower than it is in Prot which means getting snap aggro is harder- that leads to any DPS AoEing almost certainly ripping threat. No threat means less incoming damage which means less rage... which just spirals and becomes more and more chaotic. 
---
Fury tanking’s fun if you trust the group but given the choice, I’d rather not. And I’m sure AF not going to do it if there’s random competition on the loot I’m going for. Guild members sure, rando pugs no thanks.
---
But I wanna be offended.
---
Blizzard should open a new server with open transfers. No racials for either side and maybe a faction queue.
---
Honestly asking. What is there to explain? The fights are extremly simple. I joined a guild on its first raid and we did it in two hours.
---
I cleared MC like 6 times and I still dont know which boss is which because a lot of them mix together.
---
&gt; c) make an alt on a pve server and take it slow, you might be pleasantly surprised with other people's attitude and interest in content a speedrunner sees as mundane and boring.
---
I've considered that.  I haven't really done the Alliance zones yet, either; so there is some new content for me there.
---
The way the honor system works is that the amount of honor really doesn't matter. So WSG giving more honor per hour etc. doesn't change the difficulty of ranking.
---
However, ranking in the world at least sounds like(hasn't really been done like this before, and thats counting vanilla), it will just be about being in the right spot to find and kill people, sure being able to get more kills is skill thing and all. With BG's it is possible to premade, and premading is so good it always is way more efficient than soloqueueing, this means in order to rank you essentially need a premade, which is typically other rankers, that means more control over the pvp, and some random indiviual that has no life but sucks at the game will have a hard time ranking. In phase2, it's gonna be all about playing 18hours aday, rather than playing 15 hours a day in a premade. 
---
Another thing is that bracket stacking(Everyone getting the same honor) helps a lot with optimizing the rank, making everyone prgoress faster, this will be a lot harder in phase 2 since you cannot force anyone to stop playing(by banning them in premades for example). 
---
So in short. More time played for sure, more chaos, more accountsharing abuse probably, but completely plausible.
---
Druids can tank end game. Check out skarm on YouTube. He was one of the original Druid tanks. Said he main tanked every boss (with the exception of 2) from MC-NAXX.
---
Your humour choices are extremely limited then.
---
The issue is that people on the overbalance side have been absolute cunts for the last 3 months and are now complaining that people are leaving, what they would much rather is force the very same people they have made leveling miserable for to stay so that their own BG queue and honour grinding is easier. Fuck them
---
Yes. The price being cheaper is what the post is about.
---
OK boomer.
---
Warlocks and spriests fucks most people tbh
---
I'm mid 30s and for my 2nd son's first 2 months, iaveraged 3 to 4 hours sleep a night during the work week.  Sounds like you need to be more active and get a better diet
---
Hello, thank you. How would a SW:P / SW:P rank 1 modifier macro **with** mouseover look like?
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
&gt;/use \[@mouseover,harm,nodead,mod\]\[harm,nodead,mod\] Shadow Word: Pain(Rank 1)  
---
&gt;/use \[@mouseover,harm,nodead,nomod\]\[harm,nodead,nomod\] Shadow Word: Pain
---
Is there a cleaner/better way to do it? Thank you in advance.
---
The fundamental issue is that tanks get tankier, dps does more damage, but dps doesn't get tankier. PvE DPS gains outscale PvE hp gains. So as you have progression players become squishier and squishier and PvP becomes a one-shot fest, healing becomes more irrelevant. Player survivability must also scale with progression for PvP to continue to be balanced.
---
But if you have a stat that increases player survivability vs. mobs, this is automatically the best tank stat in the game, and breaks PvE. So you make it vs. players only, now it's a PvP-only stat.
---
Anyway this is a fundamental issue with the game, it's not really about 'forcing pvp to raid' or 'unifying the playerbase'. It's whether you want PvP to be balanced through progression cycles, or not.
---
Only those on your realm I think. Because they see you anyway. But I'm not sure.
---
I think 60/40 Is fine. Im Horde AND my server seems balanced, lots of alliance ganking. If it were unbalanced, I'D swap to the faction with less pop
---
Well how many cadavous pieces did you see? The chest is on same drop rate as any of them, and when I go scholo I see usually 1 per run, so prolly something like 1/5-1/7 per run to get chest, that's honestly not so bad considering you should be the only one rolling on it.
---
They can and do. Maybe a different learning curve for healers.
---
One does not need buffs to clear MC efficiently as it is
---
But you aren't competing with them? You only compete with your own server.
---
I don't mind separate servers at all.
---
Undead animations are superior.
---
I miss alliance cities tho :(
---
Fury prot bridging is the minimum required to tank raids though. Anything less isn’t enough mitigation.
---
The only time I get low fps is when I scan the AH cuz auctioneer has a setting by default to lower them to 25 so the game wont crash :P
---
You need to find a druid friend to tank for your pre-bis. No one wants to tank Strat UD
---
horde only lol
---
You could say the same about alliance crutch in pve.
---
If I'm putting the effort into making my own group you best believe I'm not taking gear competition.  It's not being a lootwhore, it's being efficient with my time.  You want that gear? Go start a group instead of relying on others to take you
---
I feel good about your farm. Good luck. You get triple gold next time!
---
Of course not, but it does seem unfair that they have a shorter week than everyone else no?
---
I’ll give it a second chance see if it’s the Addons
---
My original main was a rogue. I never went to mc with him because this was a serious thing then too- fing tanks cock blocked me from runs and stole loot in dungeons. 
---
I did eventually get full pre bis and my dps was far greater than most, but it didn’t matter. 
---
I ended up rerolling a mage and everything became a breeze through Naxxramas and into tbc. 
---
Sad that with all the tweaks they’ve done, that they didn’t add something to fix this scenario.
---
I am not tryharding though and using the goa/wf tot macro. But they seem to care about just about wf Soo yay more Mana. Still gotta farm demonic runes and major mana pots thou.
---
Would laugh to death if I could be in a group with 2 droods a warrior and a resto shaman for AP/crit and all the manas
---
Probably wont watch this but you probably wont be able to mine in P2 mate
---
Like there will be no legacy realms, hm? Just shut up
---
Scholo is worse imo. Just did it the first time that place blows
---
I started at 22 but noticed it was much better with coc
---
What are you 16? Who unironically says things like this?
---
Jfc.
---
Can you.. um.. help me out with this.
---
A macro or add-on?
---
Dont do spellcleave then? Like it's not hard to avoid
---
She has what I call a little dance before she lifts tail to shit. Normally I can catch her and get her outside on the balcony before shit.... hits.
---
One of the most balanced servers. REally alive in the evening. Not so much trough the day because mature people are working.
---
Who ever comes here. Alliance horde are almost equal.  
---
Best decision ever.
---
You are right, but it still takes time to explain. So you say what you have to say, answer any questions, then do a ready check...probably 5 minutes for each boss, some taking more (like domo or rag) so with 11 bosses, that’s 55 minutes
---
You realise that was posted on a jokes subreddit right? 
---
Yeah dude, you're the cringe here.
---
Gotta create a future market for paid transfers somehow
---
If private servers were able to handle it better than Blizzard, I'm sure there is actually a solution to this problem for the scale we are considering.
---
Yeah same thing happened to me pal.
---
I talked to me IT guy and he said not to worry about it until windows stops working.
---
God you're a dildo.
---
It makes no difference now, but it will in the future.
---
And even now even in a casual guild it feels pretty fucking bad to have somebody willingly doing a suboptimal thing. For example if I had a boomkin in my last raid when we did Ony with twenty people I would be slightly annoyed.
---
Where should I go next to quest as a level 38 dwarf rogue?
---
Just finished up the quests in Dustwallow Marsh and did some of the quests in STV. The remaining quests all require me to kill level 40+ mobs which is somewhat impossible for me at the moment.
---
I completely skipped out on Thousand Needles/Shimmering Flats. Should I head there next?
---
I bet you play an undead too
---
The difference is whether you keep that thought to yourself or not.
---
Did you have decent int/spirit and maybe some +healing gear? I haven't had issues healing including Mara as feral because I have like 5k Mana and a bunch of spirit. Also, your group just may have not been very good. Most pulls in Mara when I am tanking I need almost no healing, just prehots is usually enough. Only the bosses require healing.
---
Ally!
---
Same. I'd never touch retail. If they go with TBC as an expansion I'm quitting again too.
---
yeah but layers will be gone, so there will be a LOT of ganking and resource wars (for quests)
---
Different strokes for different folks I suppose. I personally would be like “heck yeah, we killed Ont with 20 people AND brought suboptimal classes. We rock!”
---
Yeah except this is the ally experience on almost literally every single PvP server. It’s awful.
---
Are these even actual games is my question
---
Not gonna lie Tauren are dope waiting for a good friend to finally give up retail and take his horde room seriously so I can justify leveling the Cow Druid.
---
No it's a different team. Wow classic has a dedicated team.
---
Hey man!  This is a very opinionated post, and I’m sure it will attract a lot of people that take your opinion as a personal attack. However, it is extremely relevant, at least compared to my experiences so far. 
---
All in all, I’m still enjoying classic, and I will continue playing, but I have felt the adapt or fuck you mentality that has been brought to this game. I started playing vanilla in 2006, and quit before wotlk was released, I was old enough to remember what the experience was like.  I am also a private server veteran, mostly because it was the only way I could play the only version of the game that I really enjoyed. I can tell you right now, after being apart of several different communities over the last decade, that I notice a big difference. 
---
In comparison (also tank) the classic experience since day has been pretty ruthless. I can’t tell you how many times grps spam Gogogogogogo while I’m tanking, or waiting for the healers mana. While leveling everyone seemed to have an opinion on how I should play the game as well, as if they were assuming my position as tank in the group. People don’t evaluate efficiency, and on the internet everyone thinks that their opinion is not up for argument.
---
I feel you man and rolling an alt, setting your battle net to invisible just to level in peace and get a break from the warrior might be refreshing. I have literally been in dungeons since level 22, every time I log in someone needs/wants a dungeon. 
---
Ok this was really long winded, sorry...
---
Anyway part of the issue is the phase we are in ppl are still trying to get ahead, and boost through content ASAP. Trying to Mc in farm/gear for pvp/alts to 60. The nature of this phase and time period brings a lot of crazy behavior. Trust me things will change with a little more time. Things will get a lot more comfy as servers evolve. 
---
Take care buddy
---
You clearly don't understand the concept of magnitude.
---
How do priests do this?
---
 What your gonna want to do is delete your warrior and play a Druid
---
Not informative enough to people who weren't there for the first set of information. People come and go from STV a lot.
---
take your garbage ass back to r/wow
---
It isn’t blizzard fault it’s the players plain and simple.
---
I wish I could unlearn the silithus FP
---
used to be to get to feathermoon from theramore i had 1 mid point in nigels for 12s give or take
---
now it wants to send me from theramore to gadget to ungoro, to silithus, to feathermoon for 30s
---
screw that
---
Idk man I trust you, but it just feels so odd.
---
When I joined my first guilds raid every tactic was explained in like a minute tops.
---
Are those I's instead of L's? Who the fuck would want that?
---
Looking at the sub record they broke, they didn't do anything wrong. Conforming to millions of people's unrealistic expectations is well, impossible.
---
People played ally last time and now, for whatever reason think horde is superior. You cant change what people think because of the influence of streamers it's become more polarized.
---
Simply blizzard didn't recognize streamers tremendous impact on servers, and player choice, which isn't their fault they don't wanna ride coattails.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the type up. I've done the ranking ladder a few times before, getting as high as R12 twice, but BGs were already released both on vanilla, and pservers I played on. If I recalled, the RP per week is based upon total honor, so if everyone is limited by no BGs the ranking "time" should be about equal. I do think 3-5 man death squad premades are going to be netting the most honor moving forward until BGs release though. Solo world pvp will be a slower more tedious ranking compared to a 3-5 man death squad.
---
Weird, I watched a guildie do that strat this week and it worked.
---
You'll delete it again in phase 2 😅
---
Yeah my comment was a little tounge in cheeck. I played fire aswell as arcane in TBC. Arcane in classic is definatley missing a spell or two.
---
Is there a list of only enchants the are currently live? The one on wowhead seems to show ones that won’t be live till later phases
---
&gt; Fireball is ~~poor man's~~ frat douche whiskey
---
FTFY.
---
Won't be any different than it was in Vanilla. More people started playing WoW in Vanilla after the Honor System was implemented vs those who started before it.
---
Some of the best players in Vanilla didn't even start playing until BWL was out.
---
Well, the shoe fits.
---
To me its "Hell yeah we killed Ony with 19 people trying their best and one person fooling around". 
---
I would feel bad even if I was the boomkin in this scenario. It is just so selfish.
---
I did this to change the name on my main, delete your character, get a friend to make a character with the same name, restore yours and you can change your name.
---
But seeing as there are a lot more players on horde, guild recruitment is easier for the horde thus having more and more alliance players jump ship and join the horde.
---
You'd think at least alliance have insta bg-queues. Wrong!
---
While they are certainly faster than horde queues, horde don't have to wait for hours as it used to be in vanilla either thanks to mercenary mode, which lets them join the alliance for bgs.
---
Well, kek.
---
So you rolled a rogue to gank people "random world pvp encounters" LOL
---
And now that you have to do group content, you are complaining about it?
---
Why? You're never gonna get anything doing that, especially something like hoj or truestrike. We deserve the gear just as much as them. Dont let entitled rogues tell you otherwise.
---
Talking about BGs in phase too is kind of irrelevant though, no?
---
Honestly I think if they had 2 talent options - one that improves AM speed (on proc would work like they did in TBC) and one directly effecting it’s raw damage - then it 100% could be viable
---
But for most spells, the rank 5 and rank 10 have the same cast time, so they receive the same coefficient..
---
All depends on your server.
---
You wont get proper ns before 60 anyway. Focus on your healing gear and get improved healing touch. Rest of talents don't matter right now for healing
---
100% since it happened
---
sleep deprivation can really take a toll on your body in the long term bro.  Catching up on weekends doesn't actually get you 100% caught up.   just tryin to help keep you wowin into your 80s :)  
---
i have this problem too although not quite that bad.  ive been working on going to bed at midnight so i can be up at 7 and not have bags under my eyes every day.   2:30 bed times were really starting to wear me down
---
Mmm.... yeah... you’re right, but all of the classes have been neutered really. 
---
The warlock is one of the strongest soloing classes in the game during classic. Like hunters, they’re a little slow until you start getting your good pets and ability toolbox stocked. 
---
After that though, a good warlock can do so much. I think only the hunter is better solo tbh. Arguably, the mage is also, but only during aoe grinding.
---
Shhhhh we need to say its toxic so no more alliance come over.
---
No, why is it unfair if you're not competing with them? What is the "unfair" part where EU has it easier.
---
Seems like a silly line in the sand if enemy cast bars and buff addons are commonly accepted.
---
Orbs?
---
Sometimes i solve this problem by doing my own group. The worst part is trying to invite ppl. I try to find a tank or healer and just inv the rest of the dps classes. Mostly like i don’t another rogue. If he’s gonna roll same item than me, it’ll be bad for me and for him it’s better to just find another group. That is it.
---
I love the idea of classic+. We have the opportunity here to recapture something truly unique and amazing. 
---
if they just try and rerelease the burning crusade and follow the same path as in the past , I'm telling you, everyone will lose interest and the game will die.
---
print screen???
---
Classic+ would be a great idea. Would love to see stuff like:
---
1) Ultra hard versions of noob dungeons, such as Ragefire Chasm: Fel Corrupted edition, with level 63+ elites
---
2) New in depth quest chains that involve world exploration. This kind of stuff wouldn’t even be wikiable making it a new experience for all.
---
3) Craftable world bosses that require multiple people with 300+ engineering, enchanting and blacksmithing. Once crafted, it marches towards opposing capital.
---
3b) Monster raids on smaller towns like Crossroads with multiple waves of mobs. Mobs would have shields making them immune to damage/spells/effects from anyone 5+ levels higher so only those of appropriate level could contribute
---
4) New type of ore/crystal that requires 305+ skill, Fel corrupted, can spawn in noob zones. Spawn a fel corrupted level 63+ elite hydra that only attacks someone trying to mine the ore. This will encourage noobs to interact with high levels as they discover the ore, and high levels will revisit noob zones
---
5) Dungeons that have no level requirement but instead are full of tricky platforms, traps, and spatial puzzles, much of it randomlt generated
---
Just some thoughts on how you could spice up the game without having to create new zones and dungeons
---
Yeah but by then maybe Activision-Blizzard will have been bought out by Ayy-LMAOs and they will have re-rereleased Classic WoW in their home galaxy.
---
People from denmark cant wait to tell you theyre from denmark.
---
I think it's based on cast time since its shorter it uses less SP
---
They can use Sulfuras
---
how did you guys get the ingots
---
I certainly hope so, but I'm going to be exclusively leveling in instances once p2 hits. The relentless shitty ganking and camping is unbearable now, when they have no incentive. When phase 2 hits, theres no point in stepping outside a dungeon until you're 60.
---
Paid transfers when? I would've headed off to a PVE server in a second if it was available a month ago. Instead I'm on heartseeker as alliance playing PVE lite.
---
I disagree with the premise that it's the safe choice. I think the game will simply die if they just try to rehash the same old expansions
---
That is a dumb thing to do lol.
---
You are never going to get geared that way.
---
I don't want my experience have to be dictated to me by the game. I won't be able to go in and choose an alliance character if I want to. My point is the boat having choice that the whole game is about. The game is not about having an equal amount of each fraction on each server. I actually think it's valuable having different servers that have different faction imbalances.
---
SHow Me YoUr loGs So i Can TeLl if yOu KnoW hOW To GeAr foR pVP
---
It's world of warriorcraft...
---
He meant that he didnt play for a week. Also it wasnt op who mentioned it.
---
I think the levelling experience is the best part of classic. I'm sorry you played this game so much if sucks for you :(. This is my first ever time experiencing wow and it's been just amazing
---
Uses a lower level of the spell which consumes less mana.
---
You're right but it doesn't change his point. For almost every spell, ranks taught above lv 20 have the same coefficient. So you get the same amount of extra healing/damage which is more mana efficient when casted on the lower versions.
---
You need to join the local grand marshal group and grind premade BG's whenever you can play. Easy rank 10.
---
Find these people who plan on going for GM and ride their coattails.
---
Players paying attention to faction balance are clearly already driving population trends or this wouldn't be an issue. Ignoring it doesn't make it go away.
---
100% agreed that Blizzard won't do shit about it though. They've been ignoring dead servers and faction imbalance for ~13 years and the most they've done is embarass themselves further with the faction-specific Hall of Fame rankings.
---
&gt;nice
---
Something drops.
---
Can you use it as an upgrade? 
---
No? = Pass
---
Yes? = Roll
---
There. The most simple loot system possible.
---
I found 4 gold pearls the one night, and have since never seen another one. I'm pretty sure they don't actually exist, and that I was just high on fumes.
---
A large portion of your rank decays every week. That's why you cant take a week off
---
I like that your screenshot included a sad and jealous warrior in it
---
Every healthy pop server will have dedicated PvP players regardless of the type of the server. Even Rank 10 can be challenging, getting the epic mount from PvP rewards is much harder than just farming the gold for it, not to mention the cost drops by 100 if you achieve rank 3, so there are no real reason for the majority of the players to chase 11. People will get the 2 set bonus and stop at there, that's realistic. It's just easier to Raid and gear instead of aiming for the epic PvP set.
---
Totally agree. People who complain on Reddit (any topic) are the people who complain on Reddit. They are never pleased.
---
I can’t tell you how many small guilds that I adsorbed into our guild once October hit. We currently have about 400 members!
---
Dude yes. I did this shit all the time in college. I'm 28 now and if I don't get at least 6 hours of sleep I feel like shit. If it happens a second night in a row I'm completely useless.
---
Blizzard is 99% responsible, they could've done plenty of things to promote (or enforce) faction balance. Instead they've completely ignored the problem and actively made it worse.
---
In a dungeon group, I’ll take a rogue that marks, distracts, saps, and pulls over an overzealous AoE mage any day.  It’s a much more fun tactical experience and honestly it’s not that much slower. 
---
Start your own groups is always the answer though. Aggressively make a friends list and as soon as you log in send tells to friends list and say “want to run something?”  Enjoy the struggle.  Eventually you are BiS, maxes rep, and raid logging. The chase is the game.
---
Until they own every flight point and you have to run everywhere
---
..unless indeed.
---
You moron... I’m saying that people who HAVENT worked in this business don’t know what they’re talking about. Because they keep saying shit like “fix the servers”.
---
&gt;Also when I use a wand I reg more mana right?
---
If you're Alliance and have a paladin judging Blessing if Wisdom on the boss. Then attacks regen mana.
---
###Option A, spellcleave as Bear
---
If you wanna spell cleave right now, the 37 lvls for the druid is quite the minimum as you can see [here](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZE0zs0M), you are not gonna keep aggro anyways as Swipe threat generation is bugged so Feral Instinct is not that awesome for Spellcleave. This build has the core talents that make it work but is still missing some awesome talents for bear cleave (furor, improved thorns, natural shapeshifter, predatory strikes, savage fury).  
---
The druid should also go all in on agility gear as the build focuses on the key talents Omen of Clarity and Primal Fury: every time you crit you get 5 rage and every time you hit you have a chance of making your next Swipe free. When you are spamming swipe it means that you have 3 chances to roll a crit and 3 chances to roll the proc for a free Swipe. Auto attacks also trigger both of these talents.  
---
As a bonus, agility also grants you armor and dodge chance which is a nice bonus.  
---
Ideally, the druid would use Regrowth on him self for healing threat, do the pull and pack the mobs and start tab-&gt;swipe-&gt;tab-&gt;swipe and this is followed by a mage blizzard and then let all hell loose. The point is not to hold aggro indefinitely but to utilise the improved Demoralizing roar, Feral Charge and taunt with mage slow to keep your casters alive. Do remember to keep thorns on every member of your group.  
---
A note on using taunts: taunt will set your threat equal to the maximum threat currently on the mob, so never use it on pull, the correct way to use it is after your DPS has done their damage spike, taunt and then maul or swipe immediately after.  
---
###Option B, wait until lvl 44 and spellcleave as Moonkin
---
The Moonkin enjoys the same armour as Dire Bear form (on par or better than full plate, depending on gear). The key here is to pair Barkskin (which you get at lvl 44), that reduces physical damage taken by 20% for 15 sec and prevents spell pushback, with Hurricane, that decreases enemy attack speed by 25%. They both share a one minute cooldown, which is perfect for spell cleaving as you will not probably do pulls any faster than that.  
---
If the druid has the mana, the rotation is Regrowth, Moonkin, Barkskin, Hurricane, Bear Form. If not then drop the Regrowth and make sure you have enough intellect to get into Bear after Hurricane is done and start using Demoralizing Roar and throwing Swipes around. The mage intellect buff helps a lot with the mana pool and should be always available with a spellcleave group. The talent build should look something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLEIR0sdm) at 44.   
---
###Few things to note
---
Efficient spell cleave requires good coordination and good knowledge of the encounters to be effective. This is popular because a lot of streamers did it but it is hardly any more efficient than a normal run with a random group.   
---
Trying to convince someone to let the druid even try in the spellcleave group may be extremely hard and the talent builds provided are only good for AOE smack down, they are quite awful for questing in general.   
---
In my honest opinion you will have better time if the druid gathers healing and tanking gear as you go so that he can heal or tank a normal group if needed while having most of the talents in Feral tree. This way you can initiate the group and as soon as you find a tank or a healer, it is extremely fast to fill the DPS slots.  
---
With that kind of strategy you can get quickly into dungeons and have a good time while questing.  
---
The final option is to go full resto and try to heal the spellcleave group with Tranquility and Regrowth as very strong AOE healing options, but again, you need to convince the others to take you in.
---
He also made an ally or if Jaina on a personal level.
---
&gt; Your guild is trash. You know it  
---
That's a valid opinion but not one that we share.  
---
&gt; but you have reaped the benefits so you justify it.  
---
I've personally not benefited aside from 2 devilsaur leather that I'd been given when helping with world PvP in the crater a few times. I also paid market prices for my devilsaur set. Over all I'd say the whole mafia thing has been a net negative for me.  
---
&gt; your own faction would rather move server than play with you. You're welcome to your dead server.
---
Nothing that any single guild has done remotely compares to the affect that free server transfers on a horde-favored server has had. It's silly and counter productive to pretend that GRIZZLY is responsible for a non-negligible amount of transfers.
---
Sure, that’s their decision, but now you understand why it would make sense for people to think otherwise. If they wanted they could just increase server capacity and “merge” both layers.
---
Fury prot isn't very different from regular fury in the sense that you will want to reach the hit softcap (6/9%) and have a decent amount of crit to actually benefit from your crit talents.
---
The difficulties you will face as a fury prot are the limited gear options since you will want to wear full plate armor and not leather.
---
There's a lot of fuss about fury prot and it's certainly viable but the common problem I see with newer tanks who can't hold aggro comes down to a few points:
---
1.  Not being hit capped. Every dps in the game has this as their priority so why shouldn't you?!? Defense simply isn't as important as many would believe.
---
2. Not playing correctly. Classic does not follow the retail trend of active mitigation, rage should be spent on generating threat. In short don't use Shield Block off cooldown, use Shield Slam/Revenge instead.
---
Fight Club's discord as someone here mentioned is a good resource for Classic warriors in general.
---
I love how this gets fixed within a week, but the plethora of bugs that actually need addressing aren't...
---
&gt; Just because you don't understand confounding variables doesn't mean they aren't a factor.
---
give an example that is proven to be relevant in this case
---
&gt; I don't want to argue it with you. 
---
because you knew you couldnt provide proof of anything you claim or back it up with the math. 
---
&gt;  Maybe I am wrong but to me it feels like 
---
If your argument starts with this you immediately get laughed out of the debate room, i wont be responding to anything you say again. :P
---
&gt; Maybe I am wrong but to me it feels like  you're using the same argument as someone who takes econ 101 and thinks everything is "just basic economics"
---
"because i want to pretend to be right, my feefees tell me there are higher mathematical forces in play, but remember i refuse to substantiate my claims so i wont be proving it."
---
How about making population balance ratios public for starters? That would take all of 30 seconds.
---
Instantly? Its been months.
---
Alliance racials are insane and paladins are absolutely insane. Alliance is far better both in PvE and PvP. This isn’t about racials or classes.

Watched a guildie do it this week also and that pet followed over mountains forever, eventually caught up and wacked him.
---
I don't have amazing gear but should be good enough. Like 4k mana at 48, +150 int +100 spi something like that.
---
It must have just been the group. All of their health was dropping crazy fast. And I healed ZF right after perfectly fine. 
---
Probably just a combination of no buffs and all melee class taking more damage. And a little under leveled.
---
Where? How could that possibly be true when the graphics are different, the game engine works differently, the menus are different... the entire game functions differently... A few tweaks? What the fuck are you talking about?
---
I'm guessing rightous orbs? Hot commodity for many reasons
---
I bet you play on a massively horde dominated server.
---
Yeah I know this type. People are very different, one will thank you, another one will kick you for the same thing. Can't please them all.
---
Not op but InFlight is what I use.
---
I think you can’t grasp the point that it’s gonna be a terrible cluster fuck at the beginning of phase two.
---
I need 4 orbs for my truefaith. In your opinion. How many runs is that? Lol. 
---
 I'm at endgame now and the pattern in really cheap on my server. But the mats are not. (over 100g for an orb at rimes)
---
Note that you can buy herb bags from vendors for cheaper than they are on the AH. The really good herb bags that are crafted aren't in game yet
---
I agree, hence the faction only transfer. This guy is saying let the allies come to heartseeker so they aren't miserable in their imbalanced servers, which just makes horde in heartseeker more miserable
---
And whenever someone writes such a thing as I did it gets down votes that's a dangerous signal I would say ... Real life is the basis for playing not vice versa.

---
I'm leveling my fourth character right now. :P You can reroll. Warrior&gt;Rogue&gt;Druid&gt;Paladin
---
what bussiness do you own?
---
3 hours of classes per day?  Well that explains it.
---
Yea this is what I'm doing, only have 2 imp HT right now until I hit 51. I'll just wait till 55-58 to respec out of my feral dps talents into my proper HotW/NS build.
---
I think it's more about cast times than the lv you learn, or at least I belive that was the case in BC(I'm not playing classic). Some low lv spells have lower cast times, so their coefficient is also lower. Could be wrong
---
Lower rank of a spell than your highest learned. Usually because they're cheaper mana wise. Sometimes because they're faster
---
How am I supposed to counter rogues in pvp as an arms warrior? Sometimes they get the jump on me, and I’m permanently stunlocked until I’m dead. Is there a way to prevent this?
---
Just because they are listed at that price does not mean they sell
---
Which a lot of Orcs were on board with. It’s not like Gul’Dan enslaved the Orcs and force fed them demon blood. He convinced them with good old promises of power
---
How about they get rid of the fascism of having eternal enemies first. Set up world pvp as an instance. But noo you love your fascism.
---
Semi-works.
---
Downranked HoTs are broken. 
---
Downranked Rejuv heal prediction just shows frozen bar which doesn't disappear even when Rejuv runs out.
---
Downranked Regrotwh doesnt show prediction at all for the HoT part.
---
They have 2 decent teams still, Nip and one more who i cant name. But the danish scene is way better at the moment.
---
Y'all bitches bout to get boomed by the Boom king.
---
The fact is there are way more horde players than alliance on almost every PvP server.  Faction specific ques/xfers could help a little  but ultimately there will still be a big imbalance because there are more horde players overall. You can’t force people to roll alliance. If you are a horde player complaining about not enough alliance, the solution is for you and all your friends to reroll alliance. You may not like the solution, because rerolling sucks, but that is the solution.

People arent complaining about ally transfering off stalag, they are complaining about the transfers turning ither servers INTO stalag
---
Probably 10-15 runs depending on your luck. I average about 1 orb every 3 runs
---
*Laughs in PVE server*
---
Why dont you transfer to heart seeker then pussy?
---
I would go with the heart seeker crossbow for the reason you said. Slower speed and higher damage.
---
I actually wish I rolled on a PVE server.  I don’t get pleasure in messing up someone else’s time and I find it annoying to get ganked. I’m not playing a competitive class or spec for PVP and it rarely goes my way in self defense.
---
I wouldn’t mind a chiller open world experience.
---
Lock has one of the best utility and also is one of the top dps while kind of being a sleeper class in terms of how many there are.
---
Don't add people. What do you really need to add people for?
---
solo mara or solo DM E
---
because boomer sound like boomkin (which was the surname of the balance druid) and it's a popular meme right now
---
Had a similar problem in Eastern Kingdoms. Got the waypoints in Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes, and suddenly the flight Darkshire (or was it Lakeshire?) -&gt; IF is waaay more expensive than going over SW.
---
I am glad it's not my life that will implode because of a legendary item or some false friendship with dudes I'll never meet nor get real help from.  But I am sad that people are that blind and ignorant.
---
That's actually not that bad. Good luck out there !
---
Back in the day it was always (base cast time / 3.5) * spell power.
---
Lower ranks often have shorter cast times so they get less SP contribution.
---
A 3.5 second cast time spell will get 100% of spell power *even if talented to reduce its cast time to 3.0 seconds*.  A base 3.0 cast gets about 85% of SP.  And so on.
---
Check out [EPGP](http://www.epgpweb.com/help/system). It is the best loot system for wow, it addresses the shortfalls of all the other systems. The only problem is that it takes some effort/knowledge to administrate, so it's not ideal for super casual guilds.
---
Aside from that, a trustworthy loot council is the best way to gear up for progression. But if you don't trust the council, +1 is superior. 
---
DKP is garbage, too many people pass on upgrades to horde points.
---
no, sorry, afk face pulling mobs isn't more or less challenging than afk single pulling mobs.
---
Hyper balancing everything is a big part of modern wow that I would say most people don't like. Now I'm not saying we have one singular right answer, just that making everything about PvP balance is not for everyone.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4728_Benediction
---
balance in classic is spam starfire, how the hell can they make it more simple ?
---
Yeah DKP is the most "fair" but if you have an honorable loot council it's the best for everyone.
---
We do LC in our guild and we always go by attendance, current gear, and gear attained recently. The council keeps it all on an updated Google spreadsheet for transparency.
---
Big dick BiS items such as the Priest Benediction drop and Mageblade are always distributed based on attendance. We always tell everyone the next 2-3 people in line for certain items (we run 2 raids in our guild), that way there's no fuss when those items get distributed.
---
Check my link I posted
---
No, it's not worth losing the raw spellpower of Mageblade or SoD. The proc isn't that frequent, and it doesn't scale with spellpower.

---
MAKE UR OWN GROUP
---
Yeah with those stats you probably shouldn't have an issue
---
This is probably true. I'm resto druid so I get almost twice the +healing power. I have 340 now so my most mana effective Healing Touch rank is 4. It's also faster. At +370 healing rank 2 becomes the most effective, but at the mp5 I'm at that would be a waste of healing/sec as I'd never run out.
---
Also crippling poison and mind numbing poison are key.

That guy was definitely being an asshole but I want to bring attention to the fact that Firewater will only start dropping once you've completed the relevant quest chain.

And even saying this. I only care if they got a baby or younger kid. Yeah video games are great but theres other shit in life.  Like I had people telling me well you think golf is any different ?

 Everything in moderation.

Anyone else ignore the first article only to read the second one?
---
Idk if you're being intentionally stupid or not but it certainly is.
---
Lag most likely.
---
Thanks, but should I just ignore the +4 in bows? Missing a single hit overall would be a great damage loss (potentially up to 1k+ in crit damage atm).
---
But I’m still 40 and I know why hey hey
---
maybe try tell me when
---
For me it's always been the races that make up the faction. Tauren and Trolls are just straight up cooler than anything the alliance has to offer.
---
You mean like the terrible cluster fuck it's been during literally every single WoW content/patch/expansion release since 2004?
---
No I can't grasp that, I've been living under a rock for the past 15 years......
---
&gt; server transfers aren’t the cause of this
---
Server transfers are absolutely making it worse. Tons of alliance transferred off Skeram during the first transfer period, even more will probably go once the honor system is out and they're getting camped 24/7.
---
Gratz! Whats the combat text addon? Or is a weak aura?
---
I think a class and profession specific boe requires no ruleset, just common sense, which you've made it abundantly clear that you prefer compensate for with blind greed. it's no more complicated than that - you would rather let greed guide you than anything else and that's fine, I was just trying to figure out if there were any adults in the room left who could agree you suck
---
Weapon skill isn't gonna do much for you while leveling. Just use the xbow, you'll kill mobs faster.
---
A lot of university attendance isnt mandatory.

College students have the most free time of any age in the US so not a great example

What is the most viable endgame PvE build for druids? I wanted to be feral dps/tank, but I have been reading a lot lately that makes druids sound bad...
---
As a man on the east coast playing on a west coast server. Clearing everything in one night leaves for one sleepy dude.
---
I’m 60, and still haven’t got a decent main hand to use, so I’m still using a staff. That said, I would go train in swords and daggers now, so if you find a main hand, you can equip it. In the end, generally, a MH/OH with proper stats will be slightly better than an equivalent staff.
---
If you are alliance, the sword smith in the main trade district in SW has a guy that can train you in both. I haven’t played horde in forever, and don’t remember where they train.
---
I see this sub didn't get the memo. What a bunch of normies.
---
Uh... 80 out of 1000 is 8% not 0.8%, which would be 8/1000
---
Name checks out
---
Unless this is some sort of bleeding edge Will Farrel esque reverse meta trolling
---
The people that change servers are the same people that would either quit or reroll. The issue will happen independent of server transfers.

Nice and quick. Decent.

Not really. Retail Warlocks are still very Warlocky.
---
We use a blind bid dkp system with decay, however we use loot council on weapons/trinkets and they end up costing 15 dkp.
---
Actually combat rogues might as well be shitty fury warriors.
---
If you’re not willing to roll daggers then yeah you made a dumb choice imo.
---
It does not.as a hunter main, the bowskill is super good IF you are not hit capped. Otherwise, crossbow is the choice here.
---
You're adorable.
---
'arrogant buy mediocre' is the best over all definition of Sweden.
---
Cringe
---
My overarching point is that it’s not that easy to fix these problems. And there’s no way the dev team will get a green light to go and fix all this shit when upper management wants them to work on something else.
---
Avenue Q was amazing!! I had no idea this song was from it. My date had no idea why I got so excited lmfao
---
That's what memes are
---
More like were slaves forced to wage a war of extermination and then the alliance immediately tried to re-enslave them as soon as they were free, so they took what land they could (most of which is shitty and devoid of resources) to try and fight for their freedom (again). Kind of has a whole different connotation than what you said, but whatever.
---
Sweden won ti3 though. Just to give them SOME kind of credit.
---
Go BM once you can. Hunters are good pvp 40-60
---
but it does as it's a fundamental disagreement with how people view drops. 
---
because what will happen, 1 person will roll need since it's their spec/prof, 3 people will roll greed and the 5th will ninja.
---
So, the reasons to need all boes are:
---
- It decreases the chance of ninjas (because you could then give the boe to the proper person if you wanted to)
---
- the game is not balanced around boes, so no one truly needs whatever boe drops. you're needing because you don't want to buy it off the ah. 
---
- the group got the drop. if it weren't for the group, the person who suits the item would never have seen it. so the group has equal right to it
---
Favouring the class/prof is just another form of bias - you are saying luck is far more important than anything else. which, imo, is stupid. just because i happen to be an alchemist, i get to learn something that not only saves me X amount of gold since i don't have to buy it, but also gives me Y gold because i can sell the product. again, if the group decides to go that way, fine. but it's the worst way as it hurts the whole group.
---
with an item, well, no boes are needed. the person is being greedy as they won't buy the item off the ah and having the item leads to them performing better and getting even more items. also, it won't/doesn't prevent them from getting items that are sub-par but still suit their spec just because.
---
I think it's pretty clear to everyone with the very basic abilities of understanding to identify that I'm not really following the gaming scene. "As far as I know" is typically used when it's more or less guesstimates.
---
But hey. At least there's a lot of jerks like you who offer no solutions, so all's good. :)
---
Try using your ranged weapon?
---
Make your own groups
---
Tip 1. Try not to use ur axe at all.
---
Tip 2. Set out traps but if it’s too late for those use clip wing, run back a few meters and then concussion shot 
---
Tip 3. Make sure you know when to use arcane shot / serpent sting in relation to ur auto shot. You always want serpent sting going though it’s a nice dot
---
these are very simplified dumbed down things, and always have ur pet attacking i feel like that goes without saying. 
---
You want them outside ur “too close” range which is tough at this level. Later on with engineering youll get grenades and such so you’ll have an easier time but for now just good luck tbh. 
---
Put points in concussion shot in talent tree if you pvp a lot. The stun is incredible! Use aspect of cheetah for speed (can’t remember if it deactivates though once in combat, if it does switch to aspect of the hawk)
---
Same reason why terran republic is the most popular in planetside.
---
Red and black color scheme. People thinking they are cool edgy snowflakes and how unique they are, while being a part of the majority.
---
Very cool.
---
I'm sure that was true at some points but there were always clear best specs at basically every point in the game. For example, Marksmanship hunters were just way ahead of the other two specs when 100% armor pen became viable.
---
Heavy clam is what they called me in college
---
Sounds like you just need to find people with a similar mindset. With private servers being a thing all these years, most everything has been found out. 
---
While I do feel the same on some of the above topics I also know that the game being played today is never gonna be played like it was with everything we know now. People just want efficiency when they know it's available. For dungeons, if I want a slower paced expierence I just join the groups that are going for quest runs and it's never been an issue. I guess just play how you wanna play and try to avoid randoms that may wanna play differently.
---
I had never played any iteration of WoW before and rolled with my friends with little to no knowledge of anything. Solid assumptions, though.
---
Edit: [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skeram/comments/dtxzwm/give_me_a_reason/f6zvao7/) person is a typical Horde player. He feels exactly the way I, and a huge portion of Horde, feel.
---
Depends. If RNG gods hate you you'll spend more time waiting for boats instead of being able to quickly and efficiently defecate, secure in the knowledge that nothing will happen in the next 6 minutes.
---
If heartseeker is balanced my guild will consider going there. We have to do some research still but Skeram is so unbalanced I worry world pvp will be boring.
---
Leveled as arms and AOE tanked through 60. Without crit or hit, fury is garbage. Arms has a massive damage boost against more than one target every 30 seconds and if you're unable to hold threat on more than 2 targets maybe the spec isn't the issue.
---
Yeah but what if he’s too close to me
---
lmao look at this moron.
---
An apologist would say things like “it’s not Blizzards fault” or “they shouldn’t have to fix these issues. It’s the players’ fault for doing 200v200”
---
I’m not saying that... I’m saying that people who think Blizzard can just “go and fix the problems” don’t know what they’re talking about... they need to adjust their expectations.

BM ?
---
&gt; a majority of raids out there still having to deal with submerge.
---
This is where you have the wrong idea. Beating submerge is not a feat, it is _expected_. 
---
Not beating submerge puts you in the **bottom 15%** of guilds who have managed to kill Ragnaros. (Source: [Warcraftlogs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=speed&amp;boss=672&amp;page=57))
---
As long as you guys are having fun, you should keep doing what you enjoy, but you can't go around using your guild as some kind of positive example. It's not.
---
Yeah I started playing retail in cataclysm and after loving the game way more than I expected, I looked into past warlock skill and playstyle.
---
It made me sad that I could never experience the old school warlock with meaningful skills and lots of good RP potential.
---
With classic I finally got to experience the game like I did for the first time with even more fun unexpected outcomes. Like I didn't know you had to gather so much material for the epic mount quest!? Or I need to learn two skills from books (inferno and doomguard) I am happy about this re-release of vanilla wow.
---
I'd say that's a little light, unless its 3hrs max only including classes that take attendance.
---
Why is this comment being down voted? Holy shit a lot of bots on this sub.
---
Enchants permanently add stats to your items. Typically it's something you do at endgame since you're not going to be replacing the items you're using for a while. Enchanters can disenchant any items that are green or better, which destroys them and gives you the materials you need to make enchantments. You can do this to any item with any level of enchanting so it's common for people to make an alt and level it up to at least level 5 to pick up enchanting as a profession. Then you can mail any items you get that you don't need to use to that character to disenchant. You can either sell the materials on the auction house (often they sell for more than vendoring that item would) or keep the enchants for yourself to use. Enchanters will either charge you to enchant an item using their materials or you can trade them the materials you've gathered and give them a bit of a tip for the enchantment. Overall it's a pretty expensive profession so I wouldn't recommend going into it as the recipes for the good enchantments are quite rare and costly. It's more cost-effective to just get the materials yourself and pay for someone to do the enchant for you. Sometimes you'll also see people leveling lower-level enchantments that will do enchants for you for free just so they can level up their skill.
---
Yeah priest MC'ed you and a pally buffed you. Had it happen to me in STV while leveling in August
---
Honor system and no bg's mean you have to wpvp. Everyone from level 48 and up will be worth honor for a 60. So 50-60 quest areas will be a fucking nightmare of 60 groups death Balling
---
Reeeeeee
---
Warcraft logs is not at all a majority of the raids out there. Those who take the time to raid log are absolutely in the minority
---
Kinda nooby but I don’t know how to download and install addons that aren’t thru twitch, I downloaded trinket menu but I dont know how to get it onto Wow
---
Classic is on the same course as retail. H/A dominated servers with no relevant pvp on any server. Want to dungeon and raid? Join the server your faction dominates.
---
Then you *could have* 1 player getting 5 epics.
---
Yes it does happen, does it happen often? Not at all statistically.
---
When you use RNG, RNG happens. It's still fair, anyone that creates tension from RNG are just immature babies that shouldnt be part of your raid anyways.
---
Why would you want to raid with someone who throws a fit because they lost a roll 5 times? Grow up or get out IMO.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
Yes they will have more, because .3% of a larger number will be larger. Yay maths.
---
You still have to outplay more people. More chances for folks who don't work as much as you, or have a more flexible schedule to outgrind you.
---
Also maths.
---
Yeah I know there's Swedish games who are doing really well. My comment was a reply to Eisal's "Aren't Swedes **ALWAYS** netter at games than the Danes"
---
No matter if Sweden won a championship here or there. No matter if Rekkless is probably the winningest ADC in League of Legends history, it doesn't change that there's a whole bunch of very successful Danes in the same field, so the ALWAYS is doubtful, at best. Is all I'm saying, while openly admitting it's not my strongest area of knowledge.
---
But hey. We have a bunch of jerks just pointing out the obvious, so all's good. :)
---
Warcraftlogs says the DPS ceiling for moonkin is around 450.  For a frost mage it's 800+.  On average a mage does about double a moonkin's damage, on what should be a stand-and-nuke fight (fast Rag kills, Golemagg, etc.).
---
It's not that balance druid is good, it's that *your* moonkin player is getting the max out of his class while *the rest of your DPS are slackers*.  If your moonkin player was a mage he'd be near or at the top of the meters.
---
Sure there is repeatable stuff, but none of it is "required" for any progression.
---
You can rep grind some weird faction for a special tiger mount, but it isn't required. There is a drastic difference in how the rewards are presented.
---
#reasonswhyiplayonapverealm

I mean it's been two and a half months. One 60 is not unreasonable by now. I can see maybe being hit with altitis and not focusing on one character, but it's a reasonable amount of time. It definitely does not require any no lifing. I have a full time job with obligations and I hit 60 a while ago.  I ain't buying the casual argument.
---
And so much good rp mechanics.
---
Ok oomer
---
It's called "Rod of the Ogre Magi" if you want to look it up.
---
Numero 4: Who the fuck would want to transfer to a server where you are outnumbered 10:1
---
Fear has a higher chance of sucess when you deal damage.

3 hours a day is 15 credit hours, which is what you need every semester for 4 years to graduate.
---
Tauren can play druid what do you mean?
---
Did you read his post?
---
I did! Am going to right now haha thanks.
---
Ive been main tanking for 5 weeks now and haven't gotten ONE piece of raid loot outside of Onys head.
---
Where's the loot system that protects me from getting fucked over because no tanking gear dropped?
---
Oh right, there is none. Tough luck, try again next week. RNG is RNG.
---
Did you feel a huge improvement when you started getting injections?
---
What good is Gouge as a rogue when you use poisons? Seems like a bit of a wasted skill. Especially taking the Improved Gouge talent if you're in combat spec.
---
No one gives a shit about 2 day old theories. We've know the fireball threat is broken since people first did it. You can google dozens of topics explaining it on this very sub. There's probably 200 bug report topics on the official forums.

Look a month old breakdown of cheesing broken ass p2 threat

Aye it is, not worth it this iteration. As a prot warrior way back when it was hard to get into raids and that's really all the progression I had
---
vibeo gane
---
lots of people are not in a guild because they don't have time to raid so the current "endgame" is completely out of reach. That's why a 5 man dungeon is definitely welcome instead.
---
I personally am in a small guild of old friends and we are barely 5 at lvl 60. Even when the others will catch up we will be probably never be 10 online at the same time so for us, the endgame is gonna be ubrs and farm some lvl 60 dungeons.
---
And bg's pvp of course. World pvp is just a lame mess for corpse campers. No real fun in that unless you find abusing low levels "fun".
---
BM means Beast Mastery talent tree
---
Just curious what were your played times to 60? Any guides or just questie?
---
Mainly wondering because once I hit 60 on my main I'll want to lvl up my 18 alt as fast as possible. I've been using guidelime sage on alliance which has the average player hitting 60 at like 7 days played, I'm about a day and a half behind that from exploring and playing the AH though.
---
You should never use poison DoTs, for that exact reason. Your main poisons will be instant and crippling, maybe mindnumbing for casters.
---
Oooh okay, I haven’t invested a lot of points yet, I’ll do that next
---
A couple guys taking about you being a loser and your post history being a good laugh. I’m not trying to suck your dick or anything, but one of the first things that came up in your posts was your entertainment setup... and your wife and kid...
---
Not exactly the kind of thing a loser would have.
---
I recall there being a text code you could type in and it would increase the amount you could scroll out, wish I still remembered it
---
Not true in current tier.
---
Cat DPS on a single-target fight is about double moonkin, *if* the player is competent and knows about Wolfshead Helm and powershifting.  Cats don't scale, but out of the gate, they're not *bad*.
---
Of course fury warriors on those same fights do double *cat* DPS, so it's not like cat is *good*, but it's still better DPS than moonkin.
---
I have Details! as a damage meter, but it resets seemingly every time we're out of combat. In the options it says reset is manual only, which to me sounds like it should only reset when I tell it to.
---
What am I missing? Is the addon broken, and if so what damage meter is more recommended?
---
MC fights are mostly not melee friendly however. So while a cat may be better in a straight sim, moonkin should outperform cat in almost all raid fights in current stuff.
---
Fnatic and NIP, the danes have Astralis. These are top 10 teams in the world atm.
---
I can play a cool troll lady and smite things with the loa power.
---
I vaguely remember multiple mage specs being very close in max theoretical dps at the same time in wotlk. Warriors aswell.
---
And tbc/wotlk had those unique buffs/debuffs so bringing one of the "bad specs" was good because of the increase in raid performance. Survival hunters/arms warriors had a debuff or some shit and you wanted one of those and stuff.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Which make me thing, if each country was a spec, how would it look like ?
---
I have 4 action bars full of spells  and warlock conjured items and it's still not enough if you get more abilities from the talent tree.
---
Wut. Mages and Moonkins both have 1 button rotations...
---
At 24 your should be BM and just wing clip and run as your pet eats their ass.
---
My point extends beyond PvP. Flying mounts just make travel boring.  Its turns *all* travel into just pointing in the right direction and waiting 5 minutes to arrive. Thats okay occasionally(Gryphon masters),but it shouldn't be 95% of travel.
---
It also restricts open world PvE design because players will just fly over most obstacles you place in their way.
---
More jpeg please
---
For my guilds we got 1 as drop, 2 loaned from a guild we are friends with, 3 bought on AH and 3 bought from posting buy offers in trade chat.  Average price came out somewhere in the 325g ea range
---
Do a full Strat run. Kill experience combined with all of the quests is nearly a whole level.
---
What’s the general rule of thumb when it comes to disenchanting? Is it worth it?
---
It tastes like a burning ass.
---
I'm on Shazzrah, EU and I'm pretty sure that it's still perma-two layers.
---
I pretty much only ran BRD and LBRS from 57-60. It was pretty good xp, I was 3-4 hours played per level. Gotta make sure if you’re doing BRD you get into a group planning to do multiple farm runs or a full run.
---
4 hours to clear MC and not beating rags submerge.
---
EWW.
---
he's saying why don't you go roll a character on the outnumbered side. if this sub went and did that, it would help the numbers some. More than the server changes blizzard is offering at least
---
Pick up engineering the stun bombs .. Nets amd invis cloak cam be amazing tools to put range inbetween u and another person witch is. Pivotal for a hunter
---
Well it varies obviously, but just talking to friends not attending a lot of shit is basically the default for most CS and law schools here.
---
More competitive or not, players will be PvPing in mass groups all over level 48+ zones. Just like it was back in Vanilla. 
---
Players from 48-60 will make up those groups and either participate in them or avoid them. JUST like back in Vanilla.
---
Feel like my working life has a lot more free time than when I was in school. School ate up so much time outside of classes and if not that there's all the social events.
---
Thanks for reply. So the slightly higher hemo dmg from swords outweighs the benifits of having ambush in my toolkit?
---
Memes are alterations of the same idea, not the exact same joke over and over again.
---
who cares fucking gank them all later no1 can stop u
---
I actually did the grind in vanilla, on an easy server / faction
---
Past Rank 10, this is NOT a matter of how many hours you can nolife. You could literally play 20 hours a day and still get stuck on R11 if not R10. You need to be in a dedicated ranking clan, period. After that the number of hours per week depends on what your server and faction is like. It will be incredibly hard on a large tryhard server, and quite easy on a smaller PVE or RP server. In addition the faction with the longer BG queues adds to the annoyance since there is not that much you can do while in a raid group waiting out 20 min queues (let's hope they aren't 40 min as was the case prior to xrealm BGs in vanilla on many servers).
---
Up to R10 you can simply solo queue and at several hours per day every day you'll get it without issues, especially if your faction tends to win AV
---
Just get the head down. Pick a place and do all the quests you can. Will take 2-3 days (not in-game). Dungeon grind is also a great way to level and gear up
---
So I dont know why noone’s said this yet.. but without spoiling anything you are going to encounter an insane offhand from a quest soon that will last you till level 60
---
&gt;You are looking at this from a elite perspective.
---
No. You are just objectively wrong. I presented proof of this, and the only counterargument you have is that some people in your server discord say they don't log. That's no proof at all. That's called an anecdote. Go ahead and list me all the guilds on your server who have killed ragnaros (with proof, of course) and have never logged on WCL. I'll wait.
---
&gt; I’ve got over 170 unique accounts on my guild and still only have 10 60s.
---
You're raiding MC with 10 people and your boomkin is still placing 15th on DPS? It's almost as if you're just making shit up at this point.
---
&gt; Those beating submerge now, heck even those RAIDING now are absolutely the minority compared to the population as a whole. You CANNOT use metrics of the elite for the rest of the game.
---
Of course you have to compare with other raiding guilds. What else do you want to compare to? People who are still LFG hogger in Elwynn? Yes, congratulations, you beat the level 11 on DPS.
---
Whoosh
---
Don’t come at it from a perspective of raiding from week 2. That’s not the majority of players at all. You’ve got to look at it from the non-elite players. My guild has only 10 players at 60 out of over 170.
---
Can I start doing Strat at 57?
---
Not gonna lie. At first I thought this post was bitching about how interesting and awesome the Classic Warlock experience is. Glad I was wrong!
---
You can just have 3/3 improved blizzard, 2 points in frost nova, and everything else single target and that will let you farm ZF and other places fine. It's not a firestrike/shatter build but its basically a winter's chill 20/0/31 frost build but with aoe farming capability instead of chill. You can put 3 points in cone of cold if you are willing to sacrifice elsewhere.
---
It's important to have no points in frostbite of course
---
If they only allow horde to transfer off Skeram, it would help the imbalance though.
---
Only horde from Skeram -&gt; Heartseeker means both servers improve.
---
Again, I wasn’t saying it didn’t or that you shouldn’t  sleep. Just more so making an observation that I’ve seen.
---
Ifd the react is good I do it yeah :)
---
The advantage is that to me druids seem really not popular so its easy to get a spot (we had to recruit a low level when we were looking for one on a full pop server) and you can do all roles close to optimal in dungeons with one spec which is the best pvp spec I believe.
---
Oh, I can make a claim without supporting it, too! Look:
---
Not a single person claimed it was fact.
---
People this time around arent as ridiculously stupid and see purple and just have to have it. I got a taran icebreaker and I ended up selling it for like 35g because its garbage.
---
lol gratz!
---
My guild is raiding with 3, the host guild has around 20, the remainder are pugs. 
---
I’m not ignoring your proof, From the perspective of those who are on and using logs, you are absolutely correct. But again, that’s such a small population. MAYBE 20%.
---
Combat Dagger sure is fun during rtaids, any other time, not so much x)
---
No warnings for NNN or at least a NSFW tag?? For shame.
---
/s
---
“A truck driver”
---
If you are not a healer and you find a group that will take you, yes.
---
This is why I fly SouthWest.
---
Sorry guys, that's what balance is.
---
The game is on patch 1.12 where a lot of balancing took place. It’s the biggest reason why these fights aren’t taking that long. Most of the “Pre-BIS” lists are fucking dumb and a lot of them are really inaccurate(such as not running Shadowcraft as a Rogue, lol).
---
If the patches were left at the current raids then you wouldn’t be seeing fights going as quickly and as smoothly as they are for the vast majority. They’d still be easy and puggable but not like this. MC wasn’t even seen by the larger populations until late BWL/AQ when you had other sources to get gear to step into MC and try it.
---
I am alliance...
---
If the mob is not immune to fear you just play with it all day long.  And even if it is you can easily sacrifice your voidwalker and facetank.     
---
Or kite with Curse of Exhaustion while the pet hits it and you damage with dots.            
---
There are so many ways to kill a mob, and the fun part is finding the best one.
---
Why is the alliance subsidized the nelf flights?
---
Is this what my taxes are for? 
---
They have legs and arms they can swim
---
I understand why guilds would force optimal builds. It's not because they want to clear MC in less than 2h, it's because they want to clear MC at all.
---
You can't ask people to "get good", most players will not use the full potential of their class and under perform. The simplest way to ask people to get ready for raids is ask for proper gear, consumables and spec.
---
You should assume most players are not knowledgeable about the game, nor are they reasonable people. It's too much hassle as a GM to explain to the guys playing meta specs that the other guy playing a boomkin is fine because he compensate for his spec shortcomings by greater skill.
---
If you allow one guy to have sub optimal spec then other people are going to ask for it and won't have the skill to pull it off. TLRD, it's not about having the most optimal raid setup to speed run the content, it's about keeping the hassle to a minimum in a social environment where players are not really that good and telling that would be a problem.
---
I kind of regret not doing it for that "real" experience but eh, alliance are already getting a bit too big for their britches and trying to raid crossroads/jumping people outside of MC when they forget to unflag for pvp from the aforementioned fighting.
---
It’s a deal.
---
With how tight some of the pulls get you may want to wait for 58 or 59. The dungeon has a ton of stuff in close proximity, so you don't want to accidentally start pulling extra. 
---
Questing until 58 is going to be your best bet. If you're truly out of quests, BRD runs might be the next best thing.
---
That’s a good point, it is tough trying to explain that to people. Luckily I havnt ran into that problem personally, and the amount of players wanting to even play a “bad” spec are like....01%
---
Careful what you say, now you in reddit territory
---
Fuck it's been 2.5 months? I suck
---
Well 15 years ago some of us had really crappy internet connections, I remember 512k ADSL becoming a new thing in my town and thinking it was so fast while running Mara during the summer as a teen. Good times!
---
Faction queues with faction server swaps would solve the problem however
---
&gt; My guild is raiding with 3
---
Your guild isn't raiding anything. You're joining a pug. Pugs are far from the majority. It's no wonder your view on things is so off if you've only ever talked with other pugs.
---
&gt; that’s such a small population. MAYBE 20%.
---
So I already told you there are 40 unique guilds per EU realm on average on WCL. This naturally includes guilds hosting pug runs. You really think there are 200 guilds killing ragnaros on _each_ server? Do you realize how absurd that is?
---
Oh yes I agree, Sweden is the worst. Ti3 is the only thing they got going, but hey, even in that game (dota) we have Johann who has two back-to-back ti titles, and he is the team captain and owner.
---
I would NEVER argue that Sweden is better than denmark, that would be a huge lie.
---
Farm your secondary bis (as a mage this is my fire or arcane spec gear) get revered, get a second epic mount for flexing purposes, farm herbs to sell, helps others farm their bis, farm a new profession, those are the things off the top at least.
---
Certain high lvl items are worth disenchanting- when they have a chsnce to give essences or shards and they have a low vendor price.
---
Addons like auctioneer can help you determine when that is
---
What is the benefit of using Goblin Sapper Charges versus Thorium Grenades?
---
Sapper charges do 600 dmg on average, and Thorium 400. 
---
But, sapper charges also do 500 dmg to me and lack a stun, while Thorium stuns everyone for 3 seconds.
---
As a mage, the extra 200 dmg don't seem worth it compared to the self-dmg and lack of stun.
---
That implies that every server becomes to the levels of 90:10 or whatever though. But I guess it is in blizzards best interest once paid transfers come
---
&gt; I'll gladly take a transfer to a more balanced server.
---
that's the thing though, you won't be moving to a more balanced server
---
Which add on did you use to know the time of flight ?
---
there’s two settings:
---
Per fight/engagement
---
Overall Data 
---
Should be in the options menu and just check “overall data” if you want total for your entire instance / raid etc. Make sure to reset at start though as to not skew with dmg you did prior.
---
Imagine being that warrior though....
---
The intimidation of seeing a fully realized moonkin is an unquantifiable advantage though
---
23 is the best start .. Ur talents for aoe farming are as follow 
---
3/3 elemental persicion
---
3/3 permafrost
---
2/2 imp. Nova
---
3/3 imp blizzard 
---
NO POINTS IN FROSTBITE it can mess up ur grping .. And at ur lvl u should only have 2 points into imp. Frostbolt 
---
Then make sure u get atric reach for the extra range 
---
The imp blizzard is a must as it allows a slow with permafrost to slow them and allows u 2 get multiple blizzards off b4 they get2 you ... Watch videos on it
---
. dont go arcane first for CC like some shitty guides suggest
---
Add me on bnet
---
Swifttalon#1285 
---
I can show i ur aoe farming spots
---
&gt;there are probably still a few things you can do in stv
---
*Stealth sound intensifies*
---
hard for you to say it's balanced when you're not on the side getting curb stomped
---
60/40 is playable, I wouldn't say fine.  I'm on Incendius.. it's one of the most balanced servers rn, seems close to 50/50 and it's seriously some of the most fun I've ever had in WoW.
---
if
---
why take the chance when its not necessary at all. I feel like any LC guild that isnt doing aggressive splits or sub 60min MC clear is failing. I would never join a casual guild with hardcore rules or the reverse.
---
One of my closest friend returned to play classic after stopping in wrath of the lich king... he tried the retail version playing a warlock again and... I basically lost any chance to convince him to play in the next expansion unfortunately.
---
Good luck finding a guild that recruits rogues though. At least ours is completely closed for additional rogues and most I see are as well.
---
Because the original post didn’t have the word damage in it
---
Isn't there a threat cap?  Our healer pulled threat p3 on a long kill while our tank was doing everything he could to build threat the whole time
---
The fuck it isn't. That's my fucking flag and you can't fucking have it
---
Knew which song it was before even clicking lol
---
honestly I just want wrath without dungeon finder. because as soon as dungeon finder phase comes into wow, it will feel completely different.
---
wrath with icc and icc dungeons, but no dungeon finder, would be exactly where I would want to play
---
101 101
---
I am a warlock. Horde was a simple choice. I certainly DON'T want to deal with undead rogues ganking my ass.
---
That's class specific though. I don't know what other people motives might be.
---
Idk why all the hate I like videos like this. Good job man; my only suggestion is having some text to pair with your breakdown showing herb type value and quantity!
---
You've got me there.
---
Damn when I get wasted I do dungeons and raids and then wake up the next morning to find out I was very thorough and made sure everything was done properly. Granted, I don’t drink alcohol, just other fun stuff.
---
It’s gearing your low levels so you can dominate BGs
---
Wowhead and icey veins both have great guides on leveling classes through classic and which talents/gear to take, check them out!
---
Oh I know they're still awesome! But just compared to the systems they used to have they just seem a bit neutered to me.
---
If you have all those flight points you should be at a level where 7s 60c shouldn't matter too much anymore. :p (Not that that will stop me from searching the cheapest flight)
---
It was a name thing.
---
A buddy of mine hot matching names with me, that you can only get like minute 1 of server launch.
---
I can't be arsed going in to every game there is to list a comparison of swedes vs danes. Just putting it out there that your knowledge is null when you mention someone like Kungen as a guy who represents Sweden and its gaming culture. 
---
&gt;But hey. At least there's a lot of jerks like you who offer no solutions, so all's good. :)
---
Yeah, I'm sure people are after "jerks" who give their opinion when google is a few clicks away from talking about facts instead. 
---
Quit being butthurt. Next time, take your time to do some research instead of getting sad when someone calls you out for being clueless.
---
Thanks I will remember that
---
Nice, I'll be on the look out for that
---
What were they doing to make it so bad for everyone else
---
BWL also comes with P3
---
No way man, you need to up those numbers.
---
That was my plan, but I imagine people are beginning to stack their alts already?
---
isn't 6 piece shadowcraft better for rogue now?
---
In a year, when the majority of the population is raiding, there will absolutely be over 200 killing rag. From the population RIGHT NOW killing rag, then yes, WCLogs is a majority representation.
---
But you are leaving out a million+ players and thousands of guilds because they just arnt there yet. Those raiding are such a small portion of the population, and this whole discussion on my part has been to say that when people get to raid, they absolutely can use something like a boomkin because it doesn’t matter! They will beat the raid! 
---
As far as my guild/raid goes: 
---
It’s not a pug, the main group of 20+ members is an all dwarf and gnome guild, I lead an all night elf guild. I’m the leader of my guild and an consulted/treated as a co-equal as the main groups guild leader, make decisions on who is brought, how to beat fights, how loot is done, etc. It’s a very different setup. Then the remaining 10 or so slots are filled with non guild friends from a coalition of alliance guilds we set up earlier on.
---
Was a nightmare getting into brd as horde stalagg. Always is lol
---
Is there a list of all the bad flight paths to take some where?
---
Don't forget that a lot of tanks are at most offtanks. We have 3 prot warriors in our guild. But an additional 4 warriors who will likely tank in most dungeons.
---
It happens 100% of the time it happens.
---
Thank you for the detailed answer.
---
I prefer mine in the am
---
I mean I have been selling greens I disenchant from dungeons. Hugh level greens will drop essence and I got a stack alrdy and sell the extra at 4g50s a pop.
---
 Last night I listed 4 and they sold before my flight to menethil harbour lol easy 25g 
---
 Tho sometimes you just get the dust and that not near as much but I need the dust to finish levelling lol.
---
 It's expensive as all hell to level to 300
---
Oh I WAS doing daggers, but it was too slow, Combat has been faster
---
325 isnt bad at all
---
my server is 500 and that small difference makes a huge difference x5
---
Yeah I just had some guildies link it to me. https://classic.wowhead.com/news=296156/wow-classic-november-8th-hotfixes-guard-pvp-behavior-onyxia-fireball-threat?webhook
---
No you need at least 10k. Back to the farm. Farmboi
---
I don't understand why people would want to go to a realm full of transfers. You're instantly surrounded by a group of quitters. When things got tough, they ran. The foundation of those servers is built on mentally weak people.
---
To be honest, I am beyond infuriated with how Blizzard has fucking bungled this. After the last server transfers, we've be grinding against a roughly 80-20 split. Those of us who stuck around have suffered, but we did so knowing we'd have a great playground of pvp kills. 
---
Next round of transfer is going to make it 90-10. There's already very little dungeon groups outside of est primetime. There's only a couple MC/Ony pugs outside the gigantic zerg guilds that make up most of the people left. I pretty much guarantee anyone not in a giant guild is likely out the door. 
---
So here's what Blizzard has offered us: a server with no pvp (Heartseeker), a server that's doomed (Stalagg) or a completely dead server (AR).
---
They rewarded everyone's hard work and patience with a red poker up the ass. Seriously,  fuck them for this. Months of time and effort wasted.
---
Very true!
---
Yeah i just saw that. F man.
---
Good luck eith that haha
---
Yeah saw a lot sitting on AH all week for 600-800 but let those just sit and waste deposit fees.  Sniped the 3 we bought off AH pretty quickly after they were posted
---
Welfare expac and the start of the slide. 
---
TBC was the only good expac. Ever.
---
You can't even cast insect swarm in boomkin form. There's nothing wrong with going boomkin for fun if that's what you enjoy, and I may do it at some point because Boomkins rule. But getting the form is definitely not even close to as good as NS.
---
You don't have to accept bsttle.net friend requests. Delete people that annoy you
---
Ima be that guy.
---
If you need all this to complete that quest, you're a bad Priest.
---
Do the shit by yourself.
---
I actually really like some of the stuff they have started to do thematically with demonology warlocks, but wish they still had a lot more to their old utility and flair as well. 
---
Again, Class identity being removed for spec identity was a failure in design. A lot of the pruning they did was harmful.
---
Ignite isn't lowest prio, but hunter's Mark etc can knock it off if you're not paying attention as a raid.
---
I agree with almost all of this, only thing is I don't see the TBC potential release as so black and white. Is it obvious to release TBC after a few years of Classic, yes. But I think a big part of the player base wants TBC and will eventually get bored of classic if theres no changes or next expansion. Personally I started during TBC and I want it more than classic since that's the expansion I enjoyed the most. I think they should leave classic alone but add tbc where you can copy or transfer your toon onto it. Hell I would even start from scratch again if I could play TBC.
---
Farm outside of whatever instance you're looking to run. Strat/scholo? Larval acid is decent to farm for, and bats drop good vendor trash. Blackrock dungeons? The orcs in burning Steppes drop decent vendor trash. Dire Maul? Pickpocket the Gordoks outside the  instance.
---
So glad I chose Sulfurus. Relatively even H/A and overall a great server with good population.
---
I'm part of the camp that would prefer neither. Classic survived on pservers for years and years. Why does there need to be more content added? We waited this long just to play for a year or two and then ask them to ruin it again? Makes zero sense to me
---
You're talking to the company that ruined the game in the first place, and were super reluctant to even bring the game back to vanilla. Why would you ever trust them to alter this content?
---
Oh, it's Seal of Wisdom, not Blessing. Yep. Melee and spell attacks against the target with a judgement of it have a chance of giving some mana to the attacker.
---
True, if they opened up transfers to Incendius it would just get flooded with the horde pvp tryhards who'd destroy the server anyway.
---
I’ve played on multiple airplanes over the past couple months.  Both domestic and international.  Been doing it as far back as MoP; Wow has never been terribly demanding from a data standpoint.
---
This is a super helpful summary, but I would note that strikers Mark is significantly better than boomstick although it will be a hotly contested pick up
---
ReallyHigh -Kromkrush
---
Delete and reroll Stalagg alliance.
---
yea but i want to go take a piss and get a drink of water
---
I’ve just been a bit salty about how elitist it comes off when really at the end of the day, you absolutely can grab those average players and throw them into a raid. As long as you’ve got a good core, good leadership, and people listen, you’ll clear the fights and get loot. You wouldn’t let a boomkin into your raid, which is fine if you want to be that intense about it, but that’s partially why a ton of folks are scared to raid. They have seen how everyone rips into folks on Reddit/forums, have seen videos/heard recordings of people getting screamed at, and it turns them off.
---
When really, you can make raiding be fun and casual, specs don’t matter, just a willingness to do your best, listen to tips on how to improve, and be commited for a longer chunk of time. It’s very accessible as the game was designed, but the player base has made it inaccessible, and thAts silly to me
---
Especially when nelfs have longer legs and arms than Humans, Gnomes and Dwarves. If anything Gnomes should have the subsidized flights!
---
Literally Mr last night lol except it was to kill the general for his blood to make sure I had my attune done for tomorrow.
---
Just wait until you’re 60 and buy/farm runecloth. It takes about 600g worth of runecloth to get exalted.
---
Each rank of Fortitude has a sort of minimum level requirement; is your friend lower level? if so, it will cast the highest rank allowed on him, which isn't necessarily the highest rank you have learned.
---
Man none is actually saying you need BIS or gtfo LOL
---
Everyone and their purple friend should be watching.
---
You know that you havent a gun pointed when you clicked the Warrior class right?
---
I know how Classic is that's why I choose Mage, Easy Life bro. 
---
15 years shaman, I've already felt the struggle, not this time tho. 
---
And yes, never farmed. Not even the Essence of my Archmage.
---
When you spend 1h inside ZF for 50g you can spend 10min flippin items
---
Wtf
---
You force it with faction queues.
---
The guy you're responding to was incorrect because he said all servers, but it is the case that Pvp servers are horde favored. According to the link you provided it's 57/43 in favor of horde. Not quite 60/40, people are exaggerating there, but the skew does exist.
---
Ohhh yeah good deal. What level are you? It’s not bad in pvp, as a warrior rogues with riposte is op lol! Unless I get disarm off first :) can’t go wrong with combat spec
---
Activision is too cheap to spend money on a totally new Classic+ so I will pretend that's not an option.
---
I won't subscribe to Classic+ with TBC with no changes to TBC.  They can use the same zones without flying. Portals can be used in locations where flying mounts were formerly needed. Arenas have to go (wow is a terrible e-sport product). PVP gear with resilience has to go. LFG has to go. Summoning stones have to go. Shattrath has to become a PVP location like Gadgetzhan. No portals in Shattrath.  Etc.... Although the subsequent expansions were far worse, TBC has a lot to do or let's just forget about TBC and do FRESH for Classic.
---
The problem is it's quite true in terms of being 60 and acquiring at least pre-bis if not raiding gear. Almost no one even has the CHANCE to get a complete set much less enjoy it. I'm a nolifer who has almost all tier one but that's only because I got lucky and also spent 25+ days played.
---
I can't imagine the average casual player getting even full pre-bis before Christmas. I mean just think of how many hours it takes just getting HoJ. Or Rend swords, or reed, etc. The average player has to come home from work spend an hour at best getting a group and flying everyone to brm or dm, maybe die a couple of times getting into the dungeon because it's peak hours, and then hopefully do one run before people leave. At this rate, an average casual player can take a month to get their HoJ if they're lucky.
---
I know the response to this is just join a guild that does these runs. Well baed on the Q3 conference call, there''s likely been MILLIONS of players who joined Classic. What percentage of them are in guilds actively running people through dungeons for pre-bis outside of maybe a few peak hours a day at best?
---
I think Blizzard should slow it down so that at least the top 10% of hardcore players like myself have at least 75% of their best gear before even thinking about moving on. Let us actually exhaust and enjoy the current gear levels for before we rush forward. This is Classic, we need time to slow down and smell the roses. I like investing time in and then slow it down and relax in a bit before the next grind (PvP ranking) starts. The people who complain about not enough content will not leave Classic for good. I mean, they waited 13 years for this game, they'll come back whenever the next phase hits. But let us slow down a bit and enjoy the journey. And I say this as a nolifer who has played way more of this game than almost anyone here with a job/school.
---
Cus only beta pussies transfer lol
---
&gt; why more people don't specify whether they're looking for ranged or melee to avoid wasting their time as well as the time of people who want to join because DPS needs to be filled 
---
Its a common tactic to essentially reserve items, but without getting the stigma of reserving.
---
Sappers are instant and bombs are cast is my understanding. You should double check but you were asking for a reason and I believe that’s it.
---
I just don’t see that happening.. at least on my server. 
---
There doesn’t seem to be any sort of faction-comradery 😢

You can get a warlock friend to banish a high level demon, and you can just attack it. Or go to Blasted Lands and hit a  [Servants of Allistarj](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=7670) until they become "immune", now you can go auto attack and go semi afk.

---
Uhh that data isnt right lol
---
Now you get to 10v1 people. Crybaby pussy lol
---
Druid dps is probably the least capable spec in either case. Going balance for the crit bonus is maybe ok but you are going to run out of mana quickly after doing mediocre damage. 
---
Feral dps, i hear you can sorta compete with other classes if you farm the manual crowd pummeler drop gnomeregan for hours before each raid and take 16+ of them with you to use for bosses for the attack speed boost.
---
The pulse time is like, longer than the duration of the fear lol
---
Scholo for example
---
They bring decurse for the 75% healing debuff
---
Food, water, makes the group go faster because people are less hesitant to drink. 
---
Sheeps
---
Counterspell for casters 
---
Big aoe damage for the various tight packs of non elites (I've done as much as 3.4k dps on those zombies next to lore keeper)
---
Tbh, I avoid rediculous res requests, it's a red flag. If I had a group where someone wanted to res something reasonable, like first orb for tank or enchanter with ubrs keys gets green, I'd prob just pst people the condition before inviting them.    
---
"First orb res for tank, that cool" /inv
---
Totally with you!  I’m very glad to not be on a PvP server.  I’ve had some concerns about missing out, but I 100% know that my current arrangement for the game would not have made PvP fun in any way, shape, or form.
---
In theory maybe,  but in practice they are the guys showing up in dungeons without any water/food, who spam connection and demand the healer heals them. A good lock is nice in a group but it's by far the hardest to find. Most of the time you'll get the lock noob who dies in one hit after spamming connection and ends up using the wand for the rest of the dungeon because he is always oom and doesn't understand the concept of water.
---
I personally will not run any dungeon if they’re trying to reserve stuff. 
---
Why should I commit my time tanking for them to get exclusive dibs on the good items. 
---
This “X reserved” meta needs to get outta here.
---
Classic and vanilla are different. This is based on an entirely new infrastructure. They are almost nothing alike.
---
If you shuffle letters in the word tauren you can get nature
---
Make your own group. This is a completely avoidable issue.
---
At your level and onward, you're pretty much going to be doing every single quest available to you anyway just to level at all.
---
A lot of people are. And a lot more people are saying "You can wear the same gear I can, so you can't come to this group" Which is why so many warriors and paladins only bring mages, warlocks, and healers to their dungeons. 
---
So yes, a lot of people are saying this. I have seen people get kicked from a group because they needed an item that was a very obvious upgrade but it wasn't a best in slot item, despite nobody else needing it.
---
&gt;	natures swiftness isn't on the GCD, but if GCD is active, NS will go and HT will fail to cast, 
---
This might be the issue. Cast sequence shouldn’t be needed. Just spam the button until the spell goes off.
---
Like 6 weeks ago one of our guys handed in ony head pre our guild heading to kill rag.  He got spammed by you shit heads for over an hour, every hateful thing you can imagine.  Apparently we're all supposed to know and care about your raid schedule.
---
Layers have been gone. Unless you're still on one of the incredibly high pop servers, you haven't had layers for months.
---
Yeah, there is one like that in Silverpine, I remember it. Although in theory you can't complain about it, because some fishing schools are supposed to be fishable only with Water Walking (there are several like that in Ashara). Considering the fact this school in particular is next to the hidden shaman quest spot, it's probably there on purpose.
---
This wouldn't work, it would kill wpvp completely.  Every wpvp group/raid on BOTH sides would carry 1-2 lowbies as "protection", so they can't be attacked without the other side getting DHKs.  This would mean no one would want to engage the other faction because it would mean literally never getting rank.
---
Sweden would be retribution paladin
---
completely useless
---
if I would want to buy gold I wouldnt do it in those channels
---
I'd stay w/axe and just get Gatorbite next.
---
CEPGP.
---
Facts get downvoted man can't be introducing that kind of stuff into the baseless speculation.
---
I'll actually tank lower lvl stuff for people on one condition that they pass on all green boes minus the obvious stuff like orbs. 95% of people just want some boss loot or quest done. So I just Kirby S U C C all the greens, have never had an issue doing this either.
---
To be fair a LOT of people on the EU servers ask "from?" at the start of a dungeon, because we're almost always from different countries
---
Where ya doing? See you’re flying through Virginia
---
Get your shit together, Arcunen.
---
thanks but im not even talking about backing up/rotating the camera, i specifically want to increase the position of the camera on the y axis, making it taller
---
Imagine having your own private g6
---
At some point I was putting people who reserve loots on my ignore list but realized the list is far too short for that.
---
Now I make sure to never join such groups and I'll stop playing and  Hearthstone if a I see the group leader switch to master loot at any time. People who reserve stuff are ninja loots in disguise and I'll never ever run with them.
---
But your raid rotation is just going to be pressing Shadow Bolt.
---
I know this is gonna be heretical, but for all the buttons and class fantasy Classic has, the classes themselves are actually kinda garbage to play. Most ranged dps use one ability in MC. The melee use like 2-3. Healing has been kinda fun, but that's more due to downranking than having a lot of different buttons to press. When I compare Frost Mage rn, which is Frostbolt spam for 99% of bosses, to Frost Mage even in Legion, which involved trying to maximize shatter damage with big flurries into icicles, having huge burn phases by timing Icy Veins with Time Warp and specific trinket cds, and wayyy more mechanics that need to be ice blocked to prevent wipes... It's not even a contest which one is more fun and skill testing.
---
I’m feeling a little burned out as well, albeit for a different reason. I really enjoy raiding, but currently there’s too little of it to really be interesting.
---
Doing MC/Ony once a week, gets old.. fast.
---
I can’t wait for phase 3, battlegrounds &amp; Blackwing Lair, finally you have some goals to work towards.
---
Right now I’m just waiting for one of only a handfull of items I can actually use to drop.
---
Not sure why people rolled pvp. Small scale pvp is mostly low hp ganks, corpse camping and being trolled by higher levels. Large scale pvp is lagging to the point of near server crash
---
I'm seeing actual 0 reason to go for that. I'll wait for WSG
---
Great casual raid system and very simple. Some prefer to have less loot box type system and have rewards better tied to their effort
---
You know, I actually think it's good for people to be up-front about what they want out of a dungeon.  Eliminating overlap makes the dungeon running more efficient for everyone.
---
Except that the first claim is fully supported and anyone who's spent any time here knows that, whereas yours is just you trying to be edgy saying something you and everyone else knows isn't true.
---
Fuck you and everyone who is anything like you. Blocked.
---
Bro we're over 2 months in, work and school isn't why you aren't 60 yet. My buddy works 16 hour days, has two kids and was 60 3 weeks ago.
---
herod horde here
---
rerolled horde whitemane
---
nobody to gank
---
Apparently fine means it's okay to bring a mage who only attacks half of the fight... That's literally how bad Boomkin DPS is. It's half of a mage... That's not fine.
---
Neckbeard alert 🚨
---
There's nothing in strat live for tanks. They have no reason to tank that dungeon. That's why they reserve orbs.
---
DANSK?
---
Except in wow you can't roll both factions on a pvp server.
---
Yeah spam max level holy nova. Make sure to use as much +dmg gear that you have (not healing!) I also use rank 3 if my mana is low. Alternate between power infusion and inner focus to learn the pulls
---
Always have inner fire and power word shield on and ALWAYS be 100% mana when you pull
---
Lordy-be its also a ton shorter.
---
??? What are you talking about? You obviously have no clue what this post is about.
---
/stopcasting 
---
/castsequence Natures Swiftness, Healing Touch
---
I have this under my macro now and when I click it it doesn't do anything ????
---
So find 10 Alliance and run around with them, or avoid the groups that are PvPing?
---
Some of the most fun I've ever had in an MMO was I'm Vanilla in EPL pre 60 PvPing with a mix of 50-60s in large packs.
---
Your comment just screams victim bias and sounds like someone whining for the sake of whining.
---
May I suggest a PvE server?
---
Ps, nobody cares
---
I hope this happens. I called out for help in EPL when alliance were camping the FP and all I got was snarky whispers from fellow horde saying "git gud".... how is 1 person supposed to overcome 8 alliance?
---
Are you being serious? 
---
Gtfo if so.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that the weakness of class design is exacerbated in raids.
---
All I read was.
---
"I'm a MEGA-casual who rolled on a PvP server and am now complaining that PvP is soon to be a plenty on my PvP server that I rolled on for PvP"
---
Being 60 2+ months into classic isn't that unreasonable.
---
on EU servers everyone always wants to know where you're from. It's annoying. Like I don't wanna tell you that, I don't even know you.
---
/r/comedyheaven
---
You can be CARRIED through mc below 60. You cannot have a full raid of 55s and clear mc.
---
DAE WEED LMAO AHAAAA
---
Nobody *needs* full prebis. Nobody needs a HOJ, SGC, or a Briarwood Reed. The idea that all people need to spend hours grinding the same dungeon hundreds of times so they can all have an identical set of extraordinarily rare drops is ludicrous. 
---
Full prebis is a time sink. It's not necessary for progressing in the game. The only function prebis serves is showing how much time the player has invested into their character. For players who are concerned with function over form, It only takes a few hours of running dungeons and completing quests at lvl 60 to assemble a set of dungeon blues that falls short of full prebis, but is still perfectly adequate for performing well while downing current content.
---
Imo it makes some sense for tanks.  Tanking in classic is a pretty awful experience with most groups, tanks get geared extremely quickly so they don't need gear from dungeons, they're garbage at soloing world content and wpvp so they need some way to make gold, their gear costs the most to repair, they're going to die more than anyone else in the run, and they have a very hard time finding raid spots because you need so few of them.  
---
Tanks really don't have much going for them and asking them to tank a dungeon for you with nothing reserved is essentially asking "hey, do you want to do this content you don't get anything from, that isn't very enjoyable, and that will likely take 1-2 hours?  I really need it.  What if I gave you 5g?"
---
Aside from gold-value drops, I think reserving gear is a pretty solid way of eliminating overlap.  If only one person in the party needs each individual chase item, then it becomes a question of whether it drops rather than whether it drops *and* whether you win the roll.
---
Same for me, maybe like 6 weeks instead of a month, though. I didn't nolife it, but wow classic is the only game I play and I focused 100% on one character with no alts. It takes a bit of effort and focus, but it's nothing crazy.
---
prevent it from inseminating a partner and thus producing offspring
---
Mages don't frosbolt spam in dungeons though, not if they're decent players.
---
Want to get into wow first time. Wondering what class and race for pve  but mostly pvp?
---
First of all dont worry at all. I was like you and worried a lot, but MC/ony is by far the easiest raid content ever. Classic launched with reworked items and talents which nerf the content a looooooot. I played in a very good TBC/WotLK guild as a dps so I was an experienced raider, but no heal or classic knowledge.
---
Boss tactics are really simple, and your raid leader will probably go over them in thirty seconds before he pulls. Reading them superficially once is enough.
---
For addons you need DBM to show you some timers and some addon that shows incoming heals so you dont overlap heals with other healers and overheal. I dont know if standard Blizz frames do this, but addons look nicer anyway.
---
The way I heal is basically you have like two ranks of Flash Heal, a couple of ranks of normal speed heal and the Prayer of Healing. You just spam the right size Flash Heal like 80% of the time, when you get low mana use the slower heals, when its efficient to do so (4+ people in your group damaged) use the prayer. Dont use PWS unless the tank asks for it at the pull or if you think the tank is about to die and you need to do something right now.
---
What consumables to take: I would take mana potions, dark/demonic runes, nightfin soup and a couple of greater fire res pots (one to drink before Rag if your guild wants you to - we dont rquire it) and the restorative potion (this one I would take just in case, we dont use them). If you use a flask people will think you are stupid.
---
And I recommend talking to your friends in the guild. Ask them what they want from you and ask for advice if you think you need it.
---
How is someone saying an item is on res before the dungeon even starts a ninja in disguise?
---
.... I’m aware that not everything sells on the AH thanks, but those prices are consistent with items a few levels above and below, which means that to some degree the market is somewhere around there. The enchanter angle kinda makes sense.
---
Depends on major and what stage of college you are at.
---
What? Are you really asking this? The reason is very obvious. People don't want all the hardcore ganking to be going on while they're still leveling up.
---
Also, a lot of concern isn't really for the specific things that are rolling out too soon it's just an overall concern that this whole thing is going to move too fast.
---
After the classic phases are over, there's no more classic, it's gone again, maybe for another 15 years, maybe forever this time.
---
Got side tracked with fishing, level 25 warrior with 300g worth of free action potions.  Then I just sat at SM  and am now 38.

More damage, more area
---
Man you have shitty luck, orbs drop at least once a run most of the time and sometimes multiple per run
---
you get a zip file with a folder inside
---
extract the zip file to &lt;WoW-folder&gt;/_classic_/Interface/AddOns so that the TrinketMenu folder is in that folder
---
ie. D:\Games\World of Warcraft\\\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\TrinketMenu
---
Remember you can use fear beast on Druids when they are in animal form.
---
racial skills obviously. same reason there are less horde on pvp servers and less dwarf rogues.
---
I've been waiting for this post since I started following wow classic reddit! What an awesome piece this was/is.
---
Its allowed in open world, but not in dungeons.
---
sure it does, you know how easily I found the dude in the very publically available mage discord?l
---
and if the ID is all that mattered, he wouldnt have censored the names to begin with
---
There's a huge difference between the loot dropping or the loot getting funneled to one person. It has to do with the perception of fairness, is it fair that no tanking gear dropped? Yes. Is it fair that one player gets funneled loot? Probably not.
---
It seems like you and I cannot agree on anything
---
if you got the people - why the fuck not? seems like a smart way of leveling
---
Throwback to Athene

I think this is alliance on Flamelash EU

I think prices have dropped in the past 2 weeks as more and more people are hitting 60, but the server is still layered so I expect prices to rise.
---
No he’s the ‘kin’ of a boomer which would make him like Gen-X
---
Exactly this
---
In a raid with other priests who only flash heal and chug consumes. I’m behind on the healing meters. Should I be doing the same or are they just padding the meters?
---
in what world is this an exploit?
---
I suppose you're right, hopefully he doesn't mind
---
not against the rules, stay mad
---
"Exploiting"
---
"Against the rules"
---
So you don't know if it is or isn't...
---
IM MALDING !!! STOP HIM
---
Personally I've hated the "one button" argument as a downside for endgame. What's so interesting about rotating through 3-5 abilities, especially when you get "Use Stormstrike NOW BABY!" across your screen? 
---
I choose to see it as shadowbolt/frostbolt simply being the most efficient spells in the caster kit to do stationary damage with. It's your big bolt spell why wouldn't it be? 
---
Locks add timing of their life taps (while  moving, trying to get 3+ in a row to trigger 5 sec Mana Regen) as well as when to throw on corruption adds to the little nuances of raiding.
---
except I still see it in my chat box
---
In the case of Balance druids though, all ranks of Starfire have 100% spell power scaling. That's why phase 1-2 balance druids are stacking Arcane Wrath gear: Rank 1 does loads of damage and you never go OOM.
---
Here before the Twitch spergs
---
stone cold gold. It's time to shave it. Stay mad reddit.
---
No they don't. If you put a player cap so low that the server can support it without layering and then you add layers you're not accomplishing anything. The layers are there BECAUSE the server without layers has to have a far smaller player cap to keep running.
---
Let him have fun till monday
---
Phase 2 isn't going to bring about PvP.  It's going to bring about harassment, griefing, bullying.  What I do now and what I've done since I hit 60 is PvP.  Phase 2 is not that, and it's going to outright kill most of the PvP servers.
---
Because when I was younger I liked the looks of playing a Tauren, and now me and my friends play Horde "like in the good old days".
---
I must say I kinda prefer the Alliance now, but that's more because the weird armor stretching and overall ridiculous looks of the Horde have started to annoy me a lot more.
---
&gt; Blizzard is 99% responsible, they could've done plenty of things to promote (or enforce) faction balance. Instead they've completely ignored the problem and actively made it worse.
---
And exactly what things are these?
---
I think this problem is not so easily solvable.
---
you need your back up tho 
---
right now I'm 6piece SC with devilsaur 
---
once i replace a piece of SC tho I'll have to switch to my mask, cadav chest or whatever. 
---
it is so good tho, the 6 piece bonus. procs so often
---
Play a different game
---
&gt; This “X reserved” meta needs to get outta here.
---
as well as tanks asking 50g+blue and greens to tank ubrs. Lmao a cancer joke tank mains are.
---
You don't use Heroic Strike while leveling. Spaming Sunder for more White DMG and Overpower procs is more worth it imo. I think there was some theorycrafting about it in the warrior dc
---
Here's how they did it on BC release  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otSAw\_8lPlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otSAw_8lPlQ)
---
It's not exploiting elites, he's using tagging exactly the way it's built to work in a creative way by using his massive influence in the wow community.
---
I know what happened, just thought its interesting enough to share
---
Zug Zug!
---
STOP POKING MEEE!!!
---
Need I say more?
---
I'm surprised anyone can even play alliance tbh.
---
If I couldn't play horde I honestly wouldn't even play the game. Weird I know. But it's not an exaggeration.
---
It’s obvious this is only allowed to happen because of asmons relationship with the lgbtq community.  Relish in his achievement and bow before his greatness. #asmon2028
---
&gt; This kind of reasoning is so stupid from a sociological viewpoint. Do you really think behaviors aren't predictable and can't be accounted for?
---
Yes, they are predictable. We've seen pvp servers become faction-imbalanced since server transfers were introduced in Vanilla.
---
How you are going to change player behaviors without changing the game?
---
It shouldn't have a massive effect.
---
Who said anything about equal rewards? The whole bloody *point* of resilience was to make competitive PvP gear that wouldn't make you any better at raiding. It wasn't perfect but it was a step in the right direction.
---
PvP and PvE are fundamentally different activities. There's enough overlap between the two that a lot of people enjoy both to some degree, but most are going to enjoy one of them more - and most of those are going to resent being made to do the one in order to progress and remain competitive at the other. Especially when the particular type of the one they're being made to do exists at the extreme end of the spectrum from their preference. Which is entirely reasonable given, again, they are *fundamentally different activities.*
---
There's nothing wrong with acknowledging that and trying to figure out a way to satisfy both crowds without taking anything significant away from either (except for raiders who qq because they can't just waltz into BGs and effortlessly own everyone there) rather than condescendingly telling a substantial portion of your player base to suck it up or fuck off like you've done above.
---
Either way you do layers there are implementations that work and some that don't. You can implement layers as a % in a way that eases load
---
Is amount healed part of the criteria used by your guild/group to distribute loot? If not then don't worry too much about it.
---
Yeah that's pretty standard. 5 classes, each one meets for 3 hours total per week
---
Social aspect, friends, healers, that one well performing and brain-equipped DPS from that one instance 7 levels ago?
---
And Starfire (being a 3.5 second cast at all ranks) has 100% spell power scaling for all ranks, making down ranking very effective.  
---
Phase 1/2 balance druid? Stack Arcane wrath gear. Spam max rank till you get low mana and are out of top ups, spam rank 1. All fights end before you go OOM unless you don't know to do this\^\^.
---
Spamming sunder to fish for OP procs? That seems like a really tedious way to play.
---
I blame my bad posture on 15 years of playing horde
---
This is how Athene got one of the first leveling-records
---
do you strafe and do you have an autoshot swing timer?
---
Shoot is a .5 second cast (iirc) and your bow speed is your weapon's cooldown  
---
you can shoot in a 180\* (?) cone in front of you  
---
so u can strafe then turn a few degrees inward for .5 sec then keep strafing
---
but % of allowed players becomes greater than 100% of baseline when you add them
---
Just buy swimming potions.
---
When the seed kicks in
---
&gt;I understand why guilds would force optimal builds. It's not because they want to clear MC in less than 2h, it's because they want to clear MC at all.
---
I left my guild cause they only wanted me as full resto. I'm feral/resto hybrid and can still heal mc pugs no problem. Last week we did 8/10 and stopped just cause we didn't had dousers. Meanwhile, my old guild that didn't even had 40 people to raid lost a capable heal for raids and tank for dungeons cause their obsession with optimals. You don't need to have the best to clear content when a hastily formed pug can do it fine.
---
Absolutely buy that set. You will have it for a very long time. Theres not a ton of dps warrior upgrades in MC besides weapons/rings and a couple other slots. And 93g is a steal. I bought the mats from a guildie and less than market value and it was about 100g to craft both.
---
Pretty much my thoughts but I'm on Skeram Horde. I'm gonna make the jump to heart seeker most likely just because I chose a PvP server, not PvE.
---
If they do this, retail will definitely die. It wont happen
---
I've already alerted the FBI, expect him to be in jail by the end of the day. They take this matter very seriously!
---
Are you.... seeing your reflection on your phone?
---
sheep see and sheep do. way to go sheep. Clap
---
This should be okay and everyone who can do it - gather a raid group and farm elites with it, should go ahead and do that. The time spent on mob in man-hours is nothing crazy - 40 people killing the mob in 2 seconds results in 80 seconds spent for 600 exp, teamwork. Just gather the group who is willing to spend time on you 4Head
---
Its entirely possible you keep that set until BWL
---
is exploiting your feefees against the rules?
---
MALD
---
Ain't no way you're getting a high rank with that schedule
---
Here come the boyssss. Haha laughed at that.
---
Holy shit man. That sucks. I can’t imagine what I’d do if they outright banned me for that long.
---
And for ban to be upheld after appeal?? 
---
Blizz algorithm needs a serious tweak. I read the same shit about people travelling oversees - hit with instant bottling bans. 
---
Even tho it says they investigate, clearly they dont, because long time customers getting banned simply for travelling isn’t right.
---
That sucks, but..
---
Go outside. Your life isn't over, stop acting like it is.
---
What does  **"Use of Bots or Third-Party Automation Software"** have to do with being at a different location/ip? Or you mean they suspect u you for external leveling services who use bots, because u were on a different ip? i dont get it
---
I can't decide if this is hilarious or just weird.
---
i wouldn't call 7pm normal, most guilds raid at 8:30 or 9 to like 11:30/12
---
Yes, but is a bit tough for a mage, just check on youtube
---
Should have never botted bro.
---
Not sure what you mean. There's a queue, you can't go above max server size
---
Unless you're going to respec weekly between PvP and raiding it should.
---
My guild creates a BiS list and then takes feedback from each class until we all agree on it. When an item drops everyone for who it is BiS rolls on it. When someone wins a BiS item they cannot roll on other BiS items that week until everyone in their class also gets one.
---
On top of that we do loot council for a select few items (Perdition's blade, Benediction etc.) for all who it is BiS for and is judged on benefit for the raid, performance, and guild contribution.
---
Non BiS are free rolls for everyone who can use it as an upgrade, and does not lock you out from BiS.
---
Seems like the best of both worlds for me.
---
My only question is when i do this by myself with one guy it doesnt work.  So if theres a raid of people it does?
---
So dang excited. Good thing I play a lot at 5am when there isn't a ton of competition.
---
i dont think ive played classic wow sober
---
Keep yer feet on the ground!
---
I didn’t man. Honestly I never in my life have. I truly don’t believe a human looked into this, because if they did, there’s simply no way the ban would be upheld after appeal.
---
It's doable in phase 2, but will be difficult. 
---
When battlegrounds come in phase 3 it will be very achievable. You could wait until then.  You'll have many more options then.
---
Pretty much the same as multiboxing, if you got the means and resources to do it - go ahead.
---
For sure, but ive also met loads of hunters who multo shot before o have a sunder on target no. 4.. Good hunter is great, especially if they use frost trap properly to protect the healer, but theyre few and far between.
---
Thats not a lower case name. Thats iater iip iater iai iegacy iayer ieo iea iei iolbbq
---
See the issue? Theyre trash.
---
And now you have 5G. Which, depending on various factors is far quicker than the landline options available
---
Wish List seems to not be very commonplace
---
Everyone puts their name in the google doc with their 'reserved' drop
---
Item drops with reserved names: only they may roll  
---
Item drops with no reserve: free roll  
---
Set Piece drops with no reserve: +1 system for set gear only
---
Go do dungeons if red man is too scary
---
I utilize Suicide Kings for my guild, and only for class set items. Misc gear (trinkets, rings, weapons) are all rolled off based on a semi council discussions.
---
On set gear, everyone knows their place in the list, when they can potentially grab a tier piece. Trickle down items happen of course because more geared players pass on gear they have or don't necessarily need. The top spots usually hold out for their T2 helm/pants but because of the trickle down effect, it allows an even spread of gear to the rest of the people in their class.
---
The weapons are open discussion on who can best utilize them, and I give my guild a voice on what items are best for who. It lets everyone feel involved, and because of the even spread of gear, we've had nearly zero issues with jealousy or being upset about who gets what. The SK list removes every single bit of subjective decision making. You WILL get gear, and if you don't get a piece of gear in a weeks worth of raiding you know it's not because of some "favoritism".
---
I've never guild lead or raid lead before, and I barely ever raided when I played wow. I was all pvp in TBC and WOTLK. This system alleviates a lot of the stress I would likely feel in running a loot council. DKP and LC to me seems like it would force the guild into acting like a hardcore progression guild. We are all in this to pvp again and just clear raids for the gear to do that. It's been super fun doing raids I never got to do when I was 12, but it's really not that hard. Even as someone who hasn't touched the game since WOTLK, we are 10/10, 1/1 and oneshotting bosses 3 weeks into us doing all guild runs. I don't think it's necessary for us to implement those hardcore systems, it would make things way more serious than they need to be.
---
This song convinced me to get tickets for Avenue Q. I thought the video was better. There are some amazing old WOW videos on Youtube.
---
i know, the "for some reason" was sarcastic. I thought my mage flair would make that obvious :P
---
Because removing the element of danger makes the world boring
---
true enough
---
True, but I’m willing to bet it’s the more dedicated players often running those raids.
---
I’m still very excited to get into my first Classic raid.  I’m so hyped!  (Especially since pressure should be lower with other people having more gear to carry me)
---
A little bit off topic but what is a normal tg for crafting both those items? Does it make sense to farm or buy the mats instead of buying the items.
---
You can set a timer for the auto shoot ?
---
This is wrong. Ranged attacks do not glance. Also, special/ability attacks (even melee) do not glance. Glancing blows only apply to melee auto attacks. Ranged attacks also cannot be blocked.
---
Oh for sure, I just meant it in response to the faceroll comment above. A "rotation" against some bosses can consist of just frostbolt over and over, at least in terms of mana efficiency. I actually think mages have one of the most varied toolkits available to them, it's just up to the player to use them or not as they see fit.
---
you should say that to your guildies / online friends see how it goes over.
---
So they can join the favored 80/20 horde servers
---
You ok bro?
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;PvE
---
People don't want to share loot yes. That's not the same thing.
---
&gt; I have seen people get kicked from a group because they needed an item that was a very obvious upgrade but it wasn't a best in slot item, despite nobody else needing it. 
---
I've heard about maybe 2 cases of this ever happening, and I'm pretty sure both was just a bad excuse to kick a bad player.
---
I stand corrected only melee having glancing blows. But i think armor is still a factor for hunters.
---
Short answer: armor. raid bosses have 40.5% armor
---
Join a fun pserver for the time being to get your wow fix. Something with an instant level boost or just a pvp server if you really wanna play that bad.
---
There’s probably no way you’ll be unbanned before the 6 months though.
---
why do people circle jerk to this guy though
---
A bit more, actually.  Curse of shadows/Elements to make the other casters love you, Life Tap to laugh as the healers panic and the utility stones/summons which make the warlock an essential raid bitch.
---
:D happy hunting
---
I’m buying the mats for sure. The asking price for the items themselves together would be an extra 100g.
---
Not an exploit. But im curious how fast he could lvl from 1-60 if he gets mob tagged like that.
---
He's not though. It's different.
---
If you're trying to convince me you're right, you haven't. I don't share your opinion and I don't have the same experiences. Have a good day.
---
most tanks are actually fury warrios and wont take rogues, since they need most of the gear a rogue wants. I think mages are better than rogues for almost all situations. But its close, rogues do really good damage. Too bad for them that most of their pre bis is the same was for fury warriors.
---
Still have the box in my shelf, in fact!
---
Oh right I forgot, good catch :)
---
What the fuck?
---
They need to make transfers to only heartseeker and horde only.
---
The problem was that census addons (which were messy due to layering) were saying the server strongly slanted horde, making a ton of the casual allies panic and flip on over to Heartseeker. So now there is a massive disparity that’s only really held back by a coalition of several hardcore ally guilds. 
---
Transfer round 2 will just kill the server completely at this point.
---
Then you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Bdo is strictly a pvp game. It is the only point for the game aside from just mindlessly grinding mobs.
---
You're*
---
I wholeheartedly agree Mr. Stivdiller
---
You cant have an opinion mate you're 60 thats just toxic, blocked.
---
I’m not the one going Gumby spine on three plate my guy
---
me too. Love it, can't live without it. great for planning how long to afk :P
---
Well in classic and for much of wow they have massively over powered racials, that is a huge part of the draw in classic, especially on PVP servers.
---
The honor doesn't make any difference to me, but if I knew the phases were going to be coming so quickly, I might have spent less trying to get phase 1 BiS items. I've only killed Ragnaros like 4 times and now it's phase 2 already.
---
Taking initiative on groups does wonders.  I tank, so I’m heavily biased, but just doing the social legwork is more than most are willing to do.
---
Hunters and Mages fulfil the role of being easy to play for newbies whilst being versatile in both PVE and PVP.
---
Hahahaha, yeah I was half joking when I wrote the title. I did melee that dude for 1k tho.
---
The price of shit doesn’t matter. If certain things are out of line you go farm those things and buy whatever you want.
---
Was about to say this
---
It procs off the application of a dot but doesn't proc when a dot ticks, unless they changed it big time. I'm pretty sure it's junk at 60, might be worth for 49 twink.
---
Welcome to modern wow. Something you don't like = they're a ninja
---
A slow tank is so much worse than a ninjapulling dps imo. I want runs to be as fast as possible. I dont want to play like those people who think wow is supposed to be slow.
---
Thank you. Informative indeed.  I don't even know what a flask is right now lol. I understand there powerful 2 hour buffs? 
---
 We're only doing Ony. MC is in Friday nights and I wasn't quite ready. 
---
 I use heal-bot but I believe I need another add-on to see incoming heals. 
---
 With DBM does it come set up? Lol I downloaded weak auras and had to delete it cause I have no idea how to use it and it fucked my my UI so the point I couldn't see my character but just a giant horse symbol from my mount lol
---
Have a look at Danish players in professional League of Legends too, it's nuts.
---
No he's correct, the spell power is so so so much better pvp and pve.
---
The game has barely even been out "months"
---
you *don't have* 100% detection rate anyway, I have seen dozens of people running in front of me that Spy didn't register until I moused over them...
---
One of my guildies pulled a recipe: greater arcane elixir from a thorium lockbox last night
---
If you don't like it, then roll your own tank. It's supply and demand. Tanks can res an item because they're in high demand, if you don't like it then you can waste hours trying to find someone who will do it for free.
---
What? I don't follow
---
You ought to ask your buddy if he uses third party things, since you were on his network
---
That would be fantastic and I would like it so much. Also, being able to heal them if not having initiated combat with them of course (to protect them from scummy player of my own faction that dare attack  a fellow druid).
---
Yes, you can easily work a full time job and get to Rank 11. Probably not until BG's though.
---
Shan was the last class they finished right?
---
Does it though? In the amount of time they spend trying to fill groups due to reserving something, they may have been able to run it more times. Even if people are competing for loot, more chances to roll are better.
---
Can you expand on this "boomer" thing a bit more?
---
Everytime I see a new term like this I feel like I've been living under a rock. What people refer to when they tell you're a "boomer"?
---
I just wrote out the lower case names. Why would you want to be called iater instead of Later, or even later?
---
"It doesn't matter that I literally can't use your class equipment. I'm vendoring it. And no I don't have enchanting for sharding."
---
Yeah, it really is a bad situation to be in for us. Me and my friends don’t wanna go to heartseeker cause it is so ally dominant. But if we stay here we are doomed like you said. AR we are definitely considering, but it is worrying that the population is so much smaller from what we’ve heard
---
It definitely is. It’s a key factor for grind consideration while leveling. Considering mana cost and downtime, I won’t even Aimed Shot if I know the mob is higher armor while leveling. E: leveling 51+ obviously, BM is king just to clarify haha
---
I try not to take it so serious, but it grates on you to go week after week not seeing a single usefull drop, or when it does.. I somehow manage to bid the same as someone else, and have to roll.
---
And I always loose rolls, like 99.9% of the time, if it’s for something useful.
---
Just getting into selling stuff on AH.  Is undercutting generally frowned upon or am I fine to just do it ?
---
In my book, if the boss dies, everything is fine.
---
every cheater that get's banned and decides to make a post about it claims innocence, prety sure their tools to detect that shit are solid
---
Just Do it
---
Sometimes dressed as Superman, always watching from the closet
---
I believe I said something like that the player does not have a 100% detection rate of the log.. meaning if a player is monitoring the combat log he wont have a 100% detection of enemy skill usage when Spy does
---
I played a blood elf when they were a thing because I wanted a Horde Paladin that stole his powers by force from a captive demigod.
---
I was an edgy teenager.
---
How about giving a little example of every loot system?
---
DBM does come set up. It plays some meme youtube video by default when doing ony so you probably want to disable that.
---
I think healbot comes with incoming heal feature by default. Not sure.
---
AoEing DPS will always pull threat, you just have to play around it. Ironically, the reality is that geared tanks often switch from prot to fury and even stop wearing their shield to generate more threat so they can keep up with geared DPS. End game tanks are more or less fury warriors in mostly DPS gear because they can't keep aggro otherwise.
---
I miss Devastate being a stacking effect instead of mere filler.
---
Look for someone advertising for a jump run. That kills Hydrospawn. Technically a jump run can be done with 1 tank and 1 healer but at the gear levels people have nowadays, it's a lot easier to bring along a DPS too.
---
Pineapple.
---
:(
---
"The world is only as big as your heart."

If a holy priest can do it a mage sure as hell can.

I dont know where the fuck y'all lived but where i grew up being heroic was always kind of the lame thing. Anti heroes and stuff like horde were always more popular. Maybe its an US thing? I dont know about the rest of europe of course so just anecdotal evidence but where i live nobody gave a fuck about super man but batman was always very popular. I also dont know anyone in real life that likes luke skywalker. Everyone prefers han solo (not counting the bad guys) luke skywalker was always seen as pretty lame. I dont know how he is percieved overseas. I still think luke is lame as fuck. Not in the bew trilogy, i dont like the movies but luke stopped being lame when he was old and had a beard instead of being that young blond kid.
---
Alts, alts, and more alts. I need to sign up for Alts Anonymous....
---
just make a new account, you don't even have to buy retail, you need just subscription to play classic.
---
In my server the legs themselves are 120 gold and the hands are 68 or so. Absolutely a steal.
---
Just ask to join for a single jump run. Lots of people run those for gold
---
&gt;You're going to be using it a LOT, so -20% rage cost on it makes sense.
---
Not only should you not use it a lot as other have said, the talent does not give -20% cost because you have to factor in the rage you pay by losing your next attack.
---
was this on herod??
---
last night someone left our vibe sesh in org saying "we are getting invaded by gnomes, follow me if you want to join"
---
Its actually really easy(I never done it but saw it in a video) u can stay on the upper part of the boss area and when he is near u go down and vise versa ,so he pingpongs. The edge where u jump up isnt high but he still goes all the way
---
No, everyone is the same. Right now you may be ok, but on the long term, sleeping 5/6 hours per night will absolutely destroy you, believe me
---
You dont know what the winning side is on their server
---
Well the humans in wow are fuckin beeftanks while the people playing wow are lard tanks so it's still fantasy
---
My guild is cool. I like em. But they have about 15 ppl they focus on gearing and progressing. I'm honestly not trying to bitch but it can only sound like that here. I feel like the majority of guilds just do not have players who can burn 10 min knocking a bitch of a quest out for you. I've gotten help twice, once because I made a guildy notice he is in the same zone and we both have the same quest. The other time was only cause he said he would help me if I did 3 elite quests for his alt. The third time I almost got help a guy borderline tried to make me farm nodes for which I cannot track while he played his main farming elsewhere. 
---
I buckled down and after Un goro i did flood and winterspring and wpl / epl. I'm now 58 and halfway to 59. Plenty of scholo n strat quests on me.  I can still visit burning steppes if it's worth the questing also. 
---
I finally have my devil set. Crafted the pants. Bought gloves for 30g. Can't complain atm. I'm aiming for scholo and strath runs today if anyone else is game.
---
aspect of cheetah.
---
single handedly wins the debate for me.
---
Anyone who willingly rolls a human in a video game is a boring person irl. There's not much else to it.
---
U can easily do it as mage solo when u use pingpong tactic
---
Ban that disgustingly toxic cheating turd already.
---
&gt;has nothing to add other than "haha u mad xd"
---
Do it. Someone complains to you, tell them to buy it and re-sell it.
---
This is precisely what my guild implemented. Still has don't small problems but people gonna loot drama somehow anyway.
---
Alot doesnt belong, are you new here or something? Or just use to seeing shit like this slide? 
---
Notice the sub has been deleted?   Hmm wonder why.....
---
Probably because it was hateful, harassment and old server drama that hallend weeks ago the admins dont give 2 flying fucks for neither do we.
---
I don't remember what level maraudon is, might be a little later in the 40's, but rotgrip drops a pretty alright 2h axe. Also if you're planning on doing dungeon cleave get ravager.

Gnome warrior has to be the absolute dumbest class/race combo in the game.  If gnomes can be warriors then tauren should be rogues

fyi, the 'first orb res' thing for strat live is to give it to the tank. There is 0 tank loot in strat live really.
---
While both having quite high skill ceilings. The good ol' easy to learn, hard to master
---
Sounds like everyone got them got them for cheap!  I paid 176 for the devilsaur, farmed my own rugged and paid 20g for them to be crafted...  bigglesworth two weeks ago
---
Alright. I never cared about CS much personally, but my 62 year old uncle who never played any games actively follows Astralis and he's generally following Scandinavians in the sports he follows, so I imagine he'd mention if there were some top Swedish teams too (which I know there are).
---
Again; my main thing, which I obviously didn't do very well, was to point out that it's not "ALWAYS". :)

This solved it for me ty

If you're Horde, I think Orgrimmar&gt;Un'goro is also cheaper as Org&gt;Gadgetzan+Gadgetzan&gt;Un'goro.

DKP. Loot Council is always corrupt, you just have to look in Ogrimmar and see all the officers and GMs wearing an impossible amount of MC/Ony gear.

I'm trying to farm forors and I can usually con a group of 4 people including me into east saying I'll let them have herbs and mining nodes in jump runs

---
Brings back memories when you entered capital with a DK for the first time - all the hate you got from guards.
---
The most common thing is for everyone to let the tank need the first one alone, and then round robin after that.
---
There is nowhere, that a conversation surrounding the exclusion of a protected class specifically because they are a member of that class should not be welcome.
---
Let it marinate.
---
I’m not putting you down bro, it was just a joke. More like “oh man wait until he realizes how long it *actually* does take. He’s not going to like it...”
---
It's the closest they'll feel to significant.
---
Kids a mad man, he did 50-55 in a day. That shit took me like 4 days. Once someone hits 58 we do scholo / strat quest runs and that usually dings them or gets them a couple bars away.
---
Lmao!!! I did this to you hahahahahah it worked!!
---
Wow... Very cool
---
all said and done its basically 29 sp less than staff of dominance - im just really not sure if that is actually better considering thats about 20 damage per sb.  its been proccing a lot, and it looks like the proc can crit. i totally see why people are saying its no good, but i think it may have its uses. either way, thanks everyone for responding - gonna test it out a bit more from here!
---
A far far higher % of the player base has killed ragnaros now than they did back in vanilla when honor came out. Thats why phases need to be a little faster. On whitemane there are about 100 guilds that have all content on farm, back in vanilla when bwl came out there were probably just a handful of guilds on a server that had even killed rag. Killing rag 4 times means you are cutting edge.  A large part of the player base isnt supposed to be cutting edge. Lotta people in classic seem to think they should have been able to experience all content before new content comes out. Should most people have cleared aq40 before naxx comes out?
---
I have no idea if OP is being honest or not, but why would you ever hear about someone being falsely banned for botting? It's not like someone has any recourse whatsoever and people on forums like these automatically assume OP is a liar.
---
If you find yourself thinking of giving it another chance you should spend some time finding a guild.   
---
\-My Horde toon is in a guild with 60s hosting dungeon farms for 40+.  
---
\-My Ally toon just found a guild with lots of activity of all level ranges.  
---
They def. exist. GL regardless.

also im playing a ret paladin mainly for pvp
---
Sunder is awful. I tried that out during the beta tests and even with 3 or 4 sunders on the target, I only gained a few points of extra damage. The mobs were usually at like 30% health by the time I even got that many stacks anyway. It wasn't "crazy dps gain" at all, not even close.

I just want my keyring.

Get that devil set, that's as cheap as it will probably ever be. By the time you get the rest of your BiS from dungeons you'll have a lot more gold. You are going to have to run 100's of dungeons if your raid really cares about BiS that much. 
---
I would definitely get your epic mount before your lionheart tho, the mount speed will save your life countless times in world pvp. I would also get engineering ASAP. Before P2 preferably. 
---
You also might want to have an honest conversation with your GM about temporarily leaving the guild for a while. Being the one guy in the hardcore raid who is still learning the content is going to leave a bad impression. It's going to take you weeks to get your BiS from dungeons, many of the pieces for warriors are single digit drop rates and are better than current raid loot. You don't need all those pieces to run MC tho, but you will be in a better spot if you're farming raids while also spending all your time in dungeons.

Oh wow, thanks for the info! So to clarify, I can do the gnomish engineering quest, learn all the recipes I want, drop engi, relevel, get to 225 and go click the book for goblin? I won't need to do any goblin quest? Or do I need to do the intro goblin quests AS WELL before dropping engi the first time then relevel it?
---
15-20$ to not have to not play wow for a few hours? sign me up!
---
I stopped playing my hunter due to the horrible pathing issues that blizzard don't even aknowledge.
---
P.S. They are also there for the mob as some pull you can see the npc following weird path to reach you and often nearly running in other pack (scholomance is a fantastic example of this)
---
Ya this aint the game you.
---
When someone MCs you can they blow your big CDs like a battle res or recklessness?
---
Is Xag Chad in horde?
---
It's going to be as fine as it can be. She's there for them and you are staying strong for her. That's what a partnership is all about. In spite of what's happened, you are both very lucky people.
---
Can we establish that I understand layering decreases server load? The question is whether multiple implementations of layering can be effective
---
Twinking is for people who are too bad to play max level pvp with more than 1 ability to press
---
With owlkin noises
---
And then there are the people who will respond to what you said with "but im enjoying the game and not rushing with some sort of spell cleave spam group". Ive done literally every quest in the game other than the other races starting zone quests and only did about 5 dungeon runs before hitting 60 and still got there with a full time job about 5-6 weeks after release.
---
I accept this challenge. Just more targets for me to kill
---
I play on 4g on my phone every night. This game uses hardly any data. They may be different clients but their data usage is about the same. Roughly 30mb in 8 hours. Varies depending on amount of people on screen, but usually 30mb ish
---
You will be missed, random internet WoW player!
---
Yea, you only want to sunder if you go over the 25 tactical mastery rage cap.  Either sit in zerker and WW&gt;Rend&gt;Sunder with dancing to OP, or sit in battle and OP&gt;Rend&gt;Sunder and dance to WW on cooldown.
---
If you have a nice 1h weapon too, sitting in defensive stance and doing Revenge &gt; Shield Block often works pretty well against any fast hitting orange mobs you encounter.  It is not unreasonable to be able to block 80% of a +2 fast hitting mob.
---
Also rend is 'snapshot' capable, so you can stack the damage of proc's like Crusader or Trinkets for as long as you can keep refreshing the last tick of rend for, but this also makes it snapshot sunder too.
---
I had another warrior whisper me asking me to tank. Seems like some are scared to even try. It's embarrassing. It's not super difficult. I'm new to the game and only caught a little shit in my first group from one guy.
---
O_o are you replying to the wrong post? Cause your reply makes 0 sense. I tell people what's most common, you go off on a tangent that makes no sense.
---
Ours lasted about a month, the innitial plan was to raid on our own, but after about a month we only had a handfull of lvl 60’s.
---
So we merged with another guild, and were big enough now to have 3 raid teams clearing MC/Ony every week.
---
If you leveled primarily through dungeons, you're usually fine to just start it up.  If you leveled primarily through questing, you'll want to set the guide 1-2 levels lower than what your character is already at and skip any turn-ins that the guide expects you to have.  After a level or two like that, it evens out and you're solidly on track.
---
Edit: probably set it 1-2 levels behind no matter what.  There will be quests that it expects you to have done that you won't have done and that might lock you out of a chain at some point.
---
I say 1-2 levels because some levels in the guide happen naturally and some happen by turning in 10-ish quests in the span of 10-15 mins.  Try to start at one of the levels that you have to work for and you'll be fine.
---
North The Mage posits that the thing people have been complaining about for the last week, unstable wpvp, is directly related to the thing people are now complaining about, free server transfers.
---
This....so much!
---
No one cares
---
And at least they're being upfront about it and not just ninja'ing it
---
He has a full time job and is in school. He was a weekend warrior getting all his leveling in Fri Nights, Saturdays and Sundays. He was easily clocking 30-40hrs of leveling between those 3 days each week. At 6-7 days played to hit 60 that's 4 weekends he would have needed. The kids a machine, he's always been an extremely efficient leveler.
---
A lot of 60s are playing alts by now because all there is left for them to do is raid which takes less than 4 hours a week to clear all current content. Anecdotally I see more people who are 60 by now than not.
---
At the end of the day though, any system that relies on rolling does nothing to reward attendance/performance, or really anything. It feels awful to be a top dps, putting in 10x the work of other players, and losing to someone who raid logs and is pulling bottom dps.
---
That’s rough, you should avoid toxic reserve stuff like that. Your time is just as valuable as theirs.
---
Your opinion is not completely unpopular on this note.
---
&gt; TLDR - Whats the best way to max threat generation as a paladin tank besides rolling a warrior
---
Roll a w... a druid.
---
Sorry, couldn't resist. Paladin tank are just not viable once you start to have the dps start gearing seriously. It's just bad design and god knows I wish it wasn't like that.
---
I think you're missing the point of friends in general. They're not there to be a burden on you, they're meant to be people in the world that you can count on, to help you with similar tasks you helped them on, and to be people to side with when the inevitable world pvp patch comes.
---
Tanks are a dime a dozen, value your time more.
---
Here I am on Grob having a great time because I knew RP-PVP would be pretty balanced.
---
Phase 3 🤣
---
It's a bug for something that barely anyone did because leveling professions was a pain in the ass. Not many people swapped between goblin and gnomish engineering because you lost all your recipes, and there actually was a fee for the membership.
---
But now that everyone knows everything the economy is a joke, I've got over 1k gold before even level 60. When I first played this originally I could barely afford my first mount, let alone the second. 
---
But live in your "tin-foil" bubble. I can tell from most of your other post your insensible and do pretty much nothing but whine.
---
flamestrike/ae being 'replacements' means you don't know  why people are using blizzard. They're making sure you can slow so the tank can kite. The tank cannot stand there taking huge amounts of damage forever, you need to slow them all.
---
I see it
---
How exactly does this work, you usually get lesser exp for higher mobs plus you get even less exp if someone else does all the damage to a mob. He should be getting next to 0 experience for killing these mobs.
---
Always loot council
---
I've read some of your responses in this thread and would like to clear up a few things...
---
Are you actually a tanking warrior that looking for a spot in an established raiding guild, not a fresh guild? And unable to run dungeons? And you want to have Corrupted Ashbringer, from Naxxrammas, reserved for yourself?
---
Sounds likely that your guild merged with another.
---
Well, they did ban that disabled guy that used his eyes to move around and play WoW for botting..
---
I think this highlights one of the aspects of early MMOs that really made them spectacular.  Abilities that give the player ways to come up with creative ways to approach encounters.  Problem was most of these were unintended, and it causes problems for developers when trying to create balance.  So they work diligently over the years to remove any possibility for players to play outside the rules.
---
“Who’s the tank?”
---
 We use an add on called cepgp. Get priority points for raid bosses/being on time etc.. points decay over time to prevent hoarding.
---
Bigger crits compared to a couple rage off your HS seems like a no brainer to me.
---
Can you make one for warriors aswell?
---
Because legitimately 2 minutes of research would let you know Rank 14 isnt a realistic goal for 99% of the no lifers, and casuals wont get anywhere near it
---
Fwiw I dont necessarily see the point of being an ass, but seriously people need to spend at least a cursory Google search to see about this stuff
---
Again, are you replying to the wrong poster my man?
---
Yeah except you cant count or rely on them...cause they dont want to help unless they get something out if it
---
Pfft world pvp wont happen. At least not beyond the gank fest.
---
If you expect SS vs TM pvp raids to happen
---
You're going to be Shit out of luck cause your computer probably wont be able to handle the lag fest
---
Let's just get it over with.....
---
&gt;**the only ability you have that consistently crits is Overpower.**
---
RIP your wallet
---
Are you saying you just stand there out of mana doing nothing?
---
YES! Well done sir(or madam)!
---
Meaning we should base all community in your life am i right, center-of-the-universe?
---
They are, but they are expensive. So you need to invest money and the transmute will take like a month or so before paying off, but then its pure profit. They are also on 1day cd instead of 24 and they are more convenient because you dont need to sell the transmute or buy big expensive items to transmute them.
---
You can buy Undeath to Water which is very rare and best and therefore mega expensive. The Life to Earth is also good. There is another one you get by farming timbermaw rep, but that takes time obviously. IIrc that one is in between others in profit (earth to water I think not sure).
---
Once you get some better gear you will crit more. And  if youre specced into overpower it crits almost every time. And its fantastic for fighting rogues.
---
Heh that's my problem too. 43 warrior, 34 paladin, 23 Hunter , 16 druid. I would love to get my paladin capped because I always enjoyed aoe farming instances with him and shield spike. But I don't group to do instances and my wife finds it boring to heal as a paladin.
---
Well considering that will not drop until Naxx in another year+ 
---
sounds like a troll post.
---
You don't have to change the game itself, just meta game things, like when and how people can roll characters.
---
Yeah cept you add those to your in-game friends list. I won't be adding virtual friends to my bnet till I'm well damn sure I wanna.. and definitely not people who can't respect my feelings enough when I just wanna play an alt in peace lol
---
Are you demanding Corrupted Ashbringer reserved when applying to guilds???
---
Check the spelling. In your spellbook, is it Natures or Nature's?
---
Also will do literally nothing if NS is on cooldown.
---
Nah, I’ll bet even long after our sun dies, some gray alien little fuckers will be playing wow.
---
You said tanks commonly take the first orb. I’m saying value your time more. Tanks aren’t as hard to find as reddit would make you believe.
---
I have been reliably informed that this is because [hoes mad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6oTIjvw_-8).
---
Life to Earth and Undeath to Water are both good. L-E gives me 7-9g profit a day (note that the cooldowns on essence transmutes are 24h instead of 48h like arcanite), and I managed to snag the recipe for only 150g (it's up to about 300g on my server). U-W is probably going to remain the best transmute for the entirety of Classic, because Undeath is always plentiful and there's always a demand for Water, but the recipe is like 700-800g on my server, too rich for my blood.
---
Yeah, and then you have a 1/5 chance of winning it
---
&gt; If you don't like it, then roll your own tank.
---
If you dont like it you can run your own warlock if you dare ask me to sum you.      
---
If you dont like it you can run your own priest if you want any heals or resurrects.       
---
If you dont like it you can run your own mage if you want teleports.  
---
**if you don't like it then you can waste hours trying to find someone who will do it for free.**     
---
I can do this all day, but it's obvious, the tanks created a toxic community because of their own greedy earnings. I hope this becomes reality and anything you want form another player you need to pay. You do know you're playing an MMO, right? Thanks for literally destroying a game in order to profit. What a fucking idiot.
---
A hardcore guild will split the core raiders in two groups to boost alts. He will have a spot if he's not braindead and gives his interest.
---
Do you fish in game too??
---
Lol, that was supposed to be the place where you go, "actually we have players x, y, and z playing with us." Hahahaha.
---
Impale is Normal * 2 * 1.2 = 2.4x normal = 20% dps increase @ 100% crit
---
People misunderstand how critical multipliers work in classic.  The hunter one works the same way and it is insane.
---
Deepwounds is actually the bad talent.  IIRC it self-consumes instead of rolling like ignite.
---
So it looks like this:  
---
Normal Hit = 100  
---
Normal Crit = 200  
---
Normal Crit Mult = 2.0 (this is hidden, and 1.5 for spells, aka Critical Strike Bonus)  
---
Impale Crit Mult = 2.4  
---
NormalDW  = 60/12s  
---
ImpaleDW = 60/12s  
---
1% Crit For Impale = +0.2% average weapon damage  
---
1% Crit for Wound = +0.6% average weapon damage if you only crit once every 12s
---
IIRC how Deepwounds works:  
---
When you Crit: Dot is applied  
---
When you crit again: if the dot would be less damage/tick, duration is refreshed to 12s @ current dps.  Otherwise it is refreshed to 12s with the new dps.
---
Therefor if you crit every 6s, you get only +0.3% average damage.  And if you crit every 4s, then its worse than Impale.
---
Then when you consider special attack crits, impale just further pulls ahead.
---
Ergo, All Good Warriors back in the day wanted Impale without Deepwounds, which you can see blizzard did in Wotlk to help [arms warrior talent builds.](https://wotlk.evowow.com/?talent#LVMczb)  
---
How do you guys fuck up 15 year old knowledge so hard.
---
What's even more goofy about the one-button argument is that most DPS classes have pretty limited rotations when it comes to maximizing DPS. 
---
People who act like WoW ever had "complex rotations" should check out Final Fantasy 14 rotations.
---
Paid 125 for my set so 93 is good. Dleather dropped on my serv from 10g to 4.5
---
Nah it’s a bit too close too real life. However I do play by the lake when fishing in real life from the bank when I’m not working 😂
---
I agree on that, it was just a reply to your very general question "why add?". 
---
I'm not to keen on adding people to bnet friends after 1 dungeon either, much rather go with regular friends list. But luckily, those who added me on bnet friends have all turned out to be quite cool and normal people.
---
There's no incentive for a tank to run living strat if the orbs are reserved. Almost all groups do round robin on orbs and some actually reserve first orb for tanks, since they have higher repairs, a hard time solo farming, and the orb is the only reason to go in there. It's one thing to reserve first orb for yourself it's another to reserve all abd expect a tank to waste his time farming the dungeon for you. But Yeah dude, the sub hates muh reserving haHAA
---
Getting a raid full of people to funnel you xp isn't any different than getting a raid full of people to funnel you gear. You can scratch your head at the mindset of the other participants, but it isn't against the rules.
---
Whilst classes are very limited in raiding due to the complete focus on efficiency, Classic absolutely shines in solo, PvP and even dungeons, with all the skills and decisions that can be made, every situational or instant cast skill suddenly has so much purpose no matter the mana cost or limited use case.
---
Because people who afk dps and don’t bring consumables for raid don’t deserve loot over someone constantly trying to push numbers. We run LC based on merit and performance because we have the means to keep skilled and dedicated players and use it to push away people who think their attendance should outweigh their contribution.
---
Fuck these streamers for...
---
\*Shuffles Deck\*
---
\*Pulls out Card\*
---
XP grinding mobs while in a group!
---
What this guy said.
---
Once you've done the prefered questline (Gnomish inbyour case), then you can craft the Gnomish stuff (chicken and deathray are the BoP's you want afaik). 
---
When you the drop engineering, and relearn it, you click the 'soothsaying for dummies' book in Tanaris, and you can choose specialization (Goblin, in in your case).
---
Keep at it mate I got Teebu's longsword from a thorium lock box a few nights ago farming brd
---
"No changes! The game was harder, its supposed to be hard and we want it hard!" *uses army of npc twitch followers to remove everything even remotely challenging about the game*
---
Only the cool kids
---
Good players in general?
---
I downvoted you
---
Congrats dude!
---
Find a chill leveling guild to join! My current guild &lt;Home&gt; is really friendly and helpful.
---
It's literally the joke of the thread, take your angst elsewhere dude.
---
Haven't hit 60 yet, but that's the plan.  :)
---
&gt; I've rolled an ud priest and am leveling through the whole ud areas only, following their storylines through the zones.
---
I miss the Forsaken questing in WoTLK.  I really enjoyed that.
---
Just think of it as an unpaid internship
---
It kind of makes- warlocks are class that have a more original origin in wow with the fell magic amd the twisting neather- they need more exposition to place them believably in the world. ;)
---
Based on the number of replies I'm getting, I don't think that's true.
---
I am not talking about the specific case of orbs in strat live. Just in general.
---
&gt; I guess just play how you wanna play and try to avoid randoms that may wanna play differently.
---
This is good advice, yes.
---
Consider looking up a build to follow
---
(LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL)
---
I work in IT for a company with a main office in a big city, and smaller offices in other cities. I’m in one of the outer offices. Due to this, I only manage about 40 people and I’m the only IT guy in the office.
---
So, due to this, I brought in my gaming rig and spend all day playing video games between small bouts of work.
---
Cats aren’t alone in dealing the most damage. Other pet families have a 10% dmg modifier and claw.
---
15 years ago I dicked around on several servers, classes, races.
---
UD won my heart, the most underdog race of them all, since then I chose ud classes exclusively...Undercity is amazing, the UD lore is fascinating. 
---
Alliance always had this pseudo-naziesk superiority vibe to it, miss me with that shit.
---
Faction imbalance is a massive design flaw of early wow. I really hope not too many realms will deteriorate into one faction only.
---
Nice
---
"exploiting" yikes
---
Well tonight I'm going to set up a raid heal bot load. With down ranked spells. 
---
 But yeah it uses raid frames. You can change colours and have a sound if someone is hit with a debuff you need to dispel. I got blue for the one kind and purple for the other so I know which spell to use to get rid of it.
---
 And yeah I just hover over there name and use m1 - M5 then I have shift + m1 through M5 so I basically have 10 mouse over macros set up without having to do macros. 
---
 I don't understand macros and don't use them. The only one I can think of right now that I've got more experience is a mouse over macro to dispell buffs on enemies. But that'll be when BG come out so I ain't worries out it. Plus it's one macro and can't be that hard to copy and paste from a guide.
---
 Basically I plan to have a down ranked heal bot menu. Thej my action bars will have my max rank spell
---
This is some pretty old footage, how long did he hold onto this lol
---
Told my wife last night I'd be in bed in 15 20 min just want to take a dab before we sleep. Head on to the veranda smoke a little bit, then back inside and start thinking about ganking the horde at searing gorge. Walk over to the computer and log in, she wakes up 2 hours later to go to the bathroom and I'm in a UBRS group. The shame...
---
LFM ZF SPELLCLEAVE MAGE ONLY EVERY1 ELSE GET FUCKED SCRUB
---
Wtf do you mean.
---
Ranking is determined by that.. your relative rank. Whether bgs are out or not has nothing to do with how quickly you can rank or to what rank you can achieve.
---
the ghaimz
---
What’s the original?
---
Should I be using rank 1 flash of light? I spam max rank and it's been good. I down rank to 4 for saving mana.
---
I will stand here and wait until then
---
That's lucky actually. I've seen them at 10g. I had to sell blackskull shield for 7g, posted it about 8 times and it was just eating deposits on a 15g buyout. Players learned to stop buying bad epics in classic.
---
Dwarves as well!
---
You say people raid half the day.. you can clear molten core in like 2 hours in an average guild.
---
I sepnd like 3 hours a week over 2 days raiding, with a full time job and a 2 year old daughter, its really not as time consuming as you 2 are making it out to be. You dont jeed to throw your life away to raid molten core
---
16 hour days what like twice a week? 16 hour working days is absurd if its everyday and would absolutely not allow him to reach 60 so quickly. 16 hour days and two kids?? Hes either playing from work and/or never interacting with his kids on top of not sleeping. Doesnt pass the sniff test.
---
On Herod Horde there's nothing worse than attacking someone only for like 6 other people to come "help" me.
---
No, I want to PvP not gang up on someone.
---
Moment I see that I just stop attacking and wander off.
---
Tbh if you're struggling questing as a hunter you will struggle with any class, it doesn't get much easier than with a hunter.
---
I think it’s worth the hype just because the pushback is so good against casters. 
---
If you’re not a Nelf, you could justify not getting one because you won’t be able to shadowmeld with Broken Tooth in stealth. 
---
If you don’t get Broken Tooth and aren’t an Nelf, I’d get a Windserpent because their ranged attack ignores armor which is great for warriors, the most popular class in the game.
---
No, this is from like an hour ago
---
I would like to believe these guys only play for 2 hours a day....
---
Teebu's only drops from &gt;60 mobs or bosses so drops only from Eternium Lockboxes but nice lie attempt.
---
Edit: holy oof your comment history. Was checking to see if just a pathological liar and just got giga sexist racist xenophobe
---
Drinking water has a cost too. Bullets do as well. Edit : anyway I wasn't saying that you shouldn't. Just commenting on your " I do not charge for gold, I will just ninja these items so I can sell them for gold and make profit".
---
How much hit do I need as a gnome warrior without Edgemasters?  I have stacked a ton of it but feel like I'm missing out on a lot of crit and AP by focusing so much on it.
---
I was bored of leveling today so I ran to SFK to farm a bit. Got one on my first run. Seriously couldnt believe my eyes
---
yah, that's a terrible system...
---
The no loot for tanks argument doesn't hold. After any other [insert class] has gotten their specific blues from Strat live (if they even have any in the first place), they too have "no incentive to run living strat".
---
A healing priest who literally only wants to run it for orbs to enchant his new Benediction? Exact same situation as the tank.
---
Ive been looking into that. Though I'm not specced into power infusion and not sure if its mandatory for those runs.
---
And yet I'm more than happy to go out of my way for people who need that elite mob that requires a full grp. Like Nathanos or the Bravo twin.
---
This is for leveling, you are not critting every 6 seconds lmao
---
I've gotten like 5 of them without even farming for them and they didn't sell for shit at the time.
---
Agi at lower levels gives a lot of crit. At level 60 its 20agi =1 crit. If you grab those dungarees from the gnomer quest its over 20 agi, and at sub lvl 60 it will be higher crit. Choose what talents you prefer ! But you could save yourself a respec by grabbing impale while leveling
---
Supply and demand is a concept that you clearly have no understanding of... should try to figure that out before you give yourself an aneurysm crying about tanks!
---
Buff alliance racials. Nerf horde racials. I don't care about nochanges, the game is unplayable for both sides right now - horde pvp farm will be boring as hell, alliance can't move outside of IF. There needs to be a solution to the simple fact people were told time and again horde is the "better" faction in vanilla. Also we need faction numbers and that's not optional any more, I have to know where I'm rolling before I'm stuck at level 50 doing something I don't enjoy with the option to quit or risk transferring somewhere it's the same shit.
---
"What's the mage."
---
Great for classes with a clearly visible weapon. Dagger rogues on the other hand... but I guess that just adds to their mystique.
---
They won’t ban you just the name change.
---
I came back to classic realized it sucked and started playing retail again
---
Are you going to be putting time into PvP? Then yes. Are you predominantly a PvE player? Then no.
---
I was surprised it was that low.
---
Imo the best pet by far is Death Flayer. a scorpid with 1.6 atk speed but in organized pvp the scorpid poison stacks 5 times so it covers alot of cleanses. also good dmg vs mail and plate wearers.
---
It's still 10 minutes on the first leg. Surely you can pee and get water in 10 minutes.
---
Most good players know how to counter a pet so attack speed isn't that relevant, unless you play BM ofc.
---
Some people have spent over 10+ hour trying to tame that cat, I just got a 1.3 tiger in stv and stuck with it.
---
That happens with every class. Other trainers are weirdly rude to my poor druidic cow.
---
You can grind the mobs around BT's spawn location for gold and XP. if that kind of stuff suits you. The gold pr hour is very decent and there's a blacksmith supplier that you can repair at and vendor greys etc. for gold.
---
I grinded from 37 to 40 on those wolves and cats and I had more than enough gold for mount and I got Broken Tooth in the process.
---
Broken Tooth is just a PvP pet. You want a wolf for raiding for furious howl.
---
No idea, i have no big cooldowns
---
You can look up census on external websites pretty easily.
---
Hardcast Starfire &gt;  Instant Starfire makes me terrified.
---
That's basically a free kill every time it comes off cooldown.
---
It's literally the same amount of time
---
When did being a chad become a good thing
---
So... in other words both groups are fair weather fans?
---
That's clearly not a public airline.
---
T'was our pleasure friend!
---
Sure, but you gotta stop the game, open a new window and tinker with your image. Easier just to pick up your phone, snapa picture and post it on Reddit.
---
Nahhh. Caster pushback is awesome, but I don't think you're going to notice that huge of a difference between pushback from a 1.2 and a 1.0AS. I'm sticking with Humar for maximum aesthetic and the 1.2AS.
---
Dude. Wtf! This is so LUL. Nice job
---
Only if the duration is &gt;= 15s
---
Warrior, you can tank and dps. Also since your time is limited you want to be able to make groups asap without waiting for a tank and trust me that is going to save you a lot of time.  Reserve items to gear yourself up, once you're geared run start live and reserve orbs for money. Helps if you have a good healer friend and you guys split the orbs amongst yourselves, that way you only have to find dps which is easy. Can also do dme jump runs with your  healer buddy for money. 
---
You wont be able to main tank in raids with your time sched but you can still go fury-prot build and dps until you're called upon to tank some shit.
---
Oh shit didn't realize you could have a macro do that
---
Thank you so much for the feedback! I absolutely love constructive comments like this telling me what to improve on ❤
---
Remind me again, if I want all of the engineering stuff, I go Gnomish first and then Goblin?
---
After you no life at least 80% of your pre raid bis and get an epic mount, there's no real reason to log on aside for like 3 hours a week to raid.
---
National guilds are fairly consistently average, because the ambitious/hardcore folks leave for guilds better suited to them.
---
What I've found nice about Norwegian guilds (since yknow, that's the nationality I'll join) of that while average I find the players to be consistently... *average*.   
---
In a game where there's a lot of shitty players, being able to rely on average or better is awesome.
---
So yes, arrogant and average.   
---
Which is positive unless you're into fast raid progression.
---
Is there a way to make this work with clique or other mouseover healing addons?
---
Against a +3 (boss) level mob you need 9% hit to never miss a yellow attack. White attacks are the same unless you are dual wielding, in which case you would need 28% hit to never miss an auto attack.
---
Against a target your level the numbers are 5% and 24%, respectively.
---
Anyone got an okay rogue dps spreadsheet?
---
From?
---
My friends help each other with shit all the time because we like one another, not out of a quid pro quo. Granted we look for win wins, for example I usually nab a couple dark runes running Scholo to pass along to my healers.  I run stuff with 0 value for me if needed though
---
I met these people through wow classic, now we sit in discord hours of the day with our guild. The social element is a huge part of classic
---
BS. I will use r1 frostbolt to keep enemy away from me, and THEN use wand because I can shoot it running away.
---
eHEROES has done some fun shit to APES, but Im not sure beating them at Gurubashi counts as pushing them to the limit.
---
Yea good shit, never know who owns BRM. Could be handful of horde up top and allies at instance entrance, or vice versa.
---
They’ve been at this for awhile and when they ban people for that stuff, and then look into an appeal and its still for sure then yeah I don’t believe you man sorry.
---
&gt;if you specifically go out of your way to stack crit (and lose str in the process, lowering your damage) you will crit a lot!
---
For strat live they are... tanks don't need anything from there other than quests (in that case they probably are fresh 60 so aren't very good), so people are generally happy passing them the first orb. This *is* them valuing their time more, they'd rather get a tank quickly by giving them first orb then wait a lot longer to find a tank with no incentive.
---
2014-2015 were the best times to play ESO.  Much of the game philosophy matched wow classic too:
---
- you had defacto roles baked into the classes.  Everyone could tank/heal but certain classes were better due to having akit to give them more flexibility in their role.
---
- end game entirely revolved around PvP, though it was an instance open world area with side quests whereas wow was a huge pve questing experience with side PvP. 
---
- classes had wide range of skills that defined who they were.  While ESO had no talent tree, it had intricate skill/passive system that was different for each class along with similar system for weapons you picked up or npc guilds joined.
---
It has nothing do do with classic besides some common words
---
Thankfully my guild raids late nights on Thursday and Fridays, should help with my schedule. It’s just tough to make gold with the warrior end game since their gold farming ability isn’t the best.
---
Flamestrike -&gt; CofC -&gt; AE (CofC on CD)
---
Easy
---
I'm sorry, you cant read. This subreddit strikes again.
---
It drops from mobs &gt; level 60, which Eternium Lockboxes share partial loot tables with.
---
I did state it dropped from lockboxes, but not thorium.
---
Not sure I would call it a feature.  Just what it is.  
---
You also have to use the correct case if you are equipping a weapon by name in a macro or if you are using a click command for a button ID.
---
How's the rogue?
---
It will cost a shitload of gold, buy runecloth stacks for 500-800g depending on your current rep, and then 900g for the mount. You can get wolf mount from Alterac Valley (exalted) when P3 comes.
---
Someone might be resetting it in the raid.
---
I played alliance for several years because of the aesthetics before switching to horde last month.  Simply put, playing Horde is much more immersive and even feels easier in several ways.
---
From a gameplay perspective, I found the leveling progression to be much smoother than on alliance.  Having both RFC and WC for Horde was more interesting early on compared to only having DM.  It felt like the cities and zeppelins were better suited to traveling.  Their racials seem more useful in PVP and to some extent PVE as well.  
---
From an aesthetic perspective, I still don't like the cities but everything else is so much more lively.  "Ugly" or not, Horde races actually look different compared to the 4 humans of varying height for Alliance.  Horde racials are much more flavorful and immersive so you actually feel like you're playing as your race.  
---
When I was on alliance, everything looked pretty but felt bland.  When I switched to Horde, the world came alive and even got easier to play.
---
Badlands. Ulda after. Tanaris, ZF after.
---
Wait this works???
---
You're right but I believe any spell with multiple ranks and cast times tends to change from pre lv 20 versions to post lv 20 versions. At least this is true as far as all of the healing spells I can remember.
---
Guild usually lets classes handle their own loot distribution. Then non class gear is usually /rolled and some key gear is determined by the masses like someone has leaf they get sinew etc. Have a first week period where new guildies are ineligible for loot unless nobody also needs too. Haven’t had any complications and everyone seems to be pretty satisfied.
---
Illusionary Rod from SM library
---
Not the good one.
---
Just this one last quest!
---
LOL so much better than the original song
---
&gt; Again, Class identity being removed for spec identity
---
It was so painful in legion seeing people bray about how awesome it was that "FIRE mages could now use FIRE shield why would FIRE mages use ICE magic only ICE mages do that!"
---
When it should be that you're not a FIRE mage or an ICE mage you're an ice MAGE or fire MAGE.
---
And then by BFA literally every character has their bars filled with monochromatic skill icons, only changing based on which spec you are.
---
Oh you're a fire mage? Well all your abilities are orange. Ice mage? Blue. Arcane mage? Purple. Blood DK? All red. Frost DK? Blue. Unholy DK? Green.
---
Then you go to any expansion even as late as WoD and your skill bars are a cornucopia of colors and themes that make up your entire class identity.
---
Daang. Guess I ain't dropping tailoring then lol. It's alrdy like 30g each.
---
Sounds like it's been set to Current Fight instead of Overall Data.
---
This is why I play Alliance
---
So you're saying that reddit is exactly the place for people rage, harassment, sexism, hate speech and racism.  
---
You're saying the safe place for us ALL to have discussions are 100% allowed to discuss these things? Because I GAURENTEE YOU RIGHT NOW.  Make a thread on any of those lines.  You will be told you're not welcome here and what type of conversation is ALSO notT WELCOME.  Are you also new here wtf? Everybody knows that there are CERTIAN TOPICS that you're just not allowed to bring here. 
---
So let that marinate through your skull
---
Have a nice one
---
Also can you do me a favor and stop replying to me in a deleted thread.  nuff said already. Move on
---
I think the content was the only part of wotlk that they got right, especially storylines/lore.. the changes they started making to classes, making stuff easier, and making it more of everyone is the same.. was the start of the downfall and just went from there, so wotlk was essentially the best and worst in one depending on how you looked at it.
---
Filthy Kazaksthan and their jobs
---
Me and Spriest have done lots of dps runs lately!  Havnt gotten a god dam thing for loot though hahaha. :(
---
&gt;Why do you think everyone is now conllaining and wanting only faction specific transfers?
---
That’s the point mate. Faction specific transfers would always be dominant -&gt; outnumbered. You wouldn’t make that transfer. I wouldn’t. Most people wouldn’t. T
---
I’d recommend dropping alch and picking up mining or skinning. Skinning is more consistent, but Mining has the chance for Arcane Crystals which are 40-50 G a pop.
---
I had the same issue leveling mine. I switched to the Rockpounder for a few levels.  You only miss out on 3% crit, and some attack power.  Sadly Mace spec outside of PvP isn't that great, so it really comes down to Axe or Sword spec. I still used axes while tanking, so it wasn't a big loss.
---
Typically unless you are rolling in gold, just stick with axe spec. Keep an eye out for an  Executioner's Cleaver on the AH, in case you see one cheap. Then you can always get the Rotgrip axe from Maraudon at level 48.
---
Even if you do switch to Sword Spec, it's totally fine.  You can buy a Warmonger sword at 52 which gives 3% hit, which is hard to get at that level.
---
oh yeah... huh. I guess I was already subconsciously aware of the case-sensitive naming conventions in WoW's macros. I just finally figured out on my own why some of my macros showed tooltips and others didn't and was excited to inform people.
---
"That's toxic behavior" - every snowflake (cringy douche) that uses the word toxic to describe anything other than a chemical/compound.
---
Was gonna say I was def baked and then I saw the top screen
---
we have had quite a few bad actors, but the alliance forgets Illidan was a Night Elf, and Arthas was crown prince of the Alliance before he screwed his own people. And the concentration camps orcs were kept in. And the trolls they kicked out of their land to colonize like the American Colonizers vs Natives.
---
Well gues that nobody cares
---
So then you turn into one too?
---
I wouldn't sweat having trouble keeping 4 melee classes alive on Princess, it's not the most melee friendly fight.
---
Absolutely 100% yes. If you're on a PvP server.
---
Wth is a ninja raider, do you mean ninja looter?
---
For sure. Right up until it's raid night.
---
I'd always rate gear above mount, but mount does come in at a close second.
---
Avenue Q, some of their actual stuff is on YT
---
Only downrank to starfire rank1 when you go OOM, usually I never go out of mana with pots, runes and innervate if needed
---
What lever is the elite boar? I’m only 37 and looking for a switch up from my current windserpent and a boar sounds interesting
---
You sir. Have it alllllll mixed up. Unfortunately
---
As a tank you have no issue finding groups.
---
Thats why you do start live orb runs and reserve the orbs. Also one of the best farming methods is dme jump runs.
---
No need to be rude. You are wrong just accept it.
---
There's a ton of these in Alterac Mountains. They are fishable but you need to spam cast until it randomly hits the 2 square pixels that are in deep water. Really sucks when you get a six hitter.
---
&gt; people 
---
It's literally just you and me.
---
The mafia is only possible if you break the rules...  There is no mafia on my server.
---
I miss when all specs had access to all DoTs.
---
No matter what shenanigans they pull with Destruction, it just feels hollow without corruption and curse of agony and affliction always feels like there's a gaping hole where immolate should be.
---
upvote totals at this point would imply that, but originally, others were reading.
---
I'm one of those priests. The content is too easy and fights are so short, so I don't see a reason to conserve mana as long as I don't run oom before the fight ends. I use different ranks of flash heal to minimize overhealing, Greater Heal to heal big chunks and Prayer of Healing when 4 or 5 of my group members need healing. Mostly flash heal though. Side effect is that I'm topping the healing chart every single raid because my mates conserve mana like crazy so they don't have to drink. I don't see the point of it. I sit down to drink every time we're out of combat and not moving, even if it's just for one tick. Mage water is free and the new lvl 55 water gives way more mana than the 45 one. I only chug mana pots if we really need it though, and only the cheap ones. I bank the expensive ones for PvP.
---
A little reading will help ya bud instead of just making shit up. Go read the latest leaks and final Fantasy s sub numbers. Jfc
---
lmao this some true shit
---
Except warlocks, mages, and healers are far easier to replace than a tank lmao. I guess the term "supply and demand" is nonsense to you.
---
If you think the tank getting something is destroying the game then make your own groups. If I'm tanking a dungeon I want it to be worth my time. For example, strat live literally doesn't drop anything for tanks, so the tank should just do it out of the goodness of their heart?
---
It's such a silly thing to be upset about. If you don't like it, stop playing DPS. Tank is the most expensive thing you can do in the game with the most limited farm options. Don't be a greedy lil pig
---
Agreed get king bagalash. He's has claw rank 6 and dash rank 2 straight off the bat. Then if your BM you can add another 30% attack speed every time he Crits. He also attacks fast since he has the cobra reflexes ability.
---
Yeah I raced vs a rogue with that buff today, about as fast as my aquatic form..
---
Crisis averted, sweet
---
I mean. that sucks OP but your just like that fortnite kid.  Rip.

Hopefully this link works. It is probably not ‘optimal’ but it has worked for me. I’ll probably go full disc/holy at 60 and rid myself of the shadow mana talent. It will be annoying outside dungeons but I’d rather have a more healing specific build at 60. 
---
I love having power infusion, spell casters always enjoy it
---
The Lagging of Orgrimmar\*
---
Carried? No
---
Did u?
---
Nope just my experiences
---
The purple of 100k is kinda the same as the 100-200 gold category so it looks similar. I doubt many people if anyone has that much.
---
Looks like they're in BRD to me, so 52 upwards probably?
---
I do because the only dps I get are full raid teir and I have zero chance of maintaining aggro on them
---
Best of luck out there.

Take my soul, Blizzard.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/du2luk/where_can_read_what_new_recipes_get_released/). 
---
Try finding a guild with active 60 play. That will make dungeons a lot more fun, and should make group creation way easier.
---
Also, you get to experience something you have not yet tried - raiding. 40 players coming together to beat raid content can be a lot of fun!
---
If you have any other reliable engineers that you can get the Goblin stuff from, staying Gnomish allows you to use the Gadgetzan teleporter instead of Everlook. Just something else to consider.
---
&gt;To put it simply, I don’t believe you.
---
Y'all are going to make this man /wrists lol. He sounds like he's on the verge of tears as it is.
---
idk about last finished but afaik hunters were the last class added to the original wow beta test. From what I can find, [Feign Death](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Play_Dead) was something druids had before hunters were added.
---
It’s not funny when it’s not relevant you just sound like a stupid little kid regurgitating the meme of the week.

Someone get a rope!

why did you delete this? I wanted to read your argument but nooo. loser!

I haven't looked at upvote tallies... because I don't give a shit.

Also, there's a reasonable chance that I'm not just dealing with two accounts. Based on patterns in the voting I guessed that it was three, but I haven't spotted the third account yet, so it could just be coincidence.
---
5 Stages of grief:
---
1. Denial
---
&gt; While hunters don't have to deal with soul shards (though food can take up inventory too)
---
Ammo!

how can you both not look at upvotes, then claim something based on the patterns of the votes...
---
you are like openly hypocritical of yourself one sentence to the next
---
Listen to it!

Smush smush

And shamans in ghost wolf
---
If the content is so easy why do you have to flash heal? Seems like a waste of gold to top charts.
---
I went with 6/8 shadowcraft and then two good off pieces, as I got geared I just swapped on the pieces that gave the greatest dps contribution. Finally when I had 6/8 T1 and bracers of eclipse I could do a full gear swap out without losing DPS from losing the 6/8 shadowcraft proc (it is fucking ridiculous especially when synergizing with procs from blade flurry).    
---
Anyways, the tiebreaker with a 3% proc rate with the current gear configurations is nightslayer belt when swapping from SC to NS/BF, thus if you can swap 5 items at once and one of em is the belt, you'll be seeing a minor amount of increase in DPS. Furthermore, whenever the T0,5 set is released you're still going to need to get the entire set because 4/8 will be bis until you've gotten the corresponding T3 pieces.
---
Is solo farming Maraudon as a Hunter viable if I DON'T want to pester a friend every 10 minutes for an invite to reset the instance? My plan is to unequip my stuff, drown and corpse run back to the instance (I'm an NE for that matter, so Wisp does help). Would I still be able to achieve 5 Princess runs/hour?
---
The "latest leaks" are literal speculation. And what does FF have to do with anything? Give me one link that has concrete, accurate subscriber numbers for WoW.
---
By that logic, Dire Maul shouldn't make sense. Personally, I don't play enough to push Naxx. Not everybody does. My reference to more 10-20 mans was for these people. The filthy casuals. UBRS is great. Everyone liked ZG too. There is a lot of room between raids to make more content.
---
I also enjoy the leveling process. There are plenty of areas to create more content from 1-59 for people who enjoy making alts.
---
Professions could definitely use some filling out. Filling out those professions could include any additional content from 1-59 or more instances that aren't just harder 40 mans.
---
It also depends on how it's implemented. Classic+ could be a fresh server with a better end game progression and just more all-around content.
---
The methods used to add content to Classic are only limited by your imagination.
---
And my axe
---
Usually I play once my wife goes to bed so that I don't make her feel neglected. That means sometimes I don't get to play until very late and I know this feeling all too well.

Re: Hit Caps
---
1. What is the hit cap for PVP? 
---
2. Trolls get +5 to bows, how does this affect hit cap? I've read conflicting info. Is +5 to bows = +1% hit with bows?
---
yo girl look 40 and shes sleepin with a stuffed animal
---
A lvl 24 should not be wasting money FAPs
---
Afaik yes.
---
Ok Boomer
---
Collect the gear pieces mate and then swap 5 SC &gt; 5 T1/T2, if you got the belt and dont swap the devilsaur pieces you're golden! :)
---
Same place says that Gandling is 78/22 when it feels like 60/40 and I'm on the shit receiving end(ally). These stats are as trust worthy as me saying "stalagg and heartseeker are 50/50, just gitgud and stop whining"
---
I bust out laughing when they start w/ the QQQ part.
---
nice one my guy
---
You posted two hrs ago schwag let it simmer
---
You can reset the dungeon yourself. Have a friend invite you to a party, log onto an alt, have him invite the alt and give the alt lead, then leave.
---
You can then reset your own dungeon.
---
No I didn't have the toxic ass attitude you seem to have so no I don't feel like I got carried
---
I can't tell if this is some kinda joke post now tbh
---
You keep mentioning how you've played for 15 years. What was your experience like in a raiding guild back in vanilla to make you think you can just join a guild with a specific 4h drop on reserve
---
Mc viable even in future phases, no worries.
---
just grab a 1.2 attack speed pet off this [Petopia List](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php).
---
Let's just say he didn't have sex with her he only inserted his cigar.
---
Or people that want to be able to play the game they pay for?
---
4 bosses in 30 mins is not 100 to 200g per hour and there's like 20 similar (and may I add better) warlock DME guides out there.
---
What's with you guys and calling everything "toxic"?
---
I remember a time when the gaming community wasn't full of sensitive little snowflakes and autists who cry when the wind blows in their face.
---
Most of you would have a complex or suicided if you played games like d2 and sc back in the day.
---
Blame your parents. They raised your generation to be weak and feeble of mind.
---
(Awaiting ban from weak and feeble mod who cries when the wind blows in his face....srs tho what kind of loser  mods reddit)
---
No, they cannot use any abilities. Only auto attack and move your character.
---
Name pls
---
This. You know if you have time to go get a drink or go to the bathroom.
---
I was looking to see max dps and how they compared between the classes. Absolutely nowhere in my post did I say that was reason to think these classes were anywhere close to each other in practical use or play, because at the end of the day these are just numbers that don't tell the full story. My sole reason for posting this is to show how far each class can go in pure damage scenarios, if you took anything else from my post besides that it is on you. 
---
I do apologize for giving more faith to the average poster than I did. I'll be sure to be more hand-holdy for people like you on any post in the future.
---
I rolled alliance I’m vanilla. Then when tbc came out I refilled horde. I just like how undead were more and then when I rolled a Tauren I fell in love with Tauren. For the earth mother.
---
How incredibly original, the ironic part is I’m probably younger than you.
---
So you should think about why your experience isn't like mine
---
We already have a rogue. 
---
But really. I have to either wait for my guild tanks to do something or spend the time making the group. Joining a pug is pretty hard to get into. Other than that being a rogue at 60 is great. Easy farms all over and more with gathering profs.
---
It pretty much is.
---
I can sit in stealth on the spot. Range doesn’t matter lol.
---
Or for people who don't have time to level alts to 60 and therefore go twinking because it gives them more options to play around with in BGs
---
Edit: Recorrecting autocorrect
---
 You hunted me down almost a day after the thread closure to respond to my comment made prior to that... angrily at that.
---
 Pot meet the kettle.
---
There was a few reasons this thread got shut down, and harassment within the comment threads was about half of it.
---
Follow your own advice, and move on.
---
Get a swing timer addons, I forgot what mine is called but I'll find out when i get home, I think it's called classiccasttime though
---
new
---
Does the Tribute chest despawn? Any idea on a timer if so?
---
Are there only 3 book spawns and 1 chest spawn in DM:N? Book to the left of Fengus's locked door, book under ramp by Slip'kik, and book right next to Cho. Only one chest near the campfires by Slip'kik that is almost always locked. Am I missing anything?
---
I use Elvui and for some reason, I cannot see pet debuffs on my pet unitframe, nor my target unitframe when targetting my pet. I can only see the debuffs on the tooltip and that doesn't show time left or details. Debuffs are enabled, I messed with items per row, x and y positioning, etc and nothing. Any ideas?
---
The answer to "when to cast corruption" is almost always never, and that choice isn't going to be yours, it's going to be your raid leaders. I'd say there are some more spikey rng based classes, but even something like Fire Mage can be very controlled. Sure, you're pretty wholly proc reliant, but you can usually "fish" for the procs you need, or use a specific cd to give yourself a guaranteed proc to start off your burn phase.
---
Look, if you like pressing one button a thousand times a night, more power to you, but I'm getting real worried for our raid's frost mages. P much every raid night includes them bitching about how basic their rotation is.
---
I don't believe so. The offline alt should stay in your party.
---
Yeargh...
---
You need more noggenfogger in your life. Haha
---
Guildmates arent friends...they're teammates
---
Or a more relatable term co workers.
---
I dont talk or do anything with my guild cause they dont need me for anything from me nor do they join my grps when I ask if they want to run a 60 level dungeon
---
And I dont expect them too
---
Marco doesn't work all the time. It's a known blue post issue since launch. Something with queue times for skills overlapping and causing feint death to not drop aggro, or the pet cancel attack to not register or both.
---
You have a lot of questions in here that can have light shed on them in the sub I linked above. It sounds like you have the mindset that Classic+ has to be just better gear from harder dungeons. There are large areas of Classic WoW that could be expanded on without even touching post-Naxx 40 mans. Ultimately, expanding content can be done by any method a person can come up with. And the vision of Classic+ is different to everyone, but generally to just have more content. It doesn't have to be infinite. I'd recommend taking a look at that sub if you want to get more of a feel for what people think Classic+ is.
---
You're non stop crying in this thread buddy. You also apparently imagine reserving Ashbringer. 
---
Of course you won't hold aggro over 5 targets if DPS blast. I literally just told you that it's not big deal. The best excuse you could come up with is dumb; just go out there and farm your gear.
---
Noobs not jumping in the lava
---
I wasnt being technical in any way. The meme literally fits the situation here is all.
---
Yup
---
You can turn it off I think
---
Not to mention the title of the game is a low effort reskin of Everquest
---
Is your account a joke or?
---
I find mage loot hilarious because theres so many mages and I swear the drop rate is just lower than advertised on wowhead.
---
Mageblade is 22% and I still haven't seen it in 2 months of raiding
---
Mara is definitely easier. I can do mara -princess, tinker and rotgrip (rotgrip on a good day)- but i struggle to do DM:E. And by struggling i mean i tried and gave up after getting frustrated. 
---
Anyway I believe if you can do DM:E, especially with mining, it should be better than mara for sure. I'm sticking to mara now if i'm bored since i'm herbalism and prices of ghost mushrooms, stranglekelp and bruiseweed have gone up lately. Mind sharing what a run looks like for you?
---
Until it comes raid time and they already have a full squad so he gets sat...  Happened to me since it took me a long time to level due to newborn.
---
The fact that you want something doesn’t mean you deserve it. The achievement of being grand marshal/high warlord is granted to those who show they are worth it.
---
If you cant keep that pace is your problem, not theirs.
---
Now, is it ok for the player-base that the system is so punishing? Maybe not. But also take into account the highest rank is awarded only to those who live for killing the other faction soldiers.
---
And then I just have to click on the name, hunters mark and I can see exactly where they are on the mini map :D (wondering if combat log has same functionality? Mby just a pvp target macro?)
---
I currently play my main for 3-4 hours a week. The rest of my time is spent with family, friends or other games, or alts when i can be arsed.
---
It's a big deal to the grps I join. Cause they remove me after a few trash pulls
---
And if I help build a guild from the ground up...why couldn't I ask to have priority over a weapon 2 yrs from now
---
They're not... I spent an entire afternoon doing the questline to unlock it and it's so disapointing. 
---
1) It despawns shortly if you let it free and no pvp flagged players around, not like vanilla where you could leave it to go berzerk somewhere.
---
2) When enslaved it barely did damage so I don't see it being useful at all in pvp.
---
One key press/mouse click, one action (skill, macro, move, etc) per character.
---
lmao probably. Must be getting paid bank!
---
Ooh you naughty person! How are you getting WiFi on a plane?!
---
The star and the multi channel is just an add-on called LFGShout - I don't know how to turn off the star icon!

I think that Boar is only high 20s but elite from memory.  Just go to Lakeshire and he is straight west - not far.

Did not mean to post this auction, put it into Auctioneer to get a price history. Went AFK, came back, and then immediately posted without thinking about what I was in the middle of doing. It was sniped immediately.

Live and learn, I'm dumb.
---
People may be sick of MC but they are still gonna clear it all the way until naxx is out.

It can be canceled, can't it?

Im a hunter. With the Huntard rep all hunters have.... it really sucks. Wish I rolles ANYTHING else. At least rogue pretty much guarantees top dps.
---
It's on me to change the camping situation. Sounds legit
---
Do you mean some other player can reset your meter?
---
+1 is superior system but people are by nature greedy and selfish, so DKP gives them the illusion of having control.
---
The key to making money with alchemy (without herb) is to buy herbs when they are low and sell a select few potions you make from them on raid days.
---
Herbs for elixir of the mongoose are ~2.7g and the potions sell for 3.6-3.8+g on tuesdays and wednesdays. Likewise, I buy small flame sace for &lt;1g and firefin snappers for &lt;10g each and make fire protection potions that sell for 1.8-2.1g. It's not huge profits, I probably only make 20g per week on that plus another 20g on arcanite transmutes, but it takes almost no effort and lets me craft potions cheaper for guildmatea

Recently I made a fortune off of the free action potion price spike

I take it as you get a paycheque and by the time to get your next paycheque you don't have anything left in your chequing account after your necessities.
---
A savings account is as much of a necessity as internet or phone.
---
Sounds like something a boomer would say
---
Looks like a buyout screen and it’s awaiting the money from time of purchase.
---
Probably not worth going back to farm hypnotic blade if he doesn’t already have it though
---
same with skeram. They WANT alliance to leave our server so that the lag issues go away. It's why heartseeker is open again, so that it can become 99% alliance.
---
600 gold in 20 min, see this one simple trick in my 10:01 video!!!!
---
Speaking as a Horde who hates Pallys, just bubble-hearth
---
Its because the people who feel as if they should be allowed to reserve stuff are just entitled losers who think no one else plays the game for the same loot either.  I understand losing an item you want multiple times is frustrating but it doesnt make anyone deserving of someone elses effort.
---
Good job now you made him cry. Go back in your hole troll
---
That's another mile high club ill never be a part of.
---
Can I get away with a Mithril Dragonling, or am I really missing out if I don't craft the Arcanite one?
---
I used a Gnomish Death Ray on a lvl 55 fire elemental (I am lvl 60) and it did 782 dmg. Very underwhelming for a 3 second cast that also damages me. Was I just unlucky?
---
The meme started as a non-boomer saying it to a boomer, not a young person to an old person.
---
Was this meme ever funny? Not being a dick I’m just curious if anyone has ever actually read it and gotten a good laugh.
---
Then build groups yourself. You're just making up excuses now.
---
You reserve the item before. You dont take advantage of anyone elses effort.
---
Oh.....ouch.
---
Nah just most of you dumb cunts on reddit
---
I haven't signed up for classic yet but seeing these 'reserved' posts makes me not want to, among other things. When I played vanilla the only time I ever heard anyone reserving anything was with regards to materials found in raids which would go to the guild leader. Reserving items in a 5 man PUG is laughable.
---
At this point yeah you can have a 60 with some raid gear I guess. Using this excuse isn't really viable anymore as many people have played so much of this game already.  But I'm .ore so refering to the end of September posts that kinda pissed me off lol 
---
 I work 4 days a week. And I have yet to hit 60. But this is my first ever toon so I understand it would take me much longer. But I havnt even touched end game dungeons except UBRS and jail break from brd.  Simply becuase I do not have the time. I'll try to do one run a night but if it takes more than half hour to get to entrance I have to go farm for an hour cause usually bed time at that point unless I sacrifice sleep.  
---
 I just don't get how guys who work a whole extra day a week then me can do it and yet I've had 2 days where I played 14-15 hours cause I was home alone. And I'm yet to hit 60 or do any endgame content.  I mean yeah I'm slower but it's all speculation from me.
---
Sounds like a terrible attitude to guilds no wonder they don't want to help you.
---
He is always such a freaking whiner.
---
Start the groups, its the most reliable way to get groups as a dps.
---
It's Medivh's staff, it's been in the lore since before WoW, and it's always had a plain look.
---
People acting as if this phase is so difficult is pretty funny.  Had a guy in guild get kicked the other day from a BRD group because he had trouble remembering how to get there - because it’s been 14+ years since he last had to go there.  Based solely on that his group leader dropped him because he didn’t think he have good enough damage (he was a 55 or 56 Warlock).
---
Too many min/max personalities running around.
---
yes, but the point is you consider savings to be built in,while i suspect many people assume you have nothing left to save.
---
the majority of people in the usa don't have savings to last them 2 months,  that's living paycheck to paycheck according to most people.
---
I think the "old ways" are a large reason why many people are enjoying Classic right now. Just because something performs a function more efficiently doesn't mean it makes the game better. Following efficiency is how Retail got to where it is (Some people prefer it and that's fine). Putting a group together is pretty tedious and frustrating at times. But ultimately it forces you to interact with the community. It makes the community more alive and makes the game feel like an MMO. I've made friends because of the process to form a group in Classic. During my time in Retail, I barely talked to anyone, and most people didn't talk to me either.

---
Not surprised, as a fellow warrior I feel for you.
---
You are attempting to with trying to reserve. If someone agrees to the reserve more power to them but you asked why people dont like it and i answered your question.  Can you explain how reserving isnt selfish and entitled in any way?
---
any chance you could tell me how to change the code to remove the xp bar ? :D
---
Ditto.
---
Classic isn’t vanilla. You can’t trust people anymore. If you need something set masterlooter on the boss and force MS &gt; OS.
---
Yeah the guide I read before was bc time Damn. So yeah low level = better mana/heal value thanks to +healing. I just need to know when Mmh.
---
I have found a spreedsheat so if fol =42% Mmh have to think about it
---
Lol no it won't. 2g of ammo is like one run
---
Any tips for my first Blackfathom Deeps run?  27 warlock alliance

---
As a Shadow Priest/Rogue player, I'd recommend Mage. They do everything I wish I could do. Easy transport, free food and water, best AOE abilities, damage monsters, great survivability, can Regen Mana in combat quickly, etc. No downside
---
I'm still confused, we were on p3 for like 4 mins of straight threat gain for tank before heals pulled threat
---
You should drink to celebrate.

It is not as much about complex rotations as having to do absolutely anything but stay stationary and click a button, which all later expansions have expanded upon. Say what you want about any other retail design decisions, but their raids/dungeons and gameplay in those are far more skill and mechanics intensive. This is showcased even in later vanilla raids: Naxx has a TON more interesting encounters specifically because you are forced to do a lot of things beside spamming damage.
---
Molten Core is a boring raid, and clicking shadow bolt from one spot on 9/10 bosses is boring design.
---
It's good. It's a cinnamon flavored candy whiskey.
---
Literally what I'm doing and why I'm here reading.
---
yes, it's the entire point of the game, completely legit
---
get to 60, get gear, and make some friends ingame so you can camp their asses. 
---
If this is not for you, there are numerous PVE servers where you can start again with a nice level 1 character of your choosing
---
Yeah, later I can post some

SS- Hello R/ Classic WoW
---
How are my people this fine Saturday?
---
This video continues my rambling of what classic WoW means on its launch night,  to someone who's lived side by side with it since its birth. 
---
I chopped this chapter down to 3 minutes, to make the story go faster and out of respect to the viewers time.
---
Thank you to anyone who watches.
---
Be good!
---
If you cant be, then stay good at it.
---
I'm not interested in it getting sorted. I just wanted people to know his name and be aware. Nothing more. I'm sorry you see alot of ninja-posts and that you find that annoying.
---
I’m also using Humar. But I’m pretty sure he’s 1.3. Rake is 1.2 tho.
---
Please tweet the Blizz Devs on this issue, asking for Faction based transfers!
---
Rogue got mad I didn’t tip him MORE after i opened a 5g vendor item.
---
That is fuckin sick dude, nice
---
Not on Shaz. That Arcane Explosion can waste a Mage in melee.
---
Ninja costume increases swim speed in lava too!
---
In short, seals and judgement did not exist.
---
Blessings (i.e. might, wisdom, salvation) were originally called seals
---
Crusader Strike was an instant cast, no cooldown ability that functioned identically to how the scarlet crusade uses it.
---
Ironically they could tack crusader strike back on with a 3 second CD and not only would ret paladin be viable as DPS it would also have a fairly fleshed out rotation
---
Lmao ain't that the truth
---
Lock. It is the most underrated class and one of the most fun.
---
Blizzard is literally the least aoe dmg a mage can do lol the ignorance
---
I tried and it didn’t work so there is something to reserving the names, or people saying they did it are lying.
---
As a hunter.... i agree. I wish i never rolled hunter. Im 60 now, and do great damage, but i hated everything.
---
I've noticed that in every game I've played, certain buzzwords will be invented by people within the playerbase, which are then essentially used as criteria for social acceptance.  In Factorio, the decree of the cool kids and streamers is that you will build a "megabase," and you will do so via a "main bus" architecture.  In WoW at this point, it is that you will seek out what they consider to be "BiS" gear.
---
Usually said criteria for social acceptance are invented by a small handful of people, and then uncritically followed and propagated by the majority.  They also are very rarely genuinely good advice.  It's about being seen to do what appears to be the right thing, socially; not about what necessarily works.
---
I made a thread a few hours ago about why I was becoming burned out, and listed the BiS meme and other elements of raid culture as one of the major reasons.
---
What about TBC+
---
&gt;If you dont like it you can run your own warlock if you dare ask me to sum you.
---
I'll replace that warlock.
---
&gt;If you dont like it you can run your own priest if you want any heals or resurrects.
---
I'll replace that priest.
---
&gt;If you dont like it you can run your own mage if you want teleports.
---
I'll replace that mage.
---
do the quests before hand.  There is a note that drops from the adds before the dungeon make sure to somehow get that note back to town before the instance (it breadcrumbs into giving pretty good loot for killing the second last boss).
---
Tips dungeon guide on wowhead covers those sort of things quite well.
---
That's 10000% more obnoxious than saying "I smoke"
---
hunters dont need any help against warriors lol
---
I spend more time than I'd like to admit comparing flight path prices. Sometimes that 9 minute run is worth saving that extra 4s for my mount when I hit 40.
---
My first run me and the boys did lots of research and cleared virtually every quest in there all in one go, we’re horde but it wasn’t too tough and gave us a fat xp drop at the nearby settlement when time came to turn it all in. I’d recommend looking into doing the same. The most annoying one is a quest you get from a note dropped by a female naga mob close to the entrance of the dungeon as you have to find the note, bring it back to the settlement, then dive back into the dungeon. Idk if the situation is similar for alliance though.
---
Pointless but gives you something to do and work towards
---
https://youtu.be/pgChE35ADeo
---
U have to have someone put it on for u
---
I heal more while still not going oom. There is literally no downside. If the content ever gets harder, I'll change my play style.
---
&gt; Seems like a waste of gold to top charts.
---
What gold? Mages in my guild don't charge me for their water. I don't use any flasks. The occasional mana pot costs like 60s on my server and is still optional.
---
It's not like you get paid for the amount of mana you have left after a fight.
---
I am more surprised these damn bracers actually dropped
---
no bgs make p2 favour premades too much. even if you exclude two guilds from opposite factions collaborating you won't stand a chance against 5 man parties running around killing everything. Easier to be a leech in a bg for sure.
---
Mid to high 40s
---
Keep at it and you may be able to get the rare pvp gear!, that's the best us casuals can hope for!!
---
Definitely Lock...  I am maining a Lock in Classic but in Vanilla I had a Shadow Priest and a Mage as my two main toons.
---
Those are both fun but the lock has so much variety, a free mount, much better solo ability with respect to elites and just overall has a ton more variety than the other two in terms of play styles you can choose.
---
How do I get the statistics for it? Whenever I try it says I'm missing the add-on "Details! Storage" but I can't find it anywhere online.
---
wasnt it pretty much the same in tbc/wotlk except for world buffs which let you be an actual god once in a while? warrior raiding in classic is something magical imo.
---
This is how it is if you have premade friends to PvP with a lot. The vast majority of the enemy will be spread and disorganized. When that is the case faction imbalance doesn't matter. It's free farming
---
Wow.
---
i must have missed that one
---
Well, the warrior doesn't get a hit talent and does just fine. Couple that with most of the threat coming from Conc, and I just don't see the point of +Hit from a talent.
---
Additionally, I think it's 9% hit for 1 hand 'yellow' attacks to have a 100% chance to not miss. Well, we only have Judgement and Seal hits as 'yellow' damage coming from our weapon.
---
IMO, I'd rather be able to BoP more since I can't taunt plus have a bit more armor.
---
This was mostly for post-60, when you're pretty geared.
---
I remember solocapping a flag like that. My whole team stormed the opposing base and grabbed their flag, so I just camped on the flagbase until they capped. I snatched the flag and sprint, prep, sprint, rocket boots. One of the opposing guys nearly caught me, so I threw some blind powder in his face and kept on truckin’. Two flag caps in two minutes.
---
Thanks mate!
---
Thanks a lot \^\^
---
Its fine, i like to pvp and there is a ton of horde to kill. The leveling can be brutal tho since we are so outnumbered

Your offline character will stay in the group. The only thing that'll disband the group is if both characters are offline simultaneously for too long. I don't know the timer on that though.
---
Keep in mind that you'll have to wait for 2 minutes on your alt to get lead to pass over so you can reset the dungeon.
---
BoS is basically only interesting for encounters with 10+ enemies. I pretty much only use it for farming tbh. 
---
The main problem with a three role build is that paladin speccs have different reliances on talents. 
---
Holy is the easiest to simply pot around for healing. For dungeon healing you can get away with zero points in it you'll just go through potions or relly on DPS to end the fight quickly. Last week I healed an entire MC run with full recc/ret specc. So 0 points in holy. I've used almost 40g worth of mana potions and only scored third place in the healing meter instead of first (due to lack of mana). But it's still cheaper then 2 respeccs worth 50g. Next time I bring more dark runes.
---
Prot requires one consecration in holy, without it dungeon tanking is basically impossible. Improved RF is also a necessity if your group has DPS that deserve their name and you don't want to spent 30+ seconds worth of drinking between trash pulls.
---
30pts Ret + 11 pts holy is basically a requirement to do damage that deserves that name. This is not because the Ret tree is so good but mostly because paladins damage without talents is incredible low. 
---
If you want to be a dungeon all-star focus hard on tank+heal and ignore DPS. Thats what I've been doing and I never missed being able to do damage because another DPS is just one yell away.
---
Or just respecc once a month. Given solid gear a paladin can pretty much always fall back to healing if necessary no matter the build. This will likely change later with the release of BWL/AQ/Naxx due to longer fights but atm spending points in holy is simply optional or a way to pad out bad gear.
---
Tldr mage
---
Enemy priest mind controls troll, enemy paladin buffs them.
---
aids UI
---
The thread was talking about tanks charging to tank dungeons. Also, I've seen one paladin tank in a raid, used buffs to gain agro, very weird to watch.
---
elemental fires on stalagg is 7g+ right now, and that is a hugely horde dominated server.   
---
Farming ZF ruined the games economy.
---
I always made sure to spit at DK who were on that quest for RP reasons.
---
Glad I helped mate, hunter is quite complex at times. I use arcane shot sometimes too while doing princess, but it really isn t mana effective. 
---
Also, you might wanna bring some sagefish delight to get some mana regen during the kiting so you can spam more abilities.
---
Have fun!

Would it make sense to eventually add Horde-heavy high pop PVP Server to Alliance-heavy PVE Server free transfers as an option?
---
I mean, I don't imagine there would be *that* many people taking up that offer, but since PVP skews horde and PVE skews alliance it seems like it'd make sense as a way of siphoning off whatever small percent of the population decided PVP isn't for them but rerolling isn't worth it.
---
I'm pretty sure server transfers supported PVP-to-PVE anyways, though I wouldn't care if they wanted to do free PVE-to-PVP alliance-only transfers either.
---
Shadow burn and death coil are essential to a raiding warlock as well.
---
She raids and ninjas loot in the vid. It’s gold.
---
Those people are wrong. I absolutely hate wasting time trying to find my way up a stupid hill or around a mountain path because it's impossible to see from the ground mounts. Flying mounts were mandatory for TBC good luck getting around highly populated areas like netherstorm without one. The aggro alone was enough to make you crazy.
---
You're not doing it for DPS. You're doing it for the control. 75% slow for 5 secs in a huge area (with Permafrost) is freaking insane.
---
The reality is no one likes rogues. They come off as arrogant ninja fucks with no honor. Not saying that is you but that is the preconceived notion of the class
---
Played alot of hunter in retail, and vanilla so avoiding them at moment.
---
I don't like tanking due to the pressure of leading raids 99% of time. Well has guilds ive been in past.

---
Having both bite and claw on doesn't benefit dps. In a typical pve fight, whether it's solo or in a dungeon, having both active works out to be roughly the same dps as having just one active. Further, it doesn't really matter which between bite and claw you pick for pve (claw is slightly better in pvp because more frequent attacks = more chances to push back enemy spellcasting) as long as you only pick one at a time, and pair it with growl when you're not in a group.
---
So just pick one between bite and claw and stick with it, and turn on growl when solo.
---
Like he had something time do with it. Lol

Which is against reddit rules

World bosses will be fun. Kek

Just say yes lol

If their whole guild had 10+ hours queues i doubt they wouldn't transfer. Let them flame, they are idiots for creating chars on high pop servers on the winning side. With not doing anything more people will leave.
---
As a fellow person who gets paid to stare at a screen, I can't recommend flux enough for letting eye fatigue.
---
Following in game loot rules and actions isn’t “””ninjaing”””
---
It's a shitshow and I'm glad I'm playing a rogue.  I do wish it were more balanced for sure. Being Alliance, I'd rather it be Horde heavy than Alliance heavy though.   
---
The funny thing is, even though the Horde dominate the server, they still feel the need to call in reinforcements if they die once. You sure showed me, a level 37, by calling in a level 60 to camp me! So proud!
---
I did on my main. I have a 60 mage that i used to attempt to attach the scope. Says "too low item level" Item levels are not even in vanilla wow, that didnt come until 3.2
---
I honestly googled if I missed something. I was like "Wait, what do you mean? She was supposed to tell me more? Where is my totem quest?" To be exact, I didn't realize this back when I played, because I immediatly got this rites quest and thought this was the air totem quest.
---
Which is ironic because you're ignorant here. Which fits perfectly with most the classic player base.
---
They never become immune to damage. They pause attacking you before going to 1hp and then go back to it. Okay way of testing, or at least gauging, how much dmg you deal, since you can keep hitting them forever. If they do despawn it has a long timer.
---
Thank you JoJo's posse, for caring enough to reach out. 
---
Much Love
---
I've been selling sets for 100g - it's pissed a lot of people off. I don't want to spend hours on end trying to get max profit when I'm afk 90% of the time farming dinos.
---
We use a system where every raider created a list of the items they want, In priority of how they value them. We made a web site to sort each boss and item where everyone can see it. 
---
When an item drops everyone with it ranked as their #1 item rolls until everyone with that specific item as #1 has it then it goes to people with it at #2 and so on. 
---
It’s fair, you control your own destiny besides RNG of the items actually dropping. It’s transparent and everyone knows exactly when they will get every item, assuming RNG again. Loot distribution also takes like 10 seconds after a boss.
---
Disciplin Priests were also intended to be a melee specc. Which is why there is gear with strength for cloth users early on.
---
Is art allowed in this sub?
---
I'm having trouble with sweeping strikes on my warrior.
---
More often than not the enemy nearby doesn't take any damage.  I try to get both mobs in front of me, but either stacked on top of each other or a little apart I hit sweeping strikes and probably 50% of the time the 2nd Mob just doesn't get hit and the buff times out.  
---
There's no indication that the attack "missed" (or that they dodged/parried it).
---
Any tips? Is there a trick to positioning that I'm missing?
---
Just use the other flight path at entrance/exit of the cave to moonglade :)
---
that's not reserving tho.
---
Yea let the guy with 260g to his name win the eye via roll and not make it til AQ comes out
---
Besides the dungeons requiring them for access you literally walk every zone during leveling. Not sure there is much of difference.
---
Im a fan of the world of Warcraft, the unuverse, the IP itself (well, up to WotLK anyway)
---
I was playing and replaying Warcraft 3 for funsies long before WoW came out so i loved characters like Thrall and Rexxar and Rokhan and Gul'dan and more. 
---
That and trolls are fuggin cool
---
If you see someone moonwalking, chances are everything is perfectly normal on their screen. I had a buddy moonwalk next to me without him knowing. So it's most likely just a client side bug. It fixed itself for me when he relogged.

You cant put it on a non BoE, thats why the choices are venomstrike with +3 or little timmy's with +7

Problem is it takes 30 seconds to craft 1 mask, so you’ll be  be looking at ~24g/h which is alright if you are afking but otherwise it’s not that great
---
It would make more sense if he celebrated after his roll then lost. But rolling and losing has nothing to do with his name. So you are justified in not understanding the post, because OP is really reaching here.
---
Go alch if you are gonna farm herbs. make free action potions, limited invulnerable pots and swiftness pots. lw doesn’t make money outside the salt shaker cd and devilsaur set which drops in price everyday.
---
If threat is a problem just equip more dps gear. You do have more dps than a prot warr, and that helps your threat. If its just normal ads, losing aggro is usually fine unless you let the healer get aggro.
---
And If it's single target, you have more threat than a prot warr.
---
Fury warriors are also after cadav, for the record. It's the best piece outside of savage glad chain and if youre just trying to gear up for raids its smarter to go after cadav first.

Now imagine that your class has a reputation of weeping the group,  has no real aoe, and whose CC can't compete with sap or poly, or even shackle.

Same!
---
I really dislike this mentality. I’m casual AF and I really like that there are things in this game that I’ll never have the time to achieve. It makes the more interesting and flavorful to see those rare few people running by with a High Warlord title etc, or a legendary item.
---
Everyone doesn’t need to be able to do every single thing. At least with these titles when you look at someone who has achieved it you can think ”wow this person went hard as fuck, good for them”. When I see someone with Sulfuras or Thunderfury I just think “wow look at this luck sack”.

All these splitraids are just to funnel loot to the maincore of players from the guild, if youre hardcore enough and spend the time to set up a second raid, your not going to give away gear to some random guy joining the guild yhat hit 60 a week ago.
---
Ez, never join a group where anything is reserved because reservations are dumb.
---
Not LW.  The crest of gold with that comes with getting recipes early, and even the 3 day cooldown on it nets under 20g these days.
---
Alchemy has endless customers.  Pots in vanilla sell like drugs IRL.
---
That buff though...
---
I mean... it's manifestly evident that I don't give a shit about karma.
---
I do give a shit about sock-puppeting, though. One of the signs of it is a pattern in the vote totals.
---
That's not why I think you're sock-puppeting, btw.
---
Lots of classes have 0 reason to pug it.  Tanks just get to use their role to extort money from the group.
---
Yes you can easily stealth there but I’m not sure if 1 fire elemental or 2 is guarding it.  
---
You could probably solo 1 but 2 might be a bit hard.
---
YOU stopped reading there. Lol
---
I mean I'm legitimately just me, so its entertaining to me how you got to that conclusion.
---
top meme because so damn true
---
Mankrik is a really good server.
---
How do you get to 2 hours a week? Sure if you only raid MC it will be 2 hours a week at some point. But when BWL comes out I will run 5 hours of BWL and 3 hours of MC + Ony a week most likely. And by the time ZG comes out it will be even more.
---
Sorry for the genocide afterwards :p
---
This is also incorrect. WoW is the casual game, yes. The intent was to make 90% of the game accessible to the masses, and leave that 10% for the hardcore people.
---
Modern WoW philosophy is to make 99.9999999999999999999999999999999% for the masses.
---
&gt;Thanks for proving my point tho. I should just roll a warrior if so many people are so clueless.

hahahaha no
---
Not the safest post to be on for you, I guess. You better run!
---
Let him wear his delusional nostalgia glasses in peace.
---
Besides annihilator (crazy expensive) bone slicing is about as good as it gets until ony (and your war dps would hate you for taking it)
---
You can always get a second account.  
---
Corpse running is not a good plan since you would have to run into orange or purple.
---
I don't mind. I was horde on a medium pop server in vanilla that had a 2-2.5 to 1 alliance heavy ratio.
---
But you could still only get games during prime time, and even then the queues could still be 30m because it was only really premades that queued. Which meant that you end up waiting 30m for WSG and be matched against a sweaty full t2 guild.. So all the randoms on your team just leave. 
---
And nobody queued for AV because it favors alliance so much
---
Crossrealm BGs was such a saving grace. Fuck those people that had zero clue what it was like because they happened to luckily pick a better server
---
Cloak of shadows
---
&gt; Is it going to be rough leveling holy?
---
yes, unless you are doing only dungeons
---
&gt; Can I heal dungeons from 1-55 as a Ret pally?
---
yes easily, you just need to buy some int gear off the AH.
---
I would think druid, that way you can fill a variety of roles as needed.
---
The rage cost of Heroic Strike is more around 25-30 when you factor in the lost potential rage.
---
Damn you got that right, I got a huge portion of 1KN done in that hour.
---
This honestly threw me off a lot about FFXIV. Such long fucking GCD. The other part being that healers are required to DPS.
---
Orc rogue and Tauren hunter.
---
&gt; I mean I'm legitimately just me
---
True. And you have multiple accounts.
---
&gt; its entertaining to me how you got to that conclusion.
---
You evidently don't know how I got to that conclusion.
