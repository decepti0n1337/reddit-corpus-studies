Reset limits?  You mean clearing trash?  Scarm was just farming crowd pummeler over and over with it.

Get the remote app, that problem dissapears with ease and before you get home you are already at the character selection screen ready to connect to a real, populated Azeroth.
---
yes but that's kinda what i'm saying, random people must have found this in beta and people spending time looking for exploits definitely have.
---
Sincerely bummed that wall walking was fixed. I get it though, exploitable.
---
A Mage losing to a Warrior is like Scissors losing to Paper.
---
It almost is really. Lately at least on stalagg it seems there are two layers max

---
I agree with your observation 
---
I normally would have the server favorited and as you stated then select the characters on the server
---

---
Shucks, as I think of it I will delete the pre select characters on the other servers and see if it makes a difference for myself and will share update
---
Unless someone chimes in
---
I use miks scrolling battle text and just disable everything bar outgoing heals ect then just move it to somewhere you like on your ui and change the visuals if you so choose :)
---
Was invited to a group for RFC yesterday and just needed a tank. I thought for sure we were gonna sit there for an hour. All of a sudden our priest finds a LVL 19 warrior tank and we all wept
---
What was your alternative to layering. Honestly so far layering seems to have been pretty smooth. I didn’t know what to expect but layering has caused very little problems and alleviated server stress significantly allowing us to all play

---
This a million time. What makes classic so unique is the social aspect and not the "grind this mob that has a 3% quest item drop rate oh and I need 10 of the items" quests.
---
Lets just say Gnomeregan was a good thing…
---
But doesn't that mean you have leveled in all three starting areas for your faction now?
---
Yeah... the world layering problem is already done the damage, so there’s nothing we can do.  So be it.  But repeatedly spawning raid bosses is clearly not ok.
---
Exactly... get a guild make some friends and you can easily get the WW axe.
---
You can grind. It's quite relaxing really.
---
Same exact thing happened here with my guild on Whitemane. We finally reached the consensus to move to Arcanite Reaper while I was at work today. I come home to get ready for the switch, and the option is gone?? There was no warning or anything, and now our guild is fucked down the middle. I was hoping Classic might be a step in the right direction for blizz, but it seems like the same shit is carrying over. Really hoping this gets resolved so I don't have to cancel my sub.
---
That's why I'm building a balanced setup until I can get geared. Only had to respec once because I chose the wrong talent by accident and I'm doing fine
---
A debuff that makes them hostile to everyone regardless of PvP servers or flagging. Unable to initiate these fights themselves ofc.
---
Optimal is after gear at 60, but its your character, do what you want
---
Well dungeon spamming isn't an exploit its a part of the game and I wasn't sure if people knew that or not seemed like people were getting mad at farming dungeons or somethin
---
 /Leave 2. Problem solved. 
---
But if you can’t handle sicial interaction, you shouldn’t play a MMO. It’s designed to be played together.
---
Glad they deleted, what I'm hoping is that they also tracked down any trades that were done and deleted those items as well.
---
We need layers on the full servers unless you have a better idea.
---
8 characters! How do you have the time?
---
Druids are far better at leveling over warrior (solo or otherwise)
---
As for 5-mans and endgame, druids are great in 5-mans, and great as offtanks, they are a bit worse off as maintanks. While they can, without block and being below crit cap makes it a bit more intense.
---
For sure, go druid, druids are far better than paladin tanks endgame. Paladins are stuck in the 5-man tank role for good. They CANNOT raid boss tank in any capacity as they are lacking a taunt, and enough threat generation.
---
didn't work
---
I don't know lol I am decision anxiety.
---
Don't act like you're the one open to "DISCUSSION" when you're also the one who told him to GTFO because he dares to like a feature that's not in classic. Especially when he admits it shouldn't be in the game.
---
were you thinling of posting their reactions on reddit when you gave out the wands?
---
Questie
---
Don't see that possible since the devs are against dungeon finder, which probably uses the same string needed for this
---
Pretty sure thats a nope
---
floating healing numbers aren't in classic. best bet is to use a combat text mod.
---
You scarmtank did it on his stream.  Pretty high profile guy if you ask me.
---
No I’m not talking about queues. I’m talking 15000 people queues and when you get in the zones are so over crowded that 300 people are competeting for the same 8 mobs. It would have taken you a legit day to get to level five. It would have been an absolute disaster
---
For wands I would just go off dmg per se and and stats
---
Doubt it, I've never read up on honor buddy. I know glider had waypoint grinding originally, cause I remember reporting people in felwood &amp; un'goro.
---
Google is failing me hard, though. I'm guessing the wayback machine won't have anything either.
---
We all know that recruiting people randomly on a whim makes for the best guilds with the tightest groups and the fastest raid clears.
---
Right, and what percentage of those who abused it received this long a ban? And how many didn't at all?
---
I'm surprised to see a 30 day honestly, I'd imagine this person was pretty egregious with it :o
---
Supply is inflated via layering exploit, demand stays the same, over-supply drives market price of exploited goods down.  
---
This is the effect of the exploit.    
---
Saying this will have little impact is incorrect as we don't know the scale of the exploit.  
---
Saying the impact will be for a short time is false as we don't know the scale of the exploit.
---
omg this is a exploit u should b banned smh
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Wall walking was patched in 1.9.
---
Wall jumping was a thing for a long time after, and is noticeably absent due to 1.13 being based on the legion client.
---
The guy who was killed had been stealing skins for over two hours. He wasn’t making any attempt to do his own killing, just griefing Leshraque and I expect griefing others as well.
---
Confirm. Hillsbrad is nasty and I’ve found badlands occasionally wild. Stv has been pretty good still
---
my third comment? no. lol also how is bitching about people leaving mythic dungeons not valid? dont queue up if you're gonna leave.  dont be a moron kid.
---
ElvUI or TukUI. Either will give you this effect if set up correctly.
---
There is legitimately a guild called &lt;BUTTHOLES AND WEINERS&gt; on Blaumeux Alliance.
---
&gt;  Take out points from my improved aspect of the hawk 
---
Always keep 5/5 Imp AOTH. It's one of the best talents in the tree.
---
So getting a free reset and a extra week of loot was just a bonus? Could of left the loot if u had integrity...... u knew exactly what u were doing.
---
Incredible.
---
LOL +1
---
That’s so petty lmao
---
this is unfortunately very true. at least the man got his croc skin...
---
Since wow is free to level 20, do you even need to own the game to play classic or do you just need a new subscription?
---
What kind of hotspot do you use? Off of your phone or a separate device. Been looking for something to use at work.
---

---
Thanks fellow priest!
---
Ya i do realize that but that still doesnt take away form the fact that BfA isn't good and they ruined what they did with Legion.
---
Ah sorry I misunderstood the gist of your post then. However I disagree that only a small number knew it - this will heavily affect the economy. Most of the people held back items from AH to not make it obvious something was wrong, if you take a look now there's tons and tons of high end recipes for very little money.
---
Like others said, it's not really the same as the common ninja move reaction to taking drops from bosses and such or master looting them suddenly at the end to a buddy.  It's just a dick move in general.  Like watching that mage about to pyro a mob to pull and then a warrior runs up from behind, charges and tags it.  Dick moves but not ninjas.
---
Well you are easy to mess with
---
So, think about it this way.  If you're one of the people who will do anything to get ahead, are you still going to want to play when you're a month behind?
---
Hell yea man, thanks a ton
---
As long as you get that skin, you win!
---
It's better than nothing, but really?? At that level??
---
 I think every person has once made a group of macros just like this to annoy randoms :D
---
Sorry to hear it, it really does take a lot of the fun out of classic. Best thing we can do is try to make some noise about it I guess.
---
Why exactly would this piss anyone off? Sorry, anyone who doesn't have a stick up their butt, an IQ of 70 or an incredible feeling of entitlement?  
---
    
---
You're aware that hunters use mana in this version of the game right?
---
Love it!
---
Could make an add on that did this - so long as everyone has the add on.
---
ELI5?
---
Checking in. Thought the ah would slow down by now but nope profit margins are brutal
---
Could definitely be worse, but hopefully there will be some sort of fix in the future. Definitely don't feel like rerolling at this point lol
---
Innervate is used twice on long fights. Use it the second that the mana won’t be wasted and you get a second use.
---
Ah, gotcha. I'm at 3 days, 10 hours rn. I only played WoW for the 2 week trial back in like 2007, so I forgot everything. I didn't even know about addons until a few days ago, that's cut my quest times down quite a bit. I guess if I remembered classic WoW and was good at it I could level up significantly faster.
---
Ok never mind then

Zandalar Tribe (EU RPPVP)
---
After the reset today i was getting empty loot windows from non-pool fishing. I tried Tanaris coast, Feralas inner and costal, and Hinterlands inner and costal. It still skills you up though. The pools finished only dropped stranglekelp and mithril bound boxes.
---
This is why I love Reddit.
---
Next time it happens open trade with them, it will cancel his action.
---
If those work in combat, you've solved my problem. I would even message someone over at Wowhead to see if those could be added to the rogue guide. The thing with the double press is because of that GCD. It was put in place to keep rogues from swapping to a sword in the instant they cast ambush. I'm sure you can imagine the damage difference there lol. Thanks a lot man.
---
i don't get why people act like wow streamers don't get banned or suspended. haven't they heard of swifty, athene, reckful? they don't give content creators any sort of special privilege and never have. the reason the big top streamers don't get banned is because quite simply... their entire livelihood is based off of playing world of warcraft so they don't do things that would put them at risk of being banned.
---
Well aren't you a peach.
---
Best course of action would be a complete item forfeit and no ban; not even a single minute!
---
Not even a single minute say you?
---
Yes, exactly! Just let them continue to play... but stealth nerf all the chars on the account to do 20% less damage and healing permanently but don’t even announce it! NOW THAT WOULD BE EPIC!
---
Blizzard "We fuck up, you pay the price!"
---
That’ll do? More like my everyday ms...
---
Is it possible to create a macro that toggles between pet follow and pet stay? I don't think castsequence can accomplish that, but I'm curious if there's another way to do it.
---
How are people able to exploit layers in instances? I was trying to kill a guy for a quest in Badlands and kept getting ganked by an alliance 60. A friend invited me to a group and it changed my layer. Does that count as exploiting?
---
Not really when it lets you farm rares, bypass mob spawn rates and get rare nodes. It's only different because it's generally less people doing it at a time. Still a crap system and why I've been against the fact layering hasn't had a significant CD associated with it from the get go.  
---
You're still abusing an in game system to save yourself time, it's just a few minutes instead of a day/a week. Still crap.
---
As a new healer I'm interested in hearing more about these mouseover macros
---
I'm saying I have a love/hate relationship with addons in WoW. If they were always option I would have no qualms, however over time Blizz started implementing certain features of addons into the games making it so there was no way to avoid them.
---
/moo from a fellow Tauren fren :D
---
It is your third post not comment. Do I need to screen shot it for you?
---
So I have a version of the all in one melee macro but it isn't working properly. Everything but mongoose bite is working. Anyone know why mongoose isn't (and yes I wait for when it says I've dodged, still not casting)
---
Your Warrioring was stronger than his Maging.
---
I like how you went directly to the nuclear option instead of trying to reason with them. It's not like it's BoP... could have easily traded it to you.
---
you're a rogue getting camped?
---
This smells like you're just asking to get flamed so I wont even comment on how fucking retarded you are
---
No your supposed to say 'lol"
---
Once you saw it, you could not un-see it. Then that movement style really jumped out to you.
---
What ui thing is that for all your spells
---
Looks like it gets you out of non humanoid form and casts entsbgling entangling roots on the target your mouse is hovering over OR if it's a friendly it will cast regrowth.
---
I mean, I wasn't gonna' sugar-coat anything... Are you one of those people that think everyone needs coddled and told "there there, my darling? It'll all be fine and everyone will place nice and fairly."?
---
K.
---
Pretty sure you can just download an addon that you can set options up to ignore every single social aspect of the game.
---
what, you want to run back to the bank that often? I keep two sets and just advertise myself as a healer or tank and then put on the appropriate gear. after the dungeons over, I put my bear/cat gear right back on.
---
Will the streamers who have blatantly exploited this be banned?  Doubtful.
---
If you enjoy that over questing, go for it.
---

---
At this point healing dungeons would be the best way, ZF/Mara till 50 then move on to the next thing, once you hit 52-53 you could start doing BRD. And so on and so forth.
---
Its probably a little early to be recruiting heavily for raiding I feel like. If your guild wasn't full of nolifers planning to get 60 ASAP and raid immediately then you're probably just in something of a lull where most other players are about 30-40 and so are a few weeks off from really trying to find a guild. You'll probably have a lot more interest in the next weeks as more of the casual players hit 60 and want to start raiding some
---
Me too, technically :D
---
Tiananmen core
---
Shame
---
But those guys abusing for black lotuses won't exactly stop without some form of punishment. So now, maybe not a problem, but later on if you let them continue? You better bet it'll be an issue.  
---
Neither is good for the game, justifying one and not being okay with the other is senseless and thus the opposite is also true. Layer hopping is bad. It's for people to be able to play with their friends if they log onto different layers, nothing more.  
---
Who has friends that want to change group often enough to even reasonably allow what layering is currently able to provide? Absolutely no one. It's abuse of the system and it's all crap regardless how small fries you think the independent abuses are.
---
I always wondered when I see truck driving setups why you don’t just get a laptop?
---
How are you getting camped by a Hunter? It's not like the area you can resurrect in is that small.
---
Why are you calling me names? Jesus... Look at the level difference.. He's literally fucking red and a hunter. 1 spell prevents my stealth.
---
Would you say they exploited the bug?
---
Well lucky you I just took all that gold and leveled up professions, bought some recipes, trained some skills, and got my epic mount.
---
I like how you just jumped him while he was just chilling. Gotta love horde players lmao no honor at all
---
I think I disagree with this.  Whether or not we agree with the solution, bliz hotfixed world layering to have an incrementing timer each time you layer.  So they seem to think using it as currently available is acceptable behavior.  I'm trying to reserve my own judgement from the comment.
---
It's not even a ban yet. Just a suspension while they investigate. He might recive more punishment.
---
Possibly.... But now I'm the founder of &lt;NyQuil and Neglect&gt;
---
So I'm content.
---
Wrong, that's their entire punishment.
---
It certainly made smaller targets. Not many people lazy enough to need a bot yet sill be fussed with creating and setting up profiles.
---
Tldr?
---
This pleases me greatly.
---
It was addressed with a free transfer.
---
Until I see evidence of that kind of profiteering I will continue to be skeptical that people have made insane profits that would ruin the economy of a server. Blizzard have the power to remove the gold they have made from this or ban the player permanently to remove the gold from the economy.
---
at least put out a public Banhammer lost to publicly shame them, it may deter that kind of behavior in the future
---
There’s way more trees than that.
---
Personally after elwynn I just alternated between Westfall and Loch Modan whenever one zone was starting to get too high for me. Worked like a charm
---
But who cares if you are ‘behind’? You already are. People were level 60 almost 3 weeks ago, people cleared MC or people have become the Scrooge McDuck of the server and made a ‘fortune’.
---
It’s not like there aren’t enough people in a few weeks/months to complete certain quests. It will only be easier to quest when less people are around than today.
---
Just play whatever you like.
---
Half the problem is layering. Last week I was in STV and it was 95% horde. I switch layer and it’s nothing but alliance. If layering was removed it would have been fairly balanced.
---
Percentages affect larger numbers more than smaller ones. Frenzy is a percentage attack speed increase. Not sure why that’s difficult to grasp. The dps is normalized before talents.
---
Tagging
---
Oooh , okay. And I assume people have found a way to hop between layers to get things without waiting for respawn times?
---
[removed]
---
That's true, it's technically a prequel to Diablo 3. I meant "sequel" as in a continuation of the Diablo line, which is another definition of sequel. Like Borderlands Pre-Sequel was a sequel to the Borderlands games but was not a sequel to the Borderlands story at the time. Both games continued the theme, but not the story.
---
Its almost like....wait for it...Vanilla! No amount of hyperbole is going to convince people that sharding is good. The queues worked fine for the original.
---
Where to you pick or skin devilsaur leather? New to skinning
---
Horde? I’m in a similar situation on Blaumeux as a guild leader. We pick up maybe one member a week and at this rate...
---
he literally got the ok from GM's in his stream chat and in game to do his mc clear.
---
thank you!
---
As Alliance, Badlands was goddamn terrible for me.
---
I spent many hours outside of STV intent on skipping it only to land in Badlands where it was probably worst. The map is small, horde is everywhere due to proximity Kargath and bored level 60s mean they camp all of the western half of Badlands and you can't get anything done as Alliance.
---
So basically run dunegons til 60 is my best option at this point?
---
Yeah sorry but you’re very wrong. In WoD there was a notorious group on stormrage duping spectral tigers and I unapologetically bought one off them for 950k at the time. It is still in my mount collection to this day. The price of tigers is now the new gold cap of a little under 10 mil. Blizzard doesn’t punish people for trading. They can’t prove if the buyer knew how the items or gold were obtained.
---
I believe the other side is a nod to Buckaroo Bonzai and the 8th dimension, a chessy B movie from the 80s.
---
You have just inspired me to be a truck driver.
---
That's unfortunate..
---
I actually have one for my rogue that yells “gotta go fast”
---
medium pop servers are going to feel like they're overpopulated when they remove layering. the numbers of people on those servers is higher than high pop servers in vanilla.....it's a lot of people
---
high is gonna always teeter on full with a queue so i'd go with a medium one
---
Sound like you don’t want to pvp. Should reroll.
---
The best thing to do in this case is just to report and ignore the player that sends you these channel invites. That way at least Blizzard can see who’s spamming this garbage.
---
I managed to avoid the spam until yesterday.  An hour into my play tonight, I was hit three times by this bullshit.  Twice by the same group, who boasted 300+ members as a selling point.  I'm thinking I may just join a rando group to stop the spam, and just bring up some weird shit.  Like chicken nipples or something.
---
I've always played on a pvp server, so obviously I created a toon on a pvp realm in classic, got to level 30 and got corpsecamped for hours, spent an entire weekend getting ganked as a lvl 30 in tarren mill and 1k needles.
---
Simply too frustrating, so now im playing on a normal server, might go back to pvp server, when/if things settle down.
---
striker's mark is BIS for rogues until Naxx
---
Gotta let the toes hang out, how else are you going to play the piano
---
How long can you play before your truck batteries run low ?
---
Wtf?!
---
I would also like to know
---
Bring in some boys to help deal with him. Call for backup or help or whatever. 
---
If you were literally getting killed in the same spot for an hour that’s partly your fault.
---
1g is 1g
---
your logic would be sound if i was ONLY killing alliance.
---
Fix layers. That is all. Layering has a purpose. None of the excess layer hopping was part of it. Any form of doing it outside of why they put it in can be considered abuse.
---
You're able to sort incoming whispers into their own tab at least. Stops you from seeing them before you want to.
---
Though I’m all for witch hunting, I’m not really a fan of permabans. That is actually REALLY severe. 30 days is a long time without wow, fucking 8h is a long time without getting the fix lol. But perma’ing peoples accounts for exploiting this just sounds really really harsh. People can and usually do learn from mistakes, and on the positive side of things, we kinda need the type of people trying out crazy shit to bring these bugs and glitches to light to be fixed
---
World pvpve are the best. I’ll help you quest for now. Next time, it’s go time...with a tip of the hat.
---
Use the transfer if you don't wanna wait. That's why it's there
---
It's just frustrating when people non-stop gank. In my case this dude is red to me. I can't fight back. Literally I say something about this and people call me "retarded" and flame me for no reason. Idiots that talk big talk on the internet.
---
This was a great response. Thank you. 
---
I’m gonna give the weird hybrid spec a go to see what it’s like to play it. Then I’ll switch over to a proper raid spec when it’s time to start raiding.
---
Did they kill the free transfer from congested servers??
---
layering is similar to sharding but not as dramatic. a layer is an instance within the server to better balance the player base around the world. 
---
layering is less dynamic than sharding. with sharding it will continue to change which shard you're on to better populate your current shard; layering is a little more static in that you won't change off your layer if the population on it dies down a little bit. 
---
the reason this is an issue is because you can manipulate the layers to your benefit. player a is on layer x, player b is on layer y. player b has no mobs for the quest they want to do on their layer so they ask in world chat for a layer swap, player b gets invited by player a (who is on a separate layer), player b loads into their layer and suddenly the world is now filled with the mobs they were after
---
this is a very basic and less nefarious way to exploit the system. there's no indication for which layer you on so theoretically you can join someone's party and you won't change layer, this means you're sharing the same layer.
---
this write up might be a little inaccurate, this is just my understanding of it
---
I believe it's elvui
---
Seems like an impossible task. 
---
What if you bought a pattern that was acquired via this bug, but made that item with your own reagents? And now you might not even have that profession anymore if it was a tailoring chest for example
---
Excuse me but tf is going on in this ss?
---
Why is it that whenever I aggro an enemy, and I try to run they will literally chase me to the ends of the earth to kill me.. why? Why do they chase me for so far? and when I think I'm safe after running 10 miles they are still on me like wtf??
---
I mean clearly bringing up and issue means I don't like the game. Sorry I'm just too low IQ for you apparently and can't tell what I want. Thanks for enlightening me oh brilliant one. We are all but peasants in your kingdom of vast intelligence. How dare I give criticism or bring up a problem. Clearly that is what haters say and if there are problems I should just be an intellectual like you and just ignore it. 
---
Microwave caught on fire? Eh its not a big deal its just a microwave, don't worry about putting it out lets just let it solve itself... oh... the curtains are on fire and its spreading? Nah its fine lets not complain cause that would be complaining and we know its better to shut up and be happy with it and everything will be A-Okay then!
---
Yes, clearly the reason people play Classic is because of evil things like transmog or hell, even to escape new races-- not because of the old design philosophy, atmosphere, lack of flying mounts, leveling pace, buffs, and countless other reasons to play Classic that  aren't just dumb QoL things.
---
You're an idiot if you think the response to people wanting small QoL things is to say "REEEE THOSE ARE IN RETAIL GO BACK TO RETAIL YOU NORMIE" like a fucking 12 year old.
---
Well at least it looks like you’re doing it while you’re not driving. Nice setup!
---
Some people say “bullshit debuffs”, some say “RPG elements”. It doesn’t have to be easy to be good.
---
that and wished we had more bag space
---
Paladin damage drops off hard after 40 so yeah I would personally. I was doing ZF today as tank and as boring as it was I could've gotten two levels in 5-6 hours easily.
---
Welcome to Archeage!
---
Not a jail, put up stockades by the main gate and we can throw vegetables at them
---
No other servers do not.  Just the full servers that people refuse to take a free transfer off of.
---
Any items gained from this exploit will be deleted.
---
Any gold gained from vendoring will be removed.
---
Any gold gained from Auction House will
---
likely be reverted (the buyer loses the item/skill/recipe and regains their gold)
---
resto really isnt necessary. I've been healing 5mans with an int/spr set fully spec'd feral. currently lv47. I get complimented on my heals, and I've gotten a couple different guild invites

When in doubt, run Scarlet Monastery a lot and get lucky on greens and blue greed rolls.

If you use the term toxic to describe anything other than a chemical/compound you are a douche. It's a buzzword with you kids.

"Waaaaaah! I don't like something, it's toxic"

Dumb kunts
---
I stopped reading after like 3 sentences, I'm on Skeram. It's not that bad. Haven't been camped much if at all. Died a bunch to groups or high levels but that shit happens. I've got way more kills than deaths and some hilarious griefs of my own. 
---
10/10 Quit being a bitch
---
Subreddits can be so fickle. I made a post about layer exploits and the overwhelming response was "it doesn't effect you, get over it."
---
there's so many mobs, and they respawn so fast that it makes it worth. if you have a good warlock who knows how much the group can handle, you just get wave after wave after wave of 20-50 mobs. the best of groups can get upwards of 100k xp per hour.
---
Yeah layering is almost 20 years old ofc. And mistakes is a synonym for constantly doing.

Okay so does steam link only work if you are on the same network as your cpu? So I couldn’t do this at work during lunch? I tried today but it never connected.   I get home and try and it worked fine.  Also, how’d you change the ABXY to WASD in steam link? I can’t find that option
---
Since the other one has locked comments I just wanted to say I liked your comic. Not sure how a hand drawn comic of a wow dungeon group is low effort compared to the same reposted memes with a class icon over someones face but bad mods are gonna mod badly

By doing dungeons
---
Don’t roll on a PvP server then. It’s all part of the experience
---
Invite people you and your guildies quest and run dungeons with. Best way to grow a community and not just a bunch of ransoms
---
it was not like this in vanilla. but it is like this atm to "Advertise" low pop realms and encourage ppl to move off of full realms.

"He kept running OOM before he could kill me, then bolting to force a reset. Point is: No."
---
Your friend is bad. There's no reason for it to ever OOM at lvl 60 with mana gems and evocation.
---
How much loot did you personally get, and was it on a guild run or pug.
---
Thank you!
---
Can't speak for everyone but I've had fun.  Sure the queues suck and there's a lot of rough edges that need to be smoothed out but I don't feel like I've wasted my time.
---
I’m actually happy most mages only know how to AOE farm and not actually play their class. Will be fun in pvp.
---
 Blizzard's server logs will show you as having assisted with his exploit.
---
Couldn't they do that if they got perma banned as well?
---
At 40, go full prot for blessing of sanc and holy shield.
---
Tools to hardcast/control a fight, not just spells in general. Every class has a long list of shit if you just list their spells...that's obviously not what's being discussed here.
---
Warlocks are countered by Warriors by the way. Good luck getting off a hardcast when your target is fear immune and has pummel.
---
Because its not leather. I get the Agi stat. But I avoid cloth and roll on agi/stam leather pieces
---
Arathi highlands!
---
hindsight is 20/20
---
I keep having to tell people this in dungeons, constantly seeing range pull then run away while the tank tries to follow.
---
I’ve heard there has been 10 sunrises in this time
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
This is what Blessing of Protection is for
---
can you post some ss here please? i wanna see O.O
---
I wouldn’t even want the gold at this point. Part of the fun is earning the stuff yourself.
---
Obligatory addon question, what are you using for minimap?
---
It being a war zone is what makes it so popular amongst a lot of people. Don’t like it, don’t roll PvP.
---
Upgraded Counter Spell with the talent is a 10-second silence to ALL casting.
---
Make them be naked!
---
I dont think you understand pvp  and pve differences.
---
Either you're too low level or he's trying to share quests further on in the quest chain, every quest in those chains have the exact same quest name so it can be confusing
---
You will not screwed on those specific examples, end game content there is nefarion and ?cromagus? That druids can't tank because of boss mechanics and I think there's something in aq40 you can't tank. But really druids with the classic talent trees can tank everything out right now
---
Everyone can play their own way but this is definitely how i'm playing classic. I just love the world and the RPG of it. It's great to just enjoy myself. I only play on weekends now (mostly) and when I log in Friday night, the first thing I do is burn my rested xp on each character (one of each class) cause I don't care about rushing to the end but i'm just loving the experience again.
---
I was clearing mobs for a chest once a guy ran to it got agro on like 3 mobs and died 😅
---
Wtf, you altoholics really need some ADD meds or something to fix your brain.

I more meant the kind of stuff like "for the next several minutes, all melee attacks against you have a chance to knock you on your ass and stun you, and yes, if your luck is shitty it *will* chain".
---
So when someone asks me for a layer invite, does that count as bannable? Sometimes I see ppl in world/guild chat ask, so I inv.
---
I'd keep a skeptical mind on this one- the email title doesn't match any of the automatic formatting I've ever seen from Blizzard. 
---
Certainly possible it's real, but I'm waiting for further confirmation before believing this.
---
What mods are you using.  I like your ui
---
I have a guild and a handful of IRL friends on this server that I enjoy playing with otherwise I would.
---
This is awesome. I'm kind of jealous. Enjoy!
---
In retail pet feeds you!
---
Gnome here. I have a /lol macro for when I kill Horde because the gnome laugh is insufferably obnoxious.
---
So if it looks better...what’s the tears for? 
---
I mean imo the bandanna is blis, tbh.
---
wtf is happening in this pic
---
It allowed them to clear the same raid multiple times in a single lockout period.  So just 4-7 times the potential drops as if they were playing by the rules.
---
1 less streamer on EU boys. Keep it up.
---
*sells it for 8g to afford mount*
---
Heavy exploiters should have their level go back to 1 honestly
---
Yes, I personaly don't care about tos, I follow my moral codex and I don't find trading gold(farmed with legit methods) for IRL money causing any harm to anybody as it's just change of ownership.
---
Been 15 years, would be nice if the gnomes would do that too.
---
Still afk queueing weeks later. You thought we didn't want it, but we have proven we do.
---
Transfer! You knew before launch this was gonna be the norm.
---
I'm right there with you .....
---
Nah it's.more about people.abusing it for dungeon runs
---
Same issue here. I feel like they mucked something up with the reset last night. I had no issues yesterday.
---
Get the Questie addon and you can look at the world map and it will show you where all the quests are available appropriate to level.  
---
Sometimes if you burn through all the quests available and have nothing left the best thing is to grind some dungeons for a couple levels until more quests become available again.
---
Your hubby drives cross country and your the onw playing wow while he drives and he plays on another laptop when hes done?
---
That’s so sick! Looks oddly cozy and satisfying, makes me want to play there instead of my desk
---
Jokerd was the first player to hit 60.
---
Because Blizzard-Activision doesnt have people review the reports. It's all automated so if you have a few people report it, the system flags and forces a name change.
---
Camping BlackRock Mountain
---
BFA is not doing bad. People saying it is dead are complete idiots. I have been playing both and I can tell you retail is doing fine you can still find a group just as fast as before and their are still plenty of people leveling and doing max level content.
---
At this point little you can do without affecting others. The items they got were sold and now in the world, and what if the exploiters didn't hang unto the gold and spent it on epic mount, bought stuff from AH, etc.
---
We picked it initially not knowing it was the streamer server and now me and my friends have found another group to play with so I’m enjoying it a lot. Would hate to lose a fun crew.
---
Lvl 60s lol.... try questing in STV this weekend. Those are the real stories that need to be heard.
---
I forget to disable aspect of the pact so often...
---
It’s a shame that basically no one is going to appreciate the advanced level of memeier in this comment.
---
That green fortitude just reminded me up the upgraded party wide buffs! I completely forgot!
---
So i've never played Wow before classic and I have no idea what this exploit was... everyone seems to know what it was but me.
---
Ah yeah. I can see why that might confuse some. Maybe if I let it break naturally.

Queue what queue? Took the highroad to a medium server at the first chance i got
---
Can't wait for the "blizzard banned me but I did nothing wrong!" posts
---
I'm not a mathematician, just an engineer, so I could certainly be wrong.
---
 
---
But my goal here is not to calculate *the exact number of kills for a drop* instead I am trying to calculate the point at which "one could reasonably expect a drop."
---
So, to be excessively clear, at no point do I think the game is broken, that I am actually being denied or anything like that. This post is a meme, I undertook an obscenely unlikely task, and have gotten perfectly, reasonably unlucky.
---
To return to the math, i am pretty certain my math holds up for an "expected" drop rate, by calculating the probability for X fails in a row, we can extrapolate the chance for a singular success.
---
For real, I want to get in a guild with someone I’ve played with and actually feel a part of it
---
People are saying they’ve removed a certain amount of layers. There’s still more than one but sometimes it feels like there’s only 2. I’m sitting in the same que at 4700.
---
lmao
---
It does work, helped a fellow priest to do it a couple days ago!
---
1 month is longer than these people have been playing classic. They'll almost certainly start over on a fresh account. A longer ban would not change that. After all, you don't have to purchase the game, only a subscription.
---
Auctionator. You're welcome.
---
Yeah waiting 1.month
---
Impressive ! With 4G and 5G in the futur, playing like this is really perfect &lt;3
---
Wait for real? I'm on krom as a 60 lock and I've never seen him. I kill gnomes for sport though. When's the last time you saw him doing this?
---
I think it could be possible if a multiboxer was somehow running 4-8 dungeons at a time, but what would the strat even be
---
quick note: just realized I typed it wrong. take out the space between Predatory Strikes and the rank
---
peak time on a full server, what did you think would happen? same thing in retail.
---
Yea so you do one layer and one server. I know how it works you dont have to explain it. You roll the dice and let it ride. That is the only right amswer here. You dont invent fixes to non-existent problems because you tHiNk yOu wAnT iT bUt...
---
Lol fucking people. Leave it to engineers to design a fix for a problem no one cares about. Instead of being a jr dev you should just work in PR lol.
---
If you damage them or hit them with any spells / abilities their agro range will reset and they will keep chasing you, if you want them to reset and leave you alone you need to run away without attacking them or doing anything to them, also try running in a straight line away from them, if you go in circles they will keep chasing you
---
thank you
---
my sanity is getting strained, I've promised myself If I hit lvl50 without getting it, I'm giving up.
---
Ever play trucking sim?
---
I'm starting to think its layering thats causing this
---
More important for melee or those who don’t have good sustain. Lower level (green) means you hit more, thus doing more damage and killing faster, meaning less down time having to eat or heal so more xp per hour. There is an addon that Preach talked about he used for leveling his warrior that helps with keeping quests and mobs “in the green” to help with leveling faster
---
&gt; Raise rep for cool rewards

there is no cool reward right now

---
The true is, there isnt much to do if you are not doing pve or pvp.
---
Did you by any chance used to play a Boomkin in TBC?
---
And then you vendored it for 2g. Nice!
---
Do you keep track of your cooldowns in the middle of your UI with bartender/dominos or is it another addon?
---
Why would it be a problem if it gets worse away from me where I won't notice?
---
For the queues to go away after a few weeks.
---
I quit BFA midway through Mythic guild-progression on the first raid (so maybe like 5 months in?) I honestly couldn't stand BFA. The dungeons were really cool and enjoyable, and that was basically the only part of the xpac I liked (raid was fun, too.) I just really felt like they landed on a progression model that was actually pretty fun in Legion (an xpac I thoroughly enjoyed,) and then scrapped all the good parts of that model (gaining "talents" that actually affected your build/rotation,) for a strict grindy and super gear-based progression system that strictly depended on a couple different "talents" on the gear. This also just made the war/titan forging problem significantly more exacerbated. 
---
I didn't play Cata (which I know seems to be heavily disliked,) but I played every other xpac, and BFA is the only one that I stopped playing in the first year of release.
---
it's 5/hour.
---
Idk if hitting him for 6% of his hp is a 2v1, seems like my friend just wanted to share a meal with me.
---
*laughs in medium pop server*
---
Go look at a talent calculator, its a silence for 4 seconds. has 2 ranks, one is a 50% chance to silence, second is 100% chance to silence for 4 seconds.
---
Like another user said, that isn't an opinion.  The key thing to consider is whether or not the claim is falsifiable, meaning, evidence or proof *could* be provided to *verify* the claim as a fact, *independent* of one's beliefs or **opinions**.
---
"The earth is flat" is a truth-claim.  If evidence were provided to verify this claim, it could be supported as a fact.  But simply *believing* it to be true doesn't mean it is an opinion.  If the earth is flat, it's not just flat for you or for me, it would be flat. Period.  It can't be flat for one person and round for another.  Therefore, the *claim itself* is a truth-claim, requiring evidence to back itnup so the rest of us can get on board, *objectively*.
---
&gt;Also a thing to consider about 5-mans is they often don't go as planned. When the healer OOMs it's a shitshow and they run out   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;fast
---
I'm deathly afraid of running dungeons with retail pukes. Just in VC alone, on my mage, I've seen some truly spectacularly... unintelligent people. A rogue, "Stop sheeping so I can bleed everything"- our tank that run was 17... Another warrior who was, ostensibly, the tank running around in leather and cloth ("It looks better") (Yeah, since it was working with the 23 hunter pet tanking stuff... we just kept our mouth shut.)(Competent hunters are great. lets not start \*that\* thread.)
---
It's a pretty hilarious name. I'm more concerned with the people who take the game so seriously they refer to harmless goofballs as cancerous. That's much worse.
---
im fine with asking this in my guild,u know. Exploiting? Im ajusting crowding to level which will be good for my game,u know. Thats not ok that on one layer there are 0 people in whole zone and in another layers - 3 party on boss,which can help u finaly.
---
Boomkin are still a meme spec with the current talents. Yes they can kill stuff but they don't have longevity and they use up mana instead of regenerating ur like the beast shapes
---
Then don’t complain, blizzard warned people that this was going to happen before the servers went live and you guys didn’t listen.
---
On Herod STV wasn't too bad, but those pirates in Tanaris have been a warzone. It's king of the hill with the reward being you can actually finish collecting pirate hats.
---
I just started wow and I am lvl 20...but what ever I do I meet new people and have fun ... I just don't are about xp
---
That looks almost entirely like ElvUI
---
The only night elf I know in the Eastern kingdom is Sylvanas from vanilla.
---
Do you ever get reinvited back to a guild you already did this to?
---
Transfer window ended.
---
just gotta put on music you like, and buy whole-heartedly into your sunk-cost fallacy /s  
---
it HAS do drop eventually.  
---
I mean, at the end of the day -  are you going to let your hours of hard work mean nothing?   
---
Be responsible, of course. But once you've invested so much time, it'll probably nag at you if you walk away from it.
---
Must be nice. Sulfuras alliance cant organize for shit.
---
idk why people on this sub just can't tell if something is a joke or not, thank you for being the only non gnome like person here &lt;3
---
For this reason I’m trying to avoid STV entirely. It can get a bit slim on quests at some points but it’s perfectly doable. Beats getting ganked.
---
&gt;We expect these free character moves to remain open until 11:00 a.m. PDT (2:00 a.m. EDT) on Monday, September 16.
---
Has science gone too far?
---
At lvl 60 you'll probably want to respec anyway to get a proper spec so it's worth taking dark pact for the 40-60 leveling imo. In the end do as you want but i just wanted to point out than dark pact is fucking awesome for leveling.
---
Peace is possible.
---
The mobs that are in the area are around 31-35 I believe, not sure what level the repeatable quest is, am alliance scum.
---
So Jokerd is getting a ban too?
---
And officially abused bugs to be first to 60?
---
Is it? I took some time off and it was a blast playing with friends. Cheapest vacation of my life haha
---
I want in
---
Stick to ele or enhance. The guides I’ve seen suggest going ele 10-20, then enhance 20-40, then either spec after 40.
---
Just keep a healing set of gear in your bags and you’re good to heal any 5 man dungeon.
---
I think that as well, and I'll often inform the rest of the raid/party that's where they've gone.
---
Understand that people will wait until 60. You are not 60 I assume. But your goal is to do stuff at 60. Forge relationships as you level. Then focus on dungeons. Slowly build your reputation. That’s how a good guild forms. And it happens with patience.
---
Better dead than red
---
haha no its just your rose tint-....oh
---
If only classic codex wasn't so unreliable.
---
Didn't they also use artificial red ones?
---
To be honest, I'm not okay with this. Yes, they knowingly abused the system, but they weren't expressly forbidden from doing so. A ban should not result from finding something to exploit. 
---
What's next, banning people for jumping under Stormwind (please tell me that didn't patch that) to camp?
---
I've been testing mouse-over gouge, kick, and blind macros all day today. Seems like if you take ANY action on any mob other than your target it drops all of your combo points sadly :(   
---
I watched this video last night and got SUPER excited for a solution to losing all my combo points trying to blind/kick a 2nd mob. But doesn't appear to function that way in Classic. Please let me know if you're able to find away to keep the combo points!
---
Desolace
---
Critical reading skills...don’t have em.
---
Thank you kind person 🙏🏼
---
Sorry, should spell homey. It looks like "learn to keming" thing.
---
Spawn, stealth, sap instantly.  Then run to a different area to farm. Get 20 yards off him, blind his pet then vanish. 
---
Did you skip rogue 101?
---
People mostly use twitch for classic WoW.
---
&gt; peak time on a full server
---
The man hours to fairly resolve this stuff to a fair degree with everyone involved would be insane. It won't happen.
---
Haven't noticed any missing quest data, sometimes I'd have to manually tell it to show a quest on the map though.
---
That wyvern looking hella wierd
---
Yeah, I thought they were still deciding about what to do, but when I read it again, it seems they can’t really take those items back, seeing as they gave them the go ahead.
---
He was a gladiator, heh.
---
Did you think we had forgotten?  Do you think we had forgiven? Behold now, the terrible vengeance of the forsaken!  Death to the scourge and death to the living!
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
I believe Heartseeker and Kromcrush are the only (?) Alliance dominated PvP servers currently.
---
Can someone explain to me what the layering exploits are and why they’re bannable? Out of the loop here
---
Well, that. There isn’t much other endgame. Some people enjoy clearing all quests, getting that Winterspring mount, dropping leveling profs for Engineering (or something else), farm sets for off-spec or simply level alts (and profs).
---
Looked like Wesley in the villa match today
---
What you just said is violation of tos
---
#nocange
---
I hope so too. Some idiots on my server farmed 2 bindings in 1 night...
---
A couple of reasons.  The biggest is faction rep.  I know there are more efficient ways, but doing other factions quests is a fun way to get a head start on that “different” mount.  Other reasons include: catching up to a friend who is on later stages of the quest, items in specific quests but may as well do related quests, taking a break from my “main” quests and its fun to feel a little op
---
Furries are the worst.  They post shit like that and people ask them to stop being so disgusting and vulgar, it’s common courtesy, y’know?
---
Then they complain that you’re kink shaming them and my favorite “hey, we’re not hurting anyone!”
---
It’s like seeing a homeless person shitting in public, yea he’s not hurting anyone but that is fucking disgusting and you wish he was doing it in a more private area.
---
I feel like Thunderfury and Rupture jokes are more trade chat in cities related.
---
Some of you are fucking assholes . I bet you are the kind of assholes who would do something like this .
---
Dont worry my man , one day you'll be 60 and get your revenge.  
---
I understand corpse camping for like 10 minutes or so but not an hour or hour(s). And before you jump my shit , I've been playing PvP since WoW was in Beta and most of you were probably still in diapers or elementary school . I know how it works and I know how you get yourself on a kill on site list .
---
Apparently it is difficult to grasp, you don't understand how percentages work. I know dps is normalized before talents, I'm asking for your parsing conditions because you're information is wrong.
---
Okay and I guarantee that you’d be bitching for the next two weeks if you were stuck in seven hour queues, and I definitely guarantee that more people would be pissed off in three months when a quarter of the servers were dead and everyone had to move. Get a grip dude it’s not the same situation as it was then it can’t be released the same way. The reason they did it is valid. This is the reason you’re not a game designer
---
Just respond to anything and everything said in guild chat with "mmm that's nipple-rubbing good..."
---
3d floating healing numbers weren't in vanilla
---
I don't know who you are.
---
But I like you
---
I mean I guess? I wasn’t looking at it as a time save, but more a quick save.
---
&gt; Took the highroad to a medium server at the first chance i got
---
So did I and my friend group... but Stalagg still has queues.
---
Now ban Asmon for his 10man dungeon spam
---
Can I get a source for using bulldozers and flamethrowers on 10,000 protesters? China is horrific but that just sounds outlandish, why wouldn't they just shoot them?
---
I just wish there was an option to only slow tracked quests on the map. With such large level ranges in some zones, the objective identical icons just end up being a hindrance than a help.
---
Can confirm Blaumeux is very well balanced. I'm used to there being way more Horde but STV and other contested zones are super fun right now.
---
Damn. We win. Blizzard does what we want. Stops the exploit and gives them all suspensions and removed their items. 
---
And this sub is still pissed. I don't think half the people in here calling for permabans even wanted this fixed. They just love to have a focus for their hate.
---
Added. Catch you around. Thanks!
---
Woah buddy, don't you know this could be a 10 min youtube video??
---
What kind of macros
---
Plenty of people play in windowed mode. Nowadays you expect Xing out to be handled by programs effectively. It's not like its a pkill or something.
---
You have to talk to a guy in the camp first.  That then unlocks all the other quests there.
---
I assume you mean Kotor and I've beaten both games a good handful of times and could always save in combat. You could save-cheese your way through pretty much anything. I think I remember doing it in the Malak fight on my first play through because I made a bunch of bad decisions and my character was weak.
---
Added- see you around man thank you.
---
More like reposts in a nutshell
---
It would be "easy" to rollback something that would require giving them back every single thing they used? Like every reagent they bought from the auction house to level a new profession after making the mage robe for example. Now you would delete their new profession they bought stuff from 100 people in the AH to level it?
---
&gt;The only thing that would be hard to decide on, if they bought an item, wore it, and levelled 2 times or so, would they rollback levels too?
---
They would never ever do that. People would go fucking crazy. The fact that you think this is a "hard thing to decide on" means you are absolutely out of touch
---
Can they stand at the portal entrance and roll for it?
---
"Eat s@!$ and live"
---
I cant imagine many scenarios where you only need 1 linen cloth. For every time i was 1 cloth short of a skill up that would take me up a tier of cloth (never happened to me) i have spent maybe 3 minutes extra scrolling through page after page of people undercutting each other by 1c for their individual cloths. It slows everyone down. In the time it takes to actually get to the bulk stacks you could go kill 5 mobs outside and make up the extra money you spent on a full stack you didnt need that one time.
---
Yeah burst the whole pack immediately, and stand right next to the tank so when he pulls you, can immediately start taking damage, then he can waste all of his rage pulling agro off of you instead of generating threat. Finally, when you start getting low, run away and kite the mob, so whatever enemies the warrior does get a hold of are now dazing him, and most likely hitting him from behind, so he can’t dodge, block, or parry. 
---
You know you made it as a mage, warlock, or even an enhancement shaman, if your tank dies, your healer is completely oom, and the rest of your party barely makes it out alive! Ultimately every serious damage dealer should have the highest threat in the party, but doing half the dps of the other players.
---
wow, you silvered your own post. nice!
---
There is no reasoning with greed.
---
t U r N o O f W a R m O d E
---
Gotta put it away in the archive
---
not hard AT ALL! All that has to be done is roll back everything that has happened anywhere on any of the servers since the first time the bug was discovered. That exact moment in time is when they should roll back the servers to. Obviously no progress up till then is legitimate, as it was effected at least in some way by the bug.
---
Oh they’re serious.   Just go to gold shire inn on retail (moonguard server)
---
Careful about admitting to sharing accounts. It's definitely against Blizz ToS
---
Been noticing this as well, which is honestly strange because on original vanilla and on private server 1.12 clients you can use this macro and retain your CP on the target, so it's something Blizzard changed. :(
---
The ambush macro does take multiple presses, but is spam able so pressing it too many times wont mess anything up.  Just the way macros work on Classic, can't do any sequential stuff reliably.
---
How’s the overall community on the alliance side? Horde side, too, if you know? 
---
And what’s the wpvp and pve like?
---
Is there a lot of rp, or mostly PvP?
---
Your voice is irritating
---
It seems like it's the only option, unfortunately.
---
Its fucking trash I really really miss the old curse client
---
Where X is the number of seconds before resetting.
---
Druids crush dungeons as a tank. They are generally considered better for dungeons due to a higher threat output. They are also way, way better at levelling than both paladins and warriors (who are two of the slowest levellers in the game).
---
However, they are definitely worse for raid tanking. No Questions there.
---
Paladins are worse than both for tanking.
---
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks :)

I would just pick my highest level and go from there if you’re worried about being behind others.  But the content isn’t going anywhere and BG’s aren’t coming for a while so don’t sweat it.
---
Whats the 40-50 leveling route? I finished STV at 43 and i'm doing Feralas right now, also  what dungeons do you recommend for a Warlock?
---
Pretty sure they all wear some kind of clothes.
---
The satisfaction of turning in a log full of quests at ungoro is unmatched for me
---
look up the classic census and roll on a 50/50 population
---
\*nice\*
---
Grouped with a horde guy that had a macro to yell INFERIOR GAMER every time wind fury prices. It was hilarious
---
Your gnome is definitely into it
---
How so?
---
Why is that a punishment? I never played retail but would they not just be able to play on with their characters in retail like normal?
---
Transfer them to a bfa realm
---
&gt; lvl 51 ability
---
what are those
---
Guild banks aren't in classic you filthy casual
---
The setup isn't stable enough to be played while the truck is driving so we can only play If we have a day off, which we usually have to request since team trucks never really have any downtime
---
There are those who call me....  
---
**A bad Role-model**  
---
Those people don't have a Tiny Crimson Whelpling.  
---
Get. That. Item. You got this.
---
Yeah I've experienced all of these as a rogue too.  Not sure why sap is so inconsistent but gouge works fine.
---
Also, have you found a good cc tracker?  I tried weak auras but it doesn't time it right.
---
However I remember spell queuing from before.
---
At this rate it very well might be.
---
I tried getting green and red whelping for like 10 levels in total and no luck.
---
Hail Corporate
---
Except for the Son of Arugal, fuck that guy in particular.
---
Don't leave the server! Unless you just don't think world pvp is for you, then go ahead and leave.(don't take this as rude, but if you can't handle ganks/camping. You should roll pve.) It's this thinking that led to where retail is now with servers being only horde and only alliance. Everytime an ally leaves the server the imbalance increases.
---
Like a burka then? I mean if they can’t show bones.
---
And?
---
The only thing to get is that op is the only one responsible for getting camped, he is the one running to his corspe respawning for an entire hour. 
---
Also no one claims that it isn't  a douche thing to do, just that it's totally within what is intended in the game.
---
They would get rolled back to a point, where the illegal exploited item would be removed. Raegents and other items and professions would not be involved. But you said after making the mage robe so i think you're confused? Rollbacks on levels have been done before in vanilla, so its not really out of touch.
---
&gt;No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community.
---
What’s the addon called that tells you what items vendor for?
---
A main tank that is fully adequate. If you go fury then you wont have tactical mastery, so you will be gimpy tanking dungeons, and you wont have mortal strike, so you will be gimpy in pvp. 
---
If you go prot then you will be utterly useless at every single thing except tanking. You will have to rely on either a mage alt or your guild to funnel everything to you. And what do you really get for it? 
---
If you go 31/5/15 then you are very good at soloing, raid dps, pvp, tanking dungeons, and youre fine as a raid tank, good enough to tank naxx bosses. It is by far the best all around spec.
---
Then don't play it. Enjoy retail.
---
It’s almost as if he was made for it. The perfect height
---
You mean CoS.
---
You silly full demo locks thinking you're good at damage and not the biggest threat producers in the entire game.
---
Why even comment that? Just turn it off and scroll down - lol...
---
Decline,
---
S I S S Y
---
Will do. Thank you so so much :) Went shadow and killing stuff is SO much easier! Shield&gt;DoTs&gt;Mind Flay/wand pretty much right?
---
/cast cleave
---
/train
---
I got groups just fine before Classic launch. It wont mesh with the caster cleave meta, but warrior cleave you’ll do fine.
---
When you heal well, you get friended for future runs as a reliable healer.
---
Wpvp is all I want. But I also don’t want complete opposite faction domination.
---
Yeah i'm thinking so as well, my server is 60/40 so not that unbalanced but all i see is Horde.
---
Faster leveling speed and entering a zone later allows you to grab more quests and do a giant circle to get them all done.
---
What a touching story. 
---
I use to bot in Diablo 3 when it came out. Mostly farming gold with various AutoIt! scripts. I had a bunch of accounts that I would just run on VM's. Farm gold, and sell it to resellers. Made a couple hundred bucks before all the accounts were banned. 
---
More than anything, I missed how fun it was tweaking the scripts and VM settings and whatnot. Only game I ever botted in.
---
My, you’re a tall one
---
Huh, TIL
---
leveling in the green zone is faster and more efficient, you hit more, and take less damage so less downtime
---
therefore questing where its green = faster questing = faster leveling
---
Desolace, swamp of sorrows, badlands
---
Nah. The game is popular and people are still enjoying it so populations aren't going to die out for a while it seems.
---
Proof they used this exploit?
---
Don't spec resto for leveling unless you plan to do dungeons from 10 all the way to 60.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow/
---
apply this article to dungeons
---
I say the ban players for every week of lockouts they tried to cheat.  Rerun Onyxia 15 times?  15 weeks.  No rewards.  
---
Dungeons a bit more lenient with because you can spam them already, but it's limit 5 per hour so if they ran 20 kills in an hour they are potentially skipping a few months of grinding.  1 month + seems reasonable there.  Also people may not have known.  Everyone knows you don't get to kill raid bosses on repeat, the same week.  Let alone, same damn instance.
---
Yea your guarantee is shit. All you can do is talk about a made up situation where "le bad things happen". And furthermore being a game developer in 2019 is about the worst job in the STEM field so yea you can miss me with that shit. Have fun talking about fantasy horror where the customer is wrong and the brainlet CEOs are the genius winners protecting us from ourselves.
---
&gt; If you're one of the people who keep sending this stupid ass copy pasted mass guild inv message out to guildless randoms, can you kindly fuck off?
---
When I receive unsolicited guild invites or tells asking me to join a guild without any sort of interaction, I report it for spam, which also adds the sender to my block list. 
---
If I want to join a guild, I'll do it.
---
Yeah when someone pulls aggro and runs away I just let them have it, I can't chase everyone around the whole dungeon.
---
When you get rake you’ll want to start in cat form - can’t remember if that’s 22 or 24
---
If it is first time ever playing hunter, id sugjest stay with bm, because if u decide to quest it is pretty rough if u are mm. I personaly swapped to mm at 40 and ive had loads of fun since and i dont regret 1 bit, tho i am a hunter player for 12ish years 😅 the general idea is - play for fun, if u dont have to much fun with bm swap, dont bother much about minmaxing, and if u want to swap for preformance - the gain is in cleave and lose is in singletarget and gaining mana isues
---
What keyboard is that?!
---
This is amazing. Can you show more of your overall set up?
---
lol
---
No; specialisation and unique race/class combos is part of what makes your *identity* in Classic matter. It's part of the community-building.
---
I guess that depends on how many people did the exploit, even then ive heard from a friend that works for Blizzard that its not hard at all
---
Aaaaand this is why I play PVE.
---
Honestly if you are the minority faction just avoid STV, it's not worth it.
---
You'd get more XP evne just grinding mobs in another zone.
---
Ah yeah, I forgot some people care about world firsts.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Myself, I couldn't give a fuck about world firsts in an RPG. But that's just me.
---
Hunter, pulled creeps, raid leader upset, called out the guild in sub.
---
We got a bingo
---
I’ve taken like, 100 screenshots in there already. Forgot about it at first
---
&gt;The endgame content is horrible, theres no incentive to raid, dungeon or pvp or do anything because the loot is so RNG which sucks the purpose out of doing anything. 
---
It's more that loot is reset so often that it is quite literally meaningless. When you can expect everything you'd busted your ass for to be completely worthless every major patch that kills any drive to do anything gear related. Gear has become a means to an end to complete content when it used to be the actual goal of the content itself. 
---
Lo and behold, the primary features of the game(PvP/raids/dungeons) use gear as a carrot. When that carrot becomes meaningless people couldn't care less, especially if the game feels super bad to play like 90% of classes in bfa right now after losing artifacts that classes were clearly designed around.
---
Once i realized how artifacts worked and were balanced in legion i immediately knew their removal in the expansion afterwards would absolutely break class design given blizzard's track record of making things and throwing them away every two years.
---
I'm sure whatever comes out after BfA will be *passable* but i just hope blizzard learns some things from classic about how to properly retain players without just making insanely long/tedious artificial rep grinds that require logging in multiple times per day for world of chorecraft. Chorecraft is the biggest reason i can't be assed to play retail above all else. Too much non-optional repetitive uninteresting daily content that spans weeks or more at a time to see any results.
---
I just wanted to let you know that many of them probably did thank you, but if you were running off then you may not have heard it! The /s distance you can hear at is REALLY short right now, which is something my friend and I realized after we thought a few people were being thankless!
---
Is that an addon
---
Sure there is, but you have to make an attempt. There very well could have been a misunderstanding, or didn't see the roll, etc but they were never given a chance to right their wrong... if someone immediately nerd-raged and tattled on me like this I'd probably not give it to them either.
---
quit fucking rolling horde, thats the fix
---
mage or hunter?
---
Tldr: a temp restriction is a fantastic solution 10/10 would support.
---
-
---
This would be how they did (do) it with diablo 2. Too many game swaps and you get a timeout. Usually only 10-20 min to start, but if it keeps happening (quickly) can escalate into an hour/ day or two. 
---
It's an accepted reality of online play for d2 and players adjust accordingly by taking a bit longer between swaps. It can be annoying, but it does the trick - and that's in a game that's essentially all about plowing through content and remaking a game and doing it again. WoW does not need that degree of layer swapping. Its unnecessary and realistically would very rarely affect a legitimate user - and if it did they get a 15 min restriction. How many times have u swapped layers(mostly party changing I guess?) a dozen times in a 15 minute window? Never? It may happen but it shouldn't be common, at all.
---
This likely offsets or even completely eliminates their abuse before the restriction, especially if they get dinged for an hour or even a day.
---
Oh no harassment encouraged. Protecting the rest of the community by getting them to throw this terrible person on their ignore list. Thanks!
---
Currently, making a free account lets you trial retail WoW up to level 20. Paying the subscription fee lets you play retail WoW minus the most current expansion, and all of Classic. Then to play the most current retail expansion you buy it as normal.
---
In later levels you run out of quests. After 50 each zones full quest log barely brings you to half the level.
---
Why does it apply to dungeons though if it's only purpose is population control
---
Why is it always a hunter hahahahah
---
I haven't had more than a 90 minute wait the last 2 weeks. Which is not too bad considering stuff like this post.
---
I can’t remember the episode, but I heard someone mention on countdown to classic podcast that they weren’t bad if you properly downrank your spells to conserve mana. You are definitely going to have a hard time keeping up with a mage or warlock at your same gear and skill level though. For PVP, I’ve heard balance druids are decent but you don’t actually use moonkin form.
---
Yep, RO was my first MMO and this was a lot of fun.  Getting a Merchant or Blacksmith to a good level to post her overnight....that was a lot of fun in my youth! Good to see other veterans of the game here! \[the mobile version just....doesn't fill the niche in my heart I'd hoped it would\]
---
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
---
I gave you the wrong form apparently. try noform:3
---
I played horde from BC till mop and then I've been alliance ever since. I still consider the horde to be my home but those night elf flippy jumps D: please dont write me a ticket
---
Yes. Believe they are continuing tonight
---
Agreed, everyone should've seen the warning signs with the Gurubashi chests duping and other well documented examples. These were months ago and plenty of time to come up with work around. Blizz knows their technology a lot better than we do to, blows me away none of them would think this could be exploited in instances and dungeons too.
---
Camping a corpse for an hour is NOT what was intended in this game . Yes , he could of takin rez sickness and moved on but did you ever think that some folks only have a certain amount of time to play during the day or during certain days ? It's always easy to be perfect , right ?
---
ass-clenching simulator
---
Pfft, racist quest
---
What is it 2004 again?
---
I just ignore summon whispers unless it's a guildie. No I'm not running back to gadgetzan from uldum *just* to summon you
---
Use sap as a macro like
---
/stopattack 
---
/cast Sap
---
As far as the other stuff, yeah batching is just fucked not much you can do about it
---
The only "layering exploit" is that layering exists in the first place. Everything else is a natural byproduct of that festering cesspool that was forced onto a great game.
---
I just finished Dead Mines on my druid for the first time. What item should I pick up for the quest? Staff of Westfall (49-74 damage, 5 int, 11 spirit) or Tunic Westfall (92 armor, 11 agi, 5 stam).
---
I'm not really locked into what I want to do yet. I kind of want to be versatile enough to tank, heal, or DPS in dungeons depending on what I want to do.
---
My current chest is 78 armor, 6 agi. My current weapon is 25-38 damage, 4 stam, 4 str.
---
"just go kill 20. Super easy."
---
thank mr skeltal doot doot
---
You might not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
So imagine you bought the pattern from AH not knowing someone exploited to get it. You farmed the mats and made a new BiS chest for yourself and vendored your old one. After making the soulbound chest armour you now drop tailoring as your profession and waste all your gold on something like engineering.
---
Then Blizzard swoops in and deletes your chest from your character, leaving you completely without a body armour since you sold your old one. Not only that but now you would have to drop a profession completely to level your tailoring to 300. A profession you wasted all your gold to level up, not to mention all the gold you used on getting your tailoring to 300 previously. Basically you would get screwed out of leveling a profession to 300 at least two times just because you accidentally bought an item from the auction house that somebody else exploited to get. 
---
And this is just the problem with leveling professions, not the reagents you lost making that chest
---
But it would be best to be at lvl 60 for phase 2 wouldn't it? So you can jump right into the next unlocked content?
---
I've been looking for something like this since launch! Thanks for the info!
---
Read other comments bud
---
No Blue Post, No Twitter blast, in game alert... So many tools to accomplish a simple task of "heads up" but all we get is apathy and indifference.
---
How many guilds and friend's Classic Experiences just ended from this slap in the face?
---
especially with little to no evidence/context!
---
Ohh I see, why did leaving the group change your instance?
---
[Sure they won't.](https://i.redd.it/yotlavwps0n31.jpg)
---
r/Layering because of all the drama going on right now with Layer bugs/abuse.
---
If you have no preference atm I would solely suggest priest because you can get into spell cleave groups. I played resto druid up to lvl 42 and had soooooo much trouble finding groups because everyone wants cleave groups and priests are the best healer for it.
---
I'd try starting my own and could spend an hour trying to get a tank. I ended up respecting into tank spec just so I could tank dungeons and get a group. 
---
I would suggest priest if you plan to play with a lot of groups or in dungeons, druid for solo. 
---
Also I'm on the 3rd most populated server so population isn't the issue
---
Hunter and rogue have I think nearly the exact same BIS for several pieces, head,shoulders,pants,gloves, rings, trinkets, neck (maybe)
---
Teamwork makes the dream work!
---
People really underestimate how easy it would be to do something like that.
---
Generally a pretty selfish person, when he got tired of running his guild he and a friend took the entire guild bank and jumped servers. Bragged about how he would stop raiding after had gotten all the gear he wanted and he would he 'late' for raid intentionally but still get good boy points for being a backup. Recently he ignored his own loot rules to take tier 2 helm off oxnyia. Told his guild to ninja loot off other players who aren't in his guild.
---
And you use this green cheater as a meme in this ?
---
he cheated in Ma'Gora to kill Garosh...
---
Odds are it doesn’t apply to either of you guys anyways. Just warning fellow Westfallers. Feel free to not block him and deal with the consequences.
---
That's awesome. I've been saving all the random Shoulder drops that I keep finding, and hand them out to those that haven't found a set yet.
---
Kinda reminds me of that Key and Peele skit where Peele is a huge dude ordering for delivery himself but pretends he's having a conversation about what to get with all his action figures
---
You're a douche and i bet you use the word "toxic" to describe things you don't like.
---
Tactical level-up
---
I’d be absolutely shocked if phase one is only 2 months. I think that’d be horrible for the vast majority who won’t be 60 when phase 2 is released. Phase 1 is supposed to be the longest phase so there’s going to be a phase every month? That would be insanely fast.
---
Yeah I love how blizzards punishments work with large scale abuse like this
---
TLDR: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yes but we were all screaming that layering would be abused in the open world the same way phasing is abused in retail. And it was and still is. Look at Jokers, the "world 1st level 60" if you can even consider it that. He shamelessly does this shit day in and day out on his stream while out in the open world.
---
In my opinion, people who chain layer hop to grind mobs for XP, gold, rare items, etc should be hit as well, though I imagine that's much harder to track than quick repeat boss kills.
---
Exactly.
---
Horde is different than human.  Play horde.   😈
---
Holy shit warriors scale better off agi then even rogues?
---
That can still be a half enough wait time though can't it?
---
So you don't even get to choose what server you want to go too either?
---
I enjoy leveling up and the lore, but I was so burned out with end-game bullshit (WQs, factions to grind, etc.) after Legion that when I hit level cap in BFA I just wanted nothing to do with the end-game. 
---
Although I will admit to logging into my Retadin and just destroying 3-5 enemies all at once and thoroughly enjoying it. It's cathartic after struggling to handle 2 enemies (if I'm lucky) on Classic.
---
Says the wow nerd lol
---
Minion is kind of a relative term. [It's one of these guys that takes him out.](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/9/99/Zakajz.jpg?version=a339d8a56bae1da6c2217bfc3a984c86).
---
Or the (sadly) likely conclusion of all the recent marches.
---
Also, after you *mass fucking recruit as much of the server as possible*, don't just start kicking people out when you think you have enough to stick around to raid.
---
to a degree yeah. goes for 70g on my server.
---
Drama queen Andy.
---
So you reckon if there was a server with hardly anyone playing it they would allow free transfers or merge pretty quick.
---
When im at work i just use my Phones 4G, sharing internet from it. Drains like 2-300mb in 8h with 70ms, totaly playable, so its working very good!
---
Are the rows all standard sizes on a Pok3r? I've been debating getting one.
---
Whats your guilds focus, and are you on Horde? I just rolled on Blaumeux and I might be interested.
---
I have enough trouble sticking to one personality in real life.  Why limit it in game?  The only problem is slower leveling.  It's not a race, and if it were, you and I have already lost.  Enjoy the run.
---
AFAIK nothing increases wand damage except for talents (e.g. Priest and Mage Wand Specialization)
---
I think you are as surprised as everyone else that it works in instances.
---
I don't mean label you as a cheater, but you certainly abused the way to layering works to gain a competitive advantage.  I wouldn't worry about Blizzard taking any kind of action against you though.  There is a pretty large difference between what you were doing and the people who were running multiple bottled characters to on demand swap layers and turbo farm end game crafting mats.
---
Are you talking about a bona fide purchaser? It is good policy not to punish an innocent and good faith buyer with no knowledge of the manner the goods were originally obtained.
---
Oh really? Do you think they will remove layering?
---
"Small group of IRL friends &amp; cool people LFM, or not.  Focused on having fun leveling for now, with eventual transition to Raids (UBRS).
---
Contact "Kall" on Heartseeker for more details"
---
Hows that?
---
&gt; IDK can we discuss this?
---
no, no, we wont discuss about shit blizzard doesn't want to fix. just suggesting this is toxic as fuck.
---
i wonder how many upvotes this thread is gonna get. it's at 9 now. prolly 26 tops?
---
btw anyone remembers that petition to separate wow classic in battlenet app? we dont talk about that either.
---
The problem here is context right? We only hear your story, we don't know what's going on, what discussions were had, etc. Maybe he was an ultradouche, maybe you both were. We have no way of knowing.
---
See what I mean?
---
Yea thats it. Me and all the other people who want it are stupid. Thank you for helping all of us through this difficult time. We should just make our own MMO if we dont like it lol. But in the mean time it is great that we have people like you and Blizzard to protect us stupid people from our own stupidity. 
---
Certainly dont risk trying our ideas. We dont even know what we want! We are just stupid customers that dont deserve smart people like you and blizzard. I am so thankful.
---
Green quests are the best quests in Vanilla.
---
The instance exploit they're talking about is resetting dungeons.
---
Afaik, jokered only leveled in open world and basically quit upon hitting level 60.
---
low is like a full vanilla server!? 0,0
---
Game runs surprisingly well off my my phones hotspot.
---
Badlands was much worse than STV for me. I didn't have my mount yet when I started it vs a lot of Horde that had theirs and would just track me down. Also, those small rock chips from the elementals by Kargath...

My shaman is level 33 and I feel this
---
I agree Warrior leveling is a real struggle at the beginning, but they get much better around 35-40.  
---
Once you get Whirlwind Axe, Sweeping Strikes and Mortal Strike it gets a lot better.  
---
Also keeping First Aid, Fishing and Cooking leveled as high as you can to maintain a steady supply of bandages, buff food, and high healing fish it really helps a lot with the downtime between pulls.
---
Well I guess PVE is :) In PVP I keep getting killed by undead warlocks.
---
This comment makes no sense, because it's actual content is on layer #7 while you are on layer #2.
---
I commend you good sir, not just for your awesome rig but also your hard work and long hours on the road away from friends and family. Hope you get treated well and enough rest during those long hauls.
---
Maybe give a bit of a reroll a try. Get an alt to lvl 20-25 and see if the combat is better or if u just enjoy it more. As someone who's OG toon was also a paladin, I know the struggle. Which likely why I'd always quit before max lvling until finally late bc I hit 70.
---
I went warrior this time, and am enjoying it much more. There's alot (relatively) more intricacies to the combat, and it's just familiar enough for the nostalgia.
---
At least I'm not crying about layering all day long
---
Its funny thats its always the morons on the more populated faction (horde) saying reroll or qq more.
---
with the current climate of elitism and toxicity this is to be expected, especially with twitch memers running rampart. all you can do is report and ignore and move on
---
Looks like the last week of a private server honestly
---
this is my first time playing :&lt;
---
ironic it's quest 404
---
Can anybody confirm that those streamers who intentionally exploited layering and did so via their live stream have been suspended?
---
For example, the APES guild and the Asmongold streamer both exploited layering bugs live.  They did so knowing the exact actions and mechanics outcome to give an advantage.  I would expect them to be suspended as well.
---
*WHAT LEVEL DO I GET THAT?* ^^^/s
---
Why would a hunter need armor? That’s the only difference between leather and cloth. Plus the stats are what matter in this version of the game.
---
Roughly half the BiS fury warrior gear at 60 are leather or Mail, not plate.
---
That's why the populated servers are offering character transfers. To push peak population into additional servers.
---
They would mail your items to themself, not auction from your account
---
Then stay bm, dmg aint everything
---
I like how you just assign a play style to me that I don't do and isn't what I'm talking about anyway. I always just frost nova and wait at the start of pulls until the tank gets some decent threat before dpsing.   
---
 I'm also not talking about the times I'm 90% and am drinking up the last bit while they pull. I'm talking about the times I'm 5% and only started drikning or when the last mob isn't fully dead so we're still in combat and I can't drink. In those situations I can either drink up for 30 seconds to get to 40% mana while people die in front of me or I can autoattack for shit all damage while people die infront of me. I need more than 5 seconds at the end of a fight to drink because my spells cost a shit load my mana pool is massive and the water is terrible.
---
That's what retail is for. For some people an LFG tool is "a quality of life change" but for others it's a deal breaker. Enough of these "quality of life changes" and you might as well have retail, which we all know sucks. Let's stick with the game we know is good and not risk screwing it up by trying to make it better for your personal tastes.
---
There is something you can do.  Free transfer
---
What hotspot do you use?
---
Hints your Alliance tag . Most of you are cowards and cant attack and kill anyone unless they have multiple mobs on them and low on health already . You also cant kill anyone unless you're grouped up . Must be like a rule or something on the alliance side .
---
Happened to me today. Saw a chest and as a rogue, I said I should open it. Didn't even noticed that the other party members rolled on it.
---
At least I won the roll after rolling retroactively.

r/Workspaces
---
Can you show me where they explicitly knew where it was an exploit? On the next day where they wanted to kill Rag before their first reset, they went into UBRS to mind control the fire resistance buff spell casters. That is probably where the accidental layering occurred.
---
To be fair, warriors are incredibly gear dependent and that axe makes a solid 10-15 levels much easier for them.

I think I've sold one stack of Thick Leather in the AH, the rest of my mats have been vendored. At 290 skinning and just got my first rugged leather tonight (level 45). The times I've checked ore prices still haven't convinced me; this market is...interesting.
---
They sometimes ban guilds for accepting dirty gold without knowing so. Most of the time it's resolved but it does happen.
---
U just cry about other people crying, I get it
---
Didn't think of that aha ty

FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
Exactly. I've been leveling my professions and fishing along the way too so I can afford my mount at 40. I have about 2 days of /played with some of that me being afk for some reason or another sitting at 24. I'm considered the "hardcore player" in my group of friends.
---
Not at all. But I will take them from you for 50s /s
---
Atleast one of you is self aware
---
Thanks bro !
---
Ah yes, the random MC reset. I remember it just like it was 2004. The countless zero people on this entire subreddit and the entirety of the official forums remembered it crystal clear as well.
---
If you virtually caught a rare virtual pet, and want to virtually impress other virtual players with your immense virtual skills, this was a poor decision.  I recommend you virtually move on with your virtual life. In spite of this virtual trauma. #movingon
---
At rank 1 it's definitely a good power spike, but later on the rank 2 version pales in comparison to mage's fireball and pyroblast.
---
Played on Arthas in vanilla. These queues really bring me back. Luckily, remote desktop is a god send. Every inn on Herod is filled to the brim with afkers
---
I disagree, it’s the ultimate power move.. how would you feel getting killed by someone in that hat? You should in brace that hat and make the alliance fear your hideous head ware.
---
Keep in mind that APES exploited layering to reset for MC rep farming.  The entire guild should be banned.
---
So how much would these go for?
---
The literal meaning of Horde is large group.
---
Enjoy the target rich environment and insatiable demand for blood that comes with wielding the light!
---
(Plus instant BG ques when that comes out.)
---
It’s a saying that’s been around wow since the early days because blizz never did anything to people who exploited; only banned them for like a week and they kept their stuff. Everyone plays differently; I wouldn’t compare college to a video game.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Maybe he is just being nice.
---
Except most of those specific ones you just mentioned were fixed or were fabricated by people trying to generate controversy for internet points.
---
So yes, in this case we do have to be pedantic.
---
I’ve on my 6th guild so far and they’ve all been shit. Literally the only people who speak are the small group of friends who start the guilds and they ignore the rest of the members. It’s been pretty depressing so far. I play OSRS as well and Clans on there are super social and helpful, wow guilds have been a huge letdown in comparison
---
who cares
---
A good question but people most certainly were doing so.
---
Sweet!
---
You'll likely do better in dps in 5 mans for a fair while with arms and sweeping strikes. Fury doesn't really pull ahead until you've stacked a lot of +hit gear and have an epic MH wep.

I’m new to WoW. Is this exploit when someone asks in chat for an inv so enemies respawn or is it something else?
---
They took them down today. My friends and I were about to do it and its gone.
---
Okay thanks I appreciate it
---
You mean exploit, not trick.
---
Both are exploits.  Both deserve suspensions/bans.
---
Not that I don’t agree but some people that played 25/7 to get to lv60 did not exploit.
---
Hey guys, me and my friend are new to wow and were wondering if there’s an in-game party chat available in the game? Also I’d like to play Shaman but am not too familiar with the class. Is enhancement shaman good for dps or elemental?
---
Did this exploit potentially work in raids? Or was it limited to dungeons that can be reset?
---
This is legit bad advice and how you build a cesspool guild. 
---
I began searching for a "raiding" team weeks before Classic launch and found a group on the server discord that looked like it checked all the boxes. There were spreadsheets of dungeon groups and raid rosters, lists of who was running what profession and who to filter patterns to, etc. To the naked eye, it would appear that this is a group of people who have their shit together. 
---
Within 3 days of launch, the guild went from 50 people to 200+ people because the officers attempted the "mass invite and build the community" strat. Our 21+ rule went right out the fucking window and we had literal children (8-10 year old kids) shitposting in both guild chat and discord. GM starts getting whispers from people who were grouping with people from our guild who were ninja looting shit and just being general assholes. Joined a discord voice channel to run a dungeon, we had to keep banning kids after they would join voice channels and scream n-bomb and f@gg0t at the top of their lungs until we hit 'em with the discord ban-hammer.
---
I tried to join SM groups and got rejected because I wore that guild title. People would /spit on me when I was waiting for the zeppelin because they had grouped with people who wore our guild tag and would just be clowns in group. Weeks of prep was destroyed in hours because of this strategy and irreparable damage to the guild image is/was beyond repair at this point. 
---
We already had 50 people online at all hours in discord. All 50 wanted to raid. There was 0 reasons to open recruitment like this to the mass population. We even had people OK with bench spots. We had a full fucking raid team ready to go. Even had 9 warriors, ready for Four Horsemen and open recruitment but a bullet in the entire plan. When I finally /gquit that monstrosity, there were 32 warlocks on the spreadsheet and every fucking one of them KNEW they were gonna get one of the 5 spots. 27 of those clowns are gonna be really, really disappointed. 
---
If you really want to start your own guild, you're in for some struggles if you want to build a legit team that can actually clear content and show up on-time. My suggestions to you would be the following: *** You do whatever you want, this is just a suggestion***
---
1. Join your server discord and post your recruitment spam there. Don't be an asshole and spam it every hour. Maybe once every 2 days at most. 
---
2. Post your recruitment spam on the official server forum
---
3. Post your recruitment spam on the official recruitment forum
---
4. Have a legitimate application process. It doesn't need to be a job interview, but you must have SOMETHING that weeds out the trash and this is how you do it without having to interact with people. If they're like "I'm not filling out an application to play a video game" then you don't really need any other criteria for turning them down. 
---
5. Don't name your guild something fucking stupid. I get it, we all like jokes and shit. I'm guilty of doing this as well. It's a meme but Asmongold made a video several years ago titled "How to be an elitist in WoW" and in that video he talks about guild names. I suggest you go watch that section of the video and approach it not from a joke perspective, but from an actual mindset. No shit, if you're looking to start a guild with the end goal of killing KT in Naxx and you call yourselves &lt;BUY U A DRANK&gt; you've already failed before you step foot into a raid. I swear to God, my #1 rule for joining any guild in any game is "If the name sucks, the group sucks". Doesn't matter if it's true or not. Are there guilds out there named &lt;Strawberry Puppy Kisses&gt; and do they clear the hardest shit in the game? Yes, but they're the exception, not the rule. 
---
6. If you're not max level, shut the fuck up about your plans to raid. Most everyone has "plans to raid". Unless you have 35 lvl 60's and you're looking to actually "round out your core roster" shut up about raiding. What is your army of 42 lvl 16's gonna raid other than the fridge?
---
Basically, if you're not max level or close to max level, you have no business spamming trade chat with your guild info trying to build a raid team. I see this shit all the time and when I Shift-Click the name trying to find out what we're working with, more often than not, it's from someone &lt;lvl 20. Do a /who on the guild name: 6 online at peak times. Sorry boss, but I'm not interested in joining that guild and most people aren't going to be either.
---
We're coming up on the 3rd reset tomorrow and the majority of the population is somewhere between 30-50. Those who are at the upper end most likely have already found a team and those at the lower end aren't even remotely close to the point where it matters if you have a guild that plans to raid or not. There's still plenty of time to build your raid destroying empire for when it really matters because honestly, most of these "raid guilds" are gonna fall the fuck apart waiting on Phase 2 &amp; beyond. I mean, I was in what I thought was a legit, end-game guild led by people who seemed to know what they were doing and it fell apart in the first week.
---
These are nothing more than my personal observations from playing this game, both retail and p-servers since 2006.
---
Not on alliance side they dont.
---
I agree with the sender. I have personally grown a large guild using the add on and we have a healthy 50-60 online at all times so people can help each other. If you don’t like it move on.
---
Aspect of the Dazed is more like it
---
People being able to layer hop at all is horse shit even with the timer.  There really isn't much of a point for the layers anymore as players are much more spread out at this point.
---
I’m doing more quests that I never even knew existed thanks to questie.
---
nope nothing there either unless it's a pool, fishing now 294
---
This guy will have a post a week from now blaming blizzard for his ban and crying that he only abused it once or twice.
---
I've joined a few guilds that whisper and invite to check them out, always a dead guild with 200+ members and 10 online, most of the offline people are under level 10 that accepted the auto invite. Idk what these guild masters are doing.
---

---
Just delete the gold they made from the sale of exploited stuff.  The buyer has no way of knowing what's legit and what isn't.
---
kinda did the same by switching from shadow To holy at around 46 and ive pretty great.
---
Also To fond bad groups you need to be kinda unlucky, ive never been in aoe farm group that were bad enough to not be worth anyways. Also zf with 5 clothies is pretty fun after all.
---
[I’ll give ya choice you can have money and the hammer or you can get out of here.](https://youtu.be/kGp3PrC1CKI)
---
I’ve noticed a similar thing happening with regular mobs. Was doing some questing in the barrens and sometimes when looting the window would popup but wouldn’t loot any items, and afterwards couldn’t skin since it was considered not looted. Must be a bug or server to client mixup or something, hopefully it’ll be fixed soon(what if I missed a damn raptor horn or something?!)
---
"You missing link" I'm stealing that one lolol
---
hold on to them for now though and see how the market goes. price will probably increase once wsg comes out (phase 3)
---
At least one is 19. :)
---
Never said they deserve the loot. They all deserve to be banned/suspended relative to how badly they abused the exploit.
---
My point is that once an exploit becomes public it is usually fixed very quickly. There have been exploits in WoW that existed for years because they were only shared in private circles, comparatively minor exploits but exploits none the less.
---
With something like this, it's best to make the most noise about it as possible because that forces the developer's hand and minimizes its ultimate impact on the game. The longer an exploit like this talked about only in hushed tones the more the economy is damaged by it.
---
If people want to be stupid and use the exploit after a public source shows them how to do it, that's their prerogative. But it's thanks to all the noise that was made about this exploit we got a fix much faster than we would have otherwise.
---
Horde on my server, if you are not a spell cleave player goodluck getting into a run lol.
---
Jmod smackdowns are different. r/2007scape is full of literal autist who lack the mental capacity to form their own thoughts. They'll literally jump back and forth between believing the Jmod and believing the banned player in every smackdown thread. It's fucking tiring.

30% of 2 is greater than 30% of 1.

Being a classic experience player, quest mods are not the opposite. Whether a mod, friend, chat, getting through the grind was what tons of players did. Mods made/make it fun too. IMO

Yes it does thank you!
---
I have a few [keycap](https://kprepublic.com/collections/keycaps) sets and some keyboards don't follow the "standard" keycap sizes.

If you have an interest in "customizing" your keyboard lots of people tend to do full keycap sets but also buy [artisan](https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/artisan_keycap) keycaps.

It's a pricey hobby and if you are interested in learning more you can check out r/MechanicalKeyboards.

Oh no it's retarded :(
---
If walking around looking for npcs is using my brain then I'd rather have questie brain for me
---
If you see me in the world and whisper me, I won't be bothered by it. But simply using /who as a way of recruiting is so impersonal and advertises upfront that your guild is not tight-knit.
---
Idk. I'd buy them for like 20g if I wasn't saving for a mount.
---
Already impulse bought some gloves for 40g so I am a lot shorter than I need to be.
---
But I would try selling at 40 buyout with a 25 starting bid. If no one bids, lower the price.
---
I've done the vanilla grind too many times. I could honestly care less about questing.
---
The magic of exploration was gone the first time. After that it's all motions.

That's not too say I am not having fun with the game, that's just to say I know where it's all at so the sense of wonder is gone.

I just want to play the game and have fun.

Shouldn't the need for +hit be equal between arms and fury? Note that I'm talking about 2H fury, not DW fury. Most PvE guides say that 2H Fury &gt; 2H Arms
---
Didn’t realize that, thanks!
---
Got home from work around 8PM. 924PM and I have 130 minutes left. Ridiculous.
---
What's the rotation you use for your abilities when fighting?  
---
I open the fight with Charge, then straight away pop Bloodrage and buff myself with Battle Shout, and applying a Rend to the target.  
---
Use Overpower immediately whenever it procs, you get lots of damage from this one if you're lucky. 
---
Start by spamming Sunder Armour until the enemy is below ~60% health or you hit 5 stacks.   
---
After this, you want to spend all your rage casting Mortal Strike, until the target reaches falls below 20% health where you obviously want to finish him off with Execute.  
---
This is my strategy for single target fights.  
---
If you pull 2 mobs at once you want to Rend both of them at the beginning then activate Sweeping Strikes as soon as possible and start using Mortal Strike immediately without worrying about Sunder Armour.  
---
If you pull more than that you will have to use Retaliation as well to be able to survive.  
---
Another thing that helps in emergencies is casting Intimidating Shout to fear the enemies and immediately healing yourself with a bandage.  
---
  
---
Keeping a steady supply of Bandages, Healing Potions, Buff Food and the highest healing food you can afford from the innkeepers will help a lot to decrease downtime between pulls.  
---
Better than all of this, make some friends and level with them instead
---
I hope i don’t get banned for swapping layers to give people enchants, sometimes it won’t swap me because i have changed layers several times when inviting people to parties
---
Popular opinion: no one cares what a random thinks about other people's experiences.
---
It's because so many players do nothing but SM spam and that's in a horde controlled area, it's right outside Undercity.
---
Yeah BFA I felt was just a game that played itself. No one talked at all.
---
That's awesome!
---
You’ll be forced into a rename. If the same character is reported for name again you may be temp banned and asked to rename again
---
Not as bad, but so many people abused it for farming, avoiding other people stealing their mobs and PVP
---
Dont think about it. Just play the game and enjoy 😊

I like it
---
It's not comparable. You're licensing a game, you're never buying it. A license has conditions. By breaking the license you are breaking the deal you *willingly* entered.
---
The law on the other hand is just there, you never willingly agreed to it.
---
It's also not saying breaking the law is dishonest. He's not true to his word (the agreement he entered by his own free will), and that's the textbook definition of dishonesty. Honestly, you need a class on this stuff or something.

When there's two mobs to kill, I have to tell people we should all kill the same one first.

Shamans ok,

there are better classes for all the rolls though. you wont be #1 but you will be welcome.
---
Rad, Im constantly finding myself underleveled for the quests I have (I have questie) so ill try that approach
---
I got told to go to retail when I complained in gen chat about how annoying getting ganked by skull horde groups. When I said the last time I played was wraith they still told me to go back to retail. Or a PvE server. Also to get gud.
---
Watching old pvp videos could help you out, Swity's Incredible Warrior Tricks taught me some stuff back in the day. 
---
But without a PVP trinket it's pretty rough, grab some free action potions (these need to be used BEFORE you are cc'd. 
---
Zerker stance will also help you break charm and incapacitate effects (like gouge). But it's all relative, get a shield macro going if you're  up against a rogue and you know you won't break his stealth go into defense stance with a shield.
---
Disarm melee classes, use demo shout to break stealth, swap for an overpower always, if you see a hunter drop a freeze trap use challenging shout to taunt his pet so that it will break you out of the effect, if you don't have a ranged weapon giving you stats use throwing weapons to his opponents more quickly to either keep them in combat or daze hunters, thunder clap and sunder will make a difference against rogues and warrios
---
You have a lot of tools in your bag and you need to be using everyone of them to get those wins, you just need to learn what to use given the situation.
---
all
---
The server can already handle the people. Layering just prevents the zones being overcrowded. Layering does not effect queues.

The pauldrons you got from RFK looks awesome with the robe from RFD quest.  Make sure you get the green gloves dropped by the escort mission boss too.

Uhh okay? Lol

Well on a side note welcome to WoW. Not everyone is like that.
---
Kromcrush is Alliance dominated? It always seems like a 4v1 whenever I go to STV or Hillisbrad
---
So what happened with this?
---
That's it? 30 days? 
---
# That's it?
---
It's crazy to me that layering was implemented for instances... like holy shit what a stupid oversight, by a billion dollar company.
---
Sick CM Haf XB Evo - I have one too! I have put many builds in that case, I love it.
---
Where does it say the items are deleted?
---
Also, sometimes you can't outthreat the dps
---
Seems stupid, given that's our purpose, but Blizzard liked noodle damage on our threat gen way back when
---
I thought it was 5 days at most to get the 1.5 levels
---
What does it matter if it puts a smile on people's face?
---
A month is nothing considering the offense.
---
You cannot make both horde and alliance characters on the same realm. 
---
I’d just google ‘Wow Classic Population report’ and you’ll find the info you’re looking for.
---
Hawt! Finally my turn to have luck on the rolls. I also found a Sentry Cloak in Ashenvale.
---
Blizzard banning people over ninja looting takes away some rpg aspect imo. I like the wild west aspect of Classic Blizzard dictating how things should be.
---
then make sure to leave the group and hearth away cause no one wants to play with you anyway
---
What add-on is that? That shows the disenchant stuff

What the hell is unprofessional about his statement?

It's a catch up mechanic. Look things up first.

Nah they can talk, but they're in the opposite faction's jails.
---
Oof.  Im a Tauren who only recently visited UC for the flight path and auctioneer in my travels.
---
First, the place is a fucking maze.
---
Second, I've been killed by that fucking elevator like 10 times.  Seems cat form gets me stuck extra and then I fall so I have to remember to decat before i run on or off.
---
And it has been, but everyone is running around like it ruined the game, and that is extremely funny to me, because it really has changed nothing in the long run.
---
Difficulty is measured by effort required. Not having enough stats does not make it harder, by definition. You simply can't do something your numbers are not big enough to accomplish. Mechanics require more input from the player and so, simply by definition, Retail is much more difficult than Classic. 
---
I don't get why people say Classic is hard. The combat is slow, there are very few mechanics, and the rotations and player expression are almost non-existent. The game is brain dead easy, it's just super immersive and a lot of people have nostalgia for it.
---
I'm loving it but lets not pretend that Classic is challenging in any sort of way. Just get bigger numbers.
---
Hey those are the super soldier stv cats. The very same ones that dodge, parry and avoid most melee classes abilities
---
By the way sorry I came off so angry man I’ve been having a bad day and arguing with people about video games to let out anger I guess but it’s having the opposite effect. But I didn’t mean all the insults.
---
Alliance are dropping like flies from mograine, more are being made sure but a lot of mid level players are ditching, Ive stuck it out cause I’m rogue levelling I can generally sneak my way around, but yesterday there was a raid of horde in tanaris just ganking, in a similar case I killed a same level hunter and about 5 of their guildies roll up spamming “go back to retail” looking for me, if that’s what they wanna do that’s fine everybody gotta get that fun in their own way, but when there’s nobody left to wpvp or queue bg’s against I hope they don’t come complaining lol
---
Saw the writing on the walls and joined the winning team
---
To be fair you had three weeks to do something.  You could have rerolled like they suggested. You could have free transfered.

If you stayed on a full realm it's kind of on you.

I moved and have been having a blast on Arcanite Reaper

i'm not sure if its *the* bis leg piece but it'd definitely be up there, that's an insane amount of agility

This
---
Blizzard isn't a great workplace that aspiring game devs would kill to just have a testing job at anymore.  No one is wanting to get paid minimum wage reading social media for exploits and fetching coffee for them.
---
sold for 50g and is now listed for 100, so idk how i feel about that
---
Yeah except that every single tank would need roll for the axe as well.
---
FAP.
---
lol ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Dude, you're delusional. There is 0% chance they can track the butterfly effect down to every one of the possibly hundreds of thousands of affected accounts. Even if they could, the impact of that sort of rollback would be far worse than the original problem.
---
I was going to go between Stalagg and Blamaeux and it looks like I made the right choice.
---
The people running around on epic mounts are going to feel that ban hammer and it’s going to be so fucking SWEET.

They could, but thats basically 150+ hours to catch up to where they are right now.

Punishment enough for me.

I've been hearing that alliance is having a horrible time on pretty much all pvp servers. Is it recommended to play on a pve server if i want to role alliance characters?
---
Horde scum. Wya so I can come deliver some alliance dick

Just gonna out him to his entire faction like that? That's cold.

Lol RFC and similar low level dungeons don't need a tank. Just go in with 4 dd's. SM is where a tank became a need for me. But this only because I heal in full enhance specc.
---
No I'm referring to you acting like he didn't earn world first 60 when you said 'if you can even call it that'. Idc what he did after that.
---
The instance thing is a bug not an oversight in the mechanic it isn't in the same 'problem' as layering at all.
---
Layer hopping's only large effect on anything is from a bug, not an oversight, people's previous complaints about layering aren't connected at all. Layering sucks but it is also a necessary evil for the launch otherwise the game would have been (and still pretty much would be) literally unplayable.
---
Maybe due to exploiting, but I also think some folks have actually just played that much.

Thank you so much man! These are all amazing
---
No they were layering raids as well.
---
Lmao on my laptop in vanilla the ping was okay (300-400 in those days, 20 these days), but the FPS was a GD slideshow. Playable at like 15-20 in the middle of nowhere, but SW was 5ish  and flying dropped to more of .1 - .5 FPS lol
---
I never played classic, I started in wrath. 
---
But you can look anything up. We have all the information. Really what is there to discuss? All the metas have been found, all the rotations are known, all the mechanics are known, there are video guides for everything. 
---
There is no need to ask questions here cause a quick google search yields results.
---
Not entirely correct. In vanilla, it was actually straight up garbage exp to do literally *anything* in a raid group. The only reason it became a thing in Classic, is because there was a big bug that, instead of down-scaling exp for raid groups, it was being left the same, in fact slightly upscaled.
---
Raiding 5mans always incurred a penalty of roughly 80% of the experience for doing it in a 5 player group. It was never, ever, good exp. Has absolutely nothing to do with people being able to 'properly run numbers' - it was just a bug that didn't exist in vanilla, but existed in Classic.
---
No rank 1 lightning or shocks? Auto attack on 3? Lol what a noob
---
Blink is an extra 20 yards every 15 seconds, or 1.333... (recurring, of course) yards per second. Since the base run speed is 7 yards per second, that’s an increase of 1.333 / 7 , nearly 20%.
---
Cat form is 3 in classic
---
No need to be 60 if you cannot stealth, most of the buyers are rogues since they also get a nice weapon

---
I don't know for sure, but I don't feel like that's the way it works. I believe the single queue is for the amalgamated population of all the layers combined. Layering isn't to reduce queue times, it's too reduce overpopulation within specific zones.
---
That is literally exactly what the OP is saying in this post, but you called him a donut for saying it.
---
That rig.  Those addons.  That seat mod.  Jesus, you a serious player.
---
Proof? hate to be that guy but im curious.
---
Bad groups are so easy to come by. 
---
My biggest thing is no 1 cares if the healer gets aggro from healing. Everyone just goes about their day attacking their own target lol
---
Can confirm.  Work out in rural midwest without WiFi, barely get LTE signal on my phone hotspot and I always get &lt;100ms latency on East coast server.  I was shocked, I really can't tell a difference from my home fiber line.
---
BABY DONT HURT ME
---
Just make your own guild and don't invite anybody to it if you really want to play alone
---
^(Or maybe be social since that's one of the big appeals of classic but hey you do you lol)
---
you sound very uncalm lol.
---
I'm sure this can be found somewhere else, but I'm absolutely desperate to find a guild to do dungeons and grind to 60. On EU Gehennas. If anyone has serious suggestions, or can refer to me to a place with that kind of information, I would really appreciate it
---
Unitframesimproved is very nice

If you add an exclamation in front of !Bear Form it won’t recast it.

Hell, I've used PoM on Poly
---
My alt is a mage while my priest is my main at 50 and I've played healers in original wow. A couple of priest tips for the newbies.
---
1. If you're healing AOE spell cleave, don't bother and only use flash heal/shields. It's pointless being efficient, some people can die before you get your heal off. As a priest, spell cleave is easier to heal compared to melee cleave. 
---
2. Be efficient with your heals, have multiple ranks of multiple heals. 
---
3. Priest shields are underrated, give your warrior a shield and start drinking, by the time his shield wears off and hes at 50% you should be full. 
---
4. If you're doing AOE spell cleave, and you know everyone is going to take a ton of damage, shield everyone (last 30 seconds) and then pull, by the time the debuff wears out you can shield them again. 
---
5. Avoid healing anyone that doesn't need heals, I mainly focus on tanks and Warlocks because the need mana to DPS.
---
6. Renew your warlocks after fights. If you have any mana to spare then renew anyone else. 
---
7. If you're getting low on mana and your dps is taking too much damage then stop focus on keeping them alive, its better to keep your tank alive.
---
I have been and it still doesn't seem to cast. I'll try to figure it out! Thanks.
---
It was raids and dungeons. It wasn't discovered until Esfand?(I think that is his name) did it by mistake and opened a ticket immediately while streaming. There was a hotfix done over night last night that fixed the issue though.
---
They could have been doing it already the first week also.  A lot of the people abusing it hard are also probably a lot of the week one 60's.  Delete gold, items, and a ban is a good fix to not let their characters ill gotten gains effect the economy any more than it already has.  Add to that that list of these people probably did the 10 man raid leveling that was bugged... another exploit basically.  And they will have to level again, in the group's of people currently leveling so no easy aoe leveling or raid grinding this time.  Minimal exploits they can abuse then.
---
Everyone is looking for their personal sweet spot
---
Level as Enhance, but keep a set of caster (int/spirit) gear to change into when you want to heal in dungeons.  Regardless of your spec, you'll be able to heal all 5-man and most 10-man content in the game.  Just keep that caster set ready.
---
When you get to lvl 40, leveling as Elemental becomes just as (if not more) effective than Enhance, and you won't need to keep a 2nd set of gear on hand for group content.
---
Resto is not recommended for leveling, unless you're going to be doing nothing but grinding dungeons.
---
A month *for these folks* is practically a ban. They could (and probably will) start a fresh account and be back where they were in a week or two. For no-lifers, that's way better than sitting idle for 30 days or more.
---
If it is your 1st time through Vanilla/Classic then i guess spend endless weeks trying to find quests that arent in quest hubs and then go to thottbot and research it? Im not sure what the purpose of this was. A lot of people enjoy addons. I for one do. Questie just helps make the questing a little faster.
---
&gt; How it feels like
---
It's just "how it feels", the word like is not needed and is improper.
---
Dude I'm not sure I'd even recognize it as an exploit unless it happened more than once. 
---
I'm not nearly familiar enough with the games mechanics to know when something "bugged" or I'm actually doing something like a exploit.
---
Redneck rig legend
---
To go a little off topic, wouldn't the same logic be applied to multiboxers? Does that not also impact the economy?
---
Stardust crusaders theme lol
---
yeah in the next 2-3 weeks, the bulk of players are going to hit 60 and start getting their pre-raid bis items, guilds are going to start firming up their raid roster, the market for enchantment materials and consumables will start to pick up. This is actually a pretty bad time to be out of the game for that long.
---
They literally contacted Blizzard about it before killing anything, they got 2 different Blizz employees to confirm it was fine for them to continue. There is no way on earth you can then ban them for that. They reported it as a bug.
---
I never said they should keep the Gold or loot necessarily. If Blizzard wants to revoke that I think that's fair. However banning people over their error is unwarranted.
---
I've thought about what a WoW idler game would look like, your experience with Glider sounds about like what I imagine!
---
Wouldnt they get banned again? Or if they did it without exploiting they wouldnt get back whatever theyve earned because it would take much longer.
---
That statement is kinda bullshit. If it were true anyone who practices a skill or sport is insane
---
IDK but this gives me mega Super Mario 3 vibes
---
It's ok, I started out alliance for night elf and switched to horde haha!
---
Ask around in World chat.
---
neat. Blueberry? I like soloing content. sadly I rolled a shaman lol
---
A fuck up is one thing, exploiting a fuck up over and over and over and over and over for an edge is bannable.
---
I do not recommend people using auto-target macros in dungeons and raids. You WILL ninja pull.
---
I bought an 8 button mouse to play Druid and have Bear, Cat, Prowl/Shadowmeld (depending on form), Regrowth, Healing Touch, Roots, Feral Faerie Fire &amp; Nature's Grasp bound to unreachable keys that correspond to buttons on my mouse. It frees up a lot of space.
---
Actually a very large group of classic players never experienced vanilla AQ40 - and even smaller number had seen Naxx40. I personally played from 6 months into launch all the way through vanilla and never even did BWL. I was overwhelmed by all the stuff to do that i never bothered really with raiding. 
---
Next, funny how retail players enjoy retail more. Its catered to ultra casuals. You never have to talk to anyone and the community is dead. Yes there's still players - but the glory of the community and it policing itself is gone. If you dont like classic - dont play. Its that easy.
---
Why are you posting on reddit that you're fighting with your guild
---
Say it in guild chat
---
I hit 30 on Friday and definitely felt thin on questing, then ended up running a few dungeons and completing some dungeons quests and got a good boost that way.
---
Explains the queues disappearing
---
cool
---
And much better for money too.  Less food/drink/consumables, and more quest rewards.
---
So, I need an entire PvP video with these sound effects.  Make it happen.

Yep, I know how.

That, have a realm called "Exiled" or "Purgatory" with character creation turned off, so no one can create a character there or enter that realm. The only way to go there is by getting banned\exiled\sent to prison for doing something stupid, exploit, cheat, racial slurs, etc.. 
---
Like one day all your characters would be on the prison realm, but the realm has login Qs, lags, crashes often, profanity filter is on by default. Everything to make your life hard.
---
You're not banned from playing but your playing experience is a punishment. I'm sure some would try to make a life on that kind of extreme server with all those other cheater\exploiter\trolls. IN the time of selling customer's info, that server could be something interesting.
---
Yeah I really don't get this. If I see a horde noob, noobing it around in a zone, I'll leave him alone, and I encourage my alliance brethren to treat them honourably aswell. There's no glory or pride in butchering defenseless opponents. Unless someone has a real chance of killing me, I won't engage on them. 
---
Thrill comes from danger, there's no danger in one-shotting random noobs. 
---
I think most players agree, and the toxic element of PVP is just over-represented here.
---
What about the people who farmed mobs by exploiting layering? You know, the people who got the world firsts?
---
I knew it was jealousy noted before I even opened the pic lol. Congrats!
---
I generally only put renew on in-between fights, just to help them top up before the next pull.
---
Ah, ok, well still.  Probably just panicked.  Pretty sure he was alt tabbed and saw the game glow.
---
That’s the Barrels
---
It’s cute that you kept trying to get it.
---
Just spit on them and add to ignore. 
---
On another note, I had someone /rude me after I semi-ninja’d a chest I was pushing for. I had killed 3 Murlocs and was eating/drinking before I killed the last 2 right beside the chest  but the warlock swept in and felt entitled since they insta-pulled the last 2 in front of the chest. I claimed what was mine.
---
Couldn't get anyone to help me but managed to grab ravager last night and just hit 37 before bed :) might go do this quest solo now as I never did in vanilla
---
Yeah. I think Arcanite Reaper was the lowest and until recently was LOW 100% of the time.  It's up to medium now. I'm finding quite a bit of people and it's not packed like my last realm.  It's nice.  I'm happy and can actually play
---
If you think theres too much pvp in tauren mill, just wait till STV.
---
Ashenvale should still be mostly green to you with some yellow quests in the north eastern part. You can also go to duskwood/wetlands/arathi basin
---
do you need a top of the line phone or is it like stadia where it can be a potato phone that merely "broadcasts" your pc screen and your phone is a remote?
---
true that, at least for the higher level zones, won't matter for anything low

"Driver's *License*" is required to drive. These laws only apply to drivers. Driving is something you knowingly consent to and agree to follow the rules in order to be allowed.
---
is it still rolling when the tank pulls? If so this is likely the culprit.
---
I bet that chair is comfy as fuuuuuuuck.
---
Also to address the dpsing. Your mana should be 100% for healing. If you have some free GCD and want to do some damage then Wands are okay. 
---
but don't waste your 5 second rule on dps as a healer. mana is far too important.
---

---
Also a lot of 'no experience required' jobs that promise a lot and deliver little.
---
Good truck drivers are in demand at the moment though.  If you're safe, reliable, and do what you're supposed to...you can make a good living.
---
It's just questionable how much longer the career will last (but that's true of a lot of things at the moment).
---
Again, that has been a problem for all of WoW, compounded by the fact people are leveling, so they legitimately get very few stacks of items and throw it on the AH when they're back in a city.
---
Any more pics of your set up? Where you put your tower? Inverter? Table?
---
Yeah that's most likely what has been getting on the nerves of your party. In a dungeon setting you're not wanted for anything other than heals.
---
This guy knows.
---
I'm in the mid 40's, and let me tell you that is not the case. There are clearly many more active horde at my level than there are alliance.
---
lol what they did is a instancreset from Vanilla, everybody did that back in the days so its ok
---
Shouldn't it be Enviousness Noted?
---
Isn't the new name Better Call Thrall ?
---
Greater heal does a lot of threat just use renew / heal
---
Hopefully, anyone exploiting this will be banned and have the items / gold rolled back.
---
It's Wailing Caverns you casual. 
---
All jokes aside, sorry you went through that!
---
I’m not fighting with my guild, my guildies are fighting with each other lol.
---
I was like what laptop is that until I zoomed in. Damn.
---
Desolace is a good one. Id only recommend STV if you're in a party or its late. On my server it feels like STV is where everyone goes to fight and is the kind of the unspoken rule. Everywhere else i lvld in that range i was left alone  99% of the time
---
Have you played a hunter? There are a lot of grey areas where loot is a clear upgrade but if you’re a nice guy you would still just greed. I’m not talking 2h melee weapons only - plenty of cloth gear is amazing for hunters (we use mana too...) but you have to be very careful what you roll on if you don’t want to piss people off.
---
your ass must hurt so bad lol
---
Have you done Wetlands? There should be early 30 STV quests. And check out Arathi Highlands and Hilsbrad.
---
Um. You said it. You said Questie goes against the classic experience.  Your post assumes that there is a universal classic experience and that those who use Questie are playing in a way that is not compatible with that classic experience.  
---
You could have said “is the opposite of what I had in mind for my own personal classic experience”, which is probably what you meant.  But you knew better and went with the baity-title and now you’re pretending that you don’t know what I’m talking about.  
---
Where’s the eye roll emoji....
---
It could be, I can't honestly say. I'll be sure to not do this going forward. I've just not paid close enough attention.
---
watch the drakedog vids i linked in the other reply to become more hyped.
---
I honestly went through three guilds before I found one I liked. Just group with randoms for dungeons and such till you find somebody like minded. Then ask about there guild. If it doesn’t work out. Tell them nicely they aren’t what you are looking for and move on. Try again. 
---
When it comes to general chat. Ya. That’s the norm. My guildys and I like to watch it scroll by and chuckle at the occasional good comment. Otherwise we ignore it or even open a tab without it. I’m honestly surprised your old server didn’t have much of the same.
---
This comment needs more updoots.
---
A lot of people like click-to-heal, which would mean picking up an addon for that purpose. Personally, I prefer mouseover heals, which you can do with the built-in macro interface.
---
Example:
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
&gt;/cast \[@mouseover,help\] \[@targettarget,help\] \[\] Greater Heal
---
The above macro will do the following things:
---
1. If you are mousing over a friendly unit, it will target them with greater heal
---
2. If your target's target (i.e. you are targeting a mob that is targeting the tank) is friendly, it will target that friendly unit
---
3. Otherwise, it will perform whatever your default functionality is for Greater Heal (likely healing a friendly target, or self-casting if one isn't available)
---
Yes, already joined! And the Discord too!
---
External macros are banned though. And thats what this is.
---
I see a bunch of tombstones.
---
go poop, man
---
Yes even the lowest pop realms have more than high pop realms in actual vanilla
---
Lol it was a joke calm down dude. Most the time I just go on my way too while I’m leveling.
---
It’s true i was the burning steppes.
---
About your zepelins point, I've come to remember why I have such fond memories of  thr boat between booty bay and ratchet. When 10+ members of either faction stand in silence as the boat leaves port and some undead priest finds it funny to psychic scream and start an all out war on the boat it's a spontaneous kind of magic. Or when a night elf Hunter thinks it's funny to attack the one horde priest on the boat and all the alliance stand back and just let him MC the Hunter off the boat in retaliation while laughing is a beautiful thing.
---
Are you healing too early? Do you put up a renew as the tank runs in?  Don't do that and def don't pre bubble your tank if it's a rage dependent tank.  Let him take some hits before you start healing and make sure to fade.  Do not dps, you are there to heal.  Wand if you know you are safe from pulling aggro and want to regen mana and help a little with damage but def no mind blast or any other offensive spells until you get used to aggro management.  It will take a warrior a few seconds minimum to spread threat around a 4 or 5 mob pull so you don't pull with healing.  Usually it's the mages that pull the aggro off by starting damage too early then your warrior tank won't have the rage he needed by getting hit and now he can't build threat on anything so you super healing that mage or whoever else pulled aggro you are in danger of taking some of them also because the dps made the tank useless essentially by not knowing how to manage threat.
---
also you can just do "#show dash" if you don't feel like spelling out tooltip or dont feel like pressing shift
---
Yeah but if the factions are balanced people may be able to fight back? PVP isn't about 2 sided combat, it's about one shotting lowbies and running away when people your level arrive
---
I had to log on at 6 am just to get through that zone
---
Maybe understand first what this is in regards to.
---
I’m looking for an active guild on the thunderfury alliance server. Any leads??
---
Some day I'm going to finish clearing a dungeon with a pug and somebody will whisper me: good job with the heals want to join our guild? And I might at that point actually consider it.
---
No
---
You murdered that cat and stole his backpack
---
if you drag the little slider above the layer window you can change how transparent they are...
---
"Peacebloom enthusiasts" thankyouverymuch.
---
If you want a real reason and you're not just trolling it was because humans could already be the vast majority of classes and they wanted to have some incentive to pick a different race for certain classes. 
---
From a lore standpoint there is no reason at all and it really should have been done sooner than it was. On this subreddit though even daring to mention that will get you flamed by the trolls and dog piled.
---
*Lisence* as in driver's has an entirely different meaning, which you probably know already. Please remove head from ass, I'm not playing semantics.
---
False. You agree to the laws when you chose to live/pay taxes in a place. You have the choice to move if you don't agree with the laws.
---
It is a completely fair comparison.
---
Theres lots of options, level 30 is enough for early STV and Desolace quests. Plenty of Hillsbrad quests, I find its pretty safe for PvP if you just do the quests south of the main road and even the North isnt relatively that bad. A few Ashenvale and Wetlands quests should still be your level if you go there now. Some Stonetalon quests and lots of Shimmering Flats quests (though these areas tend to be heavily Horde controlled).
---
Gnomeregan and RFK are both your level with some quests with great rewards too.
---
And people complained about the "no lore than 1 skeleton" change.
---
Ass
---
Nah, ya prick ya.
---
The trick is just to stop and they will turn around faster. They are savages and showing fear makes them chase you more. Seriously though, if you run past their “leash” range they will keep following if you keep running, but if you stop they run up to you then turn around. It’s weird.
---
I don’t have direct experience with Blizzards stance on this specifically, just off other games and how vanilla servers handle item dupes/exploits.
---
So how do they tell if they “sold it” to a friend?
---
You are asking in what is like top 3 circlejerk sub on the whole reddit. BfA sucks massive dick but don't expect fair answers here.
---
Hey, you leave us Dwarves out of this!
---
I agree
---
Came to comments for this. Wasn’t disappointed
---
!RemindMe 12 hours
---
why are you calling me a prick I was just excited about your post that's pretty rude
---
Legit the comfiest gaming chair
---
People are fascinating but i havent done much academia wise. Its interesting to think about for sure, the child like perception we hope to maintain, clashes with this efficiency based world\society. If your not useful gtfo.
---
there are a bunch of 30-32 quests in Hillsbrad, if you have done those you could head over to STV and do some of the intro quests to Arathi - STV gets a fair bit easier around 33-34 though so might be worth running SM a few times
---
What a retarded take
---
Barring some sort of official approval (there's precedent with Everquest and Project 1999), it's not quite the same
---
I disagree. Classic on official servers is and should be the way to play. 
---
I'm simply stating that yes the code is their failure and they're taking actions to reverse what happend. I think that's pretty reasonable. We'll see how it pans out. Hopefully it's so much of a none issue people forgot about it by next month.
---
Yes.
---
Agi is amazing on warrior for leveling.
---
It’s like watching the helmet kids fight on the school bus
---
&gt; The people who explited this bug made it to lvl 60 in 15 days. If you give them a ban longer than a month, they'd simply reroll.
---
This guy thinks that people hit level 60 in 15 days did the exploit, holy fuck.
---
DON'T HURT ME
---
No, classic wow is dead. People said it would be dead after a month so therefore it must be dead right now.
---

You can rebound any button on any taskbar to any empty button or button combo. (Shift-1, Ctr-2,etc.) this includes the extra bars you can turn on in the interface menu. I have my 2 heals and purify on my bottom left extra cast bar. The first 3 slots on it. I then rebound those keys to q,e, and r for easy reach yet out of the way of my offensive spells. Once I get to the point of raiding I can set up macros to down level these spells if I hold the shift button. 
---
Quick thing. I like to unbind all keys and then slowly add in the binds for what I actually use. No need to have a random hot key to open my talent menu when it can be more efficiently used to cast one of my ability’s. Like I said. Bind what you actually need to where you can comfortably reach on your keyboard. You don’t want your oh shit button  to be on the other side of the keyboard where you can’t reach it. Or where you miss the button when you do reach. You want it set somewhere that you can reflexively hit when you suddenly drop into the red because some jerk horde rogue/mage combos you down when you decide to let them live. (Personal experience here. Don’t know why this particular combo thinks they can take a pally 5 levels higher than them when I have all my cool downs.)

Thats not an exploit

This, 100%

Can i ask how many times they have forced you to change your names in the past? Curious because i have been name changed in the past for a holy priest i named Holyshatt back in TBC.
---
Yeah, and in addition to this you have so many tools at your disposal in Classic, honestly no class can really be counted out when you factor in potions, trinkets, and gadgets...
---
don't be that guy.
---
Yea she can be rough around here some times it feel like the barrens
---
Did they not do it twice?
---
I felt pretty strong around the 22 mark, it depends a lot on what talents you take though and your familiarity with the spec, early on I was casting firebolts and whatnot without realising it's just better to spam frostbolt
---
Lol, no.  God this community is childish even after all these years.
---
It's Blizzard's bug.  I'm not even comfortable with them handing out any bans except for extreme abusers.  Getting a few more MCPs is not ruining the economy...
---
Streamers won't get banned I'm sure.
---
The first picture is Davros from Dr. Who if you asked.
---
you're describing the entire open source community. pretty much all modern software at this point has open source components integrated into it, including the device you replied on, the browser you used, and every Reddit component used to render your comment.
---
I get these whispers too...yet when I post on realm discords/forums looking for a guild and what I'm interested in etc I don't get a response.  
---
Funny that...cesspool guilds are happy to spam but don't look where people actually go to find guilds.  
---
I'll find one that suits me eventually but until then I'm happy to not have a wave of toxic green chat on my screen.
---
Never once on this guy. Which is weird. But my other account, dildobagginz, I've changed twice now with no ban?
---
Nobody has ever made this joke. Ever.
---
No it means people didnt listen or broadcast that discussion for some reason
---
This is objectively wrong. It's a matter of a caster getting his spell off and not getting its spell off.
---
What's your auction house add-on op? If you don't mind me asking.

---
Constantly have issues with people in this game.  Just makes the whole instance slower.  Much easier on the healer to only have to heal one person.  And pulls can happen faster.  At least most people will let me LOS pull, however, once they turn that corner our 3 dps have each simultaneously damage 3 different targets, before I can even build rage to get 1 sunder off.
---
nice I give out healthstone to people and tried bags and people were the same way or rude. Nice to see someone remember.
---
Good luck with that bud, im level 9.
---
What queue times? I haven't seen a queue since the first weekend. Try a different server. If you're not willing to play a different server, regardless of reason, then don't complain about the queue.
---
How do you look at player info? Like if you click someone’s name  and in chat it tells you “28 rogue blah blah.”
---
The only issue I see is having to do the same content twice?
---
Hopefully so. I've learned a fair bit by posting this. I realize I'm focused far too much on damage dealing as a healer class, at least in 5-man settings. I always thought I could freely damage as long as everyone's health was staying up. I think that is my biggest issue. I would throw shadow word pain around like candy on Halloween but I guess that is not great when I'm pulling so much threat/agro as it is. I should have better results on my next group run.
---
You mean the best look.
---
Wow why so many?
---
I had the same thing happen but after i helped them they pumped the shit out of me and bailed, i was mad at first then relised i woulda done the same thing and just started laughing, fuck i love classic wow
---
Fun is more important than level. I am leveling my second character to 60 now because I find that fun. I dont find farming prebis at all fun. Just do what you enjoy the most.
---
Lol, I'm a level 40 mage and I still use the staff of westfall.
---
Not at all! It's called Auctioneer. Make sure you get the classic version. And be prepared to wait for half an hour while you make your first scan.
---
I've been curious, is there a way to see total playtime? I wanna know how many hours I've sunk into the game XD
---
Is rep lowered if you're doing low level quests? I'm 30 going to desolace and I figured I'd do some quests for the tauren on my way there in stonetalon. First questngave me ten rep in TB. Is that normal?
---
btw this is not even the group i am with if thats what you are thinking they were random people who i flew perfectly with lol.
---
Except they remove all the gear and gold you gained.
---
Haha dang ok thanks man!
---
If you insist on it you can solo queue with a lot of time investment to rank 8-10, daggers/ring/off pieces from AV, PvP trinket paired with engineering trinket(s) and cape/neck/bracer from ranks 3-5. Second ring is from WSG. You won’t be a powerhouse but you’ll not be completely dead weight.

Horde on Blaumeux here. Kill Cubelock on sight. Got it.

If u love Un'goro make sure ur weather density and effects are ALL THE WAY UP. The rain is so beautiful I really miss un'goro.

---
This is called rationalizing. You *are* dishonest, and there is no way around it. 
---
I have as little respect for you as a thief.
---
You're the one so defensive about it. It's like you're part of crusade and are guilty
---
How did you get to 60 so fast. I can understand why you are leveling a new  char.
---
my life que was 7 hours
---
my battleground que was 45 mins
---
I gave up on my dungeon ques.
---
 they lost like 60% of the remaining players
---
the fuck are you talking about as fast. haven't waited longer than 2 mins for a group on classic
---
and just about every healer wishes they wouldn't
---
I dont like layer abusing but some times this is the only option
---
Looks like WeakAuras
---
That is a good point
---
implying you can kill a chad gnome lol
---
You're projecting outrage
---
whats weird is, i have no idea if classic has diminishing returns OR a pvp trinket.
---
things youd go "well yeah sure obviously they do" dont really stand when you realize that poly and sap last like 1minute which is completely different then the later versions.
---
Objectively right, for one.
---
Hey. It’s better than the old manual way we had to do it for most adding back in the early days.
---
That's different than what's already been going how?
---
Global cooldown.  1.5 seconds cooldown after casting  most spells.
---
To be efficient you want to always be casting every GCD. However classic design will punish you for it by running out of Mana which is where the five second rule comes in.
---
Basically wands let you do something with the gcds that you're using to Regen Mana.
---
Spellpower is always better as long as you have a mana pool you are happy with. Int gives you 10 mana and spell crit. Also Spirit is better then agil and strength but it is not something remotely you aim for. Every spell you cause stops your mana regen for 5 seconds. So the only impact you will see from spirit is while you are moving around the world/between pools and even if you are running max spirit will never be able to match your drinks/mana gem/evocation.
---
I'd rather not, sorry
---
Yeah, can't remember what it's called but usually the simplest explanation is the correct one. As someone that plays a lot of games it can be easy to forget that most people don't have that kind of time to devote to playing games so when a druid/priest walks past you without buffing you then consider that they are probably putting so much of their mental power into playing the game that they can't spare anything to think about buffing you, or they just lack the situational awareness, and probably not that they're entirely apathetic towards you.
---
If it makes you feel better wars have to camp a 2h and battle/berserker stance 95% of the time.
---
Make your own Weakaura. And have it pop up on an actionbar that has its opacity set to 0 with Dominoes or Bartender4.
---
A green AND a bag in one creature? He used up all of his luck.
---
Why didn't they just have more servers and no layering in the first place.
---
Launder
---
That is normal, yes. AFAIK, any grey quests give lowered rep. Though if someone could confirm that it's specifically grey, that'd be great.
---
Global Cool Down. The time from when you use a spell until you can use another
---
A lot of the "No lifers" took weeks off work. So yes I think that's a big deal to lose.
---
I'm subbed to Esfand and play on Faerlina so idk what you're talking about about hating them.
---
This is just about should they get 2 weeks worth of loot from 1 week
---
Do not put hots on the tank or heal them while they pull.
---
Do not bubble feral or warrior tanks, since they need to get hit by the mobs to generate rage and therefore aggro.
---
Wait with your first heal until they have built some aggro. It is usually fine to wait until the tank has lost 50% or more of their health, and only then start healing. 
---
When you have aggro, run towards the tank, not away from them.
---
That is the boat I am in, you don't want to be stuck alone after playing 200 hours.
---
It’s not targeted at my guild lol it’s about the community in general. On reddit all I’ve seen for the past two days is fighting, Facebook groups, general chat, guild chat. Shits ass
---
He's dishonest, and he's okay with it. By his own admission. Consistent dishonesty definitely qualifies for "shitty human" in my book.
---
I'm playing level 18 priest and I didn't know about not power word shielding the tank...whoops.
---
To be fair none of them had told me not to yet.
---
That is good to know
---
There is a clear line between having this happen naturally, then doing it again to see if it was some fluke or if it is repeatable then stopping and abusing it for a hundred kills.
---
Blizzard has logs for everything and tools for analyzing that data as granular as they like.  Abuse is very easy to identify vs accidents
---
Whoooollleeeesommmeee take my upvote
---
My friends wanted to kill them all, told them all no. It was too pure to start fighting. There was 4 horde and I got /thanks from all of em.
---
HWID ban.   2 birds, one stone.  You wanna keep playing? Buy a new PC.
---
I took two weeks off work (27 August to 9 September) during which I got to 60. I did dungeons the entire way with EPL and winter spring interspersed for prebis quests. At 60 I farmed dreamfoil and righteous orbs with my cleave group. We killed rag first night and are waiting on reset. I’m back at work full time as of last Monday so it’s been great not having the stress of levelling. I just Remote Desktop and come home to easy play.
---
Yeah, that was my read too. I was thinking, sheesh man, really got to bring that in here?
---
Thanks TSM!
---
This is lovely.
---
If I were you I'd drop tailoring for skinning to make some gold while levelling. Then at 60 you can drop it for whatever
---
I know you're joking, but real talk, the entire career will be extinct within 5-10 years due to self-driving trucks. Unfortunate, but true.
---
Agree 100% except about the tank getting dazed.
---
Stop keyboard turning.
---
Stop it.
---
Well i guess everyone gets away with it then . . . give me a break. they will do everything they can do to punish the abusers and rectify any damage they caused to the economy. Some innocent people are going to deal with the consequences as well if the exploit really did go that far. Better a few people get fucked than the economy of entire servers be fucked. But we have no idea how much damage was actually done. If someone bought some shit of the AH and used it, its not really going to affect the economy that much, so blizzard wont care and all of this conjecture about what ifs will be meaningless. Even though it is already meaningless because we are all talking crap without any evidence to support.
---
Dw i dont get it either but im slow
---
Fly you fools
---
I do believe reputation decays as the quest becomes gray.  I'm trying to confirm but it's conflicted with BETA information.
---
You mean the greatest achievement in cinema history?
---
Horde Rogue and Priest and an Alliance Priest.
---
You cant even warlock summon someone outside of a dungeon...
---
*Laughs in 10 min queue*
---
Enjoy it while you can because the quest drought is comin’
---
You could drop group one at a time, and be invited to a different layer, reform group, and kill the boss that 'respawned' on a different layer in front of you. This means that you can kill lastbosses of instances back to back. People did this to kill Baron Rivendare 200~ times a day. This amounts to huge gear influxes and thousands of gold.
---
It was a big deal.
---
There was a bug with the layering system that would allowing bosses to become available again who shouldn't have been (raid bosses, once a day or week bosses, etc).
---
As you can imagine, this is quite terrifying.  I imagine anyone who ABUSED it will be banned and there will probably be severe rollbacks.  I'll take the rollback over the idea of that many extra loot tables so close to launch.
---
Gave up on the game for exactly one month after tonight?
---
The only comment that matters
---
"should we have layering in dungeons"  is a question about design, not programming.
---
Go to Main Menu &gt; Interface &gt; Action Bars and turn on the extra action bars. You can have 6 bars total. 3 on the bottom and 2 on the right
---
Not that it makes it okay, but if they abused it little enough to be able to feign innocence, we shouldn’t really worry. Not sure of the timing of your post vs blue posts but we now know they are going off of the idea any reasonable player would’ve recognized something was working differently than it should. With that standard repeated attempts will be obvious
---
So you're just entitled because you weren't in the know that means nobody was
---
Ahh to be 12 yo...
---
Even i was screaming as it hit you for 27 while you had no health left, god dam son you got the right amount of slippery there
---
If you're flagged for PvP or on a PvP server then there's no rules. Just because you can't be bothered killing doesn't mean others should be bound by your unknown rules. 
---
If a raid of level 60's want to kill everyone in a low level town then that's perfectly fine.
---
I hear what you're saying, but I'm not trying to be in a core group. I don't plan on raiding. I'm playing a tank, so I won't need to scrounge around to find dungeon groups.
---
Because I'm not mad, you're projecting it
---
It’s how I do it and it’s pretty face roll easy.
---
I'm not making excuses for anyone, I'm stating the reason why warriors are filling a tank roll while leveling without a shield. 
---
And if it sucks to level as holy and you can still heal without speccing holy while leveling, why have you specced holy? I'm not sure why that's relevant. Also as you said your fury warrior did fine, so I'm honestly not even sure what the issue is here.
---
does the truck have wifi or something?
---
That doesn't stop the spam in trade/general, nor the whispers.
---
Because he needs to make time for his casual gaming habit /s
---
I love you for this
---
Nah, it's pretty good for melee hunters.
---
Druids are unfortunately the worst 1v1 class there is. Your damage output and burst are very poor. Your health and mitigation are very bad outside of bear form as well. Druids are very good at surviving and are a solid support in group fights. This makes them good at supporting groups and defending, and more importantly, making them excellent flag runners.
---
PvP Druid specs are very spread out/ Youll want some variation of [this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxMhoZVEcozo)
---
Ive left 8 points unspent, because what youre really after is Feral Charge and NS, I went Omen of Clarity, but even thats flexible. If youre in a semi-casual/casual guild you can get away with a spec similar to this, theres a lot of debate as to what the "best" PvP druid spec is, but Feral Charge and NS are considered musts.
---
Just as a note, I tried to google some cookie cutter PvP specs and guides for you, but my god, I didnt realize how popular WoW classic was becoming. Theres a LOT of VERY bad information out there (like a 31 point Balance spec being considered a good PvP spec, with a bonus of being a good raid spec, dont listen to this stuff). It looks like all the old guides from pservers have been drowned out by a lot of garbage from the hypewagon.
---
Feral Druids are on the fringe of raid viability, so you cant really afford to sacrifice points required for raid for better PvP viability, so youll have to sacrifice a lot of your PvP viability for raid talents.
---
Lastly, you gear based on whats best and available to you. The simplest and most general explanation, PvE gear is heavily weighted toward just performing your role (ie. just healing as a Druid), while PvP gear is heavily weighted on Stamina for all classes (something no class except tanks care about in PvE). Its not about funds in terms of gear for the most part, its more about what gear is dropping and what you can get your hands on.

Or they'll just have great experiences on a different timeline. I'm leveling as quickly as I can and loving every moment of it. I'm only 35 though.
---
You might want to try Hillsbrad, the human settlement area.
---
No it doesn’t it still require a physical key press. It doesn’t automate anything it’s literally done manually.

Now once Tesla trucks are a thing, no xp will be wasted 😂
---
Dam I don't know this. I always used shield on the tank. But not anymore
---
Same.  Me n my friends were slightly worried about Kromkrush being a brand spankin new server added on launch day but it's usually medium to high and full on peak times but the queue is never bad, 10 minutes at the worst.
---
The BfA playerbase is suffering enough right now they don't need these cheaters too.

Awwww man... Now I'm worried about my account. Hope no one reports PigBenis.
---
Gotta wait for tank to get threat before healing
---
"Call to Arms: Subreddit Sanitation Engineers Needed!"
---
Oh yeah, I’ve always played PVP servers and am fully on board with it. Just curious others takes and wanted the free platform for my anecdote for the night.
---
On the pull:
---
- do nothing
---
Once the tank is engaged, throw a renew on him and queue up a heal. When the cast is almost done, if the tank needs it, let it go, otherwise just cancel it (move or press esc).
---
If you find threat on the pull is sketchy, or you are pulling with your first big heal, use fade proactively and often. Priests are OP with dropping threat via fade.
---
Don’t DPS mobs until you find a good rhythm with your tank and just help on the main mob. You have 3 DPS in your group to kill stuff, it ain’t your job.
---
If you pull aggro on mobs go stand next to the tank and don’t move. Easiest way for tank to get a mob back is to reliably hit it, not chase some panicking squishy half way across the world.
---

Got one of these off a raptor in stv. Made my night.
---
What's the orc rogue name, I want to give him some gold on keeping world pvp alive.
---
I wasn't part of that guild but holy shit I haven't thought about wowscape in so long.
---
Because the thought is that many people will play and try the game up to  10, 20, 30 or even maybe 60 and then quit because nostalgia etc. With layering they can artificially increase the world cap to make sure that all the servers are healthy after those people leave. 
---
That's what blizzards thought process is on the issue, from my understanding.
---
I honestly think Blizzard needs to jump on this or something similar. Make Classic WoW seem unique. Build on what makes it great, and reduce what makes it suck.
---
Ok you got me to bite, either you're an amazing troll or you're so willfully ignorant it's peaked my curiosity.
---
How exactly is bringing up the "dishonesty" of speeding more than the speed limit, or any driving habit that violates a driving law off topic?
---
It's entirely on topic. That and violating the ToS are both breaching licenses you willingly agreed to enter and abide by. They are fair comparison that have nothing to do with politics.
---
Q.E.D by your logic, if you break a driving law, or municipal By-Law, you're in fact immoral, dishonest and a shitty person.
---
So unless you're Mr. Perfect in society you're being a huge hypocrite, and this is coming from someone who agrees buying/selling WoW going is bad. 
---
You're just wrong, and I can say that even from your side of the argument.
---
Is this an undead koopa?
---
I was never replying to you? I was just commenting about the general vibes of outrage culture I see around this community with the guy who I actually replied to who seems to share my sentiment.

I ran arcane in Vanilla, now I'm going frost in Classic. Still miss the aesthetic of arcane, but frost and fire are so much better mechanically.
---
He did way more than i would reasonable expect from anyone to make sure everything was above board and what he was doing was not exploiting...
---
When I walked through wetlands I dotted up every level 20 alliance I saw,  think I got around 30 kills before I made it all the way through.
---
I was planting seeds,  hate seeds.   I need the alliance to hate the horde, in order to get good world PvP later on.   Most of you will just see it as me being a dick, you're not wrong,  but when those seeds grow and start bearing fruit, you'll be glad there are lots of people to grind that PvP rank against.
---
Such a mature name :) enjoy your travel kid
---
What happens if everyone who can roll passes?
---
That doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
If they were expecting that bug they would have fixed the bug rather than spending time monitoring every possible way it could be exploited to make sure it doesn't exist
---
STV can be extremely chill, except for the Venture Camp. That quest is absolutely infuriating, and all it takes is one stupid Horde to turn it into mayhem.
---
yes
---
The models were already in the game, it's at least 1 less step to do it like that. Since they were a late addition, I can imagine 1 less step sounded quite appealing to a dev
---
I play alliance on one of the full pvp servers that is rumored to be 2:1 or 3:1 horde to alliance (Bigglesworth), and I gotta say it's not that bad you shouldn't be discouraged. Yes you will get yanked by groups sometimes and even bodycamped and forced from an area but it really doesn't happen that often. And when it does you just move on to a different area till they clear out, or if it's just one or two you can stalk them for your revenge. It's really a fun experience being the underdogs, it makes it more tense, easy to find fights, and more rewarding to win. And the horde gets cocky when they outnumber you, means all the more opportunity to outplay them.
---
And when it's really bad and theres aggressive horde all over a zone, you can often find other alliance to team up with and defend each other while you quest. I've made some good friends this way.
---
Tl;dr being outnumbered on a server is fun if you dont get discouraged. I'd much rather be on a server where I'm on the underdog side after experiencing both.
---

How fucking selfish. We need to do something??? Because it became a problem for you after you stepped away? Seriously... reading how it wasn't a problem for you until now because of what you decided to and now something needs to be done is epic self centered shit. Log on early. Or wait for it to die down. They aren't gonna keep creating servers more than planned.
---
I'm still amazed that bug lasted this long tbh.
---
&gt; Well i guess everyone gets away with it then
---
How the fuck is everyone "getting away with it" if you dont rollback some guy accidentally buying an item 150 game hours ago from the AH? 
---
You dont need to start punishing innocent players just because you were too stupid to give out beta to more people to find out these bugs. It was obvious that layering was going to be a shitshow, the least blizzard could do is try to prevent that
---
Sometimes I try to think of ways to kill a warlock when he's been mana tapping
---
Ah, I hooked up with players from my old guild (ran 2006-2014, I quit 2010) and lots of people from our old server also came along. People started hitting 60, doing dungs and talking shit all day, gonna puggerino MC next week together with another guild we talked to. Feels really good and having a great time, you just gotta find the right community. Might take some looking around but its very possible, even in tight knit groups
---
Hope it works out and you get to enjoy playing
---

You cant roll on it at all.

I didnt say it was a ninja I said it's gonna disillusion a bunch of casuals

I end up putting points into improved aspect of the hawk on my way to beastial wrath but I agree to respec by the time you hit 40. no rush, but yeah do it eventually
---
Yo, I used to see this guild spam in BDO  that they were a PVX focused guild.  
---
In bdo pvx means you cross the boundary and do both pvp and pve/lifeskills. 
---
I was like yo how you going to a guild that focuses on every aspect of the game? The word focus lends the idea of leaving one thing out to focus on the other..
---
He was like
---
Hey you wanna join our pvx focused guild?
---
No it was an addon that mass invites. Probably.
---
It’s like people don’t understand what automation is. Because pressing a key sends a signal, sure it’s duplicated by it isn’t automated. Otherwise using a keyboard period would be considered automated.
---
Mage armor? Pretty sure spirit makes it better
---
And in proper vanilla fashion no less.
---
You want a high pop server that's what you have to deal with on launch and patch days. No one wants lame ass one shard and that's the only real fix
---
Sissy!
---
That's a neat site. Spent a bit looking at different things on it.  It does, however, list the Faerlina server as having 147 Paladins on the Horde side.  Which would be odd.
---
Small indie company
---
Wow that’s a ton of gear and gold. That’s crazy and here I am lvl 25 lol
---
Then medium and up servers would fill up just as fast? Are people this dense when making requests?! Really?!!!
---
sm waiting room didnt look like too much fun for alliance as they made a mad dash from instance to instance.  or maybe it was idk but they were getting slaughtered.  then a high level alliance shows up and starts destoying all flagged hord.  lmao.  everybody was suddenly pretty well behaved then funny how that works.  shit that makes me laugh how attitudes change when the odds change.  you need to get into a large group and all go on a killing rampage for a couple hours.  
---
and desolace like they said.  it seems like for the most part people in desolace are just leveling.  sometimes both sides start killing each other but its maybe one hour out of five.  cept alliance get grumpy when i get too close to their village and get aggressive then.  its like each faction considers the land near their village their turf.
---
Unless you're abusing layering to AoE grind in the open world, then it's fair game.
---
Same thing with running 10-man SM.
---
I guess it all boils down to how many people did it, I guess they don't quite want to see wow classic becoming a ghost town because they had to ban more than half their population.
---
ty friend, now I'm excited to try this on a free budget phone
---
You're a shitty human
---
They can probably just count the number of instances someone did in a certain amount of time, and if it's above X number, ban them.
---
I accidentally aggroed brokentooth the other day and killed him, then a half hp hunter appeared and /cry me. I assume he died while taming him. I /sorry But then he started shooting me so I killed him. Then started skinning the brokentooth body in front of him.

Hey follow up. I found auctioneer on the twitch desktop but when I downloaded the game mentioned it didn't work. Anything you can suggest?
---
You turn in cloth to a quartermaster
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/cloth-turnin-quest-quartermaster-reputation-experience
---
Don't think layering into dungeon bosses had any significant impact on XP. If anything, it's probably slower than just resetting and killing more mobs
---
Thought this might be the case. You'll probably benefit more by looking up loot tables then.
---
Just socialize with the mindless blind spam you receive about guilds full of strangers, dummies!
---
What's the addon/setting to show class icon on portraits like that?
---
Also what dmg meter?
---
If you have a nonstop group the dungeon grinding is always faster.
---
By how much depends a lot on your group setup and efficiency.
---
I have not took over 20 mins to find lfr did you perhaps try to play overnight. I don't play bg but dungeon queue's are still fast for me no matter if I am leveling or at max level and I have done a lot of dungeons the past couple weeks leveling 2 characters and doing mythic+. And yes some guilds did die and this is a given but new guilds will be made and their are still guilds that did not move over to classic. So stop with the bullshit saying Classic killed BFA. We all know BFA might not be the greatest but it is nowhere even close to dead. Let people play what they want some people like classic some like retail and some like both and I don't understand why you can't comprehend that.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
What I really want to know is, do you have /kick KEYBOUND? HOW OFTEN are you kicking people from party that you need a macro and an action bar slot dedicated to it??
---
 Nah, I don't exploit. 
---
I just figured I'd give his question some negative attention to make someone more likely to answer it. Which worked.
---
It must be. I see A LOT of spitting. Glad to know Classic Horde is as good as always. Makes me wish my friends group had made the correct decision.
---
No problem
---
Zygor, it costs 7 dollars a month. A free alternative would be Azeroth Auto Pilot
---
Each day i log in, i farm enough cloth to make 20 or so bags - then hand them out for free, 1 per person outside Goldshire.
---
People could go into any instance, even molten core, and use the exploit to effectively  "respawn" the boss multiple times. The layering implementation meant that instances were all layered, just with no players in any other layers of the instance. The exploit is layer jumping in an instance while standing next to the end boss.
---
Yeah, it's technically possible, just very, very unlikely
---
How? I'm parked and the computer get put away when I'm driving.

Your analogy is already rotten (laws are not explicitly agreed to, no matter how much you try and make them out to be), but I also want to point out my previous comment used the phrasing *intentionally and repeatedly*.

If you're *intentionally and repeatedly* breaking laws, there's a good chance you're not a great person. Though it's not conclusive, as laws can be immoral.

/u/apap0 is conclusively dishonest, however. I challenge you to point out any flaw in my [original reasoning](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d586p1/lore_gives_a_response_about_layering_exploit/f0km347/)

Yea people in my guild were asking all the time and no one ever invited them. I wasn’t going to be a part of that shit.
---
Found the 1 person in the world that has never exceeded the speed limit or ever will! Call the Guinness Book of World Records.
---
You are an honorable man. You inspire us to follow in your footsteps.
---
No I love it like this. It's so pretty.
---
Keep in mind that you can use your Mana a lot more efficiently if you utilize lower ranks. Good luck!
---
/suf &gt; Target &gt; General &gt; untick 'display combat text' or smth like that
---
Yeah, i for sure get if someone wants to reserve - and why they wouldn't want to broadcast it. It was the toxic reaction to someone saying no thanks.
---
"Runs" maybe, but I like being able to play more demanding titles aswell. Once you've had a high end gaming machine you cant go back.
---
There's gonna be so many guild raid teams affected. Feel bad for those who have to pay for these idiots actions.
---
Looks cozy af and super enjoyable!
---
un'goro winterspring and Burning steppes.
---
Silithus requires stealth since you have to skip a ton of elites. hunters can probably do it too.
---
Lore is the one who OKed the double clear while on his couch in the first place. So of course he's covering his own ass for that decision.
---
so you block, you ignore, you leave chat channels, you move guild chat to a different window and hang out there
---
or you ask yourself "why is this making my game experience worse?  why can other people talking in public chat channels affect my experience in such a negative way?"
---
then you leave that chat channel and stop worrying about what hypothetical future \*good experiences\* you could have had in that channel, had you not left it, and choose to m ake your experience better now
---
The number of bans handed out will convince me of Blizzard's commitment to this issue. By all accounts, this behavior was rampant. If only a handful of bans are given, then it's just a PR move with no real teeth. I hope Blizzard does a thorough job.
---
how many are above 10?
---
If you think stacking spirit to buff your armors bonus over int or +sp is ideal with ALL the tools mages get for mana regen idt I'm going to change your mind. For any other caster class BUT mages and warlocks i can see the situations where it would be nice to have spirit be 2nd in stat priority.
---
Just a hotspot. Have ~40ms most days
---
classic is so good. This person had a weapon that was effective for them for 15 levels. imagine that concept in modern wow. I honestly wonder if the issue isn't too many levels but instead too few.
---
You really want to die on this hill?
---
Why are you being so aggressive? Take a step back from the screen, take a deep breath and move on with your life.
---
Why are so many comments defecating in this thread?
---
Every class drops combat after 6 seconds of casting a spell or attacking another player. For mage if you poly, that means you get about 5-6 seconds of eating/drinking in. If a mob gets involved in the combat (ie aggro on you or enemy or is CC'd) that will keep you in combat forever as per normal (ie until it's dead or evades back to it's spot).
---
I only really felt that it was lopsided in ashenvale. Desolace has been nice, and hillsbrad wasn't too terrible either. STV is STV, but it goes both ways at least.
---
Someone gave me one on the mailbox and Brill and I gave them literally all my money.  Was like 15s at the time.  Kept that wand for a long time.
---
Nice
---
Honest question, how do you feel about honest interactions where a guild is mentioned, an invite offered, but the person is actually actively helping you or conversing with you instead of copy/pasted jargon. Is that acceptable?
---
Yeah.  It's tagged as low relative to the max population a fully layered server can handle.  That is something like 5* an og vanilla server.
---
That is awesome, so did you not quest at all?
---
the jumping and dancing thing is pretty great lol
---
Sorry I was talking about max level tanking, should have been clearer.
---
However - spamming swipe is generally not a good idea. People should be focusing on 1 target and downing that, and moving on, so you shouldn't have to swipe as long as you are staying ahead of your healers threat for the other targets. It is better to rotate mauls between your targets and only swipe to burn rage before it caps. Focus most your mauls on one target and only transfer every now and then to maintain other targets focus.
---
Growl is only useful to transfer aggro back to you.
---
I like the aesthetic of darkshore but I don't enjoy the questing. I feel like it's very all over the place and inefficient
---
a really spiffy aerarium.
---
Currently I am enjoying questing multiple zones and exploring.
---
IM sorry- how would I even know if what i was doing was bad?
---
If im in evelyn forest, kill 2 defias, and less than one second later those defias respawn- is that something i did, or how the game works?
---
Well they are spending their time Mcing ppl off of a boat so prob a dick lol
---
These damn Wowllenials don't know how easy they've got it.
---
Whenever games do that the cheater server ends up being the most fun.
---
When GTA online came out for 5 and they put all the cheaters on the cheater server they loved it because it was just everyone with a shit ton of money driving tanks and jets around playing how they wanted.
---
You're asking if macros have if/then functionality, which is a resounding *no*, since that'd trivialize any class' rotation to a true one-button rotation
---
&gt;lol classes in vanilla already only have 1-2 button rotations xd
---
Not to this extent. All you'd have to do is copy-paste someone that made a macro that performs your class perfectly.
---
    If &lt;debuff&gt;, cast &lt;spell/ability&gt;
---
       else: cast &lt;debuff&gt;
---
So on and so forth. You'd be able to make a complete hierarchy of spell priorities (like we already have on many class rotation guides!) inside the macro and just put that button on all of your hotbars and you could do top DPS with a literal faceroll.
---
That aside, there **is** a solution for your particular problem:
---
Make two macros.
---
1:
---
     /cast Righteous Fury
---
     /swapactionbar 2
---
2: 
---
     /cancelaura Righteous Fury
---
     /swapactionbar 1
---
Replace numbers with whatever hotbars you want the macro on (may not work well with Bartender and the like, however)
---
Make both action bars identical sans the slot the two macros will occupy. Hit it on one, it'll swap to the other action bar with the opposite macro.
---
Oh, definitely—I meant the key+click part, for the record :) thank you!
---
First off, “whoosh” like the other guy already said. 
---
Secondly, that’s just not true.
---
thank you for the info :)
---
Well, you don't HAVE to have a car, so are you not breaking a figurative license in that situation? I mean, you pay taxes on your car, you get your car inspected in some states, ect.
---
He plays good defense and he used to fuck Carmen Electra....be careful.
---
??
---
TSM Does this, bad addons don't.
---
Yea if there was only like a list you could make. And like it could have a color to so people could be quickly aware of its intent.
---
Unless they have an entirely different team proactively monitoring for this sort of thing...
---
I'll check it out. Thank you.
---
So Many people don't understand to single fucking target
---
Damn that’s sick, I really like the innovative set up there.
---
&gt;  the loot is so RNG which sucks the purpose out of doing anything.
---
Also the next patch all the base Mythic gear and WQ gear gets bumped up anyway.
---
More correctly, they sell all your things and then mail that gold off. I was also hacked but logged on while it was happening so they didn’t get everything. I just logged on it half my armor missing and all my bags gone. GMs fixed it for me in just minutes.
---
I see, but they didn't test the effects it would have on dungeons and raids.
---
My brother actually got my steam account VAC banned back in the day because he used wall hacking(not sure why...) in CS 1.6.
---
Or more character slots...
---
Haha yep good point, we have 750 members so not sure how many will get the ban
---
At my current level I've run dead mines and stockades multiple times. Generally 90% of my healing is going to the tank. 8-9% to myself, and the odd flash heal or renew if one of the dps guys get hit big. I'm sure this will change as I progress and learn my role better and also as we get into higher level dungeons.
---
Stalaag has has the world 4th rag down, which was an alliance guild &amp; Believe me this has translated over to pvp as well. Alliance is outnumber but the player base is stout AF.
---
west coast of aussie or america?
---
It obviously is he just wooshed it
---
Question- How do you bring up the persons name with level and class like you didn’t on the bottom of the chat window?
---
You can break the laws in question without having the license. Just ask your local police!
---
context matters
---
Having at least one alt is ideal. (Pick professions that with supplement your main).
---
would be true if this wasnt vanilla lol
---
its a dick move, just like stealing someones mine or herb
---
Meh I've been playing fire.  It's pretty fun, though I imagine as you mentioned probably less effective for aoe.
---
But there's no opinion there. 
---
They violated the terms and services and are able to be banned/suspended for it.
---
Just because you feel you should be entitled to drive any car you find on the street does not mean you won't then be arrested and found guilty of auto theft because it's against the laws of the state you live in.
---
Or is your opinion that blizzard should change their terms and services that all players agreed to and just let people go wild with exploits?
---
*tombloafs
---
If you have a good group with a decent comp (You know no memes like moonkins n shit) Dungeons are far faster
---
Either remove the gear, or lock them out of next week's raid.
---
Yeah. I had no idea this was an issue or even possible, so when I saw in my guild chat that someone needed an invite to change layers I would invite them. Wonder if I’ll get in trouble. He rally they said it was because they were being corpse guarded or whatever. Feel dumb- noon mistake.
---
I tell our hunter this all time time.
---
Define toxicity.
---
Ban Tips
---
Offer to sign guild charters in trade chat.  It's surprisingly easy to get some gold here and there.
---
I have no shame.
---
Verizon is the best coverage by a huge margin. Depends on what might fit your area better though, in some spots ATT is better. Doesn't really matter if from phone or a hotspot device, it's the coverage you have from that provider.
---
Is kromcrush like 80% horde?
---
u/Celestial-Squid stacked trinkets, cooldowns, and killing spree with very very good gear and then button smash sinister strike for the extra hit after the spreee ends.  Sometime use an agility potion too, just for kicks.
---
I’m fairly certain that it happened to my guild during a run sometime in April-May 2005 (I remember the time frame because it was during exams and I got in a metric ton of shit for failing one). I only remember this because I was the only Druid in the raid and we had 4 sets of Cenarion shoulders and 4 sets of Cenarion boots dropped. People were *very* salty. The reset happened after we all ported out to do repairs. 
---
Here’s a comment from 2005 indicating a similar situation https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12118/lucifron#comments:id=2914139
---
As hot as that sounds idk man.
---
quality content
---
Considering MS has a 30pt requirement, what do you recommend in place of 2H weapon spec and a weapon spec?  The only choices are Imp. Heroic strike, Imp. thunderclap or imp. Hamstring.
---
Personally, i am 32 and have been working my way down fury tree. I have zero points in arms and run 2 handed while leveling and switch to 1h+shield when tanking dungeons. Zero problems thus far.  I intend to respec to full arms once I’m 40.
---
It's not an exploit lol. The game is patch 1.12, and it just so happens that with all the changes blizz made leading up to this patch that makes it possible. It's fine for you to not like how easy it easy for mages to power level I guess, but calling it an exploit is stupid
---
rogues get ap from str too? i didnt know this
---
Considering these are people that have spent years playing nothing but private servers, and in the months up to classic launch did nothing but practice speed leveling, it's not too surprising
---
I’m talking more about on forums and reddit. Pretty much everyone I run into in the world is cool, general chats cancer though
---
Did they get banned?
---
Feed me more please.
---
Feeeeeddd meeeee
---
Still completely worthless. Unless you are incapable of using the mana gems, evocation, mana pots or demonic runes.
---
Blizzard: gives warriors a quest for a weapon that last 15 levels 
---
Everyone else: lul look at all these guys looking for help
---
For real though that quest is given to warriors 10 levels to early and it’s better to just quest until your 40 unless you have some high levels willing to help you.
---
Doesnt  work in classic as far as I know.
---
This "getting a crit saves you" is bullshit. you guys need to take a statistics course. Whatever build does most dps will save you.
---
I get that, but let's say that player in the course of their cheating got 50 of some item, and before they got banned they sold 37 of them. So blizzard deletes the gold, and the remaining 13 items.... That doesn't change the fact that there are now 37 of those it's in the game that shouldn't have been there in the first place. Whoever bought those items is now using them to more effectively and efficiently farm other items, gold, etc.  There are a LOT of downstream effects from something even as simple as that.
---
They Said taken away, but people who bought them from ah probably don't lose them.
---
Especially if they just no lifed to 60 and grinded some gold.
---
Nice repost maybe you should climb into that chopper and then jump off xD
---
One might say you were. Reborn.
---
52% Horde, 48% Ally
---
Ignore this man. Level Balance be the Crit Chicken.
---
Honestly, Warrior levelling being hard is a massive meme. The conventional wisdom is to play some arms build. and honestly I feel it's mostly perpetuated "wisdom" due to people finding that it works somewhat okay for them, and so continuing to do it.
---
After your whirlwind axe loses its lustre and edge in a few levels, give this a try. Respec protection, and go for 1 rank in improved shield block, and 3 ranks in improved revenge. I'd honestly still go 11 into arms for anger management, tactical mastery and deflection, and grab 5 cruelty in arms. Between revenge and shield block, you just won't be dying unless you're exceptionally stupid, and it honestly doesn't increase time to kill immensely, but lets you comfortably kill things a far few levels ahead of you.
---
People seem to have a fit when I mention this, criticising the time it will apparently take to kill a mob, but it's honestly only a little bit more, and the time saved from not dying more than makes up for it (as well as being able to kill mobs a fair few levels above you). Plus, between your stuns in Revenge and Concussion Blow (and personally War Stomp), you can easily handle multiple enemies if you need to.
---
&gt; As little down-time as possible.  
---
*cries in mage*
---
Ah, but you’re learning. Good on you
---
That hardly makes it BiS. Killing stuff faster and having to drink more is always going to be better and faster, ST or not.
---
Objectively. Lmao. Okay buddy.
---
What do you feed that thing?!
---
That's not a tenkeyless. It's called a 60%.
---
We've been told that a layer has the capacity of the original vanilla servers. But it's been a long couple weeks so it might have changed.
---
I've tried about half a dozen servers on classic and tbh they all feel a bit different. I'm guilty to say that i enjoyed the really high populated full realms the most. The general chats in random zones are very active, trade and cities are as well. Easy to find multiple runs of dungeons and groups for quests, prices on all ah items are lower, tons of people giving stuff away, like bags.
---
I've also enjoyed the low/medium realms but they feel a bit lackluster at times. It's as if i'm "missing" out on the social aspect of it that full servers have.
---
HAHA, get rkt idiot.
---
It’s like Orc Santa visited WoW
---
For a hunter, melee weapons are stat sticks. Nothing more than a vehicle to apply Wing Clip and get back into ranged while soloing or PvPing. Sure, a nice shiny sword with a lot of Agility on it is nice, but if you have a Rogue in the party who also needs it... Well, they can get a lot more use from it because they'll actually use the attack ratings of the weapon. Increases in the damage range can massively improve the damage of their abilities, way more than they would a Hunter's.
---
Rogues always get priority to roll on Agility weapons, while Hunters always get priority to roll on Agility Bows.
---
Armor and jewelry, though? That's fair game, straight up.
---
In my 15 years of WoW I’ve had only 1 drop and I’ve only ever seen one other.
---
Then that's just a missed opportunity for a much better joke sadly.
---
This is the best idea I've heard. Cheater server! Like sending them all to Australia! Sorry Australians but you know what I mean...
---
Basically do an exploit where you can basically manipulate the way severs handle party interactions.
---
But long story short they were basically able to just respawn bosses to farm best in slots ,recipes / boss gold drops ect.
---
For raiding purposes the only time you would prefer int over small amounts of spell power is if the crit provided by the int actually outweighs it. Besides spell power, actual important stats are spell hit and spell crit.
---
Only problem is he can't bubble if something goes wrong IRL, only in game. It's too easy to mix the two up.
---
I think you should read what he just posted.  He has a point, he might take it a bit too far but your comment only you look dumb.
---
The system is, of someone need it as a upgrade, need on the item, regardless of what the item is. Twinking is something created by the community. I just had this same talk with someone the other day and they tried to argue that if it’s a twink item, everyone should need. This is a big no. Regardless of the item, if someone NEEDS it to wear on their character, they get priority. If the item is in any way being used to make money, that’s greed. That’s why greed is called greed, literally for greed. 
---
Think of it this way. Someone who has never played WoW in their life just started playing WoW classic for the first time. They see an item that is an upgrade, they gonna need on it. They don’t know what twinking is, they don’t know it sells for a ton of gold, they see and upgrade and want it. Then they get shit on by others wanting to sell the item. Now these new people have no idea why, but then get blasted with a community created reason.
---
In the end, if you need it, need it, if you want to sell it, greed it. That’s the system that was out in place from the beginning and how it works. If anyone says otherwise, they are 100% wrong and there is no arguing it other then to argue.
---
the hero we need! I just started playing and I'll make sure to help everyone the way I can.
---
Im currently making most of my gold in the devilsaur trade.
---
On my server one leather is 9g. If you solo kill a devilsaur its a 15min respawn, there are 6 spawns.
---
You can make absurd gold/h if you have all 6 spawns killed on their timer. Lately with the increased competition i usually get 4 spawns out of 6.
---
Your mage is looking super dope, by the way
---
Ahh yeah, good point.
---
Nice.
---
So many ninja looters in the comments, no wonder people are confused about the rules. 
---
If you need on something you don’t immediately equip/use, you are a ninja looter.
---
That’s all you need to know,,
---
Is that Zandalar Tribe server ?
---
The devs that had to go in to deploy a patch at 3am probably are pushing for worse. Lol 😂
---
It’s quite a low drop rate. I only know of one person that has one it and it was a lucky drop.
---
24. Just got it.
---
“Wanted Dead or Alive for being a camping f*ggt”
---
So let's just ignore the ToS and pretend that nothing is wrong.
---
Gotcha.
---
Interesting, but this is from patch 1.3; How could a bug have gone through 9 additions and this not be fixed?
---
The quest's exp doesn't drop off until you near the quest being gray; it's actually much faster/more efficient to do quests while they're yellow or green instead of orange or red.
---
Wowhead has a slider for most quests that show the exp reward alongisde a level slider. It's been mightily helpful.
---
2spooky4me
---
Classic.
---
Fuck. That. Quest. 
---
That screenshot just brought back the memories! Ugh!!
---
Faction ratios and queue times are not the same. Also how is blizzard losing money to make people have a better time?
---
Adding servers I'm sure is not expensive for Blizzard. There reason for not adding more has always been to make sure each server has a healthy population on it not lack of money.
---
You just seem really misinformed on almost all of your points. 
---
Having said that the ratios are only terrible on a few servers and it is no where near as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be but that doesn't make anything you have said here accurate.
---
IT'S RAINING APES!
---
I don't join guilds untill I find people I'm like " I want spend my game time with them" don't see the point in joining a guild till then.
---
Gold farming doesn't even matter, thats something that can be done by anyone on any account and for a very long time its been peoples accounts getting compromised that fuels gold sellers closely followed by actual exploits inside of instances and bottling.
---
I've already replied to you elsewhere. You're replying to a comment meant for /u/Tirus_, and due to him/her appearing to have more than two active brain cells I can afford to use whichever words I feel like. 
---
Also, my argument is really your ironic honesty: You're the one who explained how you entered an agreement and then repeatedly attempted to break it. Then you went on talking about how that is indeed consistent with your moral code.
---
I clearly don't need fancy words when I've got your rambling mouth, do I?
---
i hate your guild named
---
good job
---
The account is basically deleted at that point
---
“The art of deception is a skill passed down the Armstrong family line for *generations!*”

Everyone need a boe.  That's my thoughts on it but I don't only do that.  If i know the people we all need, we all understand this is fair.  If it's a pug group and then you have people that feel entitled to a boe I'll let it go if they try to get butthurt about it but not if it's one of the bigger value items idgaf.   For example though... I'm tanking and the purple ardent custodian drops.  This is a pretty high value item.  You would greed and just watch me need and take it in a run and be cool with that?  If you're not cool with that then it applies to blues as well.  We can all buy or sell that item on ah.  If you expect to have priority on a high value item, expect not to be invited.  Example of sfk.  Assassins blade drops there.  If I know there's a chance that an item drops that could be a few hundred gold in my pocket, I just won't invite people that could use some stupid excuse that they need it because they will use it.... for 3 levels before it gets replaced.  That could have been a few hundred gold to someone... instead it's a minor damage buff to a rogue for a few levels and then he vendors it for 40 silver.  If you win the roll go ahead and use it but I'd bet that same rogue would hold it to sell it or send over to a twink of their own which isn't using it for the character that needed it anyways. 
---
Need or greed is for boss drops that are bop.  You greed because you will just vendor the item for 2 gold or disenchant.  Need if you need for upgrade.  This does not apply to boe.  Those items are not disenchant fodder.  They have a higher value and no one gets priority.
---
What rewards are people getting from this? Just using it to farm drops or something off mobs? I’ve been away for the past week and haven’t been keeping up sadly.
---
If you go by blizzard hes right though. Not like you could put a ticket in and get the item back. As blizzard used to say, pick the people you play with and avoid the baddies
---
Only mob who has a leash is kazzak cause it will kill everyone till the end of time.
---
Are we talking endgame or while leveling? Two different answers.
---
Can confirm it’s that version in classic.
---
No, that's some other jackasses.
---
Maybe have their characters visible in there during the ban time. But they aren't logged in?
---
&gt;Nah I actually gave up on the game, too busy with work and school and that. I just personally disagree with the banning.
---
Yeah sure... you gave up, yet still take time to share your opinion on the subreddit.
---
Sure...
---
Yes, but if the person that rolled need didn’t need the item as an upgrade, they shouldn’t need it, and if they do, They are a ninja looter and should be labeled as one.
---
A 1 month ban to these people is basically making them start a brand new account, which I’m totally for. I’m also for IP banning them for the full month as well.
---
Preach, also can healers stop being afraid to use mana. If you don't hit zero for any of your pulls it's okay, that means it's going to well. Fast doesn't equal bad unless it's literally killing group or making you start a pull oom or on less mana you need to heal the pull.
---
I love reporting people with stupid names.
---
Yeah that’s true. It’s mostly a commitment to practice, and prob levels dozens of toons to 60. I put in a lot of hours but nothing is refined about the way I play.
---
Nah, botted a shot ton, suspended several times, still have account.
---
Pretty certain the dungeon that drops that item is also home to a quest wherein you get much better shoulders for a priest.
---
It was never done or intended to be done in vanilla. That's all that matters.
---
Never damage anything but the focus-target.
---
This will usually be marked with a skull, and the next target to switch to with an X. If your group isn't marking mobs to focus, then target your tank and press F (by default). This will target the mob that your target has targetted.
---
I have raid markers key-bound to F6-F8, with F6 &amp; F7 being skull &amp; X. If the tank isn't marking, then I will. An easy way to do it is by targetting the tank, pressing F for his target, then pressing the skull key-bind.
---
Only DPS with wands (and maybe shadow word on bosses). Save that precious mana for dem heals.
---
Enjoy the healing. :) I find it to be a pleasant &amp; useful role in dungeons.
---
&gt;For AoE grinding, you want spell damage then int.
---
You don't want spell damage at all for AoE grinding as Blizzard barely benefits at all from it. You want Int/Stam for AoE grinding.
---
It is effectively a ban. There is no difference. A ban doesn't have to be permanent.
---
&gt; Killing stuff faster and having to drink more is always going to be better and faster
---
There's actually no research or data to prove this just yet, a lot of it comes from people "feeling" like it's faster because they're hitting harder. If you have any actual calculations or proof I'd love to see them.
---
Why are you yelling? No one is silencing you just simply stating it belongs in the weekly thread so we don’t get a shit ton of spam.
---
This is me except I kill you once at the very last second because I just can’t resist
---
I feel bad when I can’t /thank someone if they buff me when running by.  Good on you and this person on building the community.
---
&gt; misinformed 
---
Retail charges $25 a transfer. Per character. My point is Blizzard is a for-profit company responding to their consumer base by providing a service for free to amend customer displeasure. Please, tell me what in my post is misinformed. 
---
&gt; Faction ratios and queue times aren't the same 
---
I never made this claim. These are two issues that are discounting the experience of players on high-pop servers. 
---
&gt; Its not as bad as I'm making it out to be
---
I see daily threads about high pop servers, faction ratios, layering, sharding, queues, so on. This sub is swiftly becoming a complaint department.
---
To be fair, this isn't something discussed after. If they need after 2-3 people greeded, yes they're ninja looting.
---
This is a conversation that should be had at the start of the dungeon, or as soon as the very valuable item drops.
---
That xp bar CHONK
---
I did the same with lvl 5 wands in undead starter zone. Every person I gave one to ( around 8) were all very thankful though.
---
Forgive me but I have an itch to reset your brightness/contrast/gamma to default
---
Oh reddit and any online space is always going to be needlessly hostile. The only way for online discussion spaces to not be awful is for there to be decent moderation
---
Im about level 20 and i find 2h clunky because the attack speed is low and so the rage generation , when does it gets better? also when can i go dual wielding so its better? 
---
Also when do i get zerker stance and is that better than battle stance for dps?
---
Indeed.
---
Every NPC hostile
---
For BoP's sure.

But everyone needs BoE equally. In fact IMO the person who needs to equip should have lowest priority. Let me explain. For everyone else needing that item is worth whatever it it's sold for on AH. Well minus the 5% fee or whatever. 
---
For that person equipping it, it is only worth a equip + vendor. If it was worth as much as it is on AH, then you would've bought the item on AH no? If it was truly that important for you. Therefore, you can logically conclude that the people needing it for gold puts a higher value on the item, than the person who needs to equip.

Six days of /played -- consensus is figure 9-11 days of /played to get to 60 for most, I figure on 12-20 days of /played given my desire to wander around doing whatever I feel like before I get to 60.

now what to do about all the defenders of the practice who were so adamant it is clever use of a game mechanic?
---
Good on you for doing your aquatic form quest. Im lv 38 and still havent done it haha woof
---
No, this is exactly why I hate BFA war mode, it took all the fun nuance out of the game.
---
Those things vendor for 15s a pop. That’s generous.
---
The title of your post is people complaining about faction balances and before you deleted your entire post everything was talking about high pop and queue times. You compared them not me.
---
Blizzard has offered free character transfers off extremely high pop servers in the past MANY times. Again, you are SEVERELY misinformed.
---
this is _exactly_ why I post all of my emotes in trade chat
---
Its tough but fair, im a fan.
---
No need to just delete accounts or Perma-ban, that doesn't let anyone learn anything from their mistakes - and that's exactly whats happened - a lot of people made a lot of mistakes.    Its great to see blizz balancing things but not in a Thanos way :)
---
You're making a false equivalence. Why do you insist on comparison to the law when there are obviously fundamental differences.
---
Facts about /u/apap0:
---
* He entered voluntarily into an agreement.
---
* He intentionally and repeatedly broke that agreement.
---
That's the textbook definition of dishonesty. 
---
He then explicitly said this is consistent with his moral system. So he has a shitty moral system, i.e. is a "shitty human".
---
I'm sorry, but your defense is untenable simply due to the fact that /u/apap0 literally admits to everything.
---
At least you can't be disappointed with a guild like that.
---
Is that the tiannamen square aftermath?
---
Sounds like a think that Román would do
---
Awesome.  His UI was great in pserver.  Lookin forward to it in Classic.
---
Blizz anounced that players will be limited to 1 skeleton per character to avoid abuse(gold sellers would spell out their sites with skeletons), people complained.
---
Indeed
---
Do you have all of Plater installed? I think there is core and then there are other addons for it too. Ensure you have everything installed, enabled, and in game type /plater.
---
Most of the pservers would take 3-5 months to start to die down, not saying that's going to happen but a month in is way to early to judge anything.

What really matters is what happens after the last phase is in.

Honestly it goes zone by zone. Many places are pretty quiet while everyone lets out their aggression in STV.
---
Endgame mostly, Im 50 atm so starting to get pre-raid bis.
---
/u/apap0 literally admits to it. I'm sensing you're a gold seller/buyer.

I thought I was being helpful when Guildies or a person in general chat wanted to be invited to change layers. I’m new to the game and was being an idiot. Invite about five people or so. Should I expect to get in trouble?
---
To me, the adversity in classic is part of the fun. You'll look back and remember how fun this was. Keep your head up mate, and enjoy the ride!
---
Stack int for the most part. I ballpark it at 2 power per 1 int while leveling.
---
The key being fights are fairly short. Regen/mana amplification via spellpower are both relatively weak (you're not chugging mana consumables). Combined with short fights, having a bigger mana bar to cast more spells is worth it.
---
There's probably a minmax situation in the 40+ level range where that starts to swap around due to big mana bars but by that time you're already starting to look at your pre-raid gearing anyway and can swap it out as you get it.
---
You misspelled hypocrite.
---
What about the Glider ban wave in May 2008 when heaps of people lost their accounts? I guess because you only got suspended, Blizz never perma ban botters? Never heard them to zero out gold but admitadely I haven't been in that scene since that ban wave.
---
You could switch layers inside instances. On a new layer the bosses would respawn. People were doing this at bosses that toon a lot of time to clear to and farming said bosses. 
---
Once you ran out of fresh layers you could have an alt or someone else “reset” the instance. Resetting puts you back where you entered the instance. Because you layered at the last boss (Baron or whatever) the game put you back where you “entered” the instance in this case would be at the last boss etc.
---
Apparently keycloning IS allowed though. I can't see why getting lazor'd like this isn't considered cheating.

Any chance you’d share your strategy as a Warlock?
---
Layering isn't related to queues. Like, at all. They are totally separate things.
---
Am I the only one that doesn't know what the fuck layering is??
---
A 12-14 doing a starter zone is probably doing it for the reputation. Once quests are grey the rep reward is much lower. Beyond that, green quests are typically a lot more efficient than yellow quests and are very much worth doing.

One way I've found to ensure I'm not dropping fade so often, and pulling aggro is by using lower ranked spells. For 1 they use less mana. For 2 they push less threat. A few small heels and a renew is enough to allow even a slow tank to get the aggro under control before your heals pull them.
---
Warriors get their revenge when they have enough gold to manage a stockpile of Free action potions and just wreck every mage around
---
If you're still in combat, I believe healing/buffing them forces them into combat too, so they can't open the chest.
---
Wow that’s rude as fuck of them. When I’m AoE-Ing things I try to take turns with people doing the quest, and I’ll even throw them some flame strikes/blizzards/explosions on their own pulls when I’m waiting for a spawn. They’re probably the same people who flame on retail over stupid shit

Well if someone plans to ninja loot, they aren’t going to admit it, they are just going to stay quiet and ninja when the time is right and bounce. That’s what I’ve experience 90% of the time. Most of the time, their entire plan is to ninja loot and that’s the only reason they are there in the first place.
---
Having that much granular data and tracking on every transaction would also be quite silly.
---
I’m no pro but I used to play classic back in the day.
---
I would definitely recommend bestial wrath, as the CC immunity and damage increase is well worth the trade off for scatter shot. 
---
Also frenzy is important, but with a fast attack speed pet you could get away with 4 points in it whilst maintaining 100% up time, and use the extra point to improve multi-shot. 
---
Hope this helps

I know pretty much nothing about wow classic. I played wow for a year when warlords came out and have not  played since.
---
What’s the best resource (YouTube video for example) that explains what wow classic entails and what there is to do in the game?
---
They never said transfers off dead servers. 
---
The only thing they said is they will look into paid transfers as an option later in the games life.
---
Intimidation and scatter serve the same purpose in PvP, if you get both, you lose a sizable burst dps cooldown. 
---
Personally, I would opt for beastial wrath over scatter if you’re that far down into the BM tree.
---
There is absolutely a reason to argue that point.  I need an upgrade just like the next guy and I can sell that item to buy an expensive weapon upgrade or maybe upgrade every single piece of my armor if it sells for enough.  My intent is the same as the guy that could have used that specific item so how is it not needed for me also?  We both are looking at a good weason upgrade.  I'll tell the group ahead of time if necessary that this is how it works.  The alternative would be to never take a rogue to sfk, never take a mage to rfd I think is where that frost wand drops...etc.  otherwise it just diminishes the value of the dungeon to the rest of the group if people think like that.  I let it go on items that won't sell for crazy amounts but the fact remains that selling it would be a bigger upgrade to multiple items for anyone else.  I would tell a rogue that won ass blade to sell it and then upgrade every piece of armor and their weapons with the gold.  It will be a bigger upgrade anyways for them and probably have gold left over.  Change my mind that it is worth using an item like that for 3 levels before you grow out of it and sell for 40 silver vs someone getting 150g.
---
I think I responded to the wrong comment &gt;. &gt;

Trade Skill Master. It has a lot more functionality on retail, but the classic version is still phenomenal.

Fun argument but still wrong. That’s only if you view gold as higher priority than gear you actually NEED (hence the name) to equip to be at your highest possible stats without spending gold. Interesting thought excitement, but dangerous to people that may read it and not realize how counter productive it is to progression in the game.

I didn't delete a post and I have no idea where you pulled this accusation from. 
---
I also never claimed this is something Blizzard hadn't done in the past. 
---
&gt;  Having said that the ratios are only terrible on a few servers and it is no where near as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be but that doesn't make anything you have said here accurate.
---
&gt; That's not even what I said 
---
I owe you an apology on that one. I was about to put my phone down to settle in for the evening and so I speed read the last portion of your comment and misread it. That's my mistake. However, to your last point, let me at least offer a revised response. 
---
While I see your point that it isn't as bad as what most people are making it out to be, I think that a thread such as the one in my main post can get so much activity speaks to how much this topic is to the forefront of the sub. To that end, I still think this sort of shit is souring the sub. Can we make a grievance Wednesday or some shit where everyone comes out and complains on a single thread, leaving the rest of the week for content?
---
You seem to know your shit. That really is mindblowingly genius

Exactly. It’s the same keypress. It’s just being sent to multiple clients.

Most of the people who says to go back to retail have no idea how to play classic. Their idea of classic is slow and has to be irritating. If you can do things quickly and healer mana goes below 50% they exclaim slow down!!!!! I mean dude, if you aren't going to zero mana for a pull or starting another at less mana than you need to heal. It should be okay, granted it's not a risky pull that mobs can run away. Was killing undead up the ending of spiral in BFD as a level 43war. A path that's very predictable and yet I need to slow down. At no point in time that entire dungeon this dude went below 1/4 mana. It's just frustrating. I want to continue being the guy who helps everyone out but this level of cancer really getting me. Go back to retail, that's what a very smart member of the group had to say.
---
Nothing's unprofessional about it. Just streamer buttbaby fanboys sticking up for their dear leaders.

---
Glider bans were different.
---
That was before blizzard changed their stance regarding bans and suspension according to research.
---
Basically, banning a botter makes it more likely that they will just buy a new account and start botting again. While giving them suspensions decreases the risk, as they don't want to lose their characters and account.

Gold = gear in this situation because that gold can be used to buy gear. The item is literally BoP it's put up on AH so you can buy it.
---
Guess what people who get the gold is going to do with that gold? Buy gear probably.
---
It's not counterproductive to progression at all, it's actually productive, because the people who actually need the BoE's will buy them, instead of some random guy who thinks "ah well this is technically an upgrade so I'll need and equip".
---
At level 30 you can safely farm the tusks. You can easily buy the charms, and you only need a group for about 1 minute for the elite. Generally you can just group with the other groups that are doing the quest, just tagging the mobs.

It’s so easy.

---
Stop tagging people you are not responding to. The fuck is wrong with you?
---
That’s pretty shady, but how is it different than people on retail abusing sharding to farm mounts, toys, pets, etc.? Assuming it’s because of how much it affects server economy?

I just switched back to fire after being frost to AoE farm. It’s just not fun IMO.

---
It’s kind for one thing. People want to go to a dungeon and get a cool drop that they can use. If you don’t want to bring a mage because you’re worried they’ll want be mage drop, then you seem to be playing in a really self centric way. I personally get excited when someone gets a good drop for themselves, and when the group is in on it I have a more fun gaming experience. I’m not trying to change your mind, you’ve obviously given this thought- but that’s my thought on the matter. 
---
Best of luck to you.

Sweet setup man!! Btw what addon are you using for the quests?
---
&gt; Logically it makes sense for it to apply, because layers apply to the playerbase of the continent, and dungeons are within that continent.
---
Not under the original codebase and hardware. In the OG blades, instances existed on a completely different physical server than did Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms. Horizontally speaking, you might say that instances have always been on a different "layer".
---
Maybe he’s an expectant father trying out some dad jokes during the work day.
---
This is extremely against the EULA...
---
and a healer just in case the need rez
---
Absolutely not.  If a 1000g item drops good luck on the roll.  No one gets priority.  This applies to every boe drop.  If you get lucky and win that roll and want to use it more power to you.  I'll sell it and buy my next 30 weapon and armor upgrades... so in essence I need it more than you as you will only use it for 3 levels where I'll have upgrades for 30 levels because of it.  It's idiotic to think boe's go to anyone automatically.
---
Double comment because I dont want to sneak-edit: I'm not sure why you're suggesting I'm comparing high queue times to faction proportions? I mention both and cite them as causes for people to be frustrated? Can you unpack this opinion?

---
TLDR - parallelism is hard to implement, and often easy to exploit.
---
in scarlet monastery some of the enemies are called monks, like catholic robe wearing monks
---
That’s the thing though, it’s not about how much the items worth and what you can get from it, it’s about if someone is legit going to use it as an upgrade, even if they will grow out of it quickly, they still have priority over it. Selling it, in any way even to buy more upgrade is still considered greed and is the exact definition of the word and should be treated as such. Someone needed on the items to use right then and there? Sorry bro, you just lost 150g, but that’s the name of the game and how it works. You can go ahead and need on a boe item all you want to sell it, it’ll still be considered definition ninja looting cause you needed on something that you’re using for a greedy purpose.
---
The mana pool granted by int is largely a trap, just fyi.
---
Greed is for gold. It’s literally in the name. If everyone greeds an item it’s effectively the same as everyone needing. Needing was put in the game to have priority over people greeding for money only. If it’s for money, it’s greed, no matter the amount of money it’s still money and still greed. If it’s an upgrade you will equip, it’s need. That simple. Need on money items was invented by ninja looters or ppl afraid of ninja looters as a reasoning to make sure no one can out roll them based on a higher tier of prio.
---
I bet  most people who say go back to retail were probably not even born by the time Vanilla came out.
---
You don't need gear. You can level entirely fine in random crappy greens on every class. Equipping BoE blues and epics you come across in the world is usually a bad idea. You'll advance your character much more through smart use of the gold you get by selling it.
---
This might be a dumb question, but what class are you?
---
Have you been able to play around with it at all? I'm interested in how it worked out.

Used to raid in a guild name Rebørn with a bunch of Aussies in Vanilla. This is almost nostalgic lol

For the most part, focus on purely spellpower. A fair few spellpower items come with spirit/int anyway. Mp5 is nice, but certainly at this stage of itemizing isn't worth the complete lack of other stats those items will have.
---
Just picking pure spellpower is a safe bet.
---
Well as a player on Kromcrush I can say yes way. Every night the battle for Nesingwary supremacy rages.
---
I want that mouse, where did you get it ?
---
Dope thank you, do you possibly know a resto spec tree that’s solid for both PvE and Pvp/flag carrying? Or does speccing for one in resto tree basically compliment the other?
---
Yea but you have tons of stackable loot like 5x grey treats almost 1g
---
You underestimate the times i'll take joy in raiding a hord capital. For the alliance!
---
As a new wow player, classic being my first, I've never been told off in 45 levels. When I've made mistakes I've reiterated that I'm new and everyone either welcomes me or educates me in the zone. This is on Biggles server I dont know if that matters. I have come across some asshats but they were just mad at life in general that day.
---
You're thinking of onions
---
Yes because I still really enjoy this community and this game. I just have less free time on my hand then I did back in the day. I knew I’d get downvoted to hell for this comment but I don’t quite see why people can’t just have a conversation with a differing opinion instead of jumping down my throat.
---
Whenever I post.
---
Can someone contact Blizzard and get this as a loading screen tip please lol
---
This sounds sweet, wish it was on my server. If people attend do a follow up post on how it went!
---
100% bought that gold and trying to cover for it.
---
Yes. Trinket swapping is very much a thing.
---
It may be just 2 weeks as well.
---
Click the image in imgur once it loads. Then you can zoom.

Level 38 Human Priest on Kurinnaxx, leveling as a holy/ret hybrid so I can level efficiently and still heal dungeons well.
---
I'm looking for a guild that is focused on getting people to 60 and will later get into raiding. I am planning on starting raiding as a Holy Paladin, but down the line when most of the content has been cleared and progression has slowed down, I will probably switch to Ret for the memes. Another big goal of mine is to get the iconic Judgement set.
---
Also just looking for a great group of people to play and talk with, as a lot of my friends seemed to have dropped the game already.
---
Nabbed a 14 slot bag this morning farming wastewanderers.
---
Didn't even care about the ?? pally gank afterwards.
---
1 month ban is fine, and Blizzard can manually remove the shit they got as well in the worst case scenarios.
---
How good is Arcane Concentration combined with spells like Blizzard? If you pull 5 mobs and use Blizzard on them with 5/5 AC (10% chance to activate) how likely is it to proc? Is it like a 10% chance each time you cast Blizzard?
---
The *got damn* tho.
---
Greetings, Roy. Enjoy the vacation.
---
gambling with /roll games aren’t allowed either. Pretty sure this won’t fly... Sounds like fun though!
---
I hope you deliver to where I work.  Would love to have someone not so damn serious and a buzzkill
---
Just try new things, to find a happy balance. As you level up you will have more abilities to hold aggro and be a beast ;)
---
I remember it happening but I also remember all of the bosses we already killed not dropping loot the second time.
---
Yes, there's always a 30 seconds activation cooldown for active trinkets though, and obviously you can't change in combat. There's an addon called trinketmenu that really helps you swap trinkets a lot better. It's quite an essential part of vanilla pvp to have a bunch load of active trinkets that you swap around based on CD and what situation you think you will be in.
---
Thanks, that worked!
---
Do you happen to know if there's a setting that lets you show enemy health pool (exact number, not percentage?) I saw someone using plater with health numbers but I couldn't find anything in the settings.
---
Have the casters who are always drinking water/replenishing water to tell you when they’re ready for a pull. Or just wait till they have enough mana for the next pull you’ll do.
---
I just want to be able to run dungeons quickly, and I know tanks get dungeons in no time. Healers still take a bit, but that is what I would rather be doing honestly.
---
Not Feralas, I did SM Cath to 40. Then took my mount and rode to swamp of Sorrows.
---
I'm currently lvl 46, leveled Holy the whole way.  You should prioritize Int but take Spirit as a strong second stat.  If you're healing optimally (waiting until a Holy Light crit wouldn't overheal the tank, but making sure to heal before the tank dies) you should have a significant amount of time to get mana back from Spirit-based in-combat mana regen (unless you're AoE farming).  So Spirit will definitely help, but not quite as much as Int will.  And in emergency situations where you're healing more often than every 5s, Int is the only thing that matters, which means that the higher level you get the less useful Spirit becomes.
---
Like people actually know the rules of the garbage pile that blizz deems the "forums".
---
Hell no.
---
Tarren mill gang represent!!!
---
Im level 46 so ive pretty much got everything at this point.
---
Priest cause healers and shadow priest are sick
---
*Layering won't affect gameplay* 
---
That is going to sting for years hahhaa
---
always need on boe blues unless its a guildgrp
---
Unfortunately helping people swap layer is completely fine and you won't get into trouble for it.
---
Mistvale apes in STV. Hairs sell for like 80s a stack
---
Yup gnomes get tauren sized mounts as compensation. They're nerfing their mount size in retail though
---
I hope stuff like professions are rolled back as well.
---
Are there any youtubes or twitch that show high level hunter play?a
---
Beating a dead horse at this point. Let blizzard hand out bans and we all go on our way.
---
Early 40s I struggled.  At 44 I hit my stride:  Feralas, to Tenaris(and ZF), to Hinterlands.
---
He killed me on a pvp realm 😤😤😤
---
i just did those exact quests, lets just say im not a huge fan of them lol
---
What's your flight path friend?
---
The only good exploiter is the one who doesnt get caught.
---
Can I get one of these for Warlocks
---
It’s ok! Just many bumps along the road you will learn from mistakes and become a new breed of hunters
---
Whats the addon that tells you the vendor price? Is that auctioneer?
---
Are you downranking your heals or just spamming max rank? Bigger heals = Bigger threat.
---
The most important thing to remember as a healer in Classic is to use the correct rank of heal for the job, or even cast two lower ranked heals rather than one bigger one. Also you don’t need to heal everyone to full all the time.
---
I don’t even heal dps until they get to 50% health and even then I might only heal them with a rank 1 healing wave. Also don’t heal lifetapping warlocks, they have their healthstones to top themselves up with. 
---
Oh and yeah always let your tank get 3 sunders on before anyone does anything, dps included and you won’t have as many issues.
---
Install a threat meter add on like Omen so you can see your threat versus the tank. It will also alert you to when an idiot dps is going to pull so you can queue that clutch heal that saves a clothie form being instagibbed.
---
Sounds like a lot of PVE server players here. Doesn’t matter if you need as an upgrade or need as an item to sell on the AH. Discuss it with your group before the dungeon and you are fine. If you don’t talk about it you have no reason to be mad that someone else needs on a boe drop that you feel is an “upgrade” for you. Whether you want to believe it or not everyone benefits from needing may it be to sell it for gold so you can buy a mount or...use it as an upgrade.
---
I don’t have a guild and I receive these messages a lot. Is there a way to disable these invite ?
---
Easily worth $500-$1000 dollars lol
---
I play a hunter and I typically have my pet set to attack what I attack. In dungeons I change it to only do what I command it to do. Is there a way to keep it from running after mobs running away. I love my hunter but because every monster runs away on vanilla it seems. It makes dungeons so far not very fun.
---

---
Also, I don't understand how you can't see my post. If you want, I can copy paste it into a comment. 
---
However, I think you're extrapolating my argument into a different point than what it was actually making. I didn't post ideas for fixing server faction imbalance. I posted about the  individual player experience. If a player is getting ganked too much or can't enjoy themselves due to imbalance (whether they be on the smaller faction or the bloated one), they have the option to go elsewhere. 
---
I do not offer answers for fixing server balances. That was never my point. I wrote my opinion that these sorts of discussions are annoying, and that really if you want to enjoy the game, you can easily do so thanks to a solution they've provided. I'm not worried about Blizzard's problem with balancing factions in servers.
---
They could do cast sequence right? 
---
It’d be two button presses but only take up one keybind/space.
---
Obviously anything goes because it's PVP. But for me it depends a lot on mood. Usually here in phase 1 I only gank people who either interupt what I'm doing, or are part of some bigger guild. It's always fun to start rivalries with those bigger/better guilds. Tinytip is a sick addon it allows you to see guild and even guild rank of a player by hovering over them.
---
Never heard of him so probably not
---
I'm an old chunk of coal looking for a guild on Rattlegore, ideally with other equally time-strapped 30+ year olds.
---
1 guy out of thousands of streamers doesn't clean his room for 14 years
---
flogs it off like every streamer does this
---
dumb fucking reddit users
---
They didn't have to take the loot from the bosses they had to re-kill. There's nothing stopping them from letting it stay on the ground and staying on a level playing field with their competitors.
---
Shield is also bad for warrior and druid tanks in general, they aren't taking damage for the duration and so they can't generate any rage. Best to keep it for saving dps and buying time in emergencies
---
If you're talking about Inquisitor Fairbanks, his bracers are unique so if you have a pair in your inventory you can't roll for/loot them again. I had this happen to me and I was super confused. If this isn't the case for you then maybe it's a bug.
---
Which is just making the problem worse
---
If you think the multi billion dollar international company doesn't have analytics and tracking out the ass you're delusional
---
Logically if there are more players on one fraction to begin with it's likelier they also make an alt/bank account hence exponentially influencing the difference.
---
Its a lot lower than I remember it being. Got 20g in the mail from selling a 22.5g item.
---
I’m glad they’re punishing ppl. But what happened to what blizzard put out about a week ago that it’s all a hoax?! Thought they said it wasn’t exploitable. These cheaters deserve to be punished but Blizzard need to punish themselves for stupidity.  They need to  give us all a free month for the pain and suffering WE all endured during this turbulent times. Amen
---
Without exploits? they don't want to actually play this game.
---
I’d recommend leveling as Ele or enhance.  I’m currently 42 and have been healing dungeons completely fine, I just switch to int &amp; spirit gear and take off my dps set.
---
Resto leveling will be very slow but safe, however I’d definitely recommend against it !
---
&gt; That's not what "physical server" means...
---
Back in 2004/05, it did. Instances were on a different [physical blade](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Server_blade) within a realm server cluster.
---
Yes absolutely they did experience a much larger capacity of players and are attempting to alleviate the queue times by making more servers and offering free transfers off the full ones. I agreed to that but it does nothing for faction balance
---
Yeah, I'm basically a complete pleb
---
Hell yeah. Made a bunch of friends on the server and have been loving it. Though as soon as I hit Ashenvale I realized maybe I’m not cut out for a PvP world. Sucks :(
---
Good job driver. Trucking is fun, but wow is more fun.
---
Yea if freezing band drops im needing that shit even if i cant use it
---
I’d like to see what level Marney is I’ll just say that lol
---
Boe epics like that should be all need, you're scummy for convincing him he was doing something wrong and costing him his mount.
---
Add these under showtooltip to fix.
---
/cancelaura leader of the pack
---
/cancelaura Predatory Strikes(Rank 3)
---
The video literally ends with him engaging the boss a second time.
---
Everyone's gotta have a hero. This is it for a certain type of person.
---
Need on boe
---
The 3 mc clears were 2 legit weekly lockouts and one was an entirely separate bug that was in original classic and has nothing to do with layering.
---
You are a weapons grade pleb.
---
Do you like my meme
---
I prefer calling people commies.
---
I don't see many people on Reddit defending Hitler, but boy are there quite a few subs where they'll defend communism, Mao, and Stalin.
---
Always need on BoE epics hands down
---
LOL True
---
W..what do we do?!!
---
Ban em! Ban em all!!!
---
Well you use a DELL pc,
---
You take a video of the game on a phone,
---
and you film it vertically...
---
So I bet it's just that you checked "Set as Exp Bar" on one of your reputations while badly clicking on your paladin abilities.
---
I may not have been clear with this, but I can't individually open any of the images, try clicking on them after waiting for full load and it does nothing, same on chrome. I get the album loaded and no matter where I press it just doesn't do anything, all I can do is zoom but it's pointless because it's so pixelated.
---
asmongold is a popular one right?

Need all boes to remove chance of ninja, if someone actually wants to use it and equip it, that’s between the winner of the item and themselves.
---
Honestly, confidence comes through experience. You’ll get over that fear by running many instances. Some of those will go well, some will go poorly, but over time they’ll mostly get better and you won’t feel intimidated
---
I'm grinding with my wife, she's a hardcore fan, I'm new. We spent Saturday and Sunday a total of 28 hours eating and grinding with friends in discord. I can seriously see myself dying or getting blood clots from this game. So good.
---
Isn't this the first macro a hunter needs?
---
/roll
---
Four hours aye. Glad I paid 80s on the ah
---
I literally have those items, no need for any exploits. Lots on dungeons + 2 MC semi-pugs with only 2 hunters in the raid
---
Maybe this game isn’t for you?
---
There’s a reason it’s called a ‘massively multiplayer online role playing game”
---
There’s plenty of single player games out there, but wow was obviously decided to be played by social people
---
You're my hero for reminding me that video exists!
---
"rightful owner". Fucking noobs. Its a boe epic. Its a free for all item. Its barely better than the ZF staff you can get at 42. It belongs on the AH.
---
idk for sure but at the very end of the clip it def looked like he was moving to engage.
---
I think that once a quest is gray for you, it only gives 10% of the reputation.
---
That's fucking ridiculous. I literally have not bought one single item on the AH, and I've only opened trade to buy bags or enchants. 
---
If my account got rolled back, I would be LIVID.
---
There are millions of people just like me.
---
I play on Blameaux... Thanosing intensifies.
---
Take a look at rule 7, specifically "Googleable questions".  
---
It's been discussed and explained to death.
---
Yep wayyyy too much gold injection, making others efforts and gold acquisition more futile
---
cept the water is usually the exact same for each level tier
---
so if i craft the water a mage learns at lvl 40, its actually the lvl 35 water. which heals 1993 mana.
---
and at that point you can easily have 3500-4000 (most do btw) mana depending on how int stacked you are. and you keep that same water til 50, so for 10 levels your gear improves, total mana improves but your water always sucks.
---
and its not just mages, its all casters lol
---
Aoe farm? I'm talking about dungeon farm.
---
Damn it feels good to be a gangster!
---
It's was roundabout way to say you have to use the restroom. It was used in older games were dungeons took alot longer.
---
Lol just wait til you hit 60 and have to grind dungeons for gear all day and grind gold all night for epic mount and consumes. Just go back to bfa now before you waste more time
---
Perma ban is too heavy in my opinion.
---
If an account has no previous infractions I think it's reasonable to be banned for a month and have all items an gold rolled back.
---
I posted this exact same thing lastnight and got downvoted to hell. Funny how things change when the exploiters get banned 😂😂😂
---
Right but there's no alternative if we want to enjoy the game.
---
At the start of the run just say "tell me if you want me to go faster or slower" then just do whatever.
---
Paying monthly lol. Casuals.
---
&gt; his bracers are unique so if you have a pair in your inventory you can't roll for/loot them again
---
That's probably it, but I feel like it was an issue for his other loot too (which may or may not be unique too, I can't check atm).
---
In any case, I've definitely had an unexplained bug with loot that I won the roll on not going to my bags and remaining on the body, which is more in-line with OP's issue.
---
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/warcraft-less-traveled-a-world-of-warcraft-podcast/id369632440
---
I will face my fear.
---
This is more important than the suspensions imo. Good to see Blizz take a hardline stance and it be for the better of the game.
---
I've got a thing against shit posts, sorry.
---
Ah. Thanks. I was doing that but wasn’t sure if maybe there was an easier way. Thank you.
---
Always need if its an boe epic.
---
Feelsgood to be a mage, aoe farming those levels wasny stressful
---
Then you don’t play on Faerlina much because the queue is always bad after noon
---
Honestly I know it's a pain, but your process should be called out for a mob or two in a pug. 
---
As a mage, when I work with other CCers, we coordinate an order. Then we never mention it again and everyone just gets it. 
---
But no way we can expect the other CCers to know the plan ahead of time without prior communication. These are pugs, not guild raids
---
are we able to summon someone to a dungeon entrance? i know warlock/mage? can summon. what about meeting stones or any other way?
---
i mean it can be a hassle to walk to a dungeon, after completing it, the group will be disband and each will start to do their own stuffs. What if i wanted to run that dungeon again, do i have to walk to it again?
---
everything I read, even on the EULA( crtl+F " gambling  ")  says it's fine. You are just not allowed to advertise in-game or on the official forums.
---
EU making NA look shit.. again.
---
Leveling from 1-60 in retail could be done in a like 10 hours or less. In classic, it takes close to 5 days of playtime without exploiting the layering system if you’re *really* efficient. 
---
In addition, any gear, gold, or crafting mats attained in classic is literally worthless in retail. 
---
It would be like deleting their character, but in a much more circuitous way. Basically tossing some salt in the wounds.
---
Yeah it's definitely uncommon. I ran SM Armory about 15-20 times I'd say and never seen it drop for anyone!
---
Lvl 53 Pally. Looks like he deleted his toon though. He got a warden staff and did not have to pay for his first mount. 
---
There is not way I could pay for gold, I am more worried about food more than gold in Classic.
---
Until a basilisk or something adds
---
Nothin dude. I don't think your a schizophrenic. I'm sure you've seen it. Chill. Lol
---
Ayyy I see my name woo!
---
nice gold waste gg
---
Also, wow didnt cause the 14 year cleaning drought. It caused the relapse.
---
Your point doesn't make sense then. People are complaining about faction balance in their realm. This is something beyond their control, however their characters are, especially on servers with high population that have been afforded free transfers. The post I've linked discussed Stalagg. That is one such server.
---
Again, I wrote that the player experience is important, but blizzard has given players the ability to make informed decisions on how they want to spend their game time.
---
you sir, are a killer of a fun time, and a joke.
---
Reads better than I have to pee or poop etc, imo
---
To add my 2c that nobody asked for:
---
It's not a race unless you make it out to be one but, that can get stressful. You're here to enjoy yourselves, right?
---
Slow down, smell the roses, go fishing, climb that mountain! It's a glorious world with so much to do beside rushing to be the top kek! :D
---
God I love this place. I haven't been there in almost 10 years and I just hit lvl 40. Soon Tanaris, really soon.
---
Where the hell is all the horde PvPers at?
---
I'm on Skeram, supposedly the other Horde dominated server after Stalagg, and everyday I get:
---
1. Corpse Camped.
---
2. Ganked while questing.
---
3. MC'd off the boat.
---
4. Have Horde members complain in chat "Lol no honor no rewards" so they aren't going to PvP.
---
Not sure what they were trying to do there. They didn't have nearly enough people.
---
You shouldn't have to, but it makes it a lot easier if you macro in marks. Even idiots will attack a marked target (usually).
---
So deep....
---
peculiar, as I recall people gettong in trouble for that in the past. i have no proof though and you did your research. best of luck!
---
I was in that group yesterday :)
---
Had to leave by 2130 how long did you guys keep going?
---
I reckon the effect is definitely noticeable atm, especially on certain higher level trade goods. Like some things are too cheap, but it should even itself out again hopefully. 
---
Enchanting Mats are definately too cheap on my server.
---
We will!
---
I'm sure it was a lot of fun for them! Fun for us too!
---
That sounds mana inefficient even with multiple mages.
---
Yes and its obviously a problem for both factions, if the alliance leave then world pvp goes with it. Then battlegrounds will become horde vs horde (with alliance racials or some crap in an attempt to fix it). I just hate to see the opposite faction leave though, if more players migrate to a server filled with their own faction then balance will further deteriorate.
---
Maybe that's why you got banned. Third strike.
---
Its kind. Lol. Its utterly moronic to feel like you should need on an item worth hundreds of gold to use for a few lvls.
---
I popped into one of his streams once just to check him out during one of the classic betas. Him and his group were questing and ganked some other solo player. He went on to say things like, "if you don't like pvp then don't roll on a pvp server" and things like that. Well, that guy came back with his entire guild and steamrolled asmon and corpse camped his group. Asmon started literally screaming and crying about how fucked up it is, how its unfair that this guy came with his whole guild, started accusing him of stream sniping and all kinds of other bullshit complaining.
---
The whole time all I could think was, if you don't like pvp you shouldn't have rolled on a pvp server. Basically, if he does it it's fine, but if it happens to him it's unfair.
---
Also he was talking about and justifying trolling people and baiting them into making threats and then having his fans mass report the people to get them banned. Saying it's justified because as a streamer he gets treated unfairly and its his way of getting back at the community or some nonsense.
---
Tl;Dr Dude is an entitled prick.
---
Yes, mine was tge gryphon master of loch and the master of IF has one too...
---
But it's not some rare bug, it happens to multiple people. Why should his guild be further punished just for raiding publicly? 
---
Bugs happen, you don't punish people even further than what the bug caused. That's just stupid. And so what if it gives people faster gear? This is classic, nobody gives a shit about weird competitive raiding integrity. Rag was killed ages ago.
---
No rollback and only 1 month ban. Blizzard is too desperate for money to permaban anyone anymore.
---
Is that a damage and healing done addon?  If so what is it called.  Gratz on the legendary.
---
You got me! I am apart of
---
I'm out of the loop, what is this exploit?
---
This is something different. They were able to respawn dungeon bosses without leaving the dungeon.
---
Level 41, 10g from mount. Continue questing or is there a quicker way for me to quickly get the 10?
---
Hoping for more severe bans. These type of nerds ruin the game and play it way too competitively.
---
Damn the last day before I’m back from vacation lol let’s plan a thank you raid tomorrow and show them how it’s really done
---
&gt;My question is, what more do you want Blizzard to do for you? 
---
I want an option for a balanced server. I'd transfer to it.
---
I remember this day, was great
---
All he had to say was brb bio 3min, and /follow the healer. lol
---
i think it's literally called vendor price
---
Cool setup
---
Not quiet your specific request but definite proof it was done before Classic beta. 
---
https://youtu.be/tBWS9-5UQGU
---
&gt;peculiar
---
if we all get warned or banned i will let you know..lol
---
It was put into song in 2007 https://youtu.be/t3Yr4_od7Fc
---
Lol 7 hour LFR queue? Why would anyone bother reading anything you say after something as unbelievable as that.
---
Lmao, imagine needing items for gold. Have fun getting the items you need. you guys don't deserve high rolls.
---
I actually agree with them. I wasn’t and exploited and would never do that,  but it does seem unfair to me to ban people for taking competitive advantage with a feature you put in the game.
---
Should they have instead been told to get fucked and you can't kill Rag this week because of a bug they had no control over? 
---
  Big difference between "hey this instance is fucked up, we should make sure we aren't doing anything wrong" and "hey this instance is fucked up, let's figure out how we fucked it up so we can keep getting loot."
---
 if we all get warned or banned i will let you know..lol
---
Which addon shows the vendor price?
---
I created a guild with my 7 or so RL buddies that all came back for classic, not because we need to have guild chat, we are all in voice chat together when we play, but we made it to stop the fucking spam.
---
While GMing a private server way back in BC I found out that we had logs of literally everything. Every mail sent, every trade done, every message sent, and everywhere someone was. *Everything* was logged. This was back in BC, so no doubt Blizzard has done some work to make parsing all that data significantly faster to find the stuff they need.
---
Ohhh man it's look so cool
---
idk about the level in chat but if you enter 
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0" 
---
in the chat box it will start showing class colors in chat
---
What classes are the brown and green colors?  I only know whote blue and purple
---
Continue questing. You'll make 10g before you know it.
---
1. You're using canon wrong. A game mechanic isn't lore.
---
2. That interaction has literally nothing to do with layering. 
---
You're just doing everything wrong here.

This is awesome

We'll have a more planned attack :)

Is that a rare loot? I got one on like my third trap, guess I got lucky

---
Good thing about the targeting macros here is they won't override your target. As long as your tab targeting or clicking it's fine. I only really use the auto targeting in dungeons during large trash pulls.

My "favourite" part of tanking is when on a pack of 3 mobs I mark 2, and the not marked is the first to die

Not sure if it's been mentioned inhere yet, but back in Ultima Online if you screwed up you could take a ban or jail.  
---
If you took jail you had to sit in a 10x10 bricked room for a specific amount of in game playtime before you were allowed to leave.  
---
Once you were in there long enough, a portal would open and you were free to go.  
---
I was jailed for 24 hours of in game time for using naughty language(it was pretty bad and I totally deserved it.)   I didn't have access to macros that could keep me logged in, so every 15 min I had to move 3 paces to keep from going afk.

Learned my lesson.

Let them aoe farm and every piece of loot they had are the drops but every time they go to loot them their bags become full of coal

I don't know whether this translates to WoW but in the real world harsher punishment does not mean less crime is committed, nor that there is less relapsing among the convicted.
---
&gt;quick second question here - i always just spam FOL. should i be using Holy light instead and then just wait for mp5? I feel when i Holy Light I oom way quicker, even without overhealing and dont get a lot of time to hit the 5s rule anyway
---
Curious, is it a relaxing job being a truck driver? Like you just listen to some music and go for long ass drives? Or do you gotta worry about securing cargo and negotiating for rates and all that?
---
Ah, I see. You don't think offering free transfers directly responds to player complaints. I disagree.
---
I have yet to see or come up with a practical and pragmatic solution to the issue of realm balancing that can be done on Blizzard's side of the control box. So what they've instead done is delegate that power to the individual player with a transfer. You're not going to get a server fix for imbalanced factions. It's not possible. What you will get is a free transfer to a server that, so far, looks pretty damn good (my own, Earthfury, is 54.9% horde. I'll take it). 
---
So sure, it won't solve your faction balance. But I think calling for action on a realm-wide scale is wishful thinking at best, and entitlement at worst. Blizzard has given you the tool to control your experience and instead you want them to personally moderate the game at the expense of someone else. Should new players be restricted from making characters of one faction because the realm statistics show imbalance? I'm not suggesting that course of action, however ultimately any such action will limit the experience of a player.
---
Nope, meeting stones didn't allow you to summon until TBC.

Just being live for the bonkers shit like this and hearing the stories of invasions like that? I've wanted to experience it for so long.

It was so thrilling to witness. This is the shit I have wanted to see in WoW. Screenshots of the carnage:

No, that was a bug and he reported it before doing it a second time.

Couln't care less about racing this game. I'm just playing it.
---
Well, you did complain about being out of mana and there are three primary reasons for being out of mana.
---
#1 You didn't drink after the last engagemang because you were busy not paying attention.
---
#2 You didn't drink after the last engagemang because you weren't out of mana yet and you're too cheap to use drinks on anything but an empty bar.
---
#3 You were drinking after the last engagemang but couldn't resist interrupting your drink to get up to attack the next pull before it was properly engaged. (Usually by nuking a caster mob that the tank is trying to LOS thus stopping it far away from the group and near another pack or patrol.)
---
Now it's plausible that you're OOM for other reasons, but these are the most likely ones.
---
Explained this to some party members in SM Cathedral earlier today.
---
Someone pulled aggro and then played Ring Around the Rosie around a pillar while the tank followed. As amusing as it was when they changed direction just as the tank changed direction as well, they kept los’ing my heals and died. We survived and I got a laugh but overall it was a mildly frustrating experience.
---
Not sure if you did this on purpose as a joke but it’s Tarren Mill.  Gonna start calling it Tauren Hill to trigger my friends tho so ty.
---
Actually ninja looters desperately hope every one uses the need/greed system. They wait to everyone greeds and then take it, or at worst roll against one other person.  
---
The entire point of the 'all need' system is that it completely wrecks the ninja looter's plan. It literally prevents ninja looting from ever happening.
---
Always a new excuse to try and dismiss something because you are unwilling to admit when you are wrong. 
---
All of these methods existed in early 2000 retail, there just wasn’t the communication network we have today for you to learn and do it too.
---
Eh, I played on a PvP server for almost the entirety of vanilla and the experience is definitely "different". There weren't huge groups of people bottlenecked into zones with raids running through ganking questing zones constantly. I love a bit of PvP but it's a bit ridiculous compared to what actually went down in vanilla.
---
To be clear, I'm not complaining or leaving for a PvE server. I honestly kind of expected it. People's attitudes are just a bit different now and people aren't naturally spreading out as they level slowly. I'm honestly amazed at the amount of people in the 40-60 range already. I don't like to PvP as I level that much but I want to be able to at end game so that's the cost. People have to learn to deal.
---
Not speaking for me bro
---
Maaaybe there's a small benefit from recruiting for dungeons from the people that don't know about the LFG chat channel or aren't in it all the time since it spams the chat window.
---
otherwise totally pointless though, agreed
---
Pressing Esc would maybe suprise you with plenty of shiny options !
---
A couple of my friends also got gifted wands when they were low level and kept going on about how nice the guy was and how excited they were to have wands so early lol
---
Well this is actually game breaking...
---
I hope they ban esfand for clearing mc twice.
---
I'm saying that it happens. You can call them a dick, sure, but you can't expect everybody to play nice. If you roll on a PVP server and expect not to get ganked by 60's from time to time, you're either willfully ignorant or straight up oblivious.
---
Farming lasher in DME has nothing to do with 5man aoe farming dungeons and if you think otherwise you are just putting up strawmen to win your argument.
---
I mean alliance has better pve racials, that’s why pve guilds went alliance.
---
Yes, Faerlina is a competitive server. Pserver players rush to corner the market on exclusive patterns, and get the best gear to control the best resources and world bosses, to have the ultimate big dick speed run records and realm firsts.

Is there a difference in kind between this exploit and people asking for layer invites for any other reason?

There is literally no way that a reasonably sized team of QA testers are going to be able to test 5% of the potential bugs that a playerbase of several million are over 20 days.
---
Awesome thank you! I’ll look in to it
---
I'm 41 and I only have 10 gold so far so I'd say you're doing pretty good :)

I think you can block guild invites on interface-&gt; social. You'll still get the whispers but not the random ass invite popups

Also very jealous of tank and heals leveling together. How long does it take to find three rando dps? About 1 minute?

Yeah it probably tbh. No idea why but I'm not \*super\* into sharing info online, I'm admittedly a little paranoid. I realized it was a bit overboard after posting.

Grats man, may rnjesus bless your procs in the future

What does it mean by spellpower? Does he mean items that for example "increases frost damage by 10%"?

Dont inv them, report them instead.

Big difference between layering instance bosses and layering word mobs.

Someone asked this a while ago and blizzard responded by saying there is no way to transfer gold between retail and classic.

Leadership needs to have the guts to gkick troublemakers quickly, rather than letting them fester.  Yes, there will be some drama long the way, but it's part of the territory.

I'm trying to get a friend to join and he seems interested, however it's been a bit difficult to describe the classes to him since they're so many with such unique stuff. Every time I talk to him about this subject, he seems to have forgotten most of what I tried teaching him.
---
I was thinking of showing him a guide then. However, most seem written towards veterans since they use tons of jargon that my friend won't understand since he's also new to MMOs. I did find a couple of guides for new players, but they are literally dozens of pages long which is sure to put him off.
---
Does anyone know a brief and concise class picking guide for new players that know jack shit about WoW?
---
He's not talking about them, he's talking about the ones who cheated
---
You're comparing an incident where they cleared 14 different bosses with a 1-shot item given to them wrongly, where they didn't ask any questions about the item...  
---
To a singular instance reset where they immediately asked Blizzard contacts on what to do, and only went ahead with re-clearing because they were given the OK?  
---
&gt; I cheated. I know this. The item said 'Cheater.' I justified it, to be sure, and it was an easy thing to find justification for. 
---
 This is what the dude who was banned for the Martin Fury incident even said. He legit thought it was customer service to give him something that instant-killed shit, but that literally goes against the core of the game. Of course he's going to get hit hard about it.  
---
Take a step back and look how ridiculous your arguments are, mate. They're nowhere near comparable.
---
It has done next to nothing, I 'abuse' layering everyday to great success. The only difference is I take a slightly longer herb/mining run before a layer hop.
---
Incorrect logical fallacy your attempting to identify but i’ll let is slide. 
---
I’m not even sure what point you are trying to defend anymore but I hope you find peace with the fact people play a video game differently than you and that it is OK not to know everything.
---

That's not a big deal. Most guilds trying to clear efficiently would welcome more practice on bosses, assuming they only formed for Classic.
---
I was thinking of possibly rolling a Warrior alt.
---
Ideally i would be doing 80% Solo Questing, and maybe 20% dungeons
---
What would be the optimal talent-tree for that? just regular Sweeping Strikes/MS?
---
Or would a fury build be better for soloquesting?
---
Dead zone is the area between where a hunter can hit a target with melee and shoot their weapon, basically if an enemy stays in the dead zone the hunter cant do anything to them (but you can easily move to get out of the dead zone).
---
You have to feed your pets, you also have to train pets to learn the abilities they know so you can teach them to other pets. You can't just train pet abilities at a trainer (besides growl)
---
Hunters have some minor hassles with equipment/feeding, but their solo PvE gameplay is so strong it easily makes up for it. You do not need melee as a PvE player, but in PvP there's times where it's well worth using.
---
The dead zone is the distance between where you can't shoot anymore and where you can start hitting them with melee. Taurens have a bigger melee range (it goes both ways, they can be hit from further away by everyone else too), which might make you expect their dead zone is smaller (ergo a big advantage). But the way it's coded is "Your gun can start to shoot X yards past your melee range" so tauren have no benefit there.
---
i used to farm them. equal drop from all mobs afaik
---
Not enough to make paladins scary. :D Crazy interactions though. Should be fixed if true.
---
I saw that, but according to that ruling there is no explicit rule against people going on the forums, organising a gold swap between retail and classic, etc etc. If that’s the case now I need to find someone trust worthy who’s willing to perform the trade.
---
The deadzone is basically a small area that a player can be in where they are both too close for you to use range(8yards) but also too far away for you to use melee attacks. Basically you are dead in the water if an enemy player sits in this range with your CC'ed. But there's obviously ways to avoid it.
---
Hunter is a very easy class to learn, but also difficult to master. And yes you use ammo and need to feed your pet. Ammo is something you get used to very quickly, and feeding your pet is only really a hassle in the early game, if you stick with the same pet(which you should if it's a good one, go for cat imo), then after about 8 hours with your pet and feeding it desperately it will take a liking to you and hardly need food again only when it dies or once every other hour or so.
---
Wrong.  Next time please first read the arguments we give.  Feel free to debate them, but zealously shouting ninja only shows ignorance.
---
Do you renember that fucking guy who kept saying he didn't do it and then itsepi just smacked the shit out of him with exactly what the guy said in game that got him banned? Guck that was amazing, what a fucking legend!
---
I think is brilliant

Thanks! If you don’t mind me asking, where is all your money going to?

Waterbiomes have a anti botting system in place, if too many people fish at the same biome for too long, no fish will be able to be caught for a certain amount of time. This was an old vanilla thing at a point where botting was popular and blizzard had a difficult time to prevent it with their anti cheat system, so they introduced this mechanic.
---
Obviously this was designed with 3000 people per server in mind, yet we have like 20000 per layer and so popular places like tanaris are only ever restocked at morning times when lots of people sleep or work, primetime you wont usually get any fish out of popular spots, also no nightfins at midnight in feralas cause those fishing biomes all usually run dry too, this is why nightfinsoop for healer are currently exploding in prices - 1 soup on average 3-4 gold.
---
If server merges were a planned thing then they could beforehand plan and decide what servers get merged and have names be unique among the pool of servers destined to be merged. For example there'd be servers a, b and c at launch and then post launch they added server d to the pool. Then when time for merges came they combined a and d together and b and c together. Then more time goes by and eventually ad and bc got merged together as well.
---
Do a Google/YouTube search for "Warlock drain tanking". It's a good build for both leveling and PvP.
---
The point is not to introduce a system/structure/menu for a social aspect of the game when it can be generated organically by the player.
---
Long story short, 8 yard dead zone (if a mob is at 7 yards, you can not shoot it).  Taurens have slightly bigger hit boxes which is what is used to calculate your 8 yard deadzone thus causing you to have a slightly larger deadzone.
---

It doesn't stop the "notification" message in grey in the chat window, but does at least stop the "do you want to join" dialog.

Pre raid is possible because non-raid instances don’t have a weekly cap. 
---
I meant Raid bis would not be achievable in the 3 weeks (3 raids) we have had so far
---
That's my high-end. Most of my poops take about a minute to a minute and a half on average. Eat more vegetables.
---
Usually 5, because we stack the group with DPS that is higher level than us and doesn't compete for our drops. It's a sweet life, not gonna lie.
---
&gt; The horde is our adversary. Our enemies are the Gnomes
---
Blizzard has just now released census data. So is your solution (which is no where in any post or response from you by the way) that people who rolled on Stalagg originally (before census data was released) should-
---
A: Reroll on a balanced census server
---
B: Take the free transfer and pray it's better
---
Neither of these are solutions. If this isn't what you are trying to say then you have been completely unsuccessful in presenting your point. You keep running in circles in what you are actually trying to say and I find it comical you say I am the one not making any sense. 
---
I have told you EXACTLY why free character transfers do nothing to alleviate faction imbalance on any server (this post about Stalagg included). I also said the server imbalances are not that bad and these people are being a lot over dramatic. Now if you could clearly articulate why you think this guy should stop complaining about Stalagg BECAUSE of free transfers (like you have stated in the original post) I would love to hear it. Otherwise you should probably re-read and edit your OP
---
Hold shift, click a name

That deaf guild on FFXIV that cleared that incredibly hard raid (don't remember the name) with no voice communication was so fucking awesome. It'd be cool to see something like that in this game too.

Yes those ones.  Also if you’re using any of the keys past 6ish (depending on hand size) you’re screwing up.  You should rebind those keys to something you can reach without having to move your hands away from WASD. Bartender is a common add on that people use for this, but it can be done via the regular key bindings options with a little bit more hassle.
---
i don't see how thats a problem? If they come back from that and do it the honest way.. then they've earned it..

But.. I am all for teaching them a lesson.. Not like in a major way.. just something to make them reconsider cheating, then being dicks to people that call them out on it.

---
This is pretty much the standard rotation when running zf with multiple mages. It is mana inefficient compared to blizzard but you need a critical mass of burst aoe otherwise the healers will run you out of mana before they die. Also it is more dps albeit more dangerous and mana inefficient.
---
I thought you were talking about the lore of a skeleton or something
---
It comes with the territory in any guild.  When you invite literally everyone your guild fills up with people who are too incompetent or toxic for guilds with even a minimal vetting process and guild chat becomes barrens chat 2.0.

There is competition in doing it faster than the rest, and Esfand is one of the people who wants to do that. He wants his guild to be hardcore and recruited it as such.

Meaning of ART in relation to priests? I found it in an addon I downloaded and because I'm playing now on a different language this bit of wow lingo in unfamiliar to me. By the context it's something timed (addon makes a timer for it).

Horde has Corpsemaker at 29, though. Sure, it isn't as relevant for nearly as long, but it's as close as it gets.

Blizzard banned preach for stacking xp pots man everyone thinking they aren’t gonna bam obvious exploiting like this is drinking the anti blizzard Kool Aid
---
Tricks of the Trade is what i was thinking of. and it isn't in classic.
---
Some people do return lost wallets and/or money to the police, yes.
---
They don't need the gear, they were already clearing the instance relatively smoothly. Keeping the items is pure greed. They've played WoW for 15 years, they know how lockouts work and they know when it's not working as intended.
---
At least it seems that there are still many people that are so brainfucked that they watched him cleaning his desk on stream...

This is the most relavent answer. Delete the items and move on. It's 3 weeks since launch, this entire game is going to be completely different in a month or two. IF on my server is still dead as fuck there's like 3 60s running around at anyone time, and we have 2k+ ques still.... 
---
Premades in Bgs with full MC gear? So what, they would be geared out either way. 
---
800g item going for 100g? I don't care, the same people exploiting are the same that would buy a 800g item... Like .01% of the server community who cares.
---
I also don't really believe this is an exploit. It is in the sense that people abused it and such yea, but it was a byproduct of the layering system and not a devious plot/hack/bot.
---
I think a recent patch may have broken it. Check add on developer for an update
---
There is an addon for it. I downloaded it for myself because I have issues with slouching and in physical therapy they told me I need to work on that. It's a huge savior for me, still feels weird sitting straight up as I'm so used to slouching without ever noticing.

You wish.
---
Ah thank you now I know!
---
I’ve been donating stuff like bags or gold to a lot new players and have realized most players don’t say thanks. It’s not that they don’t say anything, I just more often see responses like “wow”, “oh ok”, “wtf”
---
Also: group dynamics change dramatically depending on the relative difficulty of your group vs the dungeon and especially of the tank’s level vs the dungeon.  
---
If he is barely equal or 1-2 levels below some of the trash, get ready to take your time and let him build threat because there will be misses and rage is hard to gain.  
---
If the tank, and your group, are over leveled, you can just faceroll it all but try to be sensible and assist targets. Turn enemy health bars on and make sure you are attacking the same dudes. Also, this is when the healer can basically go into DPS mode and toss heals every now and then. You don’t have to worry about pulling Aggro here as much since stuff will be dying so quickly anyway, but like OP says, if you do pull it, run TOWARDS the tank.  
---
Dungeons can be done severely under leveled with basically any heal + tank + DPS comp as long as the players are sensible and take their time. Wipes usually occur because people done fucked up big time, or the group members are out of sync with each other and doing weird shit.
---
Fucking loser lol
---
Don’t think they bind to account
---
The game would not be playable without layering.
---
Didn't down vote, but sorry i have things going on outside reddit. To answer your question: just like in real life, succes comes to those who work hard, and dedicate their time. "fairness" is a pedantic human concept that really doesn't aply anywhere..
---
And I have also replied, in multiple postings, my point has never been the relief of imbalance. It has been that Blizzard has given players the means to change their realm to one that is not imbalanced, thus removing the issue entirely. It's not the responsibility of players to run Blizzard's servers for them, or to ensure balance. If you don't understand that idea then I don't know what else to say.
---
My muscles scream in burning protest as my axe fells another quilboar, the effort only serving to widen the weeping gashes covering my body. My armor is in tatters, my blade a ruined mess, and as a fresh wave of the brutish animals charge towards I know this will be my end. I fall to one knee, unwilling or unable to prolong my own suffering in dome flfeeble final act of defiance. As the Quilboars begin to close on me, makeshift weapons held high, I see one of their kin succumb to a vicious wound I'd dealt it earlier. Good, at least I took some of them with me. I close my eyes and the ruin of my face twists into a crude smile. I have done my ancestors proud this day.
---
Energy explodes through my body, coming from somewhere deep within. A bestial roar explodes from my lungs, making the charging beasts falter, their confidence draining as they see that this old orc was far from dead. I feel somehow... stronger. I AM stronger. I tighten my grip around the haft of my father's axe, the axe he'd passed on to me with his last dying wishes, the axe that I would pass on to my son, and in that moment I knew nothing of defeat, nothing of death or cowardice. In that moment I only knew rage.
---
When they defend their existence, I lose all sympathy.
---
I second this!! I’ve gotten a number of people just from grouping up and doing stuff with them.  
---
Also, I really try to make original, humorous, and brief guild recruitment messages. I get a decent amount of hits on lower level people, but as soon as they get in I focus on chatting with them and try to help them in any way I can (bags, enchant, give them a wand, help with a quest).  We’ve had great success that way with keeping guildies and even having those people encourage their friends to join.
---
They are bind on use.
---
I spent 2hours farming turtles there tonight haha it’s a great view

Cool! If u don’t mind me asking, where has all your gold went to?
---
I'm sorry but why is the GOD tag bad?
---
1 month only? Perma ban the whole guild imo.
---
Horde has better PvP abilities, but they suck in PvP as well.
---
Glad to see action.  These exploits were private-server antics.  We're on papa blizzard servers now people! I'm hoping for a ton of bans.   Honestly, unpunished it would destroy ClassicWoW launch (which we only ever get one of) and dilute the entire game for everyone.  causal/normal players (the bulk of the player base) would be completely demoralized if the cheaters went unpunished, good work blizzard keep it up

How exactly did the exploit even work? Jumping to a different layer while at a final boss or something? (Im just curious, Im not looking to break the rules and this was patched anyways and i just feel out of the loop)
---
I love these please post any more if you have them
---
If you have a t1 or t2 upgrade from a pre-bis piece but that causes you to fall below the 9% hit cap, should you wear the pre-bis item until you find another item that gives you hit?
---
Do we know how much hit something like 5 weapon skill gives? For example, if i have 305 swords but only 8% hit, am i hit capped?
---
Hey man, don't get me wrong. I'm totally chill with PVP. I'm down for skirmishes any day. 
---
In this case though it's totally one sided and impossible to fight back against which takes all the contest out of it. The horde here are safe from the guards but those little Goblin baastards will kill us if we try and fight back, which makes this tactic seem more like an exploit.
---
Don't bash me me for asking a question. I came here to clear up if it was permitted or nah.
---
Yeah locking out these no lifers from the only thing they care about for 1 month is a death blow for them
---
Pokémon gotta catch em all!
---
the healers you're with must not be that good if they're constantly going oom in the middle of pulls, or the tank is a chain pulling 'tard
---
I do it to piss off my tank (irl buddy). 1 multi-shot usually gives me aggro on 3 mins then I run around with Cheetah so he has a hard time catching up.
---
I’m a horrible DPS friend and I love it.
---
Imagine that sweet spot between being a truck driver and losing your job to automation. Where you basically let the truck drive but have to be there (in the truck) to monitor stuff. Thatll be the glory days.

Maybe these "bounties" could only be posted in Local Defense chat?
---

However did you get that thing unstuck from your  ass after sitting on it?

Very cool

Yes because I dont want to have a 2 min downtime after each two mobs.
---
His insta is great. What a guy that Rodman is.
---
Haha, our parents probably said the same thing when they read things like LMAO and ROFL, shit changes but really it stays the same. We're just getting old.
---
This is not true at all.  There is a penalty in your effective spell coefficient for down ranking your spells i believe wowhead states the formula as  
---
(\[Level of next rank\] + 4) / \[Character Level\] \* \[Spell Coefficient\] = \[Downranking Coefficient\]  
---
this is done to prevent exactly what you're saying.  It would make every rank past rank 1 pointless once you get any reasonable amount of gear
---
No punishment is too harsh in this scenario.
---
Those scoundrels dare help you...
---
TRAITORS ILL SAY IT
---
Most items dropped by those duped bosses were solubond anyway, so we are talking about proffesion materials mostly and occasional BoE. Buyer couldn't destinguish slightly cheaper got from layering abuse from thouse that flood market with increase of lvl 60 population. This isn't buying of stolen account when users know they violate ToS.
---
Hello there.
---
Dude I saw like 4 people say this today what have you done
---
Ban worthy then and ban worthy now.
---
But why I really love this video is the background music and the comments from 11+ years ago
---
It is an illegal exploit. If an NPC can not path to their position or a player can not get to them without performing some sort of exploit themselves such as wall jumping,clipping, etc, it is considered an exploit of the games mechanics and violates the Terms of Use and they can be temp banned.
---
If it is becoming this problematic for everyone, just submit a GM ticket and they can make the decision.
---
Hey guys, what's up? It's your boy, AsmonCold.
---
All exploitation should be actioned.
---
That’s my server and those are my boys!
---
Absolute madlad
---
&gt;I wasn't doing it for the thanks
---
&gt;Complains on reddit about not getting thanked
---
Of course I don't understand that idea it is completely opposing!!!
---
You are literally saying:
---
People should stop complaining about faction balance servers because Blizzard has offered a solution that does nothing about faction imbalance.
---
YOU don't know what to say? Lol!
---
What’s the add on on the right side of the screen next to the action bars?
---
Had a druid who was fishing right there next to the mob, so I emote begged and /followme then pointed towards her. He understood immediately and jumped right in, /cheering me as we conquered her and her grandpa. Classic has so many great moments you make with friends and enemies alike.
---
All of Stone talon is a shithole
---
Still exploitation.
---
It's perfectly doable to do deadmines as holy before 20, your main heal is perfectly fine.
---
Let the tank get a little below half health, then fire off 1-2 heals to get them back aboe half. Don't need to keep them tip topped up all the time. When not healing, you can add a bit of damage by just walking up and doign basic attacks with Seal of Riteousness on.
---
Make sure you keep blessing of wisdom on yourself and other casters, and might on warriors/rogues. Don't bubble the tank unless absolutely necessary (as they immediately lose all threat, and if they're a warrior they'll lose rage generaton) save it for other people.
---
And most importantly, in DM after every boss a patrol spawns behind you. Backtrack as a group and kill that, because it makes a big mess when they show up midway through a pull.
---
Chinese speaking doesn't mean they actually are Chinese they could very well and are most likely american. Also NA realms are not called US realms but NA realms. Racist and ignorant. Looks like you got a pretty good combo up your neck.

Wow babbies not knowing who the Warcraft OGs are smh
---
"Why is it so hard to find a tank?"
---
DPS that do dumb shit and make the tank's life unreasonably hard.  I've already ported out of two groups where I tried to explain everything in this thread.  Most of the time the DPS is new and just didn't know.  When they're not and insult me and keep going I find a new group. 
---
Life is too short, and tank spots are too plentiful to put up with the lvl 25 mage that insists on frost bolting a boss while the healer is at 10% mana and you're dealing with his last pack.
---
Yeah I definitely wont be doing that anymore, I had no idea :x
---
Ok thank you a lot
---
or just use /me #thingyouwanttodo

Beyce managed to grab the hunter bag on that quest.
---
Protip, didn't know. Thanks!
---
I'm a level 60 mage, 5 level 40s running around STV stand absolutely no chance.
---
Done this before, not gonna lie!
---
So basically you clear to a boss in the dungeon.  You kill the boss normally.  Then you go to a safe spot (no trash) and have someone invite you from a different layer.  Then the boss respawns like it would if you changed layer outside.  The bug has been fixed.

FIX THIS SHIT
---
Lots of people who abused dungeon farming interact with my toon. It has had massive affects on my own enjoyment.
---
Actually you hit some walls from level to level, but in the end you always find a new zone where you can do 1-2 levels.
---
I've not grinded levels by now (I'm 43).
---
I've had maybe 2-3 levels of rested play. Maybe that helped a bit.
---
I'm close to finish stv and will start with tanaris/feralas/hinterlands soon.
---
I've been running up and down the eastern coastline in Tanaris farming all the fishing pools.  
---
You will find about an equal mixture of Firefin Snapper, Oily Blackmouth, Stonescale Eel fishing pools and Floating Wreckage.  
---
The Stonescale Eels sell for about 50 silver each on my server, and when fishing the Floating Wreckage you will recieve Mithril Trunks which will give you each some silver, random BOE greens and a few Mageweave/Runecloth Bolts, Heavy/Rugged Leather and Greater Healing/Mana potions which are all worth good money.
---

---
Have you done Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands - that's enough off the beaten track to not be overly populated, there's several quests and it's level appropriate. Hope your experience improves soon!
---
I give you gold in retail, you give me gold in classic. Voila!
---
Why should he? If you think that example is the same as the issue of exploiting layering in instances, you are letting your hate for Asmon blind you tbh.
---
Can someone explain to me what "Layering" is?
---
Blizzard are you going to do anything about the recipes that are flooding the market or are we just shit out of luck ?
---
You do know I have 2 bar sets right
---
how else do you think people are supposed to recruit for guilds?
---
Send me the post explaining this exploit in instances from before release.
---
Same model tho, isn’t it? 
---
I have seen posts about stitches on here before, so I pretty much shat my pants when I saw him at the undead starter zone.
---
Not swapping between versions. It's like this:
---
Bob gives Steve 500g gold on Classic.
---
Steve gives Bob 200000g on retail, which Bob probably then uses to buy a month's subscription.
---
I don't think it's bannable, just un-supported. So if somebody screws you over Blizzard is not going to help you.
---
What would replace truckers?
---
Laughs in mage AND cooking
---
I was told that the racial spec is equivalent to something like 3% hit which is nuts to me. Not sure how accurate that is but it is basically like you are one level higher in terms of weapon skill since they increase +5 max every ding.
---
I downloaded the AH suite but haven’t got around to exploring anything. Does this one contain the vendor mod?
---
I mean yeah.
---
Ally has an advantage in aoe farm leveling which first 60 used to win.
---
And the guild that got worldfirst rag and onyxia(if you get world first rag, onyxia is basically guarenteed too), happened to be ally. It's hardly proof of anything although I'm sure ally will win every world first even then.
---
Didn't Jokerd do it in 3 days 7 hours /played... which was four days of real time?
---
That’s the great thing about classic. All the raids are so well mapped out and theorycrafted that there’s gonna be much more opportunity for non-traditional raid compositions and fun play styles that weren’t even considered back in vanilla.
---
I think you are being incredibly alarmist and its not necessary tbh. 
---
If someone wasn't aware of any wrongdoing then their time spent and efforts to buy the thing is still legit. 
---
So if you and I both bought a BoE pattern from the AH, same price. Yours dropped legit. Mine was exploited. Which one we bought was completely random. Its not remotely fair that mine gets stripped and yours doesn't. That recipe price was the same for both of us and everybody else. We put in the same effort to afford the recipe and then craft our item. It doesn't negatively effect much at all that some recipes became a bit cheaper. 
---
People are really being silly here and blowing this all out of proportion.
---
&gt; pray it's better
---
It is. We have data for this. 
---
&gt; Running in circles
---
I've restated my point in practically every response to your comments. There has been no deviation from my original idea: you cannot control Blizzard's servers, but you can control your own experience, and have a tool through which to accomplish this. My concern is not with the high-pop servers. I can't solve that, no one can. You can however take responsibility for your own time and make a move. 
---
&gt; Clearly articulate
---
Already have. Are you arguing for the sake of arguing? 
---
&gt; People are complaining about faction balance in their realm. This is something beyond their control, however their characters are well within it, especially on servers with high population that have been afforded free transfers. The post I've linked discussed Stalagg. That is one such server.
---
What else do you need to read to understand my point? You control where and when you play. If you play on an imbalanced server, you have the ability to move character. 
---
&gt; Alleviate faction imbalance
---
Here's a critical piece in my OP
---
&gt;  What I want to understand the most is, why? You have the data. Census counts showed the absurdly disproportionate faction populations of major servers like Stalagg, or Skeram, or Westfall (albeit Westfall is PVE). You have all the tools necessary to make an informed decision. This company is losing money to help you have a better time. 
---
You have the information necessary to know what realms are not completely lopsided, using Stalagg as our reliable example. Faction imbalance isn't a problem, the problem is that no one wants to change their habits or adapt to the situation. You can go onto Earthfury, again, with 54.9% Horde lean, a realm that is *well* within acceptable faction disparity, and Blizzard has given you the tool to do this for free. 
---
This is indeed a solution because A) I highly doubt that the population of Earthfury (I use it as an example frequently, but really let's say any transferable realm with similar faction stats) will ever experience the magnitude of imbalance found on our venerable example of Stalagg.
---
B) I doubt the amount of players necessary to cause that imbalance will populate transfer servers in such disproportionate sums since census information is now available. People who are sensitive to this issue will probably Google for information to make an informed decision, thus creating a self-correcting course.
---
C) The people making threads, like the one I link in OP, are exactly the types who Google this stuff, and thus would be critical balancers in realm migrations.
---
To re-state my point, as I've done now more than a dozen times, I don't understand why we have conversations about fixing server pops that are damaged beyond repair when players have the information available to make a transfer to less populated, better balanced servers, and will continue to be able to make educated calls on where they play.
---
Nope, I don’t have any bag add ons. I wish that was the case! Haha
---
That’s a nice setup for a truck I used to have a setup like that when I was cross country now I hav epochal rout and home every night to play
---
i mean they'd be starting a new toon at level 1, so good enough for me
---
Fixed, thanks.
---
Sapeee
---
I would start off with TukUI, Leatrix &amp; Leatrix Maps and Titan Panel. I'll post up a screenshot of my UI when I get back to my PC
---
I don't understand why so many people find joy in this. Blizzard is once again shattering the community with its *indispensable layering system. This whole shitshow is Blizzard's own fault. It was their choice to implement the most controversial feature of Classic.
---
By definition layering splits community and was never part of vanilla, a game that revolves around community. Many problems were known and bound to happen. Nevertheless, Blizzard decided to include it in Classic.
---
Now they see the aftermath and decide to tag players as cheaters because they tried to optimize this modified version of vanilla by playing Blizzard's layering game. What does that create? A mob of players grabbing torches and pitchforks against their own community.
---
Please turn your hatred toward the real culprit: LAYERING.
---
Not in STVeitnam 
---
i fight ally there not trolls, its a shitshow
---
You can say prostitution does good things for people involved too couldn't you? Confidence boosting, experiencing something they potentially could not otherwise in real life. Asides from the customer enjoying the sex that is.

I occasionally just hand out some of my spare blacksmithing items to people who have significantly worse items or nothing equipped in the slot. And as a lock, I murder a bunch of mobs for shards and hand out healthstones to people. Be the change you want to see in the community people.
---
I think the best solution is to remove Gnomes. The reasoning behind this is simple: No one wants to be on the faction with those stinky shorties and their gibbergabber and their MY YOUR A TALL ONE.
---
Gah all of horde is so ugly idk how people play them

This makes me wanna play Alliance 🙀 but worse than that it also makes me wanna play classic 🙀😂

Being genuine and actually typing out things rather then a copy paste when initiating a conversation with someone who is not responding to your guild spam goes a long way in my book. When things start off so impersonal with a guild i dont even consider joining.
---
I accepted a ginvite just to get rid of these messages, and instantly regretted it when the guild leader started getting really social.
---
Like no dude, you do not need to know my age and where i live, i hardly fucking know you.

Are there any heirloom-ish items i could potentially buy for leveling an alt?

I bought a few low level greens but thats about it
---
Shift Z is an awful hotkey imo breaks my fingers
---
I believe if you go into esc &gt; interface &gt; social there is an option to disable channel invites. You want that one, because they're inviting you to a gold selling chat channel.
---
Stormwind Vanilla, Arthas TBC.  Yeah, it sucked.  
---
I love the populated server, but if you are a working adult, you pretty much have to remote by 4:30 central.  I've found that is the perfect time to drive home, get the kids, send them out to play with friends and play for a bit.
---
That’s not how currency exchange works, the easier gold is to get in retail, the harder it is to exchange retail gold for classic gold. It literally cannot devalue gold earning in classic, because the latter is much harder to do and the former does not produce gold in classic, (or in retail) which is the only way it could devalue classics gold value. This is like saying that being able to trade British pounds for US dollars devalues the means of earning US dollars, which I hope you realise sounds silly as hell. Unless there is something you can explain that can correct this discrepancy.
---
Yeah...what you're describing is not at all what's happening in the exploit. People are dropping group and layering into someone else's to skip most of the dungeon and kill a boss that respawned in front of them.
---
Great work sitting in one place getting insane xp.
---
haha our guild in wrath was called &lt;B n W Gaming&gt;, guess what the B and W stood for
---
As a warlock. If I pull Afro while hellfiring and the mobs aren’t getting novad cause of RESIST. I HAVE to run. Or else I die. Getting hit by 6 mobs after losing half my health to hellfire means unless the healer does a quick high level heal I am dead if I don’t kite. And if the healer doesn’t bubble me when I start hellfiring or before after seeing how I aoe and what it does Or after I ask for one for hellfire I don’t have faith they can keep me up.
---
This is requiem.
---
Would this cause any issues with your imp constantly swapping targets? Unless you don't dot multiple enemies typically
---
One mob dead is one kill less.
---
Questie,atlasloot.  Titanpanel is pretty nice to have aswell.Also for dungeoning recount and deadlybossmod are nice to have.
---
Gadget was entirely overrun because every alliance character had been killed by the group on the arena. (Focus your attention on the skeletons).
---
WPvP may be unbalanced sometimes, but (generally) not because of exploited game mechanics. In this case the use of the Gadget guards is what makes it different. The tactic isn't just unfair to one faction, it makes it impossible for them. I don't care if I'm on the losing side of a battle so long as I have the chance to fight back, you know what I mean?
---
You can't restore a character if a different character with the same name is currently available on your account.  
---
Examples:  
---
If you have a character named Abc, delete him, create a new character named Abc and try to restore the one you deleted, you won't be able to.  
---
If you have a character named Abc, delete him, then while he is deleted someone takes your name, you will be able to restore the character and will be forced to change your name.
---
wait, you dont wait until theyre at half health and hit them with a frost shock like me? weird.
---
No alliance? hrmm
---
I farmed the Hydrocane staff (underwater breathing) from Gnomeregan earlier just for this purpose, now it’s one of my favourite items in the game. 
---
It has helped me immensely in other quests as well as PvP :D

---
&gt; i created /world and thus i am the original owner
---

---
/world is world. It's for everyone and it's no one's.
---
Just because you were around early and was the first to make the channel doesn't give you any rights.
---
People join world to talk to world. They don't know who made it or who's moderating it. And they don't care. It's a public space. No one asked you or anyone to moderate the channel. And no one will appreciate your efforts if you do.
---
I use ElvUI and Luna mixed and have something fairly similar :) 
---
If you can't be assed with Elv you can also use dominos for the actions bars instead.
---
You just proved my point, Paladin on his own is easily avoidable. You need another class to be able to show some threat to the hordes.
---
What if they are a frostmage that can kite a lot of mobs indefinitely without taking damage?
---
Never been in queue before ;)
---
I use the VendorPrice mod. Not sure which website is best for getting classic mods, but it's convenient.

---
^ this
---
IMO, it boils down to that and the fact that it is taking people time to actually level.  Sure there are people already clearing MC, but I would wager that the vast bulk of people are in their mid 40s to mid 50s.
---
Then we get alts.  This isn't logging in to do your dailies and afk until raid night.  This will take a few more months.
---
Would you advice to stay away from people from this guild in other servers too? I think I saw them in Ashbringer.
---
Mine probably is biased as well. I never hang out on toxic streams. Most people I talk to are on my server, also play classic, on a mutual discord, or in general pretty chill people.
---
Most people who post here play alliance
---
Are all the horde players just busy playing?
---
&gt; But you know what I like the fact that I can grind and feel like I accomplished something in the hour or two I have in free time.
---
It's funny, but no matter how much time I spent in Legion I never felt like I accomplished anything.  The next day would demand the same dailies to be done again, the next update was always looming to replace the gear that I had managed to acquire, the whole story was available to play through in LFR, etc.
---
Whereas in Classic I might only have time for one dungeon or a few quests, but that's progress toward a level.  And each level gained in that way feels meaningful because it required effort, it provides a more permanent benefit to my character, and it progresses me toward very long term goals of success in raids and BGs.
---
It's fine for you to like Retail better than Classic, but it's also ironic that we feel the opposite way about them, so you're definitely *not* saying "what we are all thinking".
---
If you enjoy Retail, play it!
---
Pretty sure that was a Murphstar off the Panther.
---
Don’t leavveeeee
---
I think you might be able to adjust your chat channel (guild chat) settings to add in..I think it's system messages? Something like that. One of those chat settings will move that to the channel of your choosing.
---
IMO it also encompasses taking a smoke break, stretching, getting water, etc..
---
I fuck love these kinds of edits
---
I fookin love Yojamba!
---
Well. You two seem to be grouped so I would say that it makes sense that he would follow you?
---
You can weave melee between wand depending on weapon and wand speed, outside of that just get highest dps.
---
Twitch chat is just a cesspool of followers with zero personality or originality so when they see something that gets laughs or seems popular they just copy that thing over and over and over again.
---
Need pertains to the CURRENT character you are using the moment you roll on it.  It isn't for your other toon, money for a mount, ect.  It is FOR YOUR CURRENT character and only needed if it is a direct upgrade NOW in the dungeon.  
---
Otherwise, ask the group if you can need before needing. 
---
With your mentality I could need something because my hunter needs it even though I'm a warlock running the dungeon.
---
And send toxics there too.
---
Nope. Get fucked.
---
Enforced balance could work, but probably only from the server's inception, otherwise you're going to get a lot more saltier players than what we're seeing on this sub. It'd probably be a good idea. 
---
Im not entirely sure, but I doubt it'd shift too hard. Most people seem to not want to transfer, so you're probably only going to get people who are having a sour enough experience to want to leave their current realm. I suspect the majority of those people would be alliance people from horde-favoring servers, and a proportionately smaller group of horde players looking for a PVP server with more competition. I only say this because the data to plan an educated move is now available. The invisible hand of faction balance, I guess?
---
Blizzard isn't the police, they do what they want, whenever the what.
---
This is true, I would recommend just binding a /petattack macro to like z or something easy and just hitting right before dropping your DoTs.
---
Same, I’m struggling right there with them so any help is help I’ll take too lol
---
We're all born with a butthole. 
---
I remember the day I discovered mine. Had to buy a second plunger.
---
What are you talking about? I see plenty of PVP in STV
---
People love PvP servers until they’re the gankee and not the ganker.
---
Yea, I know, im lvl 50 atm, was just asking for heirloom-ish items for an alt.
---
As in, items that could boost my character and make leveling significantly easier
---
a "highlight" of killing a warlock who is so terrible he doesn't sac his void isn't much of a highlight
---
Yeah fuck em up
---
Guess it depends on your server, but those charms are not cheap. Being able to afford them all at lvl 30, especially if you're saving up for a mount, isn't easy.
---
I don’t understand why people keep asking this? It’s not a problem in any way, shape or form?
---
All it does is moving gold from one player to another, literally the same thing as if someone would gift another money, or buy it with real world currency. 
---
People seem to think this somehow adds gold into the Classic circulation??? 
---
Who cares????????????
---
This is some major BS right here, if it were me I would've melted this night elf's face to the ground.
---
Always was!
---
And when an alliance is just taking your mobs you can't do anything about it! You can be right on top of each other and be completely safe! It's so terrible I can't take it. I'd rather be corpse camped any day than not have a hope in the world of being able to cotpse camp someone else.

Lol, ther streamer I watched this morning was whining. "Streamers ate the LAST people devs tell the rules to"
---
Bitch, you expect a phone call from Blizzard? Listen to your chat when they're telling you you're cheating
---
I think you're in for a rude awakening... a LOT of these images have played mage since actual vanilla.
---
How?
---
Nice! I just dropped almost 1 gold training mind control so I can buff Horde. Hoping my emote game is on point so they realize I'm being friendly.
---
Can't remember the macros anymore but there's a really good post on the nost forums with a guide to hunter macros.
---
Something I found really useful were 'combo macros' that combined ranged any melee abilities into one keypress.
---
I had a "Damage Button macro" that combo'd autoshot, arcane shot, melee autoattack, raptor strike, and all the melee damaging skills, and also made it so you can't toggle off autoshoot &amp; you automatically switch to melee when the targets too close. Also a CC button that would Concussive Shot at ranged and Wing Clip &amp; Raptor Strike at melee. 
---
Also took a macro from there that combo'd Viper's String &amp; Scorpid Sting and would use one or the other depending on if the target had mana or not. 
---
Overall they really helped cut down on Hunter hotkey bloat and made them so much more fluid to play - it's so fun when you get a low HP melee guy who thinks they've finally got you in melee and you get a Raptor Strike crit to his face and finish him off.
---
I've never liked the whole "xpac gimmick" thing they do and making the gimmick core to classes was a moronic mistake when class design and balance is one of the things games struggle with constantly without regular overhauls Blizzard seem to like to do to at least one or two classes every expansion. Deciding to try to it to every single class twice in a row was a monumental undertaking they didn't think through at all.
---
Am I going to be banned for hopping layers a couple times for iron fuck
---
I'm trying to get to 60 as fast as possible only to help my guildies quest and do dungeons while they level. Then I'll start alts.
---
I'm having a blast helping lower level players out. I play a druid so I just run around playing all the roles, popping in and out of different forms. Dungeons are a blast!
---
yeah tons of models are reused and rescaled or recolored for different purposes.
---
Agility makes for higher dps. In WoW preventing damage often comes down to killing faster. After Agi is Str.
---
Where is the advantage in AoE farm?
---
&gt; I've ground SM for everything it's worth and gotten every noteworthy caster item, so I can't go there.
---
That's still my advice anyway.  SM Cath is great for gold, exp, and delicious herbs.
---
2 handed. Dual wielding has a high hit penalty so you will miss too much.
---
Team Raid Tactics
---
Or they're just background noise/radio for people who don't want to listen to actual tv/radio ?  
---
I don't understand people analyzing streaming like it's some huge psychological thing. It's just people watching/listening to others while doing their own thing, similar to Netflix.  
---
***No-one*** actually watches streams exclusively on their main monitor, unless there's a big event like a tournament.
---
As a level 30 warrior who just got this quest, all my buddies are telling me I need to finish the quest ASAP for it. Is it much better than the blue burning war axe(I think that's what it is called)?
---
Goblin news:
---
Nazz Steamboil, the best racer in Azeroth, was found by repair crew after two days of search.  Our reporter took an interview with him:
---
"If Razzeric did not put friggin\` Seaforium Booster, that caused the crash, I would won that race for sure! But the flight before the crash was awesome! This technology has a future! After the crash I was hanging on a rock for two days, hungry, thirsty &amp; bored. On a second day I saw an Alliance guy looking at me from the ground. I cried him to help me, because  it\`s a sport, we should help each other in trouble. And do you know, what did he do? A selfie! Then he just walked away. I was shocked!"
---
What streamers exploited instance layering apart from esfand who tickets blizzard and asked if it was ok to recleqr after they zoned in on a new layer the next day?
---
Stv is like one of the purge movies
---
So I dropped out for a while, why’s her hair white now?
---
It’s what makes vanilla so much better than the other expansions.
---
When you need best Halloween mask in game...
---
"core of gamers that have played together through multiple games and server with naxx experience"
---
Also keep in mind it's not always the first cast. If you use macros with modifier keys, it will show the first spell who's modifier is held. So you can see what's currently going to be casted depending on what you hold.
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [modifier:shift] Rejuvenation
---
/cast Healing Touch
---
Icon will show healing touch when nothing is held and rejuv if you hold shift
---
As a druid, i carry two sets of gear at all times. Resto or Feral. I also gotta carry maple seeds for revives
---
&gt;t exactly are “layering exploits”?
---
blizz needs to compansate med 10k gold for cleaver use of not exploiting the game
---
What? No one is upset about layering. We are upset that its being abused in a way that gives those who exploit it an unfair advantage.
---
Your argument is so poor... how did you even come to that conclusion?
---
Dumb detected.
---
My preference is for getting NS and Insect Swarm for PvP. The fact that those 21 points are helpful in PvE is secondary. 😉
---
Now I agree it’s wrong and an exploit but if blizzard makes a maze and says get thru it and at the end you find a door with goodies behind it you can have them . But when you shut the door and reopen it . The goodies are back . How fair is it to permanently ban people who keep reopening the door . All I’m saying is there is blame on blizzard for sure .
---
I actually really really enjoy AoE farming, it's one of my best memories in the game and one of the reasons I was looking forward to classic so much. To each their own I guess.
---
I might actually die laughing if someone says “this is not classic” after being banned for abusing an exploit that was not in classic
---
What? Didn't understand that. So he got banned?
---
Oh, that's a good idea! I was planning on waiting until I'm at least 45 to make alts but this will be a great way to kind of passive level alts.
---
Shammy rez is an hour cooldown and literally costs them money to do though. Different animal imo.
---
I know you’re memeing, but while leveling, you use hunters mark, serpent sting, immolation trap, and auto shot on every pull.
---
The worst offenders should get characters transferred to retail
---
At 60 it still hits harder than fireball, and hits for the same as pyroblast.
---
Of course the bigger point is that it lacks the DoT of Pyroblast, but that's presumably made up for by the fact that for most locks it will be hitting with 200% crit damage rather than the mage's 150% (thus, all the soul fire crit montages).
---
I work second shift so I don't notice it during the week. It's hard to complain too much because I love seeing all the people around.
---
When I asked in a support ticket, I was directed to this: [Trading Gold Between Realms or Factions
---
](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/000029162)
---
Sulfarus! It’s been brutal 20+ but its so much fun. If you’re on horde ill invite you to my guild, if not good luck.
---
I, as somebody who played warrior, got frustrated and created a hunter can only say, its really fun to solo elites. If the mob isn't ranged you can kill anything
---
You're a legend
---
Well apparently blizzard agrees with me and gave 1 month bans
---
That’s fucked up. Especially because they don’t drop yet.
---
What if all PvP realms become this way? the overall faction is skewed toward horde. alliance are pve carebears and horde have clearly superior pvp racials
---
I professed unending love to the player who gifted my priest a greater wand.
---
Found the non rogues!
---
I usually hand out all the bags I make for leveling tailoring and every single time I've been told thanks. I had always heard how good the wow community was but until I played I never realized how cool most of the people are.
---
&gt; Blizzard: "We have hours of chat logs from you specifically requesting groups to be moved to different layers, you stayed this exact area for 4 hours moving from group to group"
---
hahahahaha
---
Hunters can get in no matter what if you can use eyes of the beast correctly. Maybe not as amazing as a warlock, but you can definitely still find AoE grind groups. 2 mage and lock or hunter is meta.
---
I'm playing both casually , more classic tho. Mostly just on retail to finish my last 4 120s so I don't have to crunch prior to next expac. No need to overanalyze one vs the other. Despite what this sub will tell you, ya don't have to pick a side.
---
Yes, but /castsequence should be used very carefully because you can easily trip over yourself with it. A better macro would be-
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [stance:3] Track Humanoids
---
    /cast Cat Form
---
That should be pretty foolproof, however you would need a separate keybind to take you *out* of Cat form.
---
That's personal preference. I open world PvP a lot and change forms a good bit, so it's nice for me.
---
Ugh no.  Check in. I hate it when a group tries to go 5% faster because I have mana at the end of an easy pull.  One extra add and it’s a wipe.
---
Nope. What's being discussed is layering. The equivalent  scenario would be seller and you standing at Princess, layering, she respawn and you re-kill her on the spot.
---
Oh an Yeah. Its 5% Crit on that axe through specialization and 41 more max dmg on that sword
---
I used to do this with Arcane Crystals. They were twice the price on Horde side because there was a 5:1 faction imbalance on my server, so I would buy them up on Alliance side for 10-15g, use the neutral AH to xfer them to horde side, resell them for 30g there. Funded a couple alts epic mounts that way.
---
DUDE, AS A HUNTER ON THALNOS (sa server) , i can  100% say that you forgot the /train or /spit (for ally) on the macro....
---
Inv
---
Something could be done but it wouldn't be #nochanges
---
Just make WotF not break fear and you would see the ratio even up
---
If i had to go with a macro (which i did for a while) i would prefer
---
\#showtooltip
---
/petattack [mod:shift]
---
/cast spell
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
This way the pet only attacks if i hold shift while casting the spell to get around my pet hopping targets.
---
Though i have since taken the petattack out of all macros and bound it to mousewheel up and pet follow to mousewheel down. Gives you a lot of comfortable control about your pet
---
ayo i was debating on playing but i gotta do it, at least try it for the nostalgie bomb of being in middle school and starting wow.
---
what's a good US horde PvP realm to play on with good population for raiding? i've heard faerlina is a big server but i think that's alliance
---
That was boring to watch... Killing underleveled people.
---
I can’t imagine not thinking you potentially be doing something wrong though.
---
Most powerful class in the game? You're thinking of the other W class
---
age and stress i think
---
Fun fact, if you have an item by the same name, /use will prioritize the item and not the spell.
---
I just want to say how good this community is. Coming here from osrs I was expecting much more toxic behavior but so far everyone is helping out and being friendly
---
This is exactly how Warmode is in BfA.
---
I was looking for some horde to help me, not a single one did. Then I saw 3 alliance kill it. I've helped them and tried to communicate via emotes. I've pointed on the questgiver etc. and it worked!
---
Weird this alliance scum was more helpful than my mighty horde! 😄
---
i prefer using wordpad lmao
---
Looks like this podracing in the desert thing was inspired by Star Wars?
---
one thing I realised leveling my lock: wand is the greatest investment you can do. always keep it as high level as possible, even buying from ah. wand dps&gt;sb spam
---
People on the opposite (and my own) faction hit 60 faster than me due to abusing dungeon farming, this allowed them to do MC 1 week before me getting more gear, and finish the dungeon grind faster than me, thus being having time to farm black lotus and devilsaurs before I even hit 60. This means I now have a stupidly hard time farming devilsaurs with a 19g price fix, and people who abused dungeon farming have thousands of gold and can use consumables in every pvp fight. 
---
All that because they sat in dungeons instead of quested like I did.
---
Whelplayed
---
Damage is how you get rage for sunder.
---
Give alliance blood elves. That'll balance things out. And I'll finally be able to slaughter them to my hearts content. I hate them so much. They ruined the horde.
---
I mean I left when I got to 60, don't know how long the rest kept going.
---
Christ dude, they banned Preach when he exploited the XP potion thing.
---
I play classic without talking to anyone.
---
did people get a ban when someone ninja looted in original vanilla?
---
I understand you guys are venting your frustrations but the type of people who do this in dungeons aren’t the type to be reading this thread in the first place.
---
Fucking take my silver!
---
Spooktober begins now
---
Obviously, they would be refunded their gold.
---
Wipe your IP
---
Human is min-max though lmao
---
I agree! I love helping out lower level players. When I first started leveling my druid so many random people would give me bags, gear, and assistance. It was great! Now that I'm higher level and have more resources I'm able to pay it forward. It's very inspiring, for me at least.
---
those cases were not intentional and at least esfand contracted blizzard and was allowed by GM's to continue to play. 
---
So no, they did not get banned because they are not stupid like that.
---
Sounded like Open Battle.net from D2 at the beginning there.
---
You can read through the text window and it says tiger.
---
We never mind more races
---
I went down from like 300 to 230fps using elvui due to showing to many models on screen
---
so did any big streamers use this exploit ?
---
Orc is the best for PVP. Stun resist is too good. Blood fury for a dps cooldown. Axe spec, you’re going to hit more often. 
---
Undead has nothing dps wise. Cannibalize is ok, but I would never pick undead warrior just to have cannibalize. 
---
Tauren has nothing dps wise, but if you want to tank they have 5% more health.
---
Troll racials really benefit casters.
---
First thing, get auctioneer addon and scan the shit out of the AH for a few days to get an idea of price fluctuations and what a good base price is. 
---
One of the biggest issues with the AH is common crafting items have 8+pages and the AH doesn't sort properly in classic, so the only way to be sure you are setting a competitive price is to go through them all manually if you don't have an addon keeping track. 
---
Second thing, and this is a big one: don't be greedy. Undercut the competition by 5-10% and your stuff will sell almost instantly.
---
You can use shift + leftclick on the map to hide specific quests. But it would be great if you could still report bugged quests to our issue tracker https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/issues
---
"Menance". Yeah that totally ruined the immersion for me.
---
get gud might be a new one for wow classic, but it's still within context lol
---
World of Warsouls, certainly feels like that sometimes, at least I don't loose all my gold on death, thats a frightening thought
---
Absolute Unit
---
Why would you play on a med pop server at peak hours? When people quit those medium ones will be low and our full servers will be medium, right?
---
They did the alliance speed run last week. They structure it so people can only play 1 race per speed run so its more "fair".
---
Modified ElvUI.
---
"As a result of this investigation" in the mail the OP got. I wish it would also be more, but blizzards wording is like this:
---
"Hey you got flagged and we investigated you, while you were not banned - here is your ban now, based on whatever the hell you were doing"
---
You’re on the watchlist buddy
---
*Damn it feels good to be a gangsta*
---
It shouldn't is what everyone is trying to get across, there are plenty of videos of vanilla pvp to back that up. You should be able to fd and drop a trap on the move without pausing and waiting half a second between the feign and the trap.
---
This is a silly generalization. All kinds of people play on pvp servers and enjoy pvp.
---
I would hate to be in your guild.
---
Man is it just me or is the Classic team just fkn legendary? Like they really give a fuck.
---
I wouldn't have expected a truck driver to play a druid
---
Logging in most software clients is usually saved and sent in batches to address that very issue.
---
Yes we're greateful for every bug report on our issue tracker https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/issues
---
I think a month is pretty harsh. I have been playing since release (not alot) but am only lvl 24 now. 
---
If I got banned for a month, I am not sure if I'd come back. 
---
Friends of mine are lvl 40+ and said the same
---
I think it's a good statement
---
thats better than the assholes who send you an invite first then a canned message after you decline.
---
I can’t count how many times I’ve pulled a pack of 4-6 mobs and gotten exactly 1 Swipe off before some mage can’t keep his giant dick in his big boi pants anymore and just starts spamming AE in the middle of them. 
---
“I thought druid tanks did really good threat”

SKINNER

Teach us your ways
---
Dude so fire! Ever pass the Chicago area?! I’d love to see the setup/LAN with you.
---
PS- the Naga wireless makes me sad. Also props for the 60%. AP2?
---
It’s so satisfying. I remember one guy talking in general with some obscene name. Reported him and only a few minutes later “who the fuck reported my name” 
---
I’m sure I wasn’t the only one but it was satisfying to see. 
---
Pick a name not some dumb rude joke. Not that hard. I don’t want to be calling out on comms for someone to heal dildo Baggins.
---
With the release of 4.1 we've added a color system to give every quest unqiue colors. Check out the config to activate it!
---
The 30k toons part:
---
People started gathering data with the wow census addon which /whos everyone. The data is then processed and filtered to represent the numbers. (ignoring &lt; lvl 5 characters for example)
---
3000 players online:
---
Blizzard stated that a value around 2500-3500 was their max healthy concurrent playercount for a realm. The world &amp; resources were designed around this number.
---
Yeah people have gone fucking ridiculous here. I really don't understand it. 
---
Its like they've convinced themselves that this has somehow ruined the entire game and have now extended the particular exploit in question to include any other behaviour they can realistically brand an "exploit" and call for permanent bans on as many people as possible...... 
---
Anybody not completely losing their shit is apparently a "streamer buttboy".
---
Its ridiculous overcompensation where they have drummed themselves up in to this idea that they would be able to "compete" (even though I'm really not sure what competing even means at this point with no honor to play for and all content in the game already cleared easily), if it weren't for all these cheaters, then they call for blood. 
---
As far as streamers go? Standard stuff. Just people incredibly jealous that they make a lot of money playing video games 12 hours a day while their jobless ass does not and they would just love to tear them down and soak up the juicy drama of them getting banned. If they don't get banned, of course its preferential treatment from Blizzard. 
---
All of the tantrums in this post can basically be boiled down to grown ass adults childishly going "wahhhh, its unfaiiiiiiiiiiiir" and demanding maximum consequences for any and all perceived slights against them.
---
noob here, would you care to explain pls. which dungeon is this and what is the lowest level to start it as aoe group?
---
You can also now right click report them. Before channel invites didn't have the name clickable. They patched it in just to make it easier to report them
---
Another Friendly reminder if you don't have a Threat Addon as a tank I can't tell if I'm going to pull aggro so I'm going to go ham until that occurs.
---
Idk. Bleumeaux has a lot of Trumpetting at all hours
---
Maybe a week, when people's 1 month of sub they bought to check out the game runs out.
---
So it wasn't broken back then?? :D
---
With the technology of now, you are greatly overestimating the amount of data that would require. Every single things you’ve done on classic since it launched is less than 20MB. That’s a pittance when we can easily and cheaply store hundreds of terabytes.
---
They also plant various forms of metadata into screenshots that gives information like character name, server address, account ID. Usually for purposes of tracking down someone who took the screenshot, and also for finding out if it's an official or private server that they took the screenshot on
---
omg the guild i joined is worse than barren chat.
---
I had my troll warrior yell "COME GET DA VOODOO" everytime I taunt. People got annoyed real quick.
---
Make a new account you moron lol
---
We've added exactly this to the release yesterday. Version 4.1 had lots of great new features
---
My dungeon experience has been a whole lot of people not understanding what classes want to roll on what items... going to be real fun continuing to explain why the resto shaman is needing cloth or the fury warrior needs a leather piece.
---
Its retail stuff. Theres a reason we play Classiv
---
This is the best troll I’ve seen in a while
---
No, they didn't.  
---
Stop worrying so much about people who don't affect your life.
---
Might this be why I get question mark icons whenever I log into the game? I’ll try this out later today. Thanks!
---
Nice! Our group of pugs did the same while waiting for the dwarf captain to spawn :D
---
From what I hear “automation” but I don’t see us regulators allowing multi ton trucks being self driven. Regardless of what self driving statistics and AI statistics say. 
---
A lot of people think self driving semis will be the future and that very much can be true, but I don’t see it happening.
---
Would you take a hitch hiker if they grinded mobs for you?
---
Damn you’ll be ready for pvp when it comes around!
---
What does a layering exploit mean? What kind of things could be done?
---
I don't stress about the guild invites, but holy shit the twitch streamers infuriate me. Had one guy just spam "watch me" to everyone in the zone. Gave him some (genuinely) polite feedback that he'd get more people tuning in if he at least said something to the person before advertising.
---
I logged off shortly after, 3 days later I log back in and the instant i do, I get something along the lines of "get fucked piece of shit" - I had no memory of who the guy was until he followed it up with "oh wrong chat, sorry, anyway watch me". 
---
I'm sure he'll go far.
---
That doesn’t matter if you can’t play the game at all without multiple hour long queues during the first month though. Hell at this rate who knows how long queues will be fucked especially when you consider that they haven’t even turned off phasing yet and each new content release you’ll deal with queues. On top of that a medium pop server currently is more than what high/full classic servers had. Don’t get me wrong I’d hate to be on a dead or low pop server but it doesn’t seem worth the hassle to me.
---
They really don't store ability usage. That also wouldn't help in this scenario. What they could use for this investigation is location along with the players layer ID and if they changed layers inside a dungeon repeatedly.
---
I hate how this is a thing, people expect you to actually be prot spec for dungeons. I joined a brd as a tank then leader asked me if im specced prot, then he kicked since i said no. You can tank every dungeon in the game with any spec, hell ive seen people fury tank raids on overtuned servers
---
This is what Ultima Online used to do.
---
I got three of those in one day was bliss
---
Cubelock. Got it.
---
I think if you are completely new to wow and someone trades you a wand them you might have no idea what is going on and might not thank the person. At least that's how i like to imagine the people who don't thank you.
---
For dungeon leveling-gearing should I go Stockades or Blackfathom after DM? I am 22, should I advance to 24ish before any of those two?
---
I used to hit 3 to 5k in shattrah back in TBC. It was miserable.
---
yeah STV, and in some respects the shimmering flats in thousand needles, are pants if you want to quest, but much fun if you want a fight.
---
Don't forget the part where they then yell at you for not healing them.
---
I ended up ditching my mage at level 23 and rolling a hunter lol, mage was ok but I really love playing hunter in old wow. 57 now! Looking forward to getting Rhok'Delar!
---
Hmm... Try to focus on the good instead of the bad.
---
You have bad experiences in every game, if you always think about the bad in a game, you will talk about that over and over again...and you or another player will be frustrated. Enjoy your game, be happy about classic and try to bring as much positive vibes as possible to azeroth
---
The equivalent of ''lalala can't hear you''?
---
Kinda childish but I guess it just proves more about this Classic's community lol so thanks for that
---
I don't know if you're trolling, or you honestly think that, or which one of those two would be worse.
---
A tab targeted dot can cause this quest to fail so I don't think that's it.
---
This item does not exist in patch 1.12 used for wow classic.
---
It could also be related to the MinimapButtonBag addon which was in conflict with Questie. We've added a fix for this to the v4.1.0 we released yesterday.
---
But we're also trying to improve performance of drawing/updating the icons on our side.
---
Most people are not 60 yet. The ones that abused this is a very, very small percentage. There will be zero change to the que.
---
self driving cars is and will be the big looming threat on the horizon. Some 20 something year old getting into trucking right now will most likely be out of a job in 10 - 20 years. Which is not when retirement is.
---
Its specifically in relation to dungeons. 
---
People figured out you could kill a boss, use party invites to swap layers and the boss would respawn infront of you. Meaning you could just kill a dungeon boss over and over without having to run out, reset the instance and clear to the boss again.
---
It should be a permanent ban.
---
One word - TBC - end of story.
---
good job fulfilling the youtube requirement that at least the first 1/3 of the video be entirely devoid of interesting or useful content.
---
I mean, it is a requirement, right?
---
It sure as fuck FEELS like a requirement.
---
Well there was that one time he cheated at Mak'gora...
---
NSFL
---
If it was added in BC, I wouldn't expect it in Classic.
---
Put them on F1-F7 . Makes it easy to remember what icon is where as they are in order.
---
Yeah, cause you're entire account was banned right? Not just the character.
---
Someone else suggested permanent rez sickness. I like this.
---
I have been handing out 4x 6slot bags and lesser magic wands to level 2-7s in the starting zone.  Layering really makes it tough.
---
I use it and have had no problems at all. I did have other addons kill over and require a reboot.
---
Duskwood still has the best quests though
---
If your inventory is full it can't put it in your inventory when you win, so it stays in the corpse.  It's normal.
---
Bigglesworth really is the sweet spot. We have 20min queues during peak times and no queue at all most of the time. Hopefully the server won’t die soon, but we can also play.
---
I mean, we don't let steers train up before we grill a steak either.
---
Further the effects on the market of said goods are sort of balanced because these people who now have the gold from the goods are banned for 30 days (or more hopefully). Any gold they made is probably less than they would have made in a month of legit gameplay.
---
/r/redditsings
---
Damn, that's convenient. 
---
Iirc that flight path only passes over the western part of burning steppes, at least I didn't see anyone flying over me when I was in the eastern part (and I had Spy running), so if he landed near lava he was probably just outside blackrock mountain. 
---
If that glitch is reliably replicable it could save raiders a ton of time on repair runs. I mean, it would be a bannable exploit so probably wouldn't use it, but one thing I always disliked about flight paths was that you couldn't get off along the route.
---
Thats one fat gnome then lol
---
Your realm discord will be your best bet.
---
Inb4 banned for 6 months.
---
So, did you watch the vod linked or?
---
just about to start out, played back in the day but it's been a while
---
what's the best guide for leveling/addon? i used to just search stuff on thottbott back in hte day but im sure there's better options nowadays
---
Preeeeeetty sure classic world first was like 2 weeks ago unless some cosmic event happened
---
damn. if you've got wow also set to stereo, then i don't know. 
---
for some reason whenever i get near a coastline the ocean noises hard pan around the room, 100%  one speaker at a time. drives me bonkers. def don't remember that from vanilla.
---
Those are dwarves.
---
Omg yay!  Thank you! ♥️
---
Nah, they shouldn't get to enjoy the game at least for a little while. They need to rethink their approach to entertainment.
---
You  typed a lot and seemed very tantrum like yourself. If you don't see the negative consequences of this exploit in regards to the economy among other things you are completely naive. And to say people who dislike streamers because they're jealous is such a low hanging fruit. Great Analysis!
---
I don't understand why it's hilarious if it makes sense... Where would a druid be, if not around trees and flowers? The subway ? The Barracks ?
---
I actually did that, without thinking about it too much. Pulled a lot of mobs in BFD, tank was on low hp and didnt have aggro of all mobs, i switched to bear.
---
I love to play druid bc youre prepared for every situation basically
---
"Large, inviting staff"
---
I appreciate that you found this and shared it.
---
I am also a humongous douchebag.
---
That is all.
---
Yes, officer, this post right here.
---
damn. MvP
---
I gave out wands and level 30s starting asking for them and selling.
---
You *should* be marking one; how else do people know which one to focus on? (Assuming they're the same type and all).
---
You can't just switch when you see the others are killing another mob because a) that's too late and b) what if the *other* guys switch to *your* mob as well?
---
I know you are desperate to feel accomplished because you rolled ally but its not a new game sunshine. You also aren't any of the people you are bragging about. There are no "world firsts " on bosses that have been getting killed for almost 2 decades. 
---
Also no one cares.
---
You could do the same with a free account.
---
IIRC, this bug only works is instances that don't have a weekly lock.
---
Thats why they're talking about easy pre-raid bis items.
---
I mean it doesn't sound like a naturally replicable but. 
---
Maybe situation occurs and it happens but more than 5 times I'd say your fucked.
---
 3-5 a very harsh warning for a next offense perma.
---
1/2 maybe you let it slide and note the infraction against the account.
---
When tanking do you save stupid DPS? It feels like only in the groups that I need to mark in the first place do DPS start hammering an unmarked mob. I always attempt to pick them back up to save the healer, but it's very tempting not to.
---
I mentioned this in another comment, but I managed to fix the problem by uninstalling the Realtek High Definition Audio driver by right clicking the start button, going to device manager, and right clicking the driver under Sound, Video and Game controllers.
---
Love how I got screen shot as soon as I yelled. Just trotting over. It was tasty btw
---
The layering defenders will continue to say this until the game dies.
---
I wonder just how empty those already beforehand empty cities are right now. I can imagine it's hard as fuck finding people for dungeons in bfa
---
Plus if there are a bunch of low pop servers they will just merge them if it becomes an issue.
---
Sounds like someone's faction lost
---
lol, gold just magically appear in they bag? wym...
---
if you on there server you see them go into brs for a few hours off stream and next stream theyre rich as fuck lol not rocket science ofc 
---
but also no hard ev ofc could just be lucky as..
---
The Altar of Zul in Hinterlands has a lot of caster and axe-throwing mobs around the level 45 area. It's also a quest objective to kill them so YMMV on a populated server.
---
I don't know the answer to your last question though, sorry.
---
I did the run on my 10 warrior. Only aggrod a single orc and never died
---
Layers are like instances. You don’t think the queue decreases when you enter scarlet monastery and increases when you leave, do you?
---
You think an exploit starts the moment it goes public?
---
And from the sounds of it, selling via discord or forums would mean you have no connection to the person you are trading in game. How do they detect that, hmmm? 
---
ThEy DoNt DeLeTe TrAdEd ItEmS
---
Oh geez I'm alarmist though.
---
Why? I don't see anything wrong with it. I get these messages too, and all it takes is a "No ty :)" to deal with.
---
It should.  Statistics math gets wonky, but that 20% drop chance won’t even run on the mob that is “his turn” to loot, when you need the drop.
---
With free-for-all, every mob gives the drop chance for your quest item, even if you don’t loot it.  You might notice the party members looting a corpse, and walking away, only for it to still be ‘glowing’ for you.  Either (a) they didn’t loot everything, or (b) they did, but because you’re allowed to loot, and need quest drop, the quest drop will appear as loot for you, even if they looted it already.
---
If it’s a blue boe, usually in my groups we all roll need on it. Cause we probably going to sell it. Most people will not equip BOE blues because they will eventually outlevel them, most blues are trash anyway.  Better off getting decent gear from dungeon drops for free  and selling the boes. Like if a staff of Jordan drops. Nobody cares if you’re a mage or something. Everyone is going to roll need. If an executioners cleaver drops. Everyone is rolling need.
---
I love how they brag they have a massive amount of players.
---
Bitch, you're an alt parking garage, sit the fuck down.
---
I always manually write to people :)
---
I've played since 2007 and still think retail is better.
---
If you push the damage meter to the edge and always wanted to be first there you got some problems dude.. 
---
I mean, one problem could be you pull aggro from a mob just bc you want to be first.
---
...
---
I hate this mentality. Everyone complains about layering but then uses it all the time to make questing and running dungeons easier. I haven't used layering yet and will wait for a mob to respawn. I won't even use the raid/logout method to reset a dungeon and teleport to the entrance. It doesn't feel true to the spirit of the game. These people that blatantly abuse layering should be banned.
---
Biological needs
---
Gnorcs confirmed!
---
Dude... how about the one that teleported through the walls and ended up crashing in tanaris?
---
Go SM Cathedral, in a few runs you'll get to 40. After that? I don't know. I've just hit 40 myself. Then started to work on professions xD  
---
Luckily being a paladin nets me a free mount, so gathering is easier now! :D  
---
But yea, I didn't find 39-40 that bad, do SM Cath or RFD, both give decent xp per run
---
Not trying to be a dick here, but we all get enough guild spam on our own realms to not want to see it here also
---
You play game bad, you bad person
---
They weren't layering raids with weekly lockouts.
---
With free-for-all, every mob gives the drop chance for your quest item, rather than just the ones designated “for you”, even if you don’t loot it.  You might notice the party members looting a corpse, and walking away, only for it to still be ‘glowing’ for you.  Either (a) they didn’t loot everything, or (b) they did, but because you’re allowed to loot, and need quest drop, the quest drop will appear as loot for you, even if they looted it already.
---
Okay thanks.
---
Exactly the same goes for druids. PW:Shield is for absolute emergencies or for saving squishies, not something that should be thrown on tanks routinely.
---
I agree.
---
 \[H\] (Atiesh) &lt;Tilted&gt; is Recruiting!
---
Hi! We are Tilted on the NA server Atiesh and we are looking for new recruits!
---
We are a friendly guild looking for recruits. Above all we want to foster a friendly social environment. We have a very supportive community and  are happy to accept anyone.
---
As a guild we are trying to promote a MidCore raiding environment. To us MidCore means maximum effort with a minimum amount of time. When we  are   there to raid, we are there to raid. Our leadership has been in    everything from hardcore top 25 guilds to one night a week 10man normal casual fun raiding. We all have jobs, university, family, etc. so we   are  by no means trying to be a server first hardcore style guild. We are specifically looking for Hunters and Mages to fill raid spots but, as stated before, we will accept anybody. We are a here to kill bosses without sacrificing the bonds of community.
---
Raid times currently are planned to be Sunday and Monday, 5-8pm Server time(PST)
---

I suspect it was druid tank
---
Thanks!
---
your comment actually made me cringe bro your comment just made me cringe
---
Gee, with such brutal queues you'd better migrate! It's free!
---
I disagree. In my experience "humongous douchebag"s are often the best at criticising things properly. I do think your point is valid.
---
Thx
---
People abused layers by killing Ragnaros 20+ times. You arent the ones who blizz is coming for.
---
We were all the same +-2 levels. My rotation is usually Shred, Rip, then Claw until full combo points and then Ferocious Bite. All skills highest level. My agility is just above 105 I think and my AP is 300. I believe some pieces of my gear are a bit low, for example I haven't been able to upgrade my +4 agi +4 stam staff for 20 levels now and I don't wanna spend gold on it. I also try to be the support role with occasional off-heal/off-tank, but I didn't expect my dps to be so low.
---
It's more like expecting the employee to be fired for intentionally putting cat shit in the bag instead of fries. The key is intent, as said in the blue post. Forgetfulness is not a big issue (unless it's continual)
---
Oh, it seems I had no idea what I was talking about then. I thought this discussion was about animated emotes or something, like emojis. Sorry about that.
---
I giggle every time I see wow players posting about skills . Like bruh you literally press the same buttons in the same order over and over in this game. 
---
Not gonna lie though enjoyed your humblebrag essay in one of the lowest skill ceiling games ever
---
Apparently they are aware and fixing this.
---
Looks awesome man!!!
---
I like it. It reminds me of the maps in the Joe Dever "Lone Wolf" solo adventure gaming books from the 1980's.
---
What's so special about this cat? Not being ignor, I legitimately don't understand
---
You are a good guy. Yesterday I saw a Rouge about to get killed and healed him. He survived and I saved him a 10 minute death walk. I kind of expected a thanks. Did not get one. Oh well, I still felt good about it. Maybe one day I will cross paths with him again
---
This is 10/10
---
Delete everything.
---
Not my experience. I play multiple characters and every zone from 5 to 40 is jam-packed with players.
---
Reading comprehension... The MC bosses respawning had jack shit to do with layering, and according to blizz has been an occasional bug since back in 2004.
---
He does not look very happy. I bet he runs away within a day..
---
I am one of those players, in one of those filthy guilds, practice and repetition.
---
make a macro to spam at dungeon start and post it. leveling tanks unite
---
I think people undervalue this. Im running a mainly PvP focused guild on Rattlegore and ive gained the most members from just going into zones and grouping with people to save them from gankers or starting a zone war. Most of our members have actually been poached from other guilds because people enjoy knowing the people inviting them. Just a simple message like "hey man, you looking for a new guild? we could use some more active PvP'ers" is enough to get people drawn in because they know you arent some bot.
---
Esfand had molten core somehow reset while they were at ragnaros and couldn’t figure out what happened. His group thought they were using the next weeks lockout and contacted blizzard to let them know what happened because the following day they had fresh lockouts. I don’t watch asmongold very often but I checked in to see how their guild was doing and when the exploit was brought to his attention esfand was with him in discord and they were telling the viewers not to use the exploit because it ruins the purpose of classic and is bullshit.
---
They literally got permission from a GM to loot the bosses. Blizzard also confirmed that their scenario was not a result of the layering exploit, but a bug that has been in the game since Vanilla.
---
did he find these exploits while he was playing with his shaman the other day?
---
This needs to happen on Stalagg. I spent most every night in Vanilla doing this before BGs and it's maybe the one thing I missed most. I've been in Hillsbrad the past couple nights killing sodbusters (and a dog), but so far just ganking and small skirmishes with Alliance. Can't believe y'all just lettin' those sodbusters get cannibalized, dudes dragging around bags full of thirty sodbuster skulls and y'all ain't do nothin'.
---
5/holy/5 is good until lv 40
---
Im not saying Im one of then, I just dont think they should be banned.
---
1/3 of the population would be gone then. Its the truth.
---
Get an addon called Azeroth Auto Pilot and an addon called Questie through the Twitch client. Makes the leveling process a whole lot smoother.
---
https://classicwow.live is also a smooth step by step guide you can also look at when / if lost.
---
Quit game -&gt; exit now
---
Broken Tooth also doesn’t have a 1.0 attack speed in 1.12 just as an FYI for anyone intending to get it for that reason
---
i dot low levels as SP and purge their heals.
---
A cosmic event like classic dungeons being cleared in classic wow 15 years ago?:p
---
It also helps when people are being attacked or ganked on a PvP server and they see the people helping them are all in the same guild. People like joining guilds that group up to do stuff. You can have as many names on a roster as you want but if they dont ever do anything together, it may as well just be a /who list.
---
Not played retail since Cata, so this restore your own character thing is new to me :)
---
Unfortunately nobody who reads this needs to be told. I was at the verge of quitting tanking because of idiot DPS who attack instantly.
---
Yes, you start with full energy/mana, good for you. I basically start from nothing. It doesn't prove you can out threat a tank, it proves you're an idiot.
---
I don't get it. Why are people who wanted Classic for years not only rushing through the content within weeks, but exploit the hell out of it? I'm level 36 currently and totally looking forward to build dungeons groups for months so get your pre-raid gear slowly. I absolutely hate that in BfA my last 120 character only took about 4 hours of playtime to get the best equip before raiding / mythic dungeons. I love that in Classic it will take time to get your T0 or BIS gear, so I can enjoys hundreds of hours of endgame content without raiding.
---
Target markers. ;D
---
Wish I could answer better, but I'm a feral druid &amp; have swipe. 
---
Did Wailing Caverns before I got AoE taunt &amp; really all I could do was let the dps die if they pulled.
---
/cancelform should cancel any of your forms (or is it cancelstance?) so you can just do:
---
/cancelform
---
/cast [whatever]
---
I hate it so much when people can't even be bothered to a /thanks or "ty". A few days ago I saved a Warrior in Swamp of Sorrows from a bunch a Murlocs. He was down to 20% with 3 Murlocs on him and I needed my whole arsenal to save him from this mess. Keeping one feared, one Seduced and one bursted. Was down to 20% HP and 0% Mana and the guy just looted and went on fighting. The only thing I expected was a brief /wave or /thanks. 
---
Well, at least my ignore list isn't empty anymore.
---
What exactly did he do?
---
Well, we aren't all thinking what you're saying so
---
You shouldn't be downranking in feral gear. Contrary to popular belief it isn't worth it without +healing.
---
For someone out of the loop. What is this layering banning for?
---
Im so looking forward to WC3 Reforged to hear it all over again.
---
Is it true Horde questing is much easier than Ally? On Ally I found myself zone-hopping a ton to keep finding soloable quests that were within my level range (especially in the 20-30 zones) but I read somewhere that Horde zones are a bit more dense with their quest availability
---
I think they just be wanting to "go faster"  no amount of education seems to work, either. 
---
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.  Unless you're a dps zombie, in which case "fuck everyone, I wanna see pyroblast crits!"
---
Mages are the new huntatds.
---
As a hunter, I have a macro that goes /petattack bound to an ability, and another macro that goes /petpassive /petfollow bound to another - meaning, I always manually tell my pet to attack a target, or when to come back and out of harm's way. 
---
If you want to make the /petattack work in sequence with an ability, try something as simple as
---
/cast Shadowbolt (Rank x)
---
/petattack
---
It's not about knowing that they are looting twice, it's a bout intentionally causing them to be able to loot twice.
---
I would suggest deleting it entirely and re downloading it. Also if you have any other bag addons to delete them and only use one. I had inventorian installed as well as bagnon with bagbrother and they couldn’t work together or even be installed together. Deleted them all and only reinstalled bagnon and it works just fine now!
---
Holy Whiskers, you go Sisters!
---
There are no pvp servers lacking horde faction. They would have no where to go
---
I'm guild less right now I get quite a few invites but I always decline them.
---
I'd actually be totally down to join a guild however I have 0 interest in raiding this go around of classic. Everyone (even the most casual guilds) always try to tell me they are working on forming a raid team (probably unsuccessfully) it just always gives me the vibe leadership has no idea what they are doing.
---
On the flipside the casual guilds I find all have really really dumb names. I don't want &lt;Mighty Men&gt; or something tagged under my name. 
---
If a casual guild with a more serious name were to invite me I'd be more than happy to join
---
There's a snag though; buying gear on AH is the least wise thing you can do, so that whole argument revolves around being irresponsible with your money
---
Just to add a little further context, 90% of SALAD BAKERS were camping BRM stopping Nihilum exiting MC to summon. This mind control party we’re only around 10-15 people 😆
---
If you've read about the Ulduar situation (WotLK raid) a guild used an exploit where one of the guild members was given an item that instakilled everything in 100 yards radius (GM item given to him on accident) and they decided to clear the whole raid in a few hours. Blizzard found out because some random no-name guild just did a world first clear on the whole raid and banned everyone involved for 1 month + the guy who used the item permanently.
---
You can cancel your sub if it’s month to month.  If you prepaid then you have no options.
---
You play Alliance?? Don’t get mad if I end up cutting in front of you with no blinker.
---
In a few months people will buy that for their lvl 1 bank alt.  Some are good at raiding, some are good at PvP, some are good at making wow gold at the AH.
---
thats so high iq holy shit
---
Yes and no. If you do that then you cant get out of your form with the same macro (back to humanoid form).
---
You're greatly overestimating the amount of players you are referring to that are hardcore (those hitting 60 in 1 month or two).
---
The majority of players are still far under level 30, and that's not even a third of the time neededto hit max.
---
The fact is that even in 2 and 3 months there's still a crap ton of ppl hitting 60 because people don't have 2 hours a day for a game.
---
Ofc if you wanted to really push content hard and realm firsts then it would suck more.
---
it is literally impossible to not pull aggro as a hunter. I usually hunters mark &gt; auto &gt; *pull aggro* &gt; multi shot &gt; feign death &gt; volley &gt; *pull aggro* &gt; become a melee hunter
---
Yea, only reason I was able to do this was because the place I work for went bankrupt.  So yay lots of free time, boo no money.
---
Yes it got updated https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1All68hMpsEz2H-pJUk0HfdITfJskhaIBjCWdWqOBtVc/edit#gid=1315461178
---
Could you explain what that is to this noob?
---
In everquest we have the opposite problem, you dont really move through a dungeon in EQ, your group takes a camp and they all sit at that spot while someone pulls. Because dungeons arent instanced and the respawns are fast, so youre competing against other camps on pulls usually.
---
Tanks will always move up to the mobs faster rather than just letting them naturally run all the way into camp. Which is dumb for efficiency and positioning because now all your dps has to run up to the mob since you didnt let it fully come into the camp, and if thered lots of twists and turns casters will get los issues.
---
People are just dumb and dont think about what makes it easier for other people much.
---
Sounds like OP either got banned and for some reason  wants other to suffer or just really has it out for streamers lol.
---
I'm a bit worried about abusing layering in zones now because from that definition, it is an intended abuse instead of an accident.
---
While I have not used it for my own benefit, I have certainly helped others do this countless times because they asked me to, not only from my guild, but also random people messaging me.
---
Yup, that’s me haha!
---
If I had to guess, things are cheap atm because there's not that much gold going around yet. So people have to lower prices otherwise nobody will buy the things.
---
Are you capable of dialogue without logical fallacies? No, I presume not.
---
Haha
---
That's just helping my argument. If buying gear on AH is a bad idea, then buying small stat upgrades for gold is bad idea, and thus needing BoE upgrades for a small amount of stats instead of gold is a bad idea.
---
When you put a player on /ignore they can't send dueling requests to you, right? I've been using an addon to decline duels since forever so I don't remember. Kthx!
---
Turns out there actually IS a jail in Stormwind (/s)
---
Neat idea though.
---
Pretty sure stated that /sit would not proc reckoning and enrage, are you really sure?
---
holy whiskers you go sisters
---
I am looking for a guild that's kinda mediocore and accepting me as an elemental shaman for their raids. How things are going I will probably reach 60 before having a guild.
---
But he's level 11.  Not very convenient for him you know?
---
In their defense, a program like WoW has a billion different levers people can manipulate to interfere with things. I write embedded systems for vehicles and there are only a small, limited number of things people can do to interact with the system, making it much easier to test for edge cases.
---
Your testing team is at most a few dozen people, busy with their own schedules and testing regular features. Players number in the hundreds of thousands, with many of them actively looking for ways to screw the system. It's sheer impossible to make a program like that 100% fool-proof.
---
Sounds like the other exploit being circulated around if you mean that you would log out at the body of Princess, log in and be again at the waterfall entrance. If you want to be safe, you can always contact a GM about it, ask if that is an exploit and you'd like it to be amended (a cool GM might even trade that ring to whatever gold you paid for it if it is considered an exploit). But just one ring like this is kinda minor thing and they probably don't care either way.
---
I read that Sean connerys voice.
---
As I say in the video, you start dancing, then you simply mash forward. You need to be very fast and consistent to get it working. Keep practising!
---
Was expecting a resist on the soulfire.
---
i do it for the nudes
---
It requires a rare spawn which is there 90% of runs, then it has to drop that's true, but then you're rolling with 0-1 other person because casters wanna come ubrs anymore, they already have their reed since it's such a common drop.
---
The economy might take a week to stabilize
---
Do you have any more info on this?
---
Hes a gnome xD
---
holy crap, HOW DO YOU FUCK THE SECOND LAUNCH OF YOUR GAME?  Like this is fucking crazy.  Literally hundreds of thousands of gold items are being pumped into the economy.  This is completely unfair.  I want to play CLASSIC WOW.  Having a ruined economy is not part of that, I want a do over.
---
Dungeon Layering is just ridiculous
---
Is this same with the main factions too?
---
good fuck those cheaters
---
Yup I used to have one with 12 on the side and I never used it because it was too difficult to press the right one with my thumb. The 8 are spread out over the left, middle and right sides &amp; it's really easy to use.
---
Dungeon layering, fighting bosses within dungeons multiple times as far as I know. Some did it on normal dungeons and others on Molten Core etc.
---
Not MC
---
Give priority to melees if there are any in the group. 
---
Hunters replace HoJ in phase 2, warrior and rogues replace in either phase 4 or 5. They will use the item almost a year longer than hunters, while hunters get an upgrade in 2-3months.
---
It dropped yesterday but I passed in favor of my warrior friend.
---
Because iF yOU doN't LiKe Pvp rOlL pvE
---
You're calling him overzealous while being overzealous yourself defending Esfand. Zero self-awareness.
---
Use target of target or simply don't dps a mob that has no sunders. Easy way to know if you're on the same target.
---
You're more than welcome to come hang out with my guild and see if you like it.
---
&gt;right wing radicalization
---
You people need help.
---
Does anyone know how the mechanics of how whipper root tubers and night dragons breath work in Felwood?
---
Like I know that you can cleanse them, and can loot them once every 25 minutes.  But when do they become corrupted again?  Do they de-spawn after a certain time or a certain number of loots and then re-spawn later as corrupted?
---
Ah a good ole fashion switch off.
---
To be fair, fire mages are an absolute train wreck in 1v1 pvp in vanilla.
---
Any streamers who can be shown to have abused it? (I don't watch streamers)
---
Sure, sometimes I only need one of something. But enough often enough to justify *eighteen pages of stacks of one*
---
And there are pictures on this sub showing 1 month, so it's all a bit of a crapshoot but I agree with OP really, it should be a permaban across both retail and classic, actually show us they give a shit and maybe they'll restore some faith cos it's just another little thing that's gonna make people quit/put them one step closer to it.
---
I’m completely new to WoW, can you tell me why you don’t plan to raid? I’ve been loving it and only lvl 24. Not in a hurry to level up, but am eager to try top tier raids
---
Depends. Medium leather tends to sell pretty well on AH as it's one of those mats whose drop overlaps with the heavy and light leather loot tables.
---
It was absolutely like this in early vanilla days. Tarren Mill was basically a weekly raid.
---
Later vanilla wasn’t like this due to most being 60, but the WPVP right now is exactly how it felt after beta.
---
&gt;So no, they did not get banned because they are not stupid like that.
---
So, do every guild get a extra MC clear then ? Pretty fucked up if they didnt get the items taken away. There is 0% chance that they didnt understand that this is just WRONG. And they cleared it anyways.
---
Id say they are pretty fucking stupid.
---
This pleases me.
---
Those 2 times i tried STV i was killed within 15 minutes, one of them was at 03.00 in the morning, i just skipped the entire thing after that.
---
Mash forward as in spam W or left right click at same time?
---
Yeah, this ban is not for that, this is for dungeon layering. Fighting bosses multiple times.
---
/r/ComedyCemetery
---
I don't think there's a significant difference. The world 2nd level 60 was an Alliance hunter who achieved it via planned and efficient questing for what it matters. (World first was also Alliance, but it was an AoE farming mage that barely quested)
---
Not officially, but it's fairly low.
---
Reminds me of that story of the woman who used craigslist to offer sex for gold https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.hardwareheaven.com/community/threads/woman-sells-herself-for-flying-mount.135636/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFi56VmNfkAhXQop4KHaMSAZkQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pZ03EvsLuTKowjS5OrWlV
---
I will never forget the day 50+ swift spectral tigers were on the AH.
---
CD's? Either way, this fight was the mages to lose, and he did.
---
XLoot.
---
because nobody cares for pve servers
---
It’s possible but getting from IF to menethil harbor is going to be long and painful journey for you.
---
No idea if blizzard is removing the items. But from what I hear esfand clearly documented what items were gained from this second ID in case blizzard wants to remove it.
---
I agree they should remove it.
---
To make a guild you need to get 10 people to sign a charter. Some people pay random players to sign their charters to make their guild.
---
We'll only see what "resources forfeit" means in 30 days.
---
Smart people throw it all in the Guild Bank because in case of automatic characters wipe, the Guild Bank is safe.
---
Also, if they converted all those patterns into gold into gear that they equipped, unless Blizzard literally cleans their character, it's still a win for the exploiters.
---
I'm skeptical for now.
---
BOY
---
Ok I'll see if this can help me. Thank you
---
"Invite for layer" spam is abso-fucking-lutely not "layering working as intended". It's not mechanic that is advertised as ingame feature for players to use to avoid pvp or increase their chances of farming ore/herbs/etc, nor is there any sort of UI button allowing that, no matter how hard scumbags abusing it want to rationalize it for themselves.
---
It gives exploiters unfair advantage over people not forcing layer change on their whim, and is most definitely reportable.
---
Wow I'm dumb lmao. I just got really excited to see the guy that gave me mine on reddit haha
---
Congrats.
---
I swear the dps do this on purpose sometimes. 
---
It's some weird "You can't tell me what to do!" mentality I think.
---
Don't underestimate Tauren Stomp. As a Ork, I often wished to had that aoe stun
---
When typing I use my index fingers only
---
Oh my god, a sane and balanced justice system?  What will they think of next??
---
I also feel for Tauren war stomp can be useful in certain circumstances so there is that as well.
---
Laughs in RP server.
---
I only had a 15 minutes queue on launch day
---
charge is also a really good pet ability
---
Do you think other people, who have no stake in this feud, will keep up the hunting for more than a day?
---
That is literally how some people on the EU forums think right now.
---
I get a lag spike/FPS drop at the border between Searing-Burning when I fly IF-&gt;SW.
---
Get a Razor Naga mouse. The keys on the side help out a ton.
---
Paladins are only good gankers if they Reckoning bomb you, and I main a Paladin.
---
That said, it’s not uncommon for a caster to over commit and die to me when they don’t have mana to escape

I present to you the [healer pie chart](https://i.imgur.com/7HsOGOj.png)
---
Almost went into trucking until I learned about electronic devices telling me when to sleep and wake, you give up quite a lot for OTR driving and its not worth it with the last small freedom taken away.
---
I have it installed on my company Surface. We do what we want on our lunch breaks. Most of the other guys play Smash Brothers in the break area.
---
I recommend starting with a mouse that has side buttons, once you get used to those then start keybinding other stuff
---
No since you cant use sit macros to stack crits, crits from sitting dont count towards reckoning
---
why not
---
Yes, you enjoy free handouts, you enjoy being able to beat other players without ever learning how to play or attain any sort of skill of your own and you enjoy feeling like a total god with your vast array of mounts, achievements and titles.
---
Anybody who enjoys that is what retail was designed and marketed for. For people who want their hand held throughout the entire game all the way to end-game PvP and PvE. They log in for one hour and down all Mythic bosses and get 3 new mounts, 3 new titles and a whole bunch of BiS gear. That's exactly what you enjoy and I respect that, people are allowed to like what they like. 
---
It's just not World of Warcraft. You are not playing World of Warcraft. You are playing a coinslot Casino MOBA vidya game.
---
Hell, I don't really like Vanilla all that much as WOTLK is my favorite expansion of all time and I believe it's objectively the best era of WoW in its history.
---
Yeah, no run is going to be faster when you're rage starving the tank so they can't do damage and are dragging mobs out of position all over the place, out of other people's AoE and forcing the group to gather them and mop them up later rather than killing everything in an orderly fashion.
---
I'm convinced it comes down tunnel-visioning the damage meters. Being on top of the meters is the only thing that matters and if you can't instantly be top of the meters it's probably the tank's fault.  I play a lowbie hunter as well as a tanking/healing druid and I've been handsomely out-DPSing people way higher level and better geared than me simply because I wait a little and don't have to spend entire fights running for my life or spamming slows like a little baby and if I do pull off the tank I just stop and let them get it back. It's so easy.
---
No one in the guild can be at the rank you are trying to delete.
---
Yes I am currently playing one and it helps me a lot.
---
After I realised I keep more agro with my retri pala than my tank warrior i just decided to roll prot and it is amazing.
---
When the warlock just IB to get read of your dots
---
hahahaha who knew streamers would get a pass? :D
---
&lt;--- :D
---
Self driving cars will replace them in under 20 years or they will be paid less and mostly be babysitting the truck and parking at docks.    Not to mention the fact that they wouldn't have to follow the max hours would mean they would be able to use less trucks and have more drive time.  Even if they only self drive on the highway the fact they can get around the driving hours limits is huge.
---
I wonder if this world first lvl60 person did get a perma ban.
---
In the event of Classic + I think a fun idea could be one server that never introduces BGs.
---
I’m interested in how the “Spellpower Ret” will work out in raiding
---
I'm pretty sure it could still automatically open trade interface and place the items in it.
---
[Oh hey, you're still going hard on this huh?](https://imgflip.com/i/3ar5xz)
---
Can I counter this with a friendly reminder that tanks don’t fucking pull the mobs toward the hunter no matter where he or she may stand ?
---
I like playing the game and being able to tag mobs and do my quests so no, I don't hate layering.
---
Thanks! Amazing :)
---
You can slap on a shield even if you're not spec'd for it.
---
Thank you for pointing it out. People love to throw that quote around like they’re some master of the universe when actually it’s more likely a reflection of themselves.
---
Thank you I was confused the whole ride but I understand at the end.
---
I'm almost running out of zones to quest in, and i still need 5,5 lvls to 60. Looks like the grinding is back on the menu boys.
---
Weaponized autism
---
So you're suggesting I slowly work into by starting with just the mouse button binds?
---
Force yourself to learn to type at least with more fingers. Then make your actions only usable by pressing 1-4 and shift 1-4. A few other keys are good to use too
---
sorry to ruin it but this grammatically incorrect sir
---
Isn't it funny? I didn't really start tanking until BC, but most of this same stuff applies (although it was quite a bit easier with each expansion).
---
I got excited for classic for two reasons: 
---
1) I was going to be able to go back and have the full experience, not just power leveling a warrior through right before BC and then rushing to end game content. 
---
2) I thought, by now, EVERYONE who was wanting to play classic was for specific reasons. The KNOW the changes between Vanilla and retail, and prefer Vanilla (ie, its more than just AOE tanking and nuking for dungeons) and that the dummies would stay in retail. OR at the very least, get scared away around lvl 20 or so because they kept geting kicked from groups.
---
Nope
---
Good old Roy
---
That sounds like a great moment! One thing i do find frustrating that i have to get used to is losing food buffs every time. Sitting down to eat only to get insta-wrecked by someone 20 levels higher a minute later makes it feel like such a waste! I'm sure i'll get used to it in time though :)
---
I for one dont like the azeroth autopilot and felt like it only worked properly for the first 10 levels or so. At lvl 30 that thing keeps telling me to do lvl 34 quests and take some weird ass questing routes. Questie on the otherhand has worked like a charm.
---

---
This should help a lot.
---
I think it's easier with a hunter, but a lock with a shielded eye of kilrog can still do the pulls and provides greater AoE. Hunters have better utility and locks have better DPS, they're both good options I think
---
As a new tank its funny how quickly you just want to strangle those dps who cant wait just 1 second for me to get some aggro :D
---
Where do you got a working version of xloot from?
---
&gt;How long do you suppose people will all try and cram on the same streamer server if the queues are as long as most people play, during normal play hours? I'd wager most people would give up and make the sensible choice to start on other servers than waste their time in queues for months.
---
Not without giving Blizzard insane amounts of shit, because "technology got better, let more people onto the same server!".
---
What is this a ui for ants?!
---
If it's legit, it probably means their account already has several prior infractions. Anyone who has been suspended for a year or more is probably on final warning now, and I imagine further infractions will result in account closure. Not a Blizzard rep, though, so take my word with a grain of salt.
---
Our guild invites only people we've played with (dungeons etc) and we're currently at 80 online in the evenings. 
---
So those kind of guilds can f off.
---
My personal record now is 4 people in one run. Other priest tried to MC me, but i'm undead and that shit doesn't work on me, so he had to swim with fish. God i love to make people suffer.
---
You think people can only come to the conclusion it's jealously because that's what one guy said?  I can guarantee you I've never watched a WOW stream and have never heard of this person until this debacle.  I find it personally offensive you think I have the spare time to watch some jackass stream this game.
---
The fact that is your problem is plainly obvious to anyone with a few brain cells to slap together.
---
&gt;Also no, this is not even close to a "common" bug that "existed back in Vanilla."
---
Multiple people have pointed out this happening to their guilds in vanilla, and the blue mentioned it has existed since 2004.  Maybe you want to argue the semantics of the word "common" but it's a fact this has happened before multiple times in the history of the game.
---
&gt;Even if they didn't there is no reason to be greedy and keep loot you didn't earn.
---
They did earn it, they rekilled all the bosses and earned the loot for each kill.  Saying they should have to reinvest the time of an entire raid just to get back to do Rag again and keep nothing earned from that time investment is nonsense.
---
&gt;The backbone of the WoW raid system is the weekly lockout that prevents you from just running it back to back until you're done gearing.
---
So once you're done gearing you should be allowed to run it back-to-back?  What are you talking about.  Could you show me which 2004 server's paradigm was ruined from having this bug happen?  I mean, it should be easy since it is so debilitating to the server, there must be some obvious metric out there showing the drastic impact that happened each time.
---
&gt;someone who thinks very highly of community perception
---
That's true.  He underestimated the number of jealous butt-hurt children who would have a meltdown over one guild getting a single extra week of loot one time.
---
&gt;He doesn't need that loot, keeping it is pure greed.
---
You don't **need** any loot.  You don't even **need** to play the game.  You whole stance is just stupidly altruistic.  His mistake was actually sharing their conversation with the Blue publicly.  How about this, show me any other guild in this situation passing all the loot.
---
Does shielding your warrior on the pull gimp his rage generation?
---
As a Protadin, I'll whisper any priests who shield me before a pull and politely ask them not to do it again because my only way of generating threat on off-targets is for them to hit me.
---
thats...a permaban lol. you can still make a new account after being permabanned.
---
What about the items tht ppl bought from the AH?
---
Except there is literally no point in PvPing in Phase One. It's not even fun, there are no rewards.
---
A powershifting druid with pummelers can compete with hunter dps if played optimally. And does a lot more damage then a ret. You will need an addon to track energy tiks and mana in all forms, and can even main hand hit in between forms if timed optimally as far as I know.
---
Keep in mind that raiding only as a cat would be pretty useless for your raid group. A feral has value through its flexibility, in the same spec you can heal, tank and do more dps then a prot warrior off tank. This means you can be a very valuable off tank that can heal or dps on fights where no off tank is needed. Raiding purely as a cat is a waste of everyone's time imo.
---
Are people literally retarded.
---
Ban people for asking trade to get a new layer? I honestly thought classic people were different, but atleast the forums seems to have the saltiest people on the earth, what the actual fuck
---
Agro =/= tanking. 
---
Pallys fall quite short come 60 when it comes to tanking, so I hope you didn't plan on any kind of end game tanking.
---
According to blizzard this had nothing to do with layers...
---
lmao the irony
---
Totally! Its actually pretty amazing how much of a 'story' i felt i had with a few enemy players during that play session, none of which i said a word to. It's a really well devised system to replicate the feeling of warring factions, especially when you think its something that was designed 15 years ago!
---
Or I simply quit before that was a thing.
---
Anyways, my point beeing, it doesn't matter. You can just chose not to joing such a group. If every group does that then it is what most people want.
---
If you reset the whole instance and get teleported back to the beginning youre fine.
---
It's reliability that matters more than anything. Quick, low ping with frequent 3-10s spikes just sucks.
---
Oh. Why would they implement layers in dungeons? Arent they seperate instances anyway?
---
Farm Charms for the warrior quest (Whirlwind axe) in Arathi off the different Elementals and sell them in Stacks of 8 on the Ah if it's too crowded MAYBE try another layer. That's and easy one. 
---
Or you can always do the repeatable Fishing quest in Shadowprey village on the coast of Desolace, the reward is 55S Each time you turn in the quest its beyond E Z. 
---
You could also google " Vanilla Aoe Farms " since your a warlock, you've got options.
---
Maybe try searching the Word "Farm" in the ClassicSubreddit here and pull up other posts where people have mentioned farming ideas?
---
Yes, when we casually hit the downvote button on your comment its because we are all so *painfully unwilling* to admit how *obviously and undeniably right* you are. 
---
Not because you come across like a dick for calling somebody a shitty human being for selling gold they'd made in an online cartoon MMORPG to somebody else.
---
I think this is fair, tho.
---
hell yeah brother
---
This. Nobody cares that some dad gamer got a moderately rare drop off an overworld mob.
---
Nah, Mograine EU
---
Yeah as a hunter my life improved significantly after joining a 900+ guild. Groups happening all the time and I don't need to spam trade chat.
---
Dunno if they'll ever do raids, but I assume they would. Still I think it's better to just join a regular raiding guild once I'm 60.
---
Some of these useless fucks are horrible.  I landed a clutch heal and then another one on some fuck warlock tonight.  I need, this fucker goes ahead and tags the quest.mob we were both obviously going for.  I try to invite but nope. Then she goes and starts the escort quest, and decides to invite me after.  Wtf???  Either a troll or girl game that didn't know what the fucked she was doing.
---
Dude, streamers always get a pass
---
blizzard wont ban free advertisement.
---
i will and have apologized to tanks when I pull threat and just can't get rid of it (feint, vanish, re-pull, etc), but i'm careful to start with.
---
Halfway through runs with good dps i've also asked the tank if they just want to pickup X through whatever while the dps nuke the crap out of skull.
---
Wow really? Maybe a few weeks ban and all the gold they made taken away. But permaban? C'mon.. It was a bug that should never have been live..
---
Well, they screwed up apparently and a "bug" caused layering to be possible to abused to reset dungeons. It's hotfixed now.
---
I’m not disagreeing with you, but if this is on Classic servers, most of the Spellpower Ret gear isn’t out yet. Plus, one of the draws of it is that it utilizes gear that normally gets trashed out
---
It was people just want to act smug
---
As I understood it Venruki seemed suspicious in that his stream would be offline for 30-60 minutes and suddenly he had a load of new items, I never watched it personally so it is hearsay.
---
Esfand I was told did multiple MC runs, but they asked a GM and was ok'd for it beforehand, once again hearsay.
---
I play 1 - 2 hrs a Day most days, but in no way is that the crequirement. Try and see for your self. If you do 1 hr here and 1 hr there. Then eventually you will experience a lot
---
It would be rebuilding them from scratch so to speak, rather opening them in 3d modelling software, scaling them up in there and then exporting again. 
---
This could mean adjusting collision sizes as well as other factors, so scaling in game was probably the most optimal fix still.
---
I made none. Yet another Reddit classic attempt at discrediting someone. This time invoking logical fallacy. You aren't very bright my dude.
---
Planetside 2 is top 5 easy on my most disappointed game ever.
---
I swear I was watching a YouTube video and saw an advertisement for people to "level" you up to 60
---
Yup, you instantly turn into a pvp video with that spell.
---
Btw download the addon, letmecast, so it dismounts you whenever you want to cast.
---
Warrior here, go two handed arms warrior until you get + hit gear then go DW fury.  I recommend slow weapons, I believe when DW your offhand can be fast.
---
I've gotten a few PMs asking if I'd like to join a guild and in the same message telling me they're not one of those guilds that just invites everyone.
---
So like... what are you doing right now, friend?
---
Retail is designed for idiots like you to cruise through the game without ever learning how to play or having any sort of skill under your belt.
---
You log in for three hours and you get three BiS items, ten new titles, 500k gold, 3 new mounts and you just downed 3 Mythic raid bosses that you pugged with LFG.
---
Retail stopped being WoW after WOTLK ended and turned into a coinslot casino MOBA designed for casuals who have always wanted to be "pro" but could never hack it until now. 
---
I bet you begged for gold throughout TBC and WOTLK and never hit max level until MOP came around. But not to fear, you are now on paper, an uber pro player with all your fancy mounts, titles and achievements and BiS gear.
---
That was not earned through skill but through the casino RNG coinslot and ability/talent prune system. All so you can be as good as a pro player without actually being good.
---
Enjoy Legion. Or is it BFA now? I can't remember anymore, they all look the same to me.
---
Already got a mage bitching on one of my other comments.  It's pretty cathartic to read the childish reasoning, yep straight to the "I dew so mache daMgE, aoe!" 
---
If that were actually true there would be no reason for tanks or healers at all and we would all do the cleave group crap.  I played vanilla, I tried the super aoe group thing, and it wasn't all that great then.  Blizzard with frost spec is unreliable, and you'll get unlucky eventually.   Without anyone to gather it's also pointless.
---
One time I helped a guy kill a mob, then after it died, he killed me :)
---
N I C E
---
People didn't layer MC it was dungeons
---
Lol, a guy was nearly dead being chased by a murloc out in the open world and I was trying to pull aggro or stun it or something off of him.
---
...but he kept running away, keeping it just out of my range so I couldn't do anything.
---
He dies and then has the gall to whisper me with "thanks for nothing, asshole".
---
I do it all for the nookie
---
THIS.
---
They are in an instance all day and probably asking for layer invites frequently.
---
I remember doing desolace skellies solo for around 60k xp an hour, might even have been more.
---
Happy cake day.
---
This early in the game, you either have a massive guild or no guild.
---
I joined a small guild (67 members) and it wasn't really beneficial. A few guys were 50-ish and the rest were 30 or lower. Then I joined a 900+ guild and I'm able to find a ton of groups appropriate to my level.
---
Proper endgame guilds will form in time. But at this stage in the game it's not really exciting to join a guild with whom you can't do anything until everyone is 60.
---
TL;DR Be massive or wait.
---
Spamming battle shout is decent in a very large pull but much worse than demo shout was
---
Awesome
---
Yeah too rough, a month or two will make them fall back hard and regret what they did
---
I was in a neat guild which crumbled apart because 3 members out of 30 kept asking for layering invitations in gchat.
---
I don't "abuse" it but my brother and I layer hopped by logging out, waiting 1-2 minutes and logging back in to jump 3 or 4 layers in Arathi Basin within 15 minutes. Elementals were farmed out for his whirlwind axe quest, layer hopping let us finish it in decent time.  
---
If they'd done anything to apply a cooldown as they stated it would have been much harder for us to hop across multiple layers.
---
Bio is when you need to use the toilet.    
---
Emergency bio is when you go to practice your toiletbowl AoE.
---
Nah but i need to get to 60 somehow and so far it is easier and more fun
---
/cancelform [noform:1]
---
/cast [noform] !Bear Form
---
/cast [form:1]Faerie Fire(Feral) 
---
Bind to mousewheel up
---
Do 3 for cat on MWDown, never toggle out of form by accident. Just needs a separate button for universal cancelform (I slap dismount into it for convenience as well).
---
Honestly not bad I like it! If I was tossed an invite to it with a message not including a possible future raid schedule and I did a /who and saw a couple guys in my level range I'd join
---
Mark your first target, Thunderclap should suffice against healer aggro. If the pull is bigger consider CC or switch targets to apply Sunder. If people can't focus the marked target or start bombing 3 seconds into the pull it ceases to be your problem.
---
I'll do my best but if I need to back up so we dont aggro another pat, its on you to reposition.
---
looks like it was another bug, as far as i know they didn´t do the leave invite thing
---
And let me guess, you were hardstuck at level 25, begged for gold all the time in cities and never bothered progressing in anything.
---
Then when Cataclysm/MOP came around, bam, you were suddenly max level, in full BiS gear, suddenly got "good" at the game (lol) and you had all the mounts, titles and achievements you could ever want.
---
Funny how that happened with the turn of a new expansion that was specifically designed for casual idiots like you to "win" to the point that you'd have to be severely mentally disabled to not "win".
---
Isn't it? It's funny, I think.
---
Yes and give them any excess health pots and /hug or if alliance simply /lick will suffice.
---
No, needing on boe items that would make you feel better because you can sell it while you make another player feel bad, because he could use that item right there and then is a bad idea.
---
Letting someone have an item that makes him feel better as you just forfeited on making a bit of cash, will make both of you feel better, even if the player that got the item doesn't have a clue about the goldvalue of that item.
---
You see, playing games is about having fun. Making gold is fun, getting a nice new upgrade is fun, seeing someone get happier because you don't apply EA-levels of greed to it, is fun.
---
Stop tunnelling on the goldvalue and start considering the funvalue, you'll be a much happier player. Try it.
---
You’re just screwing over your healer at that point though.
---
Yes, hopefully they Will je stripped of the money
---
upvoted! The mafia are going to downvote this into oblivion
---
No actually, I'm glad they decided to take actual action.  Though a one month ban is rather light in punishment.
---
See that's helpful and most tanks can work with that.  Just seems we've got a massive increase in mages that saw the Jokerd thing and decided to do ZF spell cleave grps and develop this disdain for helping the group, it becomes all about topping the meters to the detriment of everything and everyone else.
---
2k dps! 15 2 minutes later as we kill the last blizzarded troll the priest is razzing the idiot.
---
Haha, thank you so much!
---
&gt;
---
So not permanently banning an exploiter is promoting cheating? That’s a bit of an exaggeration.
---
Talk about blatantly intentionally missing the point. Not punishing them is promoting them.
---
Was this on Thalnos tonight?
---
house ban? Isn't that literally the plot for illidan?😂
---
What mobs?
---
can someone explain whats going on please? whats a layer exploit lol
---
I'd prefer they stood still, I don't want mobs taking a janky route and taunt not working when I want it to.
---
No point dropping it immediately, any decent mage will see it and wand it. You drop it .5 sec before the cast finishes.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
That was asking for a ban lol I have no sympathy for repeat offenders.
---
what addon is what? lol
---
Disturbing!
---
Yea cause what about warlocks or mages? They do more aoe damage, then the sunder generate threat.
---
Drvrloper: Instead of taking responsibility for my mistake  I'll just ban the players.
---
Yeah. Same I purposelly chose a server I thought nobody would be on to avoid queues. Still going good on no wait times.
---
If your trigger finger is so unbearably itchy I'd suggest you go do caster cleave runs that are built around that playstyle instead of joining normal runs where you'll just be a constant annoyance for 4 other people.
---
reading is hard :((
---
You get Zerker by completing a class quest that is part of the level 30 chain.
---
You're absolutely right that the slow swing speed can feel clunky at times. A huge part of that is learning how to manage rage.
---
Like I said, you should be essentially using Bloodrage on cooldown to keep your rage up. Make sure to initiate every fight with a charge. I personally have bloodrage macro'd to go off when I charge, but that isn't really necessary. 
---
It's important to keep in mind the rage costs of your abilities, and try not to use more than you have to to take down your current target. Heroic Strike is the big example: It's expensive.
---
Heroic strike is not its own hit. It replaces the next time you would do white damage.
---
*Yellow damage does not produce rage.*
---
This means you aren't *just* paying the 15 rage for the heroic strike, but also all the rage that your next auto would generate. This means that if you heroic strike too much you'll find yourself rage starved *really* fast. You're at the level now where your options start to open up, and you'll want to use HS mostly when you're getting close to capping rage and need to dump.
---
Rend and Sunder Armor are both very rage-efficient abilities. Rend does really good damage per rage spent. Sunder Armor's efficiency is twofold.
---
While it doesn't do any damage, sunder armor is an extra attack. This gives it a chance to be dodged, which procs an Overpower. Overpower is awesome and should be used every chance you get! If you're arms and talent for it, it will have a +50% chance to crit over your base crit chance, and is an extra swing at your weapon's base damage. Very tasty.
---
Sunder armor, by reducing the enemy's armor, causes all attacks to deal more damage. This means you get *more rage* from your white hits! It also doesn't interrupt your rage gen to use.
---
The way this ends up working out, a lot of the time, is that you'll charge a target, bloodrage, and by the time you're finished with it you'll have a good chunk of rage left. You'll charge another target immediatly after, trying to keep your time short inbetween. Highly recommend potions and bandages over food, to minimize downtime.
---
Manage your rage and health well and you'll find yourself beginning each fight with a healthy pool of red mana, ready to go.
---
As for Zerker being better for DPS, the short answer is "Yes" and the longer answer is "Sometimes". It's good for Dual Wielding, and it's great once your modus operandi shifts to popping Sweeping Strikes and whirlwinding mobs into a smooth puree.
---
Certain abilities aren't usable in Zerker, however.
---
Finally when it comes to dual wielding... I wouldn't know, to be completely honest. It's fantastic at 60, and is in fact the preffered way to tank in high level raiding, but I couldn't tell you at what point in the leveling process dual wielding comes into its own.
---
All that said, I do want to say that it is a video game, it is about having fun, and you know what? If you *really* enjoy dual wielding more than 2hander, more power to you, have at it. Just know that it's very likely to be a more frustrating leveling experience in general.
---
That's def not ninja looting
---
Developers doing what they can with deadlines. You know coding isn't like digging a hole where you can throw more people at it. It takes time and ideas to figure those stuff out.
---
Yea but demo is useless now...
---
Layers don't determine server player capacity?
---
Sounds shitty! Upvoted. Hope I won't have white vans pull up to my house now to silence me.
---
I've had the bug that Esfand experienced happen way back in Siege of Orgrimmar, so I can confirm it has existed for at least that long

unless youre a streamer :D
---
then you get a free pass!
---
In all of those portals where you can get feared behind there is a way out. You either walk back out (and end up in the instance) or you can jump in a corner and end up in the instance. I got "stuck" myself several times and figured out a way out.
---
Also, the unstuck command will use your hearthstone. If your hearth is on CD or is deleted, it will kill you and put you at the nearest graveyard.
---
Yeah, they did. IIRC they were all human wearing a blue robe / hood.
---
In Classic, just as I felt back in 2008 when I started, I feel like I'm in a world.
---
In Retail, I often feel like I'm just playing a game.
---
We (horde) cleared every boss in MC with ease besides last 2, and that is with like 20-25 lvl 60, rest like me were 56/57 in green gear..
---
Yeah gotta get your healer on board.   Most of them I talk agree: if they want to pull, tank, and dps they are going to want to heal themselves too.
---
I can't wait to see these assholes in scholo.
---
I didn’t have a life in 2005, it just physically takes longer than 3 weeks by a mile! But not doubt WoW is less of a mystery now than back then.
---
Building muscle memory is key, so that you can actually utilize the key binds effectively... so the only recourse is to practice. Start by using your mouse to move (left+right click to go forward) this frees us the other hand for keybinds.
---
Those bitches at Jagex DO unfairly ban you though, and there's absolutely fuckall ways to appeal a ban to them which is beyond stupid.
---
People who make weed their whole personality are the most uninteresting people.
---
No there isn't any kind of layering abuse should be bannable.
---
I miss Questhelper. Anyone know whatever happened to it?
---
Using a mod to make actionbars non-clickable is pretty much your only option to train keyboard use in WoW. But you’re going to have to spend some time placing your abilities on the bars and re-binding actionbar hotkeys so the abilities you use most are in easy-to-reach locations first, like the 1234 keys, and ZXCQERF keys. Set your WASD keys to strafe and use your mouse to look and turn.
---
There’s a somewhat expensive solution that very high-end competitive gamers use called a Razer Tartarus V2. Also the Razer Orbweaver and Razer Naga. They use the mouse strictly for camera control and use the extra buttons to activate abilities. Once you get used to it, it’s almost like cheating.
---
Rocking a class that's ten times more enjoyable than a shaman. Shaman tears can't get through a bubble.
---
you wont get banned for resetting the whole instance and be teleported back yo the beginning regardless of what all the pleba in this subreddit think/want.
---
Because this is the way we like it.
---
Turn in runecloth. Takes around 500+ stacks I think
---
As far as I'm aware this is a side play that Grim the rogue from Al'akir used to do on retail as well. It's how some of his videos of him + his rogue friends in Org came about. You paid X to have a member of the Alliance killed Y times with screenshots.
---
There's no mafia on my server(Gehennas), no collusion, but big guilds lock out the crater by themselves quite well none the less.
---
Brev, 1600x1200 existed and was related ively common for gamers with beefier computers by then.
---
You sure about the 1AGI=1AP ? I'm not on my computer rn :o
---
I was going to say "found the idiot mage" but decided not to.
---
Glad you did.
---
&gt;Mages are the new huntatds
---
And then you have those rogues who overaggro and for some odd reason start fleeing away from the mob. 3 seconds later and about 20 yards away from the rest of us a prompt "TAUNT YOU MONGO TANK!" appears on chat.
---
Funny that joana's guide uses it.
---
Username checking out
---
Nice man! Just 35 atm as s priest tho,
---
Im playing with my brother together, he is playing a warlock and every time he gets agroo he never runs towards me (Even if i call it out), no he runs straight to the entrance
---
What weapon is that?
---
Imagine being given a wand and not saying thank you
---
This is a common misconception and you are wrong. As layering is removed, queues will increase.
---
The only difference is that layering is something blizzard artificially added to the game for neckbeard crowd control. Expecting players to not exploit the layering bug sounds unreasonable to me. You don't think players are being the scapegoat for slopping coders?
---
Nice analogy there, fuckin retard
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Also, if you don't know what each icon stands for:
---
Skull: kill first
---
Cross: kill second
---
Star: cc-target - mostly sap 
---
Diamond: cc-target - mostly banish
---
Moon: cc-target - mostly polymorph
---
Triangle: cc-target - used to be for hexing
---
Nipple: this is to shame people
---
Star and moon are often used together for rogues and mages.
---
Diamond and triangle are often used for odd cc'd like banish, hibernate, vanish etc.
---
And in raid boss fights you can mark yourself to know where tanks or healers are. 
---
But you may correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I sent a letter to some random pally who mana dumped to heal me when I was getting killed by murlocs to thank him. Not sure if he thought it was weird or sweet LOL
---
Wait.. what? The situation is way more complex than that.
---
First of all yes. Their taunt CD is atricious, but that is bad for ANYTHING, not just raids.
---
Second of all, Paladins lack the mitigation to even consider tanking end game. The best they can do is probably handle trash. And you have to remember while yeah, raiding is going to be easier for a lot of people this time around, this isnt LFR. People aren't going to waste a spot on a prot pally so he can tank some trash.
---
Well...that is exactly what this thread is about. Don't fucking AoE if there is no reason to or noone asked you to. Pick the target of the tank or, if market, the one with the skull and single target it. That's how it works usually.
---
Getting threat on multiple target is hell in classic...having some idiot "Bang AE" when you just charged in the group two seconds ago is not helpful.
---
Job priority for any DD in a standard dungeon group:  
---
1: Don't Aggro

2: Don't Aggro
---
3: Do Damage

I spent 36/37 killing the mountain lions in alterac. They drop bristly whiskers, which stack to 10 and vendor for 70s/stack. And there's an alliance vendor like 30 yards away at the AV entrance. For me, this spot was perfect.
---
From old man Hemming
---
As a level 6 dwarf priest, I nipped to IF, asked for 10s to get the lesser wand, some kind 60 dwarf priest gave me it and 15 levels later I sent him 20s back and a nice mail. 
---
To which he replied, saying it was the best message he read in a while, with ho toxic the community generally is, and he gave me 2G. 
---
We are now good friends.
---
Or why not just let people do it the way the want to?
---
Don't worry. They'll soon be off Discord and on Breitbart!
---
&gt;spellcleaving
---
Lmao sure thing buddy
---
Back in vanilla there was texas hold em addon we used to play while waiting for boss pulls. Bets got really high sometimes and thats how I managed to get my epic mount.
---
Yes, but it still won't give you new models or new animations. The old ones were made and put in specifically for classic.
---
Joke's on you! I'm only level 17 beyotch!
---
*rolls need anyway*
---
*wins*
---
Now I feel bad for what I've done.
---
Now this is a nice "mobile" Setup.
---
could you tell me what keyboard you are using?
---
Druids cant use axes unfortunately
---
No, not unless the iron was actually a lvl 60 boss in a dungeon your group was exploiting to kill 5 times in 20 min without reclearing the dungeon.
---
You sound like an undead irl
---
Get this shit off the sub you manchild..
---
Just create a 2 man guild with a fun name and avoid all of those people ;)
---
That is fucking awesome.
---
Ive tried both and questie is nice but the other guides can literally tell you step by step where to go. If you arent a fan of leveling ( like me ), this lets you cruise through it without much thought on which quests to take and when to move to another area.
---
ah nice, thank you so much. this is what i'm talking about, I couldn't even differenciate that :D
---
still weird that they invited a 6th into the group before we logged out. that's why i thought it must been a dungeon abuse after reading this post. 
---
good to know my shaman will keep fighting.
---
Personally I prefer going for the crit gives 2 combo points talent, then switching this means that you have it for when you get ferocious bite which gives you a huge spike in burst damage for levelling
---
&gt;There is 0% chance that they didnt understand that this is just WRONG. And they cleared it anyways.  
---
&gt;Id say they are pretty fucking stupid. Lets see anyone else contact GM and get additional reset .. not going to happen. 
---
They had cleared MC Up to Rag on the Sunday.
---
When they get back in on Monday to kill Reg, they have found the other bosses have respawned.
---
Their entire discussion about it is in the vod, commenting like you are doing obviously not having watched it is not rely constructive. You are claiming they did something wrong when it is simple to check what they did.
---
While waiting for the GM, they decide that if they are going to loot the bosses, they are going to document who got what item from the extra bosses and send it to Blizzard as part of the bug report in case Blizzard wants to remove that loot.
---
They then clear Trash only while they wait for a GM response to the issue. GM Tells them to go ahead, just don't get duplicate bindings.
---
This is the RIGHT way to handle a bug in the game when you can get an advantage. As Blizzard has been saying, *intent* matters. 
---
I have multiple times used (fairly cheap) services where there was a problem with the payment system. When I sent an email telling them their machine let me out of the parking garage without paying, they told me not to think about it. My friend who didn't bother to send that mail got sent an invoice.
---
It pays off to be transparent. 
---
Where the streamer privilege comes in is that they were able to get in contact with a GM after hours like this.
---
Well, all of my own 5 wow classic accounts are still under 1 single [battle.net](https://battle.net) account.
---
Ya but what if tanks dead, should we stand still?
---
Even though I said when I AOE and Frost Nova.
---
Also AOE comps isn’t just that one thing.
---
And no this thread was talking about dungeons in general which is why I pointed out there is a time when kiting is mandatory.
---
But you got your knickers in a twist, and then got upset again when I pointed out you completely missed what I was saying.
---
Yeah, just casting from the safe kiting distance is one of the hardest pvp aspects to learn. Same for hunter. That takes hours of practice.
---
What is cheating about having icons on map? :D
---
I am not a huge fan of perma bans.
---
a temporary ban that sets them back considerably and a gold/item reset is all that is needed.
---
That make it even more impressive! My compliments!
---
Yeah there is no real report function on their site for these businesses and I just think it I see it as a form of cheating rather than accomplishment
---
Call in help.. Pvp solutions to pvp problems.
---
Because I didn’t tagged it. Haha bot punished me. I wrote it from my phone. It’s solved now :)
---
chain lightning? ;(
---
Thanks
---
The tank switches mobs at the start (he has to build threat on all to out-threat the healer). You can't target-of-target the other DPS because of what I put in the second paragraph.
---
It's easy to do once you're good and well into the fight, but it's much faster to just mark one from the start.
---
This was suprisingly nice to read through.  Good on you!
---
What about owl's though?
---
Sick man fk what the haters say it looks DOPE!
---
Do a binary search of you addons:
---
Turn off half, leave the other half enabled. Log in and observe FPS. If the FPS is lower you know the addon causing the issue is within the enabled half, if not it is one of the disabled ones.
---
Repeat this for the group of addons that you know are causing the issue until you are left with one addon, which is the one causing the issues 
---
This assumes that it's one addon causing your issues, and not multiple.
---
i do this too and type faster than 90% of the people according to online tests. what's the issue?
---
They only leave the economy by removing and banning.
---
They dont leave the economy naturally.
---
Take the devilsaur mafia on recent pservers. They had such a huge oversupply that if they hadnt artificially decreased the amount in circulation, they leathers wouldve been 75% worth less in value.
---
The same happens with truefaith vestment from camped Balnazzar. If there are enough patterns for every single priest on server farmed, the pattern wont ever leave the economy again.
---
30 is fine for GY. The best way to get there is to fly to soutshore then run up to WPL(and get the FP there), then take a big arch around WPL to be safe, you might die acouple times but it's still the fastest way.
---
Oh I see, well there are lots of resources online to learn how to type, however it mostly comes down to practice, playing pc games in my teens is how I learned how to touch type, as voice comms were less common so you had to be quick when typing. 
---
I will say if you teach yourself to touch type it will make learning keybinds much easier as you will already have a mental map of the keyboard in your head allowing you to hit that keybind without having to look at the keyboard 
---
That being said, its not something you can do overnight and it will require time and practice to learn from the beginning. 
---
A good keyboard can also be a great help, it doesn't need to be an expensive mechanical one (although those are great) but a good quality membrane keyboard can be much nicer to type on, something like the CMStorm keyboard from cooler master is very good for the 20 bucks or so it costs.
---
The irony
---
nothing about playing the majority faction on pvp servers will ever be 'chad', stop deluding yourself
---
And there's another dude somewhere that's going:"Fucking Kroll blade dropped, that's a fucking BiS for me and this asshole just straight up swipes it from under me so he can get his fucking mount!"
---
What you want is 1 person happy. What I want is 2 people happy. Forfeiting shit at the behest of others feels fucking amazing.
---
I value happiness, no matter how shortlived far above any monetary gain.
---
Yeah there were a few times I thought about how cool this must be for him. I was actually kind of disappointed he decided to run and hide and didn't come out to fight us more. We could've made a cool game of the whole thing.
---
Can someone explain what the layering exploit is? Is it to basically get over the 5 instanced per hour cap?
---
You pve to get gear to pve to get gear but pvp is pointless.  Hmm
---
* Holy Shield is mandatory for any serious tanking. Both from a defensive perspective, as well as aggro. Your main damage/threat comes from Holy Shield and Blessing of Sanctuary.
---
* If you want to go full-Prot, I'd recommend [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxVzZVhxIxzVoV). The last 4 points can be spent on Improved Blessing of Protection, Blessing of Kings and/or more Parry from the Ret tree. I've found that Kings gets a lot less usage than you'd think, unless you have more than 1 Paladin in the group.
---
* The Holy/Prot spec is [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uoxZVhxIxzVo). It allows you to have ~90% of a full-Holy's potential, while maintaining the ability to tank. You'll just have to watch your mana more.
---
* Don't level as Prot. It's completely pointless before lvl40 or lvl51. It's technically possible to switch at 40 and tank without Consecration, since Holy Shield does very good damage while solo.
---
* Tanking dungeons works just fine 95% of the time, but some bosses and trash have aggro-drop mechanics that make it almost impossible to get them back on you. Some of those can be mitigated by tanking with your back against a wall, but others will still ignore you. Dr. Krastinov in Scholomance regularly shreds my team, since he does absurd damage and fully drops all aggro on his stun.
---
I think 30 is enough to dps in GY, it's a hard instance at all.
---
As for getting there, there's a couple of options but my preferred one is walking north through hillsbrad, alterac, cross the pond and under city, then walk northeast.
---
Did you update blizz launcher, and are you running the game with the launcher or just the wow.exe?
---
And your defense is what? Nothing? Hit me with it
---
looks like its ok to let familie members play on one account.
---
like, brothers, or father an son
---
it was the case  2 weeks ago with Joker, the world first 60, his brother played while he was sleeping they say
---
any recommendations for professions for a rogue? looking mostly to raid
---
&gt; This is the RIGHT way to handle a bug in the game when you can get an advantage. As Blizzard has been saying, intent matters.
---
Well, i would have NOT looted any of the bosses that was previously killed. That would have been the correct way of doing it, because you KNEW getting 2x loot is wrong.
---
i'll check it out. thanks! so whenever i wanna do SM:GY, i gotta run from WPL to SM, unless summon, god!
---
Same =D
---
There’s a parable in the bible that I quite like, about giving such that your left hand does not see what your right hand is doing, or giving because giving is good and not because you require anything in return, even gratitude.
---
It’s freeing, to give freely and for the reward to be the giving. :)
---
I’m no bible thumper, but it does have some nice things to say amongst the fire and brimstone.
---
How do you get internet?
---
tempted to bring my pc tower to work but the internet is a bit weird. Would probably need a vpn or something
---
I play mage and have for quite some time (played mage when wow original came out and it have been switching between my main and primary alt throughout the different expansion. If you have any question regarding mage, please just pm me at any time and i can most likely help. 😊 Mage love /Alberto ten storms
---
They didn't, you can just watch the VoD :D
---
They were continuing the run from the previous day
---
And yet we have dipshits in the very thread that insist on explaining to me that aoe is the best way to do everything. 
---
It may seem to be faster, but all you are doing is fucking up the rest of the party's jobs.  Healer has to drink, bear chases mobs all over the damned dungeon. 
---
It's an incredible pain in the ass, and absolutely why tanks and healers are in such short supply.
---
I play palatank, when they aggro i not even try to follow the mob, since i have no taunt....
---
It makes fun to watch groups, especially the DDs: instant AoE (or AoE for two mobs, DoT every mob - even before it reached the tank, nuke exact the mob i don't target and when i change - they change again, ignore the mobs that run away, ....
---
use this [https://classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live/) and thanks me later
---
Should also delete the character since they also gained levels.
---
Care to explain how it is used incorrectly? I know its often misattributed to Einstein but if I remember correctly, the quote, or the way its written, is more or less accurate.
---
this way will be easy for a normal server. sadly im in a PVP server! dang!
---
But for humans its better to get the sword right?
---
marks are the key, specially for bear tank. since my AoE isn't too strong I have to work threat up individually, luckily it only takes a couple of slaps
---
layering
---
Meanwhile I just spent 2,5 of my precious gold to purchase a 14 slot off AH...
---
They had a different bug, the layering exploit was dungeon only.
---
Couldn't layer out of a RaidID
---
Me: How many more fire thingies do you need?
---
Friend: 8
---
Me: Are we sure they're even here?
---
Friend: Questie says so
---
Me: Ooh, there's one, let me see if I can pull it from here and avoid all of those Stormwitches
---
(aggros about 437 harpies)
---
Friend: RUN!
---
A hunter kiting an elite solo is no different to offtanking or cc. It's the exact same practical outcome. In my guild back in the day hunter-trap-and-solo-till-taunt was a legit strategy. Hunters are built for it and are trained to do so during normal leveling.
---
Thank you !
---
It doesn't help that nobody with an interrupt ever remembers they can interrupt. I played with a rogue named INTERRUPTZ who interrupted twice to my (the healer) 30
---
Yeah see, that just closes your game. Your character will remain in the world for 20 seconds, during which you can be killed. Its been this way since vanilla, its not new technology.
---
&gt; At the time I was excited my Ret was more viable but as time has gone on I’m not sure if getting rid of support classes was a good thing.
---
As a retridin you're not a support class. The raid is usually better off just taking another real DPS or healer instead. There's just no role in which a retridin is viable in classic (well, apart from leveling, and even there there is a case for going holy instead due to earlier consecration).
---
&gt;WotLK was where I split away from a long term Guild as they couldn’t clear the content as the game became hyper balanced around cutting edge play from every player.
---
I disagree here. Yes, there was a skill component, but builds and raid compositions still mattered a lot.
---
&gt;Normal and Heroic are brain dead minus maybe the last boss in an instance and Mythic has become increasingly tedious. After multiple CEs in Retail and multiple top parses on my Ret with over a year played time since 2007 I finally called it quits back in March.
---
I gotta say that I disliked the decision to artificially increase content by introducing heroic modes. It was a cheap attempt at increasing replay time and should have never been done. That said, Ulduar and ICC nailed it with regards to raid atmosphere and mechanics.
---
If I want to just jump in and play for an hour, then I die and have a 10+ minute corpse run where I auto-run and tab out of the game... yeah I'd rather just go and play something else.
---
&gt; I dont think we are talking about an amount of exploiters to really make a difference.
---
On one hand, its probably not that many people. On the other hand those are for the most part extremely active players
---
lol I enjoyed the part I read before it for removed.
---
I throw dots on enemy tagged mobs in hopes they take pity on me and spare my life while I quest in the area.
---
Ahh yes what a glorious day indeed
---
This kitty will be the happiest kitty around once I get around feeding him casters :)
---
Right or wrong, you definitely come off as a prideful snob in these posts
---
THIS
---
Respawning Bosses and just do em over and over again
---
I had such a fun time at the start. Had a long break and came back only to find out that they had changed the company that ran the game in EU and you had to transfer your account but it was too late at that point and the account was just deleted with all my paid stuff, no way to get it back. Really wanted to play it more but ain't gonna start a new account and support them ever again in my life.
---
Its so weird when they give you total silence...
---
im a lv 30 ally rogue. my plan will be to finish up Darkshire quest, then to STV. along the way i will just do gnome / SM:GY dungeon runs
---
Dude... this may be my friend.
---
Back in Vanilla, we had a guild called &lt;Chicago Bulls&gt; and all of us played someone ie Scottiepippin, michaeljordan, etc.
---
Are you me circa 2006?
---
Hey folks,
---
Has anyone come across an addon that categorizes or sorts your available crafting recipes? I'm a maxed Enchanter, and the big fuckoff list of available enchants is a nightmare to deal with.
---
Well I was under the impression that it was slower.
---
Much quicker to run to Loch Modan later than to die over and over on the wetlands road.
---
I don't think when Blizzard finished creating World of Warcraft in 2004 they released it with the intent of "We want players to create addons that completely trivialize our content."
---
Do you think that went through their conference room?
---
This would hold true for black lotus, because instead of 2 hours a week, people could just flask for 20 hours a week for the same price and eventually the amount would just go down.
---
However crafted pieces of gear like Truefaith, Lionheart etc. are crafted once. Like a car. If everyone has the car he desires (lionheart is all time BiS and you won't replace it), the market dies, because there is no demand anymore eventually.
---
You still lost time in both scenarios.  One is more extreme but that's the best way to illustrate how dumb someone is being.  It's not at all unreasonable to be pissed off if someone steals loot from a dungeon.  It is also the developers responsibility to ensure a good experience for the good players, so it's also not unreasonable at all to bitch to them when it happens.
---
Thanks for your concern, but I'll be fine.  I am in a guild with more than 100 players from my old 2005-2006 realm, we are between casual and hardcore, we have our first Onyxia raid this week (I am just lvl 35 though, I am among the casual side of our guild) 
---
Because I am surrounded by old experienced players, I won't have trouble finding dungeon groups. Oh and people here know how to play and know how the economy works, so they  understand the Need expensive items makes more sense.
---
Since many here apparently don't I will explain it once again.
---
This system is meant for pugs (strangers) and ONLY for very expensive items.   Small items are need for upgrades, greed otherwise. 
---
If you do a guild run, or a run among friends, and this big money dagger drops, you give it to the people who would use it, because it's your friend. Next time he will give you something or help you with your class quest.
---
BoE's are different than BoP's You can sell them. For some items, they are so desirable for somebody in some situation, that they are worth a LOT of gold, much more than the intrinsic utitlity value. A certain lvl 19 boe sword is worth 100g, while the exact same sword at lvl 20 would only be worth 3g.
---
So let's say a group of lvl 22's are doing Shadow Fang Keep . This sword drops. It's an upgrade for the rogue and the warrior. But both would be STUPID if they would equip it at lvl 20+ Because they can buy an equally good or better lvl 22 weapon for 5g and keep 95g.
---
That's why all 5 Need. Each can win the same 100g (or 95g + some AH buy)
---
This is an extreme example, because lvl 19 twink gear is special. But the same applies for money epics. You are a mage and staff of jordan drops? What do you prefer? 150g and a slightly worse weapon or 0g and the best weapon? since you will replace the staff anyway, almost everybody will chose the gold, and have a free mount + money for professions to spare...
---
So the staff is not for the party, but for the rich lvl 60 who buys it for his pimped alt. That is why all 5 NEED on the staff.
---
Stop seeing these items as gear upgrades, start seeing them as jackpot tickets , with a 20% win rate.
---
and remind yourself, sure, the mage rolls on your rogue weapon, but you can also roll on their mage stuff, so it's the same for all.
---
EVERYBODY has the exact same chance under this system, and ninjaing is NOT possible when everybody needs
---
WHEN TO USE THIS SYSTEM?
---
IMHO only for big money items. for low value stuff, just use greed and need when it's an upgrade you will use.
---
Yea my groups in vanilla would cc mobs etc. In classic is not really necessary aside from a few pulls. Best bet is to just fill your friends list up with folks with similar play styles to your own. I only run with my guild using voice comms so we just go ham seeing how much we can handle.
---
On my server the main pack of players is in their 40s now so I’ve got no clue how bad endgame pugs are going to be with those guys. Took time off work to avoid finding out!
---
It's kinda strange seeing all these requests for features which are in the addon since its release, like people stopped checking options for at least once ?
---
I think that's asking a lot from players when its handed to them like that. I dont think duping the guards in booty bay is intended behaviour but people do it. Same with climbing dun morogh mountain. Is it that you think those things arent comparable to this, or are you only focused on the extreme degree of the exploits?
---
Am I an idiot? How do you increase the chat log size? I can't find a rescale button anywhere...
---
im using [this guide](https://classicwow.live/) . If you have hunter selected you'll get options like [this](https://imgur.com/a/GNv873n)
---
&gt; The only viable horde city to kite anything into is Orgrimmar, since TB and UC both have elevator systems.
---
UC has the sewers.
---
If addons are creating a problem then removing those addons should be the solution. The AH have flaws but is fine overall.

He probably won't make it that far.

killed so many people there as shadow priest.

I told a dude in my group that there was another group doing the quest in the cave I just left and that he should go join them since I wasn't on the quest. His reply; idiot.
---
Here is was trying to help, wtf...
---
Yes yes yes!! Ban those mothertruckers!!
---
Arms is better at 40+, but under that fury is better. Both are fairly bad pre-40 if you are comparing to other classes though, as warriors are the worst leveling class

---
To be honnest people layering to get a rare mob spawn for their quest or aoe farming a new bunch of humanoids also fall into this description and should get banned as well.
---
No fuck off.
---
Sounds like something Bryce would do :D
---
That’s why this is an MMORPG and not a single player game. If just running back to your body is your experience maybe you are doing something wrong, fighting something you shouldn’t, doing quest +2 levels ahead, not grouping when you should. Ask for help, explore your character, learn from his weakness and strengths. If you are looking for an arcade, this is not the game, it’s an rpg :)
---
It's going to get worse before it gets better.  These guys are going to try blizzarding a group in UBRS and they'll get squashed.  After getting booted a few times they'll either get a clue, or switch to PvP where they can get their "Me first" shit out of their system.
---
that is an evil idea to do to the tank....
---
That isn't a bad idea to add something for mana breaks, but I didn't want to have to make it so people feel like it is a chore or something they have to do too often. during a dungeon run you could drink 10-20 times...that would get annoying after a while....i tried to pick things that might happen 1 or 2 times per gaming session to keep it light
---
r/angryupvotes
---
It just an additional measure on top of account banning. It isn't perfect, but having to us a VPN just to play on a NEW account for a game could deter a small percentage from even bothering depending on their connection speed and location.
---
This is not true, they all had to wait for queue as seen in their streams.
---
Should be a perma... Or atleast character deletion
---
The world first lv60 streamed all the way and only leveled by aoe farming packs in the open world. He may have abused open world layering, but that is not what this ban is for. This ban is for abusing layering in dungeons.
---
Don't you have to jump down from there? If you jump, the boss will likely evade back.
---
mages mad in this thread, lmao
---
&gt;Use target of target
---
Maybe it's me, but when I tank on my Warrior, I regularly switch targets. Get some threat on the first one, then some on the second, some on the third, back to the first, some more on the second, to avoid losing aggro to the healer for example. If someone then uses the target of target or assist feature, he'll be attacking the wrong mobs. u/NikeTheSword
---
I think you can keep Bonebiter until you reach ~50.
---
The thing is, I don't think it's worth spending gold for a respec now. 
---
Wait and get a real / more important upgrade before investing gold.
---
A lot of people do, apparently. [(Wowhead) Realm population data](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) shows the most popular realms in US are Pagle (PvE) at 100k and Atiesh (PvE) at 95k. Most popular realms in EU are both German Everlook (PvE) 94k and Razorfen (PvE) 92k
---
I think 2-3 months is more apt, since that's about the median calendar time for people to reach 60 (if they're going to) and be stuck behind the weekly raid lockouts. 
---
It's been 3 weeks and some people are already starting to get bored, having farmed all dungeons for gear, gotten their epic mounts, and cleared raids once a week.
---
Max level is a pretty powerful carrot on a stick for people, but the open-ended nature of the game once they cap out character progression may start shedding players.
---
Nah, they just don't qualify for honor. No punishment for doing it.
---
Oh nice. I haven't updated in a bit.
---
Doesnt exist yet, but dragon can be kited to org from ashenvale right?

Isn't there a stream with Esfand doing it though?

---
Hey, I just want to catch up and let you know I rerolled on Zandalar Tribe and I'm having a great time, finally. I wish I'd done this 13 years ago in vanilla, lmao. There's the odd issue but, like you said, a much more mature and fun environment where I don't feel like I'm the only one objecting to bullshit. A+ advice, would take again.
---
Dude, do more, and let me use it as a map in-game
---
That made me legitimately cackle in laughter, like an Undead female. Very witty.
---
Huh, TIL. Thanks for the info
---
I've known some mouse clickers who where \*incredibly\* good. So yeah that exists too.
---
Now if you wanna switch, I'd recommend you start with just a few bindings (or even just 1 to get you started) and work your way up as you get used to it. Progressively add more and more.
---
Don't worry, everyone hates on mages for being able to AOE level with ease from as early as 22 and all the way to 60.
---
I get the exact same hate when I mention leveling as a priest in spellcleave.
---
The leveling experience is nostalgic and all, but I'd be damned if I want to do it EXACTLY as slow as we did it back in the day. This is my 8th max level character after all.
---
Came here for this :-D
---
I hope blizzard have a way to track EVERYONE doing this.
---
looks more like warforged

---
Is using macros to avoid being afk bannable?
---
Maybe so, but then they should speak up and recommend another kill order, not just do the opposite of what the tank marks. That just makes it frustrating for everyone involved.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5dct1/realm_down/). 
---
Do we now how long are realm transfers gonna be available. If in a couple of months server becomes very unbalanced will we still be able to transfer if we havent used transfer before.
---
Quick question. Shouldn't humans actually get the hammer (if they do not care about the looks of the weapon). The +5 weapon skill (hit rating) might be better than the small attack difference between the axe and the hammer (0.2).
---
no...
---
Modifiers had variance in the past. The ring from Uldaman can have a pure stat ranging from +11 to +13.
---
Fuck that - give me points, track my stats - ANYTHING is better than nothing.
---
Phase One is PvE only - it’s a free penalty free gear grind for people to get suited up for the eventual BG release.
---
I feel you, bru! Atm tanking SM with a 2H weapon. It will be fun!
---
When in doubt, check the other person's gear. Melee weapons for Hunters are stat-sticks, so keep that in mind when rolling on them. Rogues/Warriors etc. get much more value out of a weapon upgrade than you'd get out of having 3 more agility.
---
This cuts both ways, of course. Rogues and Warriors need to leave ranged weapons to Hunters if it's an upgrade.
---
Mage: Why can't I start combat with a Pyro into POM Pyro?
---
BRD, sure. But have we seen any evidence for multiple raid boss kills due to layering? We've seen a MC respawn, yes, but that's a fairly old bug, and it was one (1) extra kill for that lockout. Where are those 5+ MC clears on one reset you speak of?
---
Didn't old threat meters just parse everything from the combat log? Can they not do that any more?
---
The thing is, it's not kids, but old mature veterans who know the ins and outs of the wow economy and know this is the rational (benefits most people and the whole server economy) thing to do. 
---
It benefits the economy because it puts expensive boes onto the market, so investors and ah tycoons can buy it, giving their wealth to the population.   If  Random Joe equips a 100g lvl 19 twink sword , that is NOT any better than a 3g lvl 21 Sword  (Remember the only reason the lvl 19 sword is 100g, is because the battleground brackets : its BiS for a lvl 19, not because it's so amazing)  , anyway if he equips it he is shrinking the economy because a potential trade good is removed from the market. 
---
Don't worry, I play this game for days without thinking a second about the economy..  it's just that here, at work , I have the time during my morning coffee  and e-mail   to explain why this is not just little kids ninja-ing stuff.
---
thanks! But my post for some reasons obliterated to the obscurity with downvotes here, so no one's gonna see it :D
---
Specially if u are solo leveling as a prot warr.
---
Maybe if you are playing alliance. Because its at high almost every night so i would not call it "dead"
---
I forget all of them.  Particularly the Normal servers.  I only know the pvp ones:  Fairbanks, Whitemane, Blaumeux, Arcanite Reaper, Bigglesworth... some others.
---
That doesn't work for me in classic. Really hoping for something that does work.
---
Best of both worlds
---
I saw this orc shaman and troll mage struggle a bit around the Foothills. I was omw to SM.
---
I run up to them, try my best to relay to them that "I can help you!" And later "PLEASE HIDE MY OTHER WARRIOR BUDDY IS COMING AND HE SHOWS NO MERCY :(((("
---
It all worked out well! Pretty hilarious meeting them and their friends later on, where their priest MCed me so that they could all buff me up before letting me be on my way.
---
Some of you Hordies ain't all that bad. Thanks!

---
Hunters are the best class at keeping up dps while kiting. Good job hunter player!
---
Ultima Online? I remember playing on a private shard that had a jail.
---
Using multi shot as your first active ability is the problem here. The threat mechanics just aren't made for DPS to open up with AoE instantly on the pull.  No DPS can do this against any tank without overaggroing on something, the numbers simply don't work out. 
---
Back in Vanilla the way AoE skills were used in normal dungeon runs were either well after the tank had a solid threat lead or on big packs of weaker mobs where tanking wasn't really needed. In raids it wasn't uncommon to see rotations of frost novas and AoE taunts set up to keep mobs occupied and gathered in one place long enough for AoE to do the job because there was simply no way for tanks to AoE tank the way they've been able to since the big threat changes in WotLK.
---
Prepare because its just gonna get worse if BG's are crossrealm - thats the **ONLY** reason to balance out factions.
---
No crossrealm = long queues and factions will balance themselves
---
Crossrealm BGS = people dont care since queues are more or less instant.

Zandalar Tribe (A) has/had a dwarf priest, roleplaying as a dwarf with cum in his beard. His name? Cumbeard, obviously. I love him.
---
Hey everyone.  
---
I'm totally new to WoW and decided to try it out. But here, on reddit, I read everyone using add-ons etc for the game. (like quest) 
---
So my question is : are they necessary? And if so, which are the most common ones to use?
---
Hate to break it to you, but groups have been successfully clearing Scholo, Strat and LBRS with this strategy.
---
He didn’t use the layer for instances and infinite boss kills which is what this ban is about. He also deleted the character he got to 60 as world first.
---
Nice keyboard. What is his name?
---
Nobody is speculating anything. Im saying if i was leading the raid, i would have left the items untouched. That way there wouldnt be any discussion of ANY KIND.
---
Now there is discussion if the gm gave them permission BECAUSE it was esfand, streamer from method. Would a average joe get the same response in every region ?
---
Either weapon from uldaman last boss
---
Sounds like fun...
---
60 frostmage here and want to respec, I'm primarily PvP focused so i need the frostbite talent, but I also want to be able to AoE grind. Is there any effecient ways of AoE grinding while you have the frostbite talent?
---
A GM approved of the re-clear when their MC lockout reset, so I doubt it.
---
No, ban was for exploiting
---
Wait, APES? thought they'd all be banned for exploiting layering.
---
Same as me, except with rogues. When I see rogues I kill them if I can, regardless of level.
---
I didn't think it was possible to CalArts a mountain but you did it
---
what makes this different/better than any of the other guides for guidelime, aap or even zygor?
---
Yeah it's very bad.  
---
With all the random pet stuff happening too.  
---
I did, however, make a macro that *does* work, but not as instant as you remember from retail vanilla/private server.  
---
--------------  
---
/petpassive  
---
/petfollow  
---
/cast [nocombat] Freezing Trap  
---
/cast [combat] Feign Death  
---
This macro works like this, if you are not in combat, you can press it and it will just lay down a trap. (and the pet stuff happens)  
---
If you are in combat, it will feign death, and when you drop combat after feign death, it will lay down a trap  
---
You have to spam the macro for it to work; but here is the catch;  
---
You cannot move or do anything else while spamming this macro, it will fail if you do  
---
You have to stand completely still and spam the macro until the trap is down, which will take longer than you remember from retail vanilla or private server  
---
because the reason regular macros doesnt work in classic, is because feign death doesnt drop combat instant like it used to, meaning the other macros tries to cast freezing trap before you are out of combat, which will fail.  
---
it can take half a second to drop combat with feign death in Classic, which is why you have to stand completely still while spamming it  
---
Someone mentioned that having petpassive and petfollow in the same macro doesnt work. It does work for me, but if the macro doesnt work for you, maybe try to leave that out. In that case, you have to manually make the pet passive and follow/stay before you use the macro
---
Honestly don't get all the aoe hate, i did similar things back in vanilla too. Only differnce is i ran that with a tank whereas now i don't.
---
nice !  But i doubt many vanilla bosses would put 10 debuffs on anybody, maybe something in Naxx?   Or did they do it the early expansions ?
---
I agree 100%. On the other hand (no pun intended) it is nice to know if what you gave them actually is helpful or not.
---
Ya, I feel like I've gotten good at clicking over the years. It all started as kid playing Everquest. I never learned about hot keys and macros, and I taught myself how to type so that's why I am the way I am but nobody has ever called me out for being a clicker so suppose I've gotten decent
---
Running away gives your rogue the chance to stun, the mage the chance to frostnova, the chance to slow and in some cases me the safety to aoefear it and so on. Also, when I run far and finally hit the fade button, the mob was a long time not doing any dmg, which is good.
---
I agree in many occasions your statment is true, but it's not 100% true.
---
Only one streamer I can think of who done it (Esfand) but he didn’t do it intentionally so why would he get banned?
---
Tell that to Reckful
---
&gt;future tanks.

That's weird, in my experience warriors are one of the other three guys in party waiting while the lead spams LFG with "LF TANK THEN G2G"

Corpsemaker to ravager is what I did

Esfand's guild was unintentional, and they ticketed GM's as soon as they noticed MC was reset.

---
I take it you didn’t read the blue post where they said that the MC reset was due to a separate bug then.
---
Did your character get deleted or did you get name change for the character?
---
2H

only go dual wield, if you acquired items with +1% to hit target.

If you have acquired a total of +8% hit, its reasonable to play Dual Wield, or else you will miss a lot, and i mean realy a lot

I saw a lowbie asking for 3s to train so he could use his new sword.  I gave him 3g and he was blown away.  He told me before he accepted the trade it was too much and i said enjoy it.  Hit the space bar to make my horse whinny and rode off. I got some hand outs when i first played vanilla so I'm trying to pay it forward now.
---
Is there a link to those DPS projections? I'm wondering where my class/spec ends up
---
Is it really THAT bad? Stopped back in the days during WotLK/Pre-Cata, never thought retail would go down so hard. :(
---
In Sodapoppin's case that's called getting funneled gear.
---
Another clueless retail player who has never seriously pvpd in classic but thinks he knows all. If you'd actually pvp against a skilled player ud get fucked 100/100 times. Heck off m8
---
If they tell their guild how cool the guy is, the least they could do is type 6 letters to the guy and say "thanks".
---
There's already a prison in Stormwind. You could have them do an infinite amount of stockade runs, and that would be punishment enough.
---
How do you find your server's discord??
---
Oh I have yet to see the need for any more CC than just nova. With enough dps everything just dies anyway. Faster this way.
---
Depends on what gear both have, and who is the best player, what buffs they have.
---
Does clique make me a more efficient clicker?
---
Thanks for the help. Way back in vanilla I skipped DM completely and didn't start healing until I think SFK, so I was unsure how vital flash was to the rotation so early on.
---
He's talking about a seperate issue from layering. The MC lockout reset is seperate from layer abuse and happened back in 2004 (As to prove it's seperate from layering).
---
My epic mount will be a nightsaber.
---
As a side note with regards to gear... for damage output, Strength is slightly better than Agility for feral damage, but both are better than Stamina (which doesn’t help your damage at all). If you don’t need to worry about taking damage, such as doing dungeons with a good tank, stack as much Strength and Agility as you can. 
---
If you’re missing items like rings, shoulders, necklaces, or headgear, got get something cheap off the Auction House. Anything is better than nothing.
---
Once you get to end-game in Classic, increased hit chance and crit chance are also good stats to have.
---
I saw this on a video about macros yesterday - use /equipslot 16 &lt;weapon name&gt; to put something in your main hand. You can also do offhand with 17 instead of 16.
---
Hope that helps!

Is it possible to have a retri spec as a pala but still heal good in dungeons with some int+spirit gear? I want to level solo as either ret or prot pala but want to be a healer in dungeons and in end game. I also thought about leveling as prot pala but I am not sure if this is most time efficient?

i like your tiny keyboard

Nah its intended, you think blizzard is so inept they accidently made invites relayer you?

TFW a mage pulls aggro, instantly runs toward you and blinks through the mob.
---
I'm assuming you are taking the drop rate from Wowhead Classic database, which is currently extremely unreliable for things like this, as they are based only off the drops of people using the Wowhead addon so far in classic. You can see on the site that the drop rate is calculated based on a single drop out of only 981 recorded kills. The actual drop rate is probably more like the .0006% used by private servers.

No-one wants 4000 stacks of linen.

Haha this is so frustrating even more if they run and agro other mobs
---
Add a 10km run and I’ll be one punch man soon
---
Alliance do the same thing given half a chance
---
What you did was hard reset of instance, shouldn't be bannable. Only thing you essentially saved time on was the run out of instance and back in, this mechanic has been in the game of its whole lifespan. Players who abused layers did not have to log out, reset instances, clear trash as they essentially just abused layer mechanic. You might ask why did you have to logout, it is because when you want to reset instance normally everybody would have to run out of the dungeon because instance has be clear of players. Players who have logged out manually are not counted being inside of instance thus allowing leader (or 6th player who will get invited and promoted) to reset instance for you.
---
Being absolutely puzzled about what the fuck you're supposed to be doing and/or where the fuck you're supposed to be going (either immediately or for the next zone) is very much part of the classic experience though lol

Alright I just created my first ever WoW character after all the hype I've been hearing. Now what? 😁
---
I’d take those people over the political type. Politics is important but shut the fuck up about it in WoW please
---
Ragnarok was this way too. You’d have a party with a tank grabbing a bunch of monsters and then running to the party to have them kill it. Mob tagging wasn’t a thing so another passing party could steal them from another tank or you could steal it too. Sorry I only played in private servers and most of them penalized stealing mobs though.
---
That would be some awesome punishment!
---
What it sounds like to me is that the realm cap and the number of layers vary independently of one another, with realm cap being a fixed parameter and layers forming dynamically based on server need. Some of the low-pop servers may already be on a single layer. The current realm cap is likely some multiple of the 'normal' cap from Vanilla, and they're likely to decay that value down to a the normal cap by Phase 2 when they turn off layering altogether.
---
From [Blizz](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layer-switching-is-the-problem-not-layering-itself/286941/20)
---
&gt; All realms have a single-digit number of layers. Most of them have a low single-digit number.
---
They've not explicitly come out and said exactly what the relationship between layers and server caps is. The most we've gotten is the following [quote](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/q-a-compilation-wow-classic-development-team-ama/260760/1):
---
&gt; Q: What exactly are the pop caps for a layer? And extrapolating from that, what are the server pop thresholds roughly indicating (what makes a server low vs medium vs high?)
---
&gt; A: We’re not releasing specific numbers, that will likely change dramatically. Based on the response we got from name reservations, we’re anticipating large player populations for some realms initially. This may change as players switch to lower population realms. We’ll use layers to help improve performance in the short-term if large groups of players cluster in an area. We hope to reduce the use of layering over time as people spread out in each realm.
---
OOOO Maybe people like mysaelf who have to sit in the queue to get into the server might have a lower wait time?  Love it :)

The worst offenders of the xp exploit got 30 days including Preach and Josh from Method.

Good idea but the two sepaeate storylines would confuse people a lot. People were confused with fucking WoD and that was pretty on the nose straightforward.
---
Same, but Classic is not really Vanilla. It's four months before BC 1.12. Most every broken thing that made vanilla what it was had been fixed at that point. Don't get me wrong, it's great for new people to see the old world and quests, and I'm having a blast playing Retail and watching these people on Twitch play it. But for myself, been there done that.
---
Yeah same, Badlands has been the worst so far. But it's only like 2-3 minutes
---
I run a guild, even asking for layer invites is gkick worthy
---
There are no auto buying or selling addons, you cannot automate things with addons. Posting/buying auctions still requires you to press a minimum of 1 button, no matter how easy the addon makes it for you. What can be automated is keypresses with 3rd party software, which is against the ToS.
---
yes, heal with clicking on party frames, attack with mousover on enemies.
---
I still don't understand how any of this contradicts what dismal626 said. All of the layers fill up to whatever their max amount of layers is set at and *then* the queue starts, right? The queue is not the number of players on the server, it is (or at least I guess it must be) the number of players over the max number of players per layer times the max number of layers.

Why not use the in-game raid frames?

How do you expect people to empathize at all with no name for context?
---
It was an exploit but so widespread and easily done they likely didn't feel the need to ban anyone. Especially when all they did was level a little faster than some people.
---
I have no idea about fury warrior, but I out dpsed one yesterday as heal shaman. No idea what he was doing.
---
Pretty sure their was a trinket but weather it came in later expansions or not.
---
thats amazing :)
---
Since playing classic I forgot how nice people are online.
---
This time I rolled an Undead priest (always went ally priest) and its been a joy so far :)
---
A cool name
---
This is a sensible reaction. Very good Blizzard!
---
Afaik, my guide is the only full horde guide for guidelime, it's not a speedleveling guide, has less annoying elite quests than joana and more grinding to help with gold issues while leveling. Aap currently only goes to 40, zygor for horde is incredibly slow and tedious us what I've heard people say.
---
Can you shout this a little bit louder for all the retail kids playing Mage in classic for the first time and pulling aggro every pull.
---
good choice and good luck!
---
You asking overall dps or the rotation? Fury warrior is king dps (pve) in vanilla. Mages might be comparable in Naxx, but warrior is dominant even in MC with pre raid. 
---
Rotation isn't anything too crazy. I feel rogue is a smoother rotation just because of energy vs rage.  Fury beats Arms in PVE.
---
That sentence actually makes sense considering it’s in pirate-language, it’s like saying; ‘All you need TO do to collect...”
---
They just shorthanded the first ‘to’
---
Forgot the part "if you have a healer."
---
Its retail shards with a shiny new name so people dont go full retard about it. Which they should. Its already damaged the games economy.
---
arena is actually the only thing that I would want to be implemented on classic as a pvp player
---
Holy dumb thought process. “I didn’t do anything wrong officer, Their bank vault just wasn’t secure. It’s their fault I found a way to get in without using the key”.
---
I understand the frustration, but there are a LOT of people playing WoW for the first time right now.  Explain to them what you mean by that.
---
Get rekt, Roy.
---
Warrior tank is generally 10 seconds or 3 sunders before you go full ham, depending on what for you have they can wand/white attack until then
---
I found queue times have improved dramatically since I began playing exclusively during the hours I used to sleep
---
Lol truuue
---
I think you're assuming that
---
    realm_capacity = 3000 x num_layers
---
In reality, I think the realm capacity is an independent parameter, and the number of layers varies dynamically depending on player activity. So maybe they've set the realm cap to 15,000 right now
---
It doesn't make sense for different servers to have different caps.
---
I used to play on 56k modem that only got 18k because of old phone lines. I was usually around 1200-1500 ms, and during raids or BGs it would peak at 6000ms. It was boloney, but it was all I had. I pulled decent raid dps according to tracker and guildies though. I was never bottom dps, but occasionally a tryhard healer would beat me, lol. Once I explained my situation people were more amazed than annoyed.
---
Idk. I never gank people just fuck with them (freezing trap, polymorph, kill their pet, etc.). I only take fights that are somewhat even, because I like open world pvp but don’t get off to killing someone for free. It seems like the biggest shitters are the ones that gank on sight.
---
Does it feel bad to be left behind? You’re losing touch old man.
---
It says you downed C'Thun in 2009 lol.
---
Some of your earliest achievements was in 2008, so you can't use the "there was no achievements in Vanilla" excuse, you downed him AFTER the achievement patch came out.
---
Nice try, fuck off with your bullshit now.
---
You are being deliberately stupid.
---
Pulling four mobs and killing them all sounds like a pretty good warrior to me
---
They categorized it as in ‘in game bug’ but it’s not a bug, it’s a mechanic, and they created it. 
---
Yes, take action and suspend people, but also, take some responsibility yourselves, or at least don’t lie.
---
&gt;If someone doesn’t, he can ask.
---
Communication is a two-way streel, friend. How would a new player even know to ask? I have friend coming in from DCUO where skull is the danger symbol notifying that you need to move away from that enemy. He has bit short of a decade playing like that. You can't assume that everyone knows WoW standards.
---
*Run to the tank!*
---
*Run to the tank*
---
*I can't get back the aggro, when you're that far away*
---
I guess that's true yeah, I had the mindset of looking at streamers for whatever reason. I know when they get banned if they create other accounts Blizz would ban those too if caught playing, or at the very least did that for certain cases.
---
Where do priests pick up Mind Control? The Wowhead page, and the internet in general, are curiously silent on this subject.
---
Are there any good websites/addons for auction house prices?
---
Lol
---
Maybe right behind prot warriors
---
All I'm saying is that I've seen worse names that fit the sentence fragment format that were very clear, such as peonmyface or nutinherbutt.
---
Dunno about that. At least on my server there's sooooo many people there that it is annoying af to do anything there.
---
For clothies the engineering monicle is generally pre raid bis, other than that I'm not sure.
---
Vuhdo said it doesbt supper classic and I downloaded the classic version from curse. It's clearly something I'm doing wrong or they are duff mods from curse.
---
In the words of the great M.O.P.
---
"You're as cold as i- FUCK YOU"
---
Name change and a 72 hour suspension.
---
^^^ this is my exact mentality. Ganking is for baddies.
---
it is less impact for me since I'm still only level 25.
---
Years ago I was told it was a European way of needing to use the bathroom. Not sure if it's true or not but it's easier to type I suppose
---
MTSL
---
What I'm saying is how do you know they didn't get some of the six you say they had up on the AH during an earlier offstream farm session?
---
They have been invis pot farming those guys since before they were even 60, lvl 58 or so (I happen to know that because I tuned into Ven's stream for the 60 ding and he traded Ziqo a bunch of invis pots about five minutes before he dinged 60, when Ziqo was still 58 or 59).
---
This is the truest read I had a while.
---
Wow, didn't think they'd actually have the guts to do it.
---
I had one a day ago who asked what X meant. I’m not going to explain the game to 100% of my groups when only a minority needs explanation.
---
Report them and you wouldn't see them anymore.
---
Meanwhile Im sitting there waiting for the tank to get to 50% cuz my big boy heals would draw aggro too soon.
---
exactly, we all can one punch Onixya
---
I keep on threatening to make the "General Goods Vendor" guild.
---
Did they exploit it? So is their world first not really legit?
---
Cheers for the happy skull about to joyfully slaughter the enemy!
---
That's really weird, did you download it through the twitch app?
---
Just find a guild
---
Playername: xsarahpalinx
---
How could I obtain the same UI as you?
---
In lvl 54 and havent looted a bag yet.
---
temporary bans are a better deterent there was a study about this, a perma ban doesnt feel so harsh, people just deal witth it and move over, and do it again.
---
Temp ban makes many of people reconsider their actions
---
What's the command for chair dips? /chairdips isn't working.

I think she followed that post up with another one along the lines of "Guess what I got laid and got my epic flying nerds"

Negative, it wasnt a freudian slip.
---
Not anymore. Ship to Menethil Harbour and you have to run to IF.

Unless youre a meme class like mage

Horde run through Darkshore
---
The thing is warrior is highly dependent on gear. Rogue is not as much. With BIS warrior beats almost anything right now (bar mage and warlock with also BIS). In NAXX warrior with BiS will beat anything by quite a margin while rogue will probably come 2nd or 3rd.
---
If you dont have a raiding guild or good means to get gear rogue is the safer option, otherwise warrior is king.
---
Or, you know, just go to the gym and do compound lifts for 45 minutes three times a week.
---
I get what you’re trying to say but attacking someone 10 levels lower than you will always be pointless. I think your point applies better to people within 4 levels of you.
---
You know that this is actually a good thing, yes? Aslong as the mob/boss is tauntable it's favourable for the tank to have someone else pull it and dish out big threat immediaty. Once you taunt you're on his threat level, which is pretty high after this burst. This means that it's almost impossible for others to steal aggro from u on this mob. It's also harder for the one u taunted the mob from, in this case the mage. The reason for this is pretty simple too: he needs 130% of your threat to pull aggro again. Which is considerably harder, as the 100% were built using his biggest available burst. For you, as a tank, this opens up the opportunity to build up threat on other targets whilst easily holding threat on skull. So yeah, mages pulling with big dmg is good, not bad.
---
Orc axe spec gives approx 2-3% damage increase at end game raiding. It’s significant, but not so big that other races are unusable
---
It's a pet.  They come as items in classic.
---
I did the same handing out bags as a tailor in brill. People are so happy te receive some bagslots! It really helps them out early on if they have a couple of 10 or 8 slot bags with them.
---
The fact that their CS is so bad is kinda mind boggling honestly. I play casually but I've seen so many people get their accounts hacked and Jagex somehow blames the victims pretty much every time. Like mm yes Jamflex I totally wanted to lose hundreds of hours of progress and my fat bank stacks yes. Come on.
---
208 min on Herod? That seems fair in comparison to the 6-7+ hours it was at a few weeks ago. Isn't Herod the de facto "not the streamer server" server? I don't own a crystal ball, but I fell like it's always gonna be relatively full.
---
Flash news: Not everyone enjoys world PvP in PvP severs. 
---
Arenas and BGs? Sure. I’m all up for it. World PvP, asking me to gank lowbies? Nah I don’t find any joy or fun in that. Migrated over to Carebear PvE server (Remulos) after 2 weeks with my gf. She has never been happier in WoW classic. 
---
Here’s her estimated breakdown of “Joy” for PvP.
---
1) killing lowbies: 0 units
---
2) killing same or higher leveled players: 1 units
---
3) getting killed: -100 units 
---
4) spending time trying to look for lowbies to kill: -10 units
---
And for me? Seeing her happy makes me happy. Net win for me when I migrated over with her.
---
&gt;You literally have no argument.
---
🙄
---
Jesus christ, you Blizzard fanboys must really be clones of each other. I can predict exactly what you're going to say before you even say it!
---
&gt;I am pretty certain I can shoot it down.
---
No you can't. But I know for a fact you'll jump around like a monkey trying to anyway, so why bother? I already gave you the tools to find the answer, and you *already* aren't listening to me. Stop defending this shit, Blizzard isn't going to suck you off as a prize for worshipping them.
---
thanks for the link. as an europian i don't read the us forum that much!
---
Dungeons. Not raids.
---
Anything can be exploited with enough effort. To say it’s blizzards fault for making exploitable content is completely ignorant to how technology works.
---
No, I dont want to hear about our lord and savi--- I mean about your guild. I dont wanna join any so kindly fok off yer cun\*!

Zygor costs money right? :(

How is questie not "quality of life"? All it does it makes it so that you don't have to alt-tab to browser when checking for some locations? Or is using internet also not allowed in your rulebook? And what exactly is the difference between "quality of life" and "giving direct advantage"? Aren't those pretty much the exact same thing?
---
it is true
---
^^^there ^^^was ^^^no ^^^bind-to-account ^^^in ^^^vanilla.
---
Today a person gave me a scope in IF +2 damage.  Was such a great feeling. I sent them later the gems that are used in the recipe,  they then sent me another scope.  Now I just need a better gun.  
---
Love the feeling of classic.
---
I found a bot too! The player was totally unresponsive. If you killed their mobs they didn't react. If you mind controlled them and ran them off, they just ran back to the same spot and started killing mobs. When I started to attack their pet, they just started healing the pet. Totally a bot.
---
I have no problem with their names, I'm just giving an example. I'm not reporting anyone for any reason unless they somehow affect my gameplay.
---
It's funny how many people don't save me in this game even though i save fuck tons of people.

---
Yip, only issue with addons I seem to have is with raidframes. Healbot was my first port of call on release day and that never worked, put it down to  being bugs with it being the first day.
---
Yes you can spam Dash to learn it. No need to fight anything :)
---
The level of intelligence you must have to think the creators of the game wouldn’t find out you’ve been banging the fat chick from Maraudon 15 times.
---
Thats a level where u get fit enough during the process.. But starting this with 54 as not very fit person is rip :D
---
My friends don’t like pvp but always role pvp servers. The world feels kinda fake if you don’t run the risk of running into the other faction.
---
A few second here and a few seconds there and a dungeon which takes 30 minutes max. is suddenly 1,5 hours.
---
Play the game and have fun, but don't make other peoples time miserable or steal their time.
---
Wow that looks amazing! I love your setup.
---
What a dumb argument. “It’s their fault that there’s a way to bypass the faults security”.
---
I just want to level at the moment (lvl31) so I leave alliance alone. Especially because I usually level with my pal and 2v1 is just dishonorable and boring.
---
Though if you attack me / us, the by God may the wrath or horde be upon you.
---
Most people have been chill. Though not in hillsbrad. Man, fuck that place. Too many people there so find decent number of mobs and a lot of ganking. PSA don't go there if you can avoid it.
---
&gt; As a mage, I can recover mana 3-4x faster drinking than I do passively from spirit.
---
You do realise that drinking and spirit regen aren't mutually exclusive right? If you have high spirit and you drink, the amount of mana you are gaining per tick is greater than if you had no spirit.
---
Exporting the video of it now. Lol it’s so deliberate it’s funny
---
This is awesome, I like seeing how the majority of people in this game are cool and enjoy playing and experiencing the game together. I ran into my first player today who was a real pecker head, rolled need on mail gloves and he was a warlock. I said now c'mon lad we're all trying to get better gear as we level and released him from my group.
---
I said have fun and watched as he was slaughtered inside stockades, then he messages me you're a queer and this and that, I was laughing and thinking I'm a warrior I can get into all of these dungeons with ease, keep on doing what you're doing and people will never invite you to their group again.
---
I'm pretty sure I'll be changing the looting terms to whatever it is that you can only roll on items you can use going forward, we'll see.
---
I’d say it’s because all of those topics are so heavily policed in real life (don’t ever speak bad about LGBT) that people feel like they are finally able to speak their minds (or more likely just talk some shit) behind the veil of anonymity
---
The black book from Razorgore?
---
SemiAuto said that Phase 2 will have crazy queues again after layering gets removed. 
---
Dismal replied that queues are for the whole realm (&amp; layer) and would not change if they'd disable layering right now. 
---
Given the original realm player limit this is simply not possible with that amount of characters we have. 
---
If Blizzard would delete layers now the queues would explode because they are calculated with the increased capacity they offer.
---
it is a good start :D...."hit the ground running"
---
You need to find the balance between playable enough so that they keep being at it and so annoying that it tilts them and they hate playing yet can’t stop, because it’s still somewhat enjoyable.
---
it is also boring as fuck and not even that much faster than efficient questing
---
This is what gnomes see in their dreams
---
Low pop server are actually bigger than a full vanilla server anyway.
---
And a full vanilla server is imo already too big to have a good community.
---
Edai? is this you
---
i do that too. but i also sit still for a few hours playing..so why not right? :D
---
It isn’t fun ganking low levels. Unless you get off to pissing people off. It’s way more fun to just fuck with them.
---
This was actually after they had already killed me. I ran right back, resurrected, and stood defiantly in the middle of them all.
---
Sounds fair enough! Might sign up
---
Bro i made an undead mage and when i was level 6 someone handed me a white linen robe which was a MASSIVE upgrade for being usable at level 5. So as soon as i got tailoring i made like 7 and handed em out to people and told them to pass it on if they did tailoring. I hope it got passed on.
---
And we wonder why retail is timegated so badly
---
hotter tip priests are drinking the same shitty water just because i just started drinking doesnt mean go pull and the mana will be ready when you need heals. cant wait for the better water/food.
---
A good exemple of this is in BWL on the dragon boss where the tank has a debuff which will 100% kill him, he could drop the debuff with oozling's and priests using mind vision on him to push the debuff off!
---
I mean, he might be right, but wouldn't you also say he's a tad biased in this matter?
---
Oh this sounds fun. How hard can it be?
---
*plays on PVP realm*
---
*Goes to STV*
---
*One week later*
---
Well I can now squat with a truck on my back so that's nice. 
---
Still level 36 though...
---
i really dont even know how to help ppl like you. even if you fix this issue of yours i feel like therell just be something else thatll bring you down.
---
Yeah haha. Farmer him back in the day :)
---
Sweet, then yeah I guess it is possible to pull something all the way up there. Don't see why it wouldn't be
---
That....would be overpowered
---
They have a lower aggro radius but never truly lose aggro.
---
JEEEJ More bans!!!
---
From what I understood the instance cap didn't apply via this method of exploitation. I'm not sure what the layer cooldown is so I can't say anything about that. And while the pulls before that are very good XP, they still take considerably longer to setup and pull off than the zombie pulls. You can definitely improve this part by cycling evocates so the pull can be started quickly, but I doubt that'd make the speed go from my best of ~50k to 80k.
---
The last pull as well, where you actually run to GY, is usually a small one. You can pull some extra stuff along the way but the improvement is pretty marginal as you can't get an AoE setup as clean as the pulls before that. There's also the time it takes to run back, although I suppose that's somewhat close to the time it takes to layer reset once or twice.
---
That's subjective, and not a basis to look down on people.
---
Maybe it's an ability of the npc?
---
I've noticed the raptors in the barrens hitting three times from time to time, and the timing always works for a rough 6-8 second CD
---
Also lvl 37 ally looking for an answer
---
I googled classic wow resistance and the first result answers all your questions.  I can't imagine you actually tried to google it...
---
*deletes rogue*

Next week:

*deletes pala*

*creates mage for aoe farm*
---
How much a day do you have time for playing as a truck driver?
---
It’s lacking something for the back, maybe some rows or pull ups to not get more forward rotated shoulders 😜
---
When you say to "get's them to level 5 or 6", do you mean the Starting Zone as in Durotar (which would be weird!) or the small subarea people start in in that zone?
---
Thanks for the tip. 
---
Regardless of the context of this specific thread. Layer switching to achieve anything is abuse of a game mechanic.
---
Like any other group where people in lead start to have issues between each other don't you think? i would say that there is still higher chance that they have better relation ships to get over it than complete randoms where one self promoted guild master try to lead group of strangers who have 0 loyalty to anyone in guild.
---
Guilds are about people that's an obvious and giant red flag itself.
---
Who the faq cares what other people play?
---
I'm an ele shaman.
---
PvP is the only real endgame.
---
Yes what kind of giant loser would use Questie, the (probably) most popular Classic addon? /s
---
They'll never become passive but the aggro radius will reduce dramatically for a 60 in a starting area.
---
No, hang them.
---
RemindME! 9 hours “Try it!”
---
Nah, the resists are completely negligible, and the Magic absorb is too specific and a low value anyways
---
And it doesn't give you any agility
---
wtf is this ?
---
He was asking about aoe farming, but yeah obviously ally has some clear advantages in raiding :)
---
It would have taken you less effort to just type your argument instead of telling the guy to look it up in other threads and then saying "you gave him the tools", as if he needed you to tell him you can look stuff up online. It sounds like you have no point but you also don't want to back down.
---
I am also someone who thinks layering is necessary at the moment, and I don't see any solution short of realm splits that would remove layers yet keep the game playable.
---
Shammys work better in melee cleave because of windfury. Casters, mainly mages, work with any healer and work better together cause they can all kite with blizzard and not be touched. If you put a melee with 2 mages and the mages nova, the melee will get dropped since novaed mobs target whatever is in melee range.
---
The 1-12 buttons seem most satisfying to press compared to the naga and g600. It's a mechanical click really.
---
Proof?  Do we have any proof whatsoever that this worked in raids?
---
Awwe ❤
---
Not sure, I guess it's just reality hitting me in the face now. I knew about hunters not being so great before but I thought it can't possibly be *that* bad right but the community aspect of everyone hating on hunter is the worst for me. I feel like I'm already losing before even starting the race because of all this prejudice.
---
TIL Shamans can wear Nox
---
Nice that something exists at least. Are there any known values for how much the radius decreases per level or at what point it decreases?
---
They do, but without access to threat mechanics all they can do is approximate and as such they're somewhat inexact.
---
You can literally buy 14 slot bags for like 2g already. I get that some people are casual but holy fuck this place turned into /r/wow quickly.
---
Addon is called Spy.
---
So what? A person can't have more than one character?
---
Stop assuming.
---
HAHA GREAT! go blizzard, go ban them woooooi
---
Mobs that are weak and then trivial to you may remain hostile, but they have vastly, vastly reduced aggro radiuses. Meaning you can walk a few yards around them no problem.
---
Nah, set it up behind the waterfall behind the bank(?). I sent my warlock buddy there years ago and deleted his hearth before logging. Poor guy had to swim to ashenvale or around darnassus.
---
I dunno for same faction, but I use spy for the opposing faction, two people are on my kill-on-site list for being knobs on boats.
---
Jesus he didn't even exploit anything. This sub just wants to see every streamer banned, not matter if they violated any rules.
---
The damage is mostly not so spiky as to need it to be done instantly.
---
Back when there wasn't a open all mail by default, an addon to open &amp; loot your mail for you. 
---
Player Note Addons
---
MogIt
---
AtlasLoot
---
Immersion
---
Addons that let you sell junk items in bags.
---
Warrior is fairly hard mode for leveling up solo. You'll probably want to do green quests (as opposed to yellow) for a lot of it if you're not in groups (meaning you kill mobs a few levels lower than you). Or group up to make things easier (and generally its a lot of fun being social anyway).
---
Shift click the name in chat or /who name
---
I use Details dps meter and make multiple windows; one with a threat meter, one with dps. It's been my favorite dps meter add-on in retail for years.
---
Yea i always use battleshout. But it isnt enough when they start doing dps ;p.
---
Felwood oozes. Specifically Tained Ooze. (not all of the oozes in Felwood drop the bag that contains this pet)
---
You can also farm Oozes in Un'Groro and EPL.
---
Aggro range scales inversely with level difference, so at about 20 lvl difference between you and mob you need to literally walk through their model to make them aggro on you.
---
Maybe as a niche pvp item. +600 shield = 60 stam versus a mage/warlock in this case.
---
bugs will eventually get fixed - the bottom point for me is
---
- *Meanwhile I get shat on and made fun of in my guild just for being a hunter, being called a waste of a raidslot or loothog even*
---
- *Yesterday we did Onyxia and I wasn't even allowed to roll on the head for the neck.*
---
so maybe find a new guild? "casual" guilds seem to be more welcoming/frendlier, and can be streamlined into having a successfull raidteam. or if you farm mats for guild progression maybe they will be more willing to give you items,
---
I thought about feign death + use macro.
---
Can anyone explain what's layer abuse?
---
Leave that guild imo
---
Stop right there criminal scum, your stolen goods are now forfeit
---
what a useless comment
---
I've noticed it multiple times on completely different mobs while leveling my mage. Sometimes up to 5 attacks at once. Feels super annoying to keep a mob frozen until it’s about to die only to get 5 hits when it gets to you.
---
Hey buddy wrong sub reddit. This is for the official Blizzard Classic WoW, and I think you are talking about the private server.
---
Fantastic thanks again!
---
You could use more "modifier" like shit+key or ctrl+key.
---
I think you use the default "Z" to move forward, what I do is using "E" to move forward which move your hand a little on the right on your keyboard and let u use more key.
---
You also could put yourself in dangerous situations, forcing you to use all your toolkit instead of just your basic rotation abilities, idk aggro more mob, try to kill elite, do some pvp
---
Do you know at what point this becomes noticeable, like does the radius decrease every level you have above a mob or do you need to be double/triple a mob's level to get a single decrease?
---
Guidelime detects what quests you've done and whats in your questlog, but the first few levels might be a bit clunky cause of quests you've done already etc. It should even out fast tho
---
Is there like calculation? For example, I want to know how much resistnace i need to resist the spell 30% of the time.
---
I have more than one character, stop assuming.
---
That's a fairly conservative estimate as well.
---
R/wowservers
---
If you are at 3 days, 10 hours (82 hours), you are closer to 4 hours a day than 2, my friend.
---
No, abusing layering in open world to gain unfair advantage over players not spamming "invite for layer" over global chat most definitely breaks EULA and is reportable. 
---
Layering is not there for you to escape pvp or get another herb/orb/quest mob, but to offset server load - and you change layers while getting in party with person from other layer to be able to do some activity together.
---
Wanna abuse it - your call, but at least let's not pretend that it's not abusing game feature in not intended way. No one can be dumb enough to believe that rationalization of their shitty behavior.
---
Doesn’t seem like he’s bragging. He’s just trying to get head from his wife. Why is that unbelievable? You made bro?
---
There are some people who have theorycrafted routes / quests etc etc to lvl up as fast as possible. record is in like 3day played. 
---
it also depends on class that you are playing
---
for mage / hunter it will be much faster the. for palladin / warrior. i mean if they play solo. 
---
the guy who hit world first 60 in classic (Jokerd i belive correct if im wrong) trained for this ever since classic was announced. and when he hit 60 he deted his character.
---
but as other guy said. dont worry about lvling speed. Enjoy the ride friend
---
Good to know my triceps will get blasted since AH is the only thing i have going for me. I vanish if i'm in danger, get teleported to dungeons, am 60, and never win anything!
---
Dunno off-hand, there might be something a Google search will pull up. After so many hours I just kind of feel the distance now.
---
You go to war that's what you do. Or grind somewhere because there really isn't any other alternatives. Around 39 you can do dushwallow marsh effcienctly, then 40 badlands.
---
LF help with warrior axe quest
---
I'm glad to see this. People were being very pessimistic yesterday, thinking the exploiters who get off scot free
---
Totally that's why the game shipped without it
---
Seconding this. I've been leveling quite fast because I know what to do and use Questie, but the journey is still the best part of the game to me.
---
What? this is backwards.
---
Pre nax with same BIS gear, Warrior stomps everything. It's not a contest.
---
Probably because of layering aswell :) are you horde or ally?
---
That makes sense, thank you!
---
Nah, son, you were never level 60 in Vanilla. Nice try at defending dogshit retail though. 
---
Retail will always be a literal piece of shit compared to any expansion before WOTLK. That is the objective reality, that is the objective truth, get over it.
---
But spaming SM by streamers is ok. Way to go blizz
---
I bet there are lot of parents out there who want to know how to get their childrens accounts into that state :)
---
Is there a instruction manual available for people who never played WOW how to do that?
---
It's the BIS pet!
---
This is an amazing reply. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to help me with this.  
---
I still think it would be amazing if you could have a macro that you enable on click rather than hold for the same functions. But alas, this is still a better way to do it than holding shift imho.  
---
Thank you so very much.
---
Well I don't care to help people who claim they tried to google something when they either didn't or they can't read.
---
Try Badlands
---
Badlands is also an option, I went there at 38 after the zones you listed. I have completely avoided STV
---
It's spelled BOIS 
---
Thank you very much.
---
wow. Thanks.
---
Fishing my fam. It's heavily underrated.
---
unbelievable that this abuse was possible ... you'd think blizzard would have considered how bad this could be.
---
Lol, safely farm....I farmed that stuff on lvl 35 and the trolls still took a ton of consumables to get through. Luckily Horde players ahead of the curve ignored me most of the time but you still have to kill like 90 Trolls if not more. Buying the charms is incredibly expensive too...at least it was 2 weeks ago.
---
Open world aoe farm scarlet mobs in WPL
---
do some men believe that if the world goes one day without hearing about their dick, it’ll fall off or something? it’s probably one of the most annoying parts of playing any game online
---
Not only would I have thanked you, but I would have attempted to give you some form of compensation. 
---
Bothersome that you couldn't even get a TY, but I'm glad one person made your efforts worth it.
---
Been doing something similar to this to complement my regular exercise, though only when leveling up. Has been fantastic to avoid gettign stiff while playing for long stretches of time. I'm fifteen years older than I was in Vanilla, gotta take care of those joints! Looking into getting a sit/stand desk too so I can mix it up a bit (better for the shoulders).
---
No it can’t. We had her down to 30% and quest worked
---
If you played since Vanilla you know that the core gameplay slowly died between TBC and mid WotLK. Achievements were a part of that, which you would know if you played back then.
---
Yeah, also if you have to start fresh you now have the choice of picking the exact same race+class again (because obviously you only pick min/maxed race combos) and probably level pretty much the same way for another 150-200 hours, or you pick a different class but now when your first acc gets unbanned you have to maintain 2 subs at the same time if you want to play both characters.
---
Yesterday Stromgarde was camped by at least 2 60s and some high 40s allies. There is no real fighting back in such a situation for a (couple) mid to high 30s horde(s)
---
The people you gave it to that didn't thank you probably didn't know what it was and thought you where dumping junk om them or something. I wouldn't have known what it was. Like me, there's a lot of new players out there. Also, every single time I stand around in the auction house trying my best at understanding leveling sewing or whatever it's called, someone comes up to me and trades me something. Most of the time it's useless crap.
---
Hahah, yessir!
---
God what a sound bloke
---
10 hours?? Legit?
---
I'm only level 19 and I've been playing at least 5 hours a day for 5 days. Admittedly i spent a lot of time RPing and I am anything but efficient at levelling.
---
Playing the long con.
---
So when do you sleep?
---
Nah. Scorpid poison is exclusive for scorpids.
---
As a priest, if someone gave me a greater magic wand at low level I would be deeply in their debt. Not all heroes wear capes sir and you are one of them. Glad one person remembered you though!!
---
As a tank, I don't think this rule is always hard and fast rule (maybe is a good choice 90% of the time). I'm okay watching my dps soak up a bit of damage or even doing some kiting while I'm tanking the rest of the mobs. Sometimes that saves some damage off me if I have a weak healer or the mobs hit especially hard.
---
But I do she's that let's make the run go fast but not so fast we wipe. Fast and smooth is my preferred dungeon run.
---
Did anyone test this themselves?
---
Hi, /u/Tautogram

He means that AoE farming does not teach you to play your class, the option to AoE farming to level is spamming frostbolt.
---
Because you have to target them.
---
No it's not. It's about respawning resources inside instanced zones. Moron. No one is getting even a slap on the wrist for spawning normal mobs. Even if someone was spawning black lotus or something the ban would be for economic reasons. Moron.
---
I'm level 50 and I'll gank level 55s, ill gank 45s, fuck ill gank a level 1 if the opportunity arose.  All for no reward, other than the pure satisfaction I get knowing I just took a giant shit in your cereal.
---
... A-Are you trolling?
---
&gt;clever use of game mechanics
---
It's not a clever use. 
---
It's literally the defined use of layering. You see new people and mobs because you're on a..different layer.
---
i do not know about how feasible is to level only in dungeons, but it sounds doable. I am at the moment leveling in with protection talents (only lvl 30) because all the time i play with another mage. Solo might be a completely different story. Also, after lvl 50 i read that dps spec warriors start to become rather mediocre at tanking, so this is also a plus to go full tanking.
---
The thing i would like to add, or rather debate, because i'm am not sure, are the talent points. 
---
First off, is a warrior tank using heroic strike at all? It is a huge rage dump which might be otherwise used on Revenge, Shied Block or Sunder Armor, most of the time, all of which sound like a better choice for tanking. Most of the guides i saw for tanking specs that also deal some damage (because damage is the main threat tool even for tanks) involves the Impale talent. 
---

---
This is the talent points which to me seem like better choices, but like i said, i am not experienced with warrior tanking and would like to know other peoples opinions.
---
I agree, I have played since vanilla and think retail is more enjoyable,that said retail could learn a lot from classic especially when it comes to difficulty and  the overall lvling experience.
---
That nice guy stole my intended name!
---
Add-on for the nameplates please?
---
To make you come on reddit and make posts about them.
---
Well, op can rethink his life decisions and become a monk driven by his guilt and go on pilgrimage. Also make an oath to help each ally with their escor quests wearing green boots.
---
Josh is one of the good ones. Enjoyed watching some of his GTA RP streams in the past. Glad he made a statement to that whole affair that couldn't really be any more concise.
---
My point is pvp encounters in the open world.
---
Isn't Judgement of Wisdom ppm (proc per minute)-based which means that the proc-chance goes down with faster weapon-speed. (note: base-weapon-speed. Speedbuffs like Seal of the Crusader should increase your proc-rate)
---
Mobs instantly spawning occured in vanilla, sometimes randomly but some mobs were just bugged, it was an issue on my warr especially in caves. There was a worg in a stable in BS that if you killed whilst the other worgs nearby were dead would always spawn instantly for example, skinned that guy for hours.
---
And drop rates idk about tbh, they were all made substantially easier in TBC but in vanilla there were a ton of quests you skipped to level efficiently simply because you'd be killing 50 of something for 1 item and it was too far to be worth it. I've done a few ”20% drop, need 5" quests in classic where I've done nearly an entire level just to finish it though lol.
---
He's the only cat that has a 1 second atk speed; but the DPS is the same. This is good for PvP to interrupt casters and for PvE DPS to trigger criticals more often than the others. However, there are much easier to attain cats with 1.2 speed which you can tame in Alterac Mountain until you are comfortable enough to camp this cat.
---
Note; there are two bat types which has 1.0 speed also.
---
Git bueno kiddo
---
I found someone selling 5 and talked them down to 2.25g each :D
---
fishing.
---
Yay. Glad that this is happening. #nochanges
---
Having an actual raid schedule, having a lvl restriction e. g. Only lvl 40+, cool name, mature and experienced leadership.
---
What I don't want is all those social guilds that all are the same #niceandfriendly. No one wants to play with jerks, if your guilds best selling point is the lack of ass holes then it's probably not a good guild.
---
Guilds that only want to promote something like their discord or something else.
---
Well Blizzard disagree so go send an email to yourself and complain. Moron.
---
Who poops in 3 minutes?
---
They kill you because they know you’ll do something like come all the way to reddit to complain about it. Honestly though.

In Diablo 3 Blizzard flags accounts  rolls out bans in waves, because constantly banning people left and right makes it easier for the bot creators to spot and patch whatever made the bot trigger the Warden. I agree that too many cheaters slip through, but bans do happen. Take it from me--someone who has had 2 accounts banned due to botting. Cheating ain't worth it folks; shame it cost me like 100 euro before realizing it.
---
You have the weirdest keybinds
---
You can sort on wowhead, items by level and type and rarity, then see where they come from. Check AH for some low level blacksmithing ones to fill in if you absolutely need to wear plate.
---
you must be really fun at parties, if you ever are invited to one?
---
People exploiting layers. Meanwhile I never switched a layer since classic launch
---
You know those kegs have random spawns all around the bunker right?
---
See my last post. You’re late to the party brother. I already accepted I missed that part. Try and be a nice person. Toxicity doesn’t help the world.
---
Rank14losSA is available on GitHub for Classic IIRC
---
.
---
You can? I feel when I right clicked their name I didn’t see an option. I’ll have to recheck
---
Couldn't have said it any better.
---
Thanks for the tip. Emailed. Have a nice day x
---
The reward is reddit posts crying about pvp on a pvp server while claiming not to be crying about pvp on a pvp server.
---
It says in the customer support that I can right click the name in chat to do it but that's not true.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/AfuQhwJ](https://imgur.com/a/AfuQhwJ)
---
If they aren't in my vicinity (which they wouldn't be as bots/farmers on level 1 accounts) it doesn't let me target them either.
---
Ty I will check it
---
fucking this!
---
the most mana efficient healing that any class can do in leveling is priest with their biggest available heals (until you get a lot +healing gear). 
---
Thats why every good Priest guide tells you to go full shadow because healing is a joke in classic.
---
God Layering...
---
When first announced I hated it. Thought it would ruin my Classic experience
---
Then Classic launched and it took like 2 hours to cleat the Elwynn Forest quests because of the number of people there, so I warmed to it
---
Now this? God damn it...
---
IIRC these long crowd control abilities like sap and sheep are reduced to 12 seconds in PvP. Because it is absolutely ridiculous to keep some one sheeped for 60 seconds, it is not fun for the other player.
---
If you have a blacksmithing friend, you can get some decent mithril plate gear from them. Apart from that, you'll have to wait for random drops or scour the AH.
---
But I honestly wouldn't worry too much about plate. A mail or even leather item with better stats will server you better than a bad plate item.
---
It is, but you dont expect a different result. You expect the same result but a better version of it. You dont kick a shin 1000 times and expect the next kick to decapitate youe opponnent.
---
It feels like the wand suddenly gets the same 0.5 cast time Auto Shot does on Hunters. You get the same delay when you're being hit, it's very noticeable as Priest when you're shielded and when you're not.
---
If you like retail, then you *are* the casual moron that everyone thinks you are. Because retail **is** **in** **fact** **made** for the casual pleb, so in turn, if you enjoy retail, you are unknowingly agreeing that you are this person.
---
I love working hard in order to achieve something, it makes it so much more enjoyable to earn. It's in our nature, it's documented millions of times in psychological studies - there is absolutely no denying the mass flood of statistics to prove you wrong.
---
Therefore, you are an ignorant pleb.
---
Laugh in  teamviewer from work on my phone
---
I'm concerned by your keybinds. How do you play with that?
---
yeah I agree, 2 of my IRL friends didn't play in a decade or so and while both came back for classic they are now on retail 
---
im enjoying classic of course but overall retail offers much better gameplay
---
Let people play however they want. I personally hoped for Classic to be released for years and I rushed to 60 in a bit less than 5 days /played with a total of 12 days 15 hours /played on my main. I‘ve cleared MC and Ony several times now, am full-prebis with some raid gear (T2 head and pants), all professions maxed and epic mount from another faction. And you know what? I‘ve had an absolute blast so far, and there‘s no end in sight. I‘ve started leveling an alt (25 currently), where I take it a bit slower instead of rushing everything.
---
&gt;People can and usually do learn from mistakes
---
No they dont. There's a reason "exploit early and exploit often" is a catchphrase. Blizz needs to end that shit as early as possible in classic. People should hear about an exploit and instantly think "yo fuck that"
---
All I can see is a giant douchebag in the corner of the screen
---
His wife needed healing irl.
---
It’s a power thing. Obviously You have it over the lower level player that corrupts some people. 
---
I generally don’t gank lowbies, however if I’m spat on or an alliance low level player /yells for help I dispatch them, usually in a fashion I find funny, melee hitting them to death as a caster, or if in water or near water I’ll sheep drown them, or if they are being chased by mobs I’ll nova them in place and let the mobs eat them. 
---
Everyone has their own reasons for doing it on occasion that is an insight into why I sometimes kill low level players.
---
Precasted healing spells.
---
i know the meme is its so easy but honestly i think a lot of more casual guilds will have some difficulty in mc and ony
---
for one ony agro onto dps after she lands can easily wipe a raid but tuat is easy enough to learn
---
about 4 of the mc bosses have mechanics that can be a bit hard under geared or if you have poor organisation. there is several things raids could do on pservers that flat out does not even work on retail
---
one example is having a hunter kite domo while the raid kills the adds just does not work, in one practice we also did this on garr and had the hunter kite away the adds which we didnt need to do but i highly doubt works on classic but worked fine on pservers
---
What makes you say rogues are linear in pvp gameplay? Not passive aggressive, honestly just curious.
---
I love that Ven and Ziqo, who by the way have competed in Blizzcon tournaments and currentlycommentate them in an offical capacity for Blizzard, who's livelihoods are WoW, are going to perform this blatant exploit and get their account into bad standing, just for some phase 1 blue items... all because 'weedmaster15' says so. fkn lol
---
Well. Currently you don't get anything from any PVP you do. So in fact it doesn't make a difference if I kill someone my Level or 15 Levels lower.
---
That is why I kill everything that moves just to make the opposing faction suffer a bit more.
---
I know the same happens to my fellow alliance. That is why I do it :P
---
Better that the just the blind guild invites
---
this. so much this.
---
I’m sticking it out on an underdog alliance server so I can enjoy quick big queues whilst the majority horde gonna be waiting 50 minutes for a wsg
---
I see. Thank you. Hex is Arcane spell correct?
---
Yeah I spent all my gold last night because i wanted to make the shiny blue recipe boots I just unlocked with tailoring lol.
---
Back to killing spiders and venture Co bros tonight :)
---
If the Mage is not needed for a Poly just go right ahead and pull, I'll join in soon enough.  
---
I hate being the only one out of mana and having the tank wait for me.
---
Or threat meters, for the impatient.
---
What add-ons to people recommend? Particularly quest ones
---
Start at the end and work your way back to the front to see causality.
---
You = Esfand, Sodapopping, Towelliee, Staysafe
---
I hope your friend "messes" with you by taking the first 6 Blackcrows that drop for you 🤗
---
I am currently using bustea's guide and I have been since around lvl 22 I love it! The first level or so was a little clunky (run these places) mainly because I didn't have the flightpoints etc needed for the rest of the guide and I had already completed some of the quests listed. I now use it on all my characters and I gotta say its streamlined very well. Being dependent on the Guidelime addon means u have plenty of functionality especially since u can scroll forwards in the guide to see where it is going to take you along with the fact if it says to go org and train then return you can tick the box basically auto completing that step if you know you do not need those spells etc
---
That's so cozy
---
&gt; AND get rid of layering asap ffs.
---
Not sure how many layers there are on my realm, but people are literally fighting over every quest mob. It's like the hunger games. Sometimes not even quest mobs, just mobs. Like anything. I've ran around in a circle for 5 minutes not seeing a single mob that wasn't instantly tagged. So not sure how removing layering would work out there lol.
---
On the plus side, skinning is really easy to level. Trivial, really.
---
If youre this bothered by an equally leveld player ganking you then you shouldnt have picked a pvp server
---
This picture invites more questions than answers. 
---
Most importantly: how do you plank in WoW?
---
It's not "perceived", it's objectively unfair advantage and people do it deliberately - as in there is clear intent to willingly abuse layering mechanic. Its not worth getting month ban over it, but 24-48 hours ban for abusers would be healthy for game in the long run.
---
just bind all your keys around WASD... its much more comfortable when you don't have to rush over the screen with your mouse only to click one spell after another... might wanna just press E and then Q.
---
YOJAMBA FOREVER
---
bruh
---
you mean ganking like 3 grey players? with 9? yeah those are the moments. Lol Thank god I switched to alliance this is embarrassing. Can't wait for BGs
---
I'd say the chest piece is the way better reward, it'll last you into your 30s and has stats that benefit your damage. Staff of westfall has Stam and spirit, which I guess isn't totally useless, but green 2handers with agi would be more useful because while leveling you're rarely gonna need to actually melee if you're properly kiting and managing aggro with your pet. That Staff of Westfall on a warrior however, now that's some leet damage (what I chose for my warrior on this playthrough).
---
I'm 32 and the tusks are quite hard for me. Super long fights, the shamans can even kill me sometimes. Additionally, that place is farmed 24/7 by at least 10 people. Fucking hate this quest already and my potential savior stopped playing :(.
---
Noggenfrogger?
---
honestly, you shouldn't be pulling 4-6 mobs as feral. Swipe is horrible. It hits only 3 targets and does almost no aggro. At 4-6 enemies, it's very likely that someone just will never get a hit from you.
---
Feral tank is great at single target threat generation. He's awful at aoe tanking in Classic.
---
Is it ***unfair*** though ?  
---
I wouldn't put seeing NPC's in the same pot as respawning dungeon bosses 50 times to obtain loot in a fraction of the time.
---
i've resorted to leveling during the least common hours i can manage my schedule around.
---
Wrong that Hunter and warrior should be a lock and mage
---
Wait, someone from Gravediggers, the one guild that pretty much kills every alliance on sight, or tries to and then /w me why I didnt help when they died, helped you with that? There must be a hidden agenda.
---
Horde, nearly 40, and I've completely avoided Dustwallow, par picking up the first aid book and the flight path. I was planning to finish up the Stromgarde quests + the last few Nesingwary quests before heading to Tanaris, then Feralas and Hinterlands at some point. Is there any point in me heading to Dustwallow? 
---
Same question applies to the Badlands. A guildie was telling me you need to quest there to get a lot of the quests for Uldaman
---
what have you been doing if you don't mind me asking?
---
I play on Gehennas and the queue starts to build up i find around 2-3pm UK time. Around 5pm you're looking at about a couple of hours wait.
---
It is always two sided (the same as being in healer range in raids). It is on both sides to position correctly one to another.
---
A post that mentions thankless players so I share my experience about thankless players. But fuck me right? Lmao
---
No they didn't. People are just mega salty, those people are smart enough to not abuse it
---
That's just Gnasty.
---
this isn't new though, this is something that has been happening as long as there have been guilds. and complaining on here isn't going to make it go away
---
50,000 people used to gank here...
---
Heard this one in game.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rank14lossa-classic friend of mine just updated it
---
... I am totally using this to prank one of my guildies.
---
About 70s-1g each on both servers I'm on. Don't think many people can afford that at lvl 30.
---
Why is that? Wasn't there a calculation here recently with the result that the sword's extra swing is a higher DPS increase on average?
---
Let me know how those packs of 4-6 dragonkins in Sunken Temple works out for you, then. Either 4 elites or 3 elites and 3 whelps.
---
Dude, I'll take it as a compliment that you think I didn't draw parts of this.   But really that's quite an accusation.
---
I drew all the "assets" by hand.   The murloc and banner for Undercity were drawn by me and scanned into Illustrator, then imported to this map in photoshop.   I can even prove it to you tomorrow evening when I get home from work (to my notebook).    The murloc itself was me freehand copying someone else's style, but I drew it.
---
I've never used wonderdraft.   Here is the original drawing [https://flic.kr/p/2hgEV76](https://flic.kr/p/2hgEV76)   (complete with the hills I forgot to shade in the centre).
---
One final thing, please can you link to where these are in wonderdraft?   If someone is using my art, I'd like to know about it.
---
Can’t wait to be mid dungeon and asking for a break to do my jumping jacks. I’m going to live this, awesome idea.
---
Still waiting to encounter a single DPS who has any idea what threat even is. Seriously, in the ~40 odd dungeons I've done from 15-60 as a priest healer I've barely healed a tank, because they never have aggro. DPS are all bursting into different targets before the Warriors charge even reaches the fucking pack. At least the mob damage is low enough that it doesn't matter I guess.
---
True, but orc can go into blood fury which is similar.
---
from 52 and onward you can do torch runs as a mage.  52 - 60 in a day.
---
Racism is not about whether you consider somone as inferior. It is about wether you display contempt towards them.
---
For Warlocks, in terms of leveling, spell power is king.
---
Once you get life tap + drain life, the more health return you get from drain life the more you can life tap, and also you kill things faster.
---
Int doesn't have shit on Spell power in terms of leveling.
---
Yeah I helped a paladin and he came back at me with a druid in stealth. Not only that but he laughed at me when I died. I dont know why but it made me so angry that I had to just take ress sickness and hearth and log out.
---
My rule for pigs when I tank: Attack what I'm attacking. If you yank it, you tank it.
---
Did torch run farms from 56-58 as i felt questing was taking ages.
---
I died inside whiles getting those two levels.
---
I have never been happier questing and have promised myself to quest til 60
---
I like both though. I'm not sure how liking a game makes me a moron, maybe more casual though I think that M+ and mythic raiding are harder than anything in Classic, at least until Naxx which I didn't do during vanilla so I can't speak on. 
---
I never said that Classic wasn't good, I said I think retail is better. I do have more going on in life at 30 than I did at 16 when I started playing, and maybe that's all true, but I didn't say it was objectively better, I said I am enjoying it more. 
---
Not sure why people are so fragile over someone having a different opinion. 
---
I
---
Nice !
---
I mean I was level 7. Maybe that's just not in the spirit of things.
---
it is if the priest is doing dps and occasionally looks at health bars ;)
---
Well the entire server has equal layers; if one zone has 5 due to population, then the server has 5 for all zones, which is why even lvl 60 areas can be farmed for materials with layering even though the zone is quiet. 
---
It seems to imply though that pop cap is higher due to layering. If it can’t handle questing populations now then I’m not sure how they plan to handle massive world pvp in phase 2 on one layer with the same number of players. Orgimar already lags as it is even with layers.
---
its weird tho. you fatten them up and give it some beer and suddenly theyre super cool.
---
I didn't say it was inferior, calm down. 
---
I was referencing certain streamers and the like who basically did exactly what I said... complained for years about retail and all its flaws, wanting classic to return for reasons X and Y, missing the danger and excitement of world PvP, having gold mean something... annnnnnnd then immediately did exactly the opposite of everything that.
---
You're most welcome to play any way you please, but if you say you want one thing and then do another I'm probably going to mock you for it.
---
Think it's dog eat dog. Someone done it to me so I'll do it to another. Not my attitude but sure it's others.
---
The "Off with ya!" works better.
---
You can install a threat meter - details! comes with one - too. The casual instruction is to let the tank get 3 sunders in before applying yellow damage. 
---
If a mob is skull marked, kill that first. If you start pulling, stop dpsing that mob, pref. switch to the one the tank is hitting.
---
If you're just clearing low-level trash this matters less, as your group will probably out-DPS them before they hurt you, but for tougher trash and bosses it might become a bit more important.

Non-prot warriors and lower-level warriors have problems generating rage, too, which means that managing multiple enemies is pretty tough - if that's the case, at least I'd prefer if most of the DPS is targeted towards a) the mob i'm hitting b) the mob i'm hitting next c) a mob that is about to die
---
And yet I get downvoted for it haha.
---
Read the comments again, do a little thinking and then edit your comment so you don't look like an idiot.
---
Dude it's obvious; Waladin
---
This!
---
Also teach your tanks, not everyone know's the ins and outs of vanilla. There is this and a ton of other small details that aint explained everywhere, and majority havenever played warriors before, or even on "vanilla servers".
---
Nah just give everyone on that realm infinite gold, BiS in every slot, and make every mob and boss 1 hp and respawn instantly.
---
You shouldn’t be dying too often, if you are you need to change the way you play. Should really only die if you get ganked or mobs spawn on you while you’re trying to kill something. 
---
Go for green quests and kill everything while you’re travelling, if you’re in a green zone you won’t have trouble killing 1-2 things at a time and your down time will be minimal.
---
i remember always refusing to port people back in the day if they didnt say please when they asked me.
---
i dont care if you offered to pay... manners cost nothing
---
I have three side buttons, with macros and modifiers they let me power shift to all four forms, charge, enrage, bash, prowl, dash, mount and hearth. Frees up a lot of keyboard! u/warpborne's [druid macro guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/) was a massive help.
---
alliance pov : stonetalon is mostly just an annoying rocky path you have to cross to reach desolace. Those damn rocks keep us from autorunning so we kill everything on sight to make the travel less boring.
---
&gt;o have some gorgeous maps, but I just like how you clearly have your own style and think you'd do well putting your own touch on them! Just some food for thought, and keep up the great work.
---
Thanks, I'll definitely consider it!
---
Last few days it has been 1-3 hours queue past 5pm server time.
---
Sorry they didn’t thank you, that’s just some rudeness! Glad to see there are players like you out there willing to help the grind out.
---
I sometimes go "Hellfire time!" and go and and give my healer a panic attack.
---
Waiting for the tank to get sunders up before falling asleep is the hardest part of classic so far for me
---
Stop putting words in his mouth and start reading...
---
Like he said the other option to AoE farming is questing which is spamming frostbolt instead of blizzard. 
---
He didn't talk about pvp
---
You mean bezerker rage?
---
Sure that negates stun, sap and fear but not Charm or Sleep
---
This tanking thing remembers me so much of vanilla. Standing infront of dm for almost 2 hours because not finding a tank. Vanilla getting a lvl 17 druid and wipe at vc because tank died. Group wasn‘t pissed we wished ourselves a nice journy and went to bad. Good guys
---
&gt; in the early 50s
---
found your problem mate
---
WTF and Interface folders in your WoW folder.
---
&gt; This damage can subsequently proc your own Reckoning and if your tank is also a Paladin, it can proc their Reckoning at the same time. Huge damage 
---
what happens if both paladins have Blessing of Sacrifice on each other?
---
Layering doesn't effect how many people a server can support.
---
Layering distributes the number of players so that you don't have 5,000 people on one layer all fighting for the same quest mob. Instead you have a few hundred people spread across a dozen layers.
---
Probably, but I think he's right. Remember last year when that woman got hit by a self-driving car? It made national news, even though people die in auto accidents every day and it was her fault for illegally crossing the road in the darkness with no light while cars were going ~60 mph on it.
---
Warlock is much better pve and pvp hunter levels faster
---
Ty !
---
it's called being a druid in classic.
---
People who make dictionaries.
---
I’ll definitely do that! Thanks!
---
Used zygor tons in modern wow and it was incredible. In classic it’s not great. I suspect after 6 months or so it will be much better.
---
&gt; I want to do it isnt super difficult to /gquit and find
---
Use the Blizzard forums and MMO champion etc. and leave a post stating your goals/ethos.
---
Lower damage things have a lower chance of breaking fear iirc. Dots and drain life are all low ticks of damage but when you go against an affliction warlock they can throw 4 dots on you, spam fear, and then drain your life causing tons of low damage ticks to hit a lot
---
Congrats, you managed to post the same whitty comment at 3 others
---
Probably in retail, since it was changed to no longer be a terrible joke item with negative stats, but not in Classic  I would assume?
---
I don't remember it ever being vendorable in vanilla.
---
Easy. Die
---
I might be wrong, but being feared through a dungeon portal weren't possible. You just got feared through the portal animation to the other side.
---
How about reading the comment lmao
---
Thanks a lot! I had similliar thoughts. Like you say, I'll just wait for lvl 60 to farm some gold first + devilsaur skins for BiS. Really helped me to make my mind!
---
The replace the bones with bread.
---
Cataclysm was the beginning of the end. I mostly stopped during WotLK as well, I was super casual and pretty young at the time, so I just got bored of the game, so I dont know the full story with all the ups and downs, but from what I understand switching to the new engine fucked up a lot of stuff, the entire world of Azeroth changed with Cataclysm and is unrecognizable, and the sense of community died
---
lol thats kinda morbid, first you save her THEN you go back to murder her
---
Is the XP really that great? I know the mobs give very little XP in that torch room.
---
Aaah ok, thx for the clarification
---
And what if the banned IP is assigned to a different user on the same ISP?
---
I agree completely with you on everything. I'm not saying you owed them anything. Just asked if you all put the cards on the table before hand. I meant when you were still part of the group before the whispers saying you intended to need on the roll as well. 
---
But for what i read from your post the best course of action was to just leave.
---
Whispering back is just utter nonsense.
---
use atlas loot addon.  
---
There you can see item drops from bosses in Dungeons.  
---
Might be helpful, or just wait for random drops
---
I used to play Druid tank - I'm now playing priest. I'm having some good chuckles watching the poor tanks in my groups try to hold aggro when the DPS are clueless. Mostly it's fine, I'm sub-40 atm so it's not a problem keeping everyone up - but I think some people are in for a rude awakening in later instances.
---
I thought about mentioning addons, but figured I should get people learning the better way haha
---
We had a thing happen in Legion where we cleared a bunch of bosses in the raid, got loot, and the instance server just straight-up died, hard, everyone got disconnected.
---
The raid ID just vanished. We had the loot, but no lockout. We cleared the bosses again and got more loot.
---
Thanks!   I'm afraid you may be waiting some time though :)
---
if time is an issue but you still want to do them, write down the number and do them in the next mana break or something.
---
Makes sense. Wanted to make sure we weren't being slow by not looking for larger pulls. Thanks.
---
Ask them why they invited the tank, his dps is really low.
---
I use a Razer Naga mouse, I just hold shift and use the mouse buttons 1-12 on the side.
---
Aaaaand that’s why we stay out of Westfall.
---
Is it really bragging? I mean I think it's kinda funny. Used to know people who would type silly -afk- messages all the time, mostly to get out of bad groups or to try to elicit a response. I think its kinda funny, especially if he actually got the BJ!! You seem insecure and unhappy for no reason.
---
Why does there need to be a difference between saying "brb gotta shit" and "brb gotta grab something to eat" or "brb getting a quick blowjob".  
---
Idk we're all grownups and personally I don't find this problematic, his wife might not like that he's so open about it but why should anyone else be offended?
---
Will do, thank you.
---
How do you kill your world chat?
---
There's a lot of mages that will just train you, get ready for that also :)
---
Default set would be  
---
Bagnon - better inventory   
---
Questie - show this quest givers in the building  
---
Bartender4 - making action bars properly configurable  
---
LeatrixPlus - quality of life changes like autosell trash/auto-repair/auto resurrect/show vendoring prices/etc  
---
Auctioneer\Auctionator  - to make your auction experience less painfull
---
OmniCC - to see CD in meaningful values  
---
SexyMap (because I like bigger minimap :)
---
Wish I knew
---
&gt; Raids. Paladins can't tank RAIDS.
---
No one said anything about dungeons.
---
ummm They can tank at 60 and even do raids. It just requires more attention and a good guild to pull it off. Its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work. I don't suggest it for new new players to wow classic though.
---
its always a good idea to keep the blood flowing.
---
Haha gaylliance! That was sick bro super burn!! Got his dumb ass hahaha you’re the man
---
Big fat nope from everyone who don't want merges.
---
Or is it cake?
---
But his mean something cause they fit your argument
---
&gt; you dont have to use that exact ability. 
---
yes.. yes you do
---
thats exactly how you learn it
---
you can learn prowl by standing in IF and having your pet use that ability.
---
In vanilla, there were no implementation of account-wise items. All of them are bind to character. After an update (WOTLK maybe), binds on account thing has started on heirlooms / little critters etc.
---
**USE**

 I bought my first one at 120g..... thinking it was a lot more rare. Then saw another for 20-40g and bought that too. 😃
---
not only begging, but begging for an illegal private server... next level
---
If that's your idea of a fun time, you're doing something wrong.
---
Get auctionator. Super simple and improves your AH experience a lot
---
its good vs czhun it overwrite his debuff if ur in his stormache
---
Gateway drug.
---
You contiunue harping about whatever it is that is bothering you while ignoring the actual topic. I play the game, sit in queues, run through maxed out zones and am in favor of everything that makes my experience more fun and less annoying. I don't like sitting in queue and I don't like running around in a circle waiting for mob spawns. I don't keep track of who supports what and frankly I don't care. If that's mindless and pathetic to you, then by all means keep crying about fanboys and the quality of this subreddit, but just keep in mind that the people supporting layering might not be the people who were part of whatever consensus you thought existed against it. That's how public forums work, sometimes new people join or start posting after previously being silent. But it sounds like you really want to have something to be angry about, so please don't let this stop you.
---
30 years ago the world wide web was invented.  Also the gameboy came out that year.  Technology has come a very long way in 30 years.   I'd be more surprised if we haven't become fully automated in 30 years than if we hadn't.
---
Why no back workout? Give posterior chain some love too
---
I dont even know when my sub will refresh
---
L2P
---
From my experience healing; a mage generally takes a lot more damage than a tank. Also with one mage in a DPS setup of hunter-spriest-mage, they generally take a while to kill with AoE.
---
Yea this is so true. Always care about my healer. Ty for tips tho.
---
The Thing that solves this Problem is to either not loot while fighting a mob or using your finishing move before you loot.
---
This will not be changed as this is critical to how rogues Play. If you could just throw stuns at People left and right without loosing Combo Points on your main target that's be strong
---
No, as far as i'm aware APES didn't abuse instance layers/ raid layers
---
having the money to buy 6months at once? look at mister rich kid over here
---
These?  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=8347](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8347)  pretty shit stats, might be upgrade as fresh 60 but else it's not rly useful.
---
Thankyou all for the tips! Really apriciate it.
---
Feel like that applies to the Undead as a race rather than Locks in particular haah.
---
You missed square which is usually hunter trap.
---
Don’t think that’s right.  Layers are so that leveling zones don’t get overloaded, because spawns are only sized for X many people per zone.  But once people aren’t crowding a few leveling zones anymore, the server can easily support 10k concurrent users as most will be in IF, instances, etc.
---
Terrible, it doesn’t provide you any offensive stats whatsoever. In PvP it might help you live a little longer, but it’s not absolutely life saving.
---
I think I would become a headhunter
---
vanilla\*
---
I know, but I remember in tbc you could just swim while mounted instead of being dismounted every time and having to re-mount when for example crossing a river.
---
I would love seeing that added into classic just as a quality of life improvement, unless it could be exploited somehow.
---
&gt;I can't believe blizzard destroyed the game that much.
---
It was most decisions made with good intentions.  
---
Bad things just piled up for 15 years. Also Blizzard is the in the hands of parasytic CEOs not caring about their products, just wanting endless profits to increase their paychecks then abandon ship in time at this point.
---
I play ARK with Chinese people. Legit the most dedicated farmers and teammates you'll ever have even when they aimbot and dupe.
---
Welcome to a pvp server
---
Shhh.
---
Watching panicky mages run round in circles is one of the best entertainments in a dungeon run.
---
Are resistances important for pets? If it is which one?
---
list of things that annoys me as a tank :
---
* dps pulling before me. It makes generating rage and getting aggro much more difficult during the fight.
---
* dps starting 5 milliseconds after I pull. bonus point if it's an aoe ability.
---
* dps disregarding marks and attacking watever they feel like attacking.
---
* what OP said.
---
* dps switching target before the 1st one dies. It doesn't have any dots on it. It runs away. It pulls all the mobs. we die.
---
All of that happened in almost every run I did, I guess that's just the new meta we live in.
---
I think fix should be live already
---
I never attacked a horde player unprovoked.
---
Rarely I get along with one. Maybe different on EU and US servers.
---
I can really not understand what is funny in sheeping me 4 times in a row and shooting me down to 30% between sheeps before finally killing me off. Really makes be hate people.
---
Open a ticket and mention his character name and server he will
---
Pretty sure you won't last long in Classic lol, every classes is "slower then retail"
---
" comon vanilla is great i like it in my bones... " hmm no you never liked Classic
---
I was there. A great victory for the Alliance!
---
A couple of things I do to help with this: 
---
1) Whenever I learn a new ability I make a conscious effort to overuse it on the next few mobs I kill as practice. It gives me a feel for the strengths and weaknesses of the ability, and an idea of what situations I might use it in to be most effective. It also gets my hand used to the key bind for it so I don’t have to search it out when I need it. 
---
2) Whenever I make changes to my action bar setup I repeat that process.
---
3) Macros. I haven’t done much with them yet in Classic but I’m assuming here that they can be do what retail macros can. You can create macros that change which ability is cast based on which form you are in. For example, on a druid it does one ability if I am in cat form and another if I am in moonkin form. I imagine you can do the same with stances.
---
They'd probably ransacked at least one tavern.
---
.. which got parried.
---
Can u tell what to turn on ? =)
---
Using Leatrix Plus addon
---
Hillsbrad &amp; Alterac?
---
That’s alot of work to give palas more burst potential though
---
It’s a crafted item so your name is literally on the item as the person who crafted it.
---
There's some better ones, like next to Dalaran where there are already corpses dangling.
---
Weapons damage for instant attack is calculated by normalized weapon speeds ( [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization) ) So your mortal strikes and whirlwinds actually don't hit harder and so it's better to pick the weapon with the better type (or looks ) in this case. (Unless they also had different other stats)
---
I'll try that addon later, thanks.
---
My brother did it last day and did 55 - 60 in an afternoon. Even if you're slow you will at least get 100k/h
---
No one said on stream....its common knowledge as I know people who were doing it with streamers off stream. Blizzard can see it just because the public eye cant. EVERYONE should be held accountable is the point.
---
ye fucking gnome height received blizzard attention
---
\&gt;So having to go through all the mobs first for every pull. 
---
tab -&gt; tab -&gt; tab -&gt; tab  
---
You can do this tabbing in the 3s you wait after tank pulls and he's grabbing aggro.  
---
\&gt;Just mark the damn target. You can even keybind it. It makes the run so much smother for all parties involved.
---
No duh! It's great if that happens! But if your tank/healer aren't marking don't just attack random stuff! Pick the target with the most sunders!
---
It is a bug if the mechanic isn't working the way it was meant to work.
---
Actually, you know what, I was always of the idea that flying mounts really are a good thing when it comes down to it, but I've totally changed my mind of this.
---
In retail on my Druid, I have an OPie addon ring with 35 different teleport locations. Between that and extremely quick flying, I can get anywhere within a minute, and WOW does it make a difference for world size. The Classic world is tiny compared to retail in land mass, but actual travel makes the world HUGE.
---
Create mouseover macros that don't deselect your target. I've seen ways to do blind and other abilities without dropping CP. I wouldn't loot in combat as rogue... weapons are too fast and you lose swings (even 2h it resets swing timer). Maybe after gouge, but still looting during combat usually isn't the best practice.
---
This dino is small, but those are far away
---
I am more lazy, i send them a nice mail that they will get once they reach Brill, that should make them the level for using it.
---
Does this include all pussys who use layering to avoid ganking and leave their brethren to death?
---
I was trying to come up with some simple workouts that didn't require any special equipment, space, or set up.....something like that. what do you recommend?
---
Literally no matter the class you choose, you have basically reached your peak at 30. The people that are having fun just generally love the game or are lost in nostalgia. I hit 60 on a rogue and quite frankly have disliked the class since level 20 but didn't want to restart. Eventually I got too far so it would be a waste of time to restart, now at 60 I have done a bunch dungeons and MC and it really just doesn't get better. The only way I think I would legitimately enjoy myself right now is playing something mind numbing like a mage and just pressing frostbolt on a macro while I watch a show. But at that point why am I paying 15 dollars for a game I don't even play.
---
This is incorrect, the question was never if the server could handle the amount of players. Of course they can. But the World and the resources are designed for around 3,5k players. Therefore they have more layers so each server can hold more than 3,5 without overpopulating the world. A server with 1 layer = aroudn 3-4k players. A server with 4 layers = around 12-16k players. of course layering affect the queues, remove 1 layer and 3-4 more peopla get put into the queue. Its quite simple actually and exactly how blizzard have explained layering to work several times.
---
IIRC they changed stance restrictions on some spells in BC and then in mists they removed all stance restrictions, and then I think in legion they removed stances entirely.
---
Unsubscribe and go back to eating ass 👍
---
I rez, and buff other players usually.  throw a heal or renew their way.
---
Usually, I'm a dick and will PVP at 60, however, since I'm lvling still like everyone else, it's all down to business.  If I got an Alli near me who isn't bothering me, I'll buff/renew them.  Doing this has probably saved me potential headache while grinding.  Tho, anyone who is hostile, gets lit up.
---
Every driver I've ever met was like "I did it for about 6 months and then went insane so I found another job."
---
Warlock here, i have to. If i crit and gain aggro, i die if i stop draining to sustain myself. Sorry :(
---
Warriors play either DW Fury or 2h fury.
---
I do agree that mace spec is underwhelming for PvP compared to sword, but 2h Fury with Sulfuras is bonkers DPS in PvE.
---
If you're okay with answering this...
---
How much do you pay for a hotspot service, how much data do you get, and what is the reception like generally?
---
Absolute chad.
---
Tukui will get you something similar all in one go; it does frames, bars, nags, chat, map the lot
---
I think the fact that it's so upsetting for you, makes it all the more funny for me. Say my name.
---
Lol thunderfury lol.
---
&gt; Night King
---
Ohhh.... yeah. Don't bring him up either.
---
When are people supposed to stop taking phone screenshots again?
---
I imagine its closer to 15 than 5 but its days are definitely numbered.
---
Don’t you find farming spots to be very contested?
---
It was an honour to fight for the Alliance in this battle!   
---
Victory!
---
The trouble i have as a hunter is that i never know if they want me to pull mobs for them or not. Sometimes they get pissed off if i do it and sometimes they tell me off for not doing it.
---
I'm already playing on Bloodsail and Grobbulus as it is.
---
Leveling two warriors, two rogues and a druid is already taxing enough, so I probably won't be making a paladin anytime soon.
---
Did you just fat shame us? How dare you!
---
All male gnomes need to macro /train the most rage inducing sound known to manikin nd
---
if everybody rolls greed, it's safer when everybody rolls need. with need nobody can ninja, with greed it only takes one asshole to wait for the other 4 to roll greed and then need, grab the 200g and leave the party....
---
&gt;	 are they necessary? 
---
Only if you can realize the perceived value in using them. For an example, Questie helps you know exactly where to go for finishing your quests, without it you’ll have to use context clues to figure out where to go.
---
&gt;	And if so, which are the most common ones to use? And of course is it legal to use them
---
I would download the Twitch app and go to the Mods section, click on WoW and then select the classic folder and comb through the most downloaded addons. Almost all addons are legal, the illegal ones (which are more like bots instead of addons) tend to be harder to find and you’ll really have to be knowing what you’re looking for to find them.
---
No instant quest text is the real punishment here
---
That's what TBC will be for in a couple of years.
---
Print Screen
---
You mortal infidel!
---
No. It’s nothing like that at all. That doesn’t spawn extra bosses. That just saves time running.
---
So is rogue. But only warrior complain about leveling
---
It was 9th of January 2007 - when TBC was out
---
As a paladin I use DI so wiping is never really a problem
---
Imo they aren't, unless there are some retards running around needing on everything giving us a bad name. I've been very fair with my need rolls in my opinion, and I go out of my way to help random players with elite quests if needed and usually only roll on preraid bis loot if really nobody else needs it, but still I get a lot of unsollicited hate towards me just for being a hunter. There seems to be this massive community-wide circle jerk of simply hating on hunters just for the sake of it. I'm close to rerolling tbh I'm not having any fun at all feeling like the black sheep in every aspect of the game.
---
Take it to the streamer's subreddit, thanks
---
I recently read „The WoW Diary: A Journal of Computer Game Development“ (John Staats), where it was said that the whole China Skelleton thing was all just a fake thing from China to slow down the release of WoW in China to protect local produced Games. 
---
BTW: Awesome read if your into game development and WoW. I don’t read that many books, but this one I finished within 10 days. So many great stories and facts around all kind of things in the game.
---
No. We're playing classic because we want classic, if we redo specs, talents and so on it won't be classic. 
---
All specs have their purpose, some is better in more situations and some is worse. Arcane mage? PoM pyro in PvP.
---
If we change stuff it simply won't be classic.
---
 /console SET cameraDistanceMax "50"
---
Losing an argument about pvp not existing?  Nah that ain't it chief...
---
Not only that but from buenos aires which was destroyed by the bugs
---
&gt; I'm sure in the coming xpac they will see what they did wrong in BFA and fix it. 
---
I haven't played retail since WoTL, so I can't say myself.  
---
But every current retail player I know keeps saying the same thing after being disappointed over and over again.
---
How do you do it? Remove ways for addons to interact with AH?
---
First, this would be OK if default ui was at least somewhat usable, like sorting for price per item, etc.
---
Second, this wouldn't achieve anything as AH scanning addons will just prompt you to click "next page" manually.
---
Keep safe on the roads friendo. I try and let you guys in when possible!
---
Wym ofc ev ofc as
---
Fuckin kids these days
---
When u need questing addon in a 15 years old game XD
---
I obviously get it and think layer abusing is dumb. But does it really qualify as exploiting? Layering isn't a bug, it's meant to be there.
---
Noggenfrogger isnt too bad in horde vs alliance is it
---
Ahh another Staff of the Ram+6 connoisseur, best backstabbing weapon in the game!
---
It won't be Classic anymore if balance is changed... so no.
---
Never prehot the tank. Renew will be ok most of the time with ocasional heal cast followed by instant renew refresh. Then just stand and wait so your mana regen kicks in
---
Any 2h PvE fury warrior should be setting their sights on Bonereaver's Edge. It's easier to get, doesn't cost any gold, and the armor proc on it is massive.
---
Not saying Sulfuras wouldn't be good in their hands, but when there's a better alternative that's also much less painful to get it really doesn't make sense outside of the warrior wanting to run around with a legendary. Which is a fine reason. If you have a 2h fury in your raid that has a dream of using Sulfuras and has proven capable of farming enough gold for it then I say let them have it.
---
Gandalf the Bald
---
New players to classic might not know the value of a fast wand being gifted at a very low level.
---
In modern wow, you jump on and you start smashing frostbolt and mana is almost never an issue (or you just drink through the issue).
---
So i can understand, a new player being handed a wand, or an OG warr/rogue being handed a wand would be underwhelming until you realize the value it gives you.
---
but yeah, the guys name is stamped on the wand.  thanks should be the easy part.
---
Am I wrong in thinking it used to stack up to 4 in 1.12?
---
Actually I changed my mind, please spend hours hunting down a specific Warlock on one the most popular servers 
---
I'll give 5G if you manage to find me and kill me
---
As a priest I buff random people because I enjoy being helpful to others.
---
A warlock even rewarded me by making top and legs gear for me and giving me a health stone.
---
And I would've been very happy with just a simple thank you lol.
---
No. Go play retail
---
(patch date::2005-05-05): Combo points will no longer be removed if the target is deselected. They will only be removed if a different target is selected. 
---
Foudn the patch
---
I am also a trucker but i Play Old school runescape
---
If someone made such addon, what are the odds it gets taken down?
---
So better to wait a bit (ZG AQ NAXX) before to switch yes?
---
I'm ok with that, and if i see that i can't fine a spot in any raid i'll switch asap and do just some pvp, we'll see.
---
Thank you all guys for the infos!
---
Do they need it? Yes. Should they be? No.
---
We're playing with a time capsule, if you pick and choose changes to make the whole purpose of the project is defeated and we'll be back to square 1 with people wanting vanilla servers.
---
While working on the Defias quests in the hills of Westfall I died and was on a long run back but was rezzed unexpectedly. I couldn't see any players capable of casting rez when I came to and feel bad for missing the thank-you. I'll be surrogate for that rogue and you can be surrogate for my mystery rezzer: THANK YOU! :)
---
I don't exactly agree with you. I've been playing the same duo comp with my brother from day 1. We've been constantly pulling 4-5 mobs, doting everyone of them.
---
It's true that it's been way faster since 30 and sweeping strikes, but it doesn't mean you should pull single mobs.
---
There's so much loot quest that you'll have to kill tons of mobs, better kill them faster.
---
Why?
---
GNOOOOME!\~
---
 more impressed how fast you can type
---
It depends you can get local gigs if you already have your cdl and training, but you can expect to pay 5 or 6 grand for any half decent school and that is also seven full time weeks where you won't earn any income.  The big difference is doing long haul program will typically pay for your CDL in exchange for a contract for a year or two.
---
People are allowed to like things man, you shouldn't simply insult people because they like something you hate. I don't particularly like retail myself, but I don't care if people do, and understand why they might. 
---
Being able to sink as little time as possible into something and still experience most of the content available is completely understandable. Did it kill a lot of the enjoyment we got from putting a lot of effort into things? Yes it did. 
---
Did it also kills off a lot of the social aspect of the game that was a big part of it's enjoyment? Yes it did. 
---
Are people idiots for liking retail? No they're not, maybe they simply don't have the time to sink they used to, and that's okay.
---
You should try to let people state their opinions without jumping on them about it.
---
Don't try to defend him being a douche.
---
I'm pretty sure spells can randomly break earlier. Especially the warlock's fear if the target takes any damage. But also polymorph and sap just randomly. 
---
I searched a bit on google and it seemed that, in the months leading up to release of classic, there were some discussions on the duration of PvP CC. Seemed like it should be about 12-15 seconds and then have diminishing returns (i.e. if you CC twice in a row then the second time the duration is halved).
---
both of your examples arent even true....
---
I want to see how this effects streamers to be honest.
---
I've played a holy-priest (with 5 in wand and spirit-tap though) on a private-server up to level 47 and have a druid right now that is level 40.
---
The druid doesn't even have a single point in restoration and so far I have successfully healed through every dungeon. Of course I use a full set of healing gear with Spirit, Int and Healing-Bonus.
---
The healing itself feels almost the same. As the priest I almost exclusively cast "Heal" and "Greater Heal". As the druid I almost exclusively cast healing-touch. For both classes that's their respective best heal when it comes to mana-efficiency.
---
As the priest I could wand enemies when the situation doesn't require to heal. As the druid I have to melee, which requires more knowledge about mobs that can interrupt. So I have to step a bit to the side when I start casting heals so I don't get a shieldbash to lock out my nature-school. But due to having the "Omen of Clarity"-talent, it's totally worth it. It occasionally gives me the chance to cast the otherwise-to-expensive Regrowth for free without even interrupting my mana-regeneration. Priest has a similar benefit from auto-attacking by having the chance of proccing spirit-tap. Depending on the situation one can be better than the other.
---
Priest gets 1/4th of their spirit as mana-regen per tick. Druid only 1/5th. But now that I have innervate, I think it more than compensates for that.
---
Priest can spam his group-heal, druid's group-heal has 5 minute CD. But it's really rare that you actually need either. At least in 5-man-dungeons.
---
Priest can fade when they get aggro. THis is awesome if someone reacts and was about to do something about you getting aggro. But oftentimes people wouldn't even realize it, when you use it too fast.
---
As Druid, depending on severity of the aggro I sometimes go in bear. But I get aggro surprisingly rarely. I guess that's got to do with me standing right next to the tank meleeing the mobs most of the time so the tank sees when I get aggro and taunts immediately.
---
The biggest difference is the rezz. Sometimes you have people who don't act with the necessary caution and die because of that. Like some mage standing right in the middle of mobs that all cleave in RFD. Having to wait for them to walk back in can be annoying and tremendously slow down the run. As a priest it woudn't be a big deal.
---
Once I actually spec resto, I'll get 0.5 seconds faster cast-time on my HT, 15% combat-reg, 19% less mana-cost on HT and 10% more efficiency while keeping Omen of clarity in the Moonglow-spec. (I'll be 25-0-26)
---
This is the most mana-efficient-healer-build in the game pushing the HPM of maxrank-HT to almost 4. But you could argue that priest still has a slight edge thanks to the armor-buff they procc of their crits. Also the ability to stay out of harms way while still contributing to damage is in favor of the priest. Actually having one druid per priest is an ideal raiding-scenario due to this getting the most out of the priests-spirit-regeneration with innervate.
---
My main reason for choosing druid regardless was their mobility in PvP. A dead healer can't heal and Druid is the best at avoiding PvP situations where other healers would die.
---
TL;DR: The performance of both classes in PvE is very similar, no out-of-combat-rezz is druids biggest disadvantage there. Combat-rezz and innervate kinda make up for it. I think in PvP druid has the edge.
---
Listen guy, this will be replaced fairly soon by a quest item. Yes the item is good for it’s level, but only that. It will only serve its purpose on a twink account that cant get an upgrade better than it due to level restrictions. When something like this drops, with a heavy price tag and clearly not BIS for end game, it’s better off that the whole group rolls need and sells it on the AH for the gold rather than using it for a few levels, replacing it, then selling it for a 99% loss to a vendor.
---
Tank Heal and DPS are the same layouts. Just change it manually, /elvui in chat or ESC - ElvUI.
---
You can move and change everything to your hearts content.
---
So much cleaner and efficient, I'll never go back.
---
My point is if done right, refurbished content could be interesting and cool. It could be an old dungeon layout, maybe with minor flair changes, but with new mobs and bosses.
---
Let the SAO fanboys be, you dont rly want em in.
---
Their mental is trah for a guild. So is their ability to be efficient.
---
Would have thought ShadowedUnitFrames myself
---
excellent
---
That cancer interface and method of farming
---
#notmyclassic
---
How are people not able to use fast screenshots with snipping tools in 2019?
---
More and more questins, you are absolutely right my dear friend.
---
The social and honest interaction is what gets me with classic!
---
Pretty much. Some is really a fucking handful of people
---
And despite the anecdote you know statistically there are more than 2 60s Horde you can call for every 60 Alliance you see.  If only just one would answer the call you’d be fine!
---
Yeah I had my first experience with that in Ashenvale the other day. Dwarf priest comes running by as I was eating and emotes for me to "wait". He MC's me and buffs me. Blew my mind lol.
---
Aoe threat costs rage, if you pull and the mobs run at you I will get 0 rage and then all I can do is taunt one and once it has hit me twice after 4 seconds I can maybe do one thunder clap which won't matter for shit because you have already thrown cone etc. on them.
---
Seriously try tanking yourself. We don't have that kind of threat-generation aoe wise.
---
No, you definitely have to go back and forth with my guide, I also have you go out of the way once or twice just for flightpoints to save time later in the guide
---
im not talking about moving combo points from target to target...  
---
im talking about keeping the points on the same target even if your not targeting him
---
If you go under profile and look around in the drop-down menus you should be able to find it
---
I thought he meant if he Targets a different unit and not just deselect. Because he was talking about looting in a fight.
---
That would be 09.01.2007.
---
Combo points added to a target should not be reset until you add a combo point to a different target.
---
I was expecting to have to wait days. I was killing the lions there for leather then I get a message "humar is on my layer"
---
apparently people can't take a bit of friendly jibing *shrug*
---
It’s a cesspool on Flamelash but at least I know where the edgy teens are it makes it easier for me to avoid annoying people.
---
 holy whiskers you go sisters
---
If you watch the video it's clearly very suspicious behaviour, obviously there is a slim chance someone's playing, but I'd bet on that being a bot.  I think most people would.
---
 I was trying to come up with some simple workouts that didn't require  any special equipment, space, or set up.....something like that. what do  you recommend?
---
I just hate when my ass pulls water aggro
---
Grrrrrr angry &gt;:(
---
Regardless, earliest mention of that was TBC
---
Thats not vanilla
---
What is the purpose of a warrior in torch runs?
---
Joined up just before the launch with some friends and I have not been disappointed. You need to have thick skin and not be easily offended.
---
as long as that first dude waits for me to LOS the mage mob....I hate it when you mages force everyone to fight in a stupid position because you think dungeons are your aoe grinding grounds.
---
Yep, when i go with my warr friend we usualy attack atleast +5 lvl players .
---
I don’t know, this comes off more like you were attention seeking rather than altruistically providing gifts to others.
---
You were giving gifts to a specific group of low levels, and many of them probably are still trying to get the hang of the game. I’m sure they were thankful, but just didn’t show it in a way you might’ve expected them to.
---
Hey man just saw your comment, dunno if you fixed it yet but the Addon button ONLY appears when WoW detects 1 or more addons. Check the install directory of WoW again, make sure Twitch(Curseforge) has the right directory for it, 99% of the time it is no issue but sometimes they might not be installing to the correct folder. The fact the button isnt appearing means WoW isn't detecting the addon.
---
What’s wrong with the interface?
---
wtf is this shit
---
Your the same level as me, but your using a pretty useless weapon, so I'd suggest that being the one thing you consider buying. Don't go mad, no more than 2 gold, but it's definitely worth it. It's 10 minutes of farming humanoids to recoup that money.
---
Would be great for Paladins if they were viable tanks!
---
54 pushups. Ya np
---
Aaaaah lessons for my ride to work. Thank you.
---
Ahh so many patches mentioning this mechanic, its hard sorting through which one :P
---
I gave up on herod, queues too long. blamuex is perfect, always medium/high
---
For those who haven't followed up on what abuse of game mechanics were happening, can someone enlighten me?
---
Does the Twitch client not have one? Pretty sure that's where I got mine.
---
Now imagine someone doing that to you for 5 hours but only when you are low on resources after the fight and you have typical rogue ganker.  
---
Yeah.
---
Pretty normal. If there's a quest with relatively low spawn rate/count of mobs, you can easily expect 3+ hours to complete it.
---
Found the hordie
---
If that was the case more than 2 people would have had the rep to get their quintessence, meaning they wouldn't have had to run back and forth between mc and azshara a bunch of times to douse all the runes.
---
They farmed it in silithus like everyone else, grow up.
---
Classic Global Ignore List can filter out stuff like guild ads. Haven't seen one for 40 levels.
---
I’ll try to remember to look it up tomorrow, I forgot what it’s called
---
The ring is 6int... It's a caster ring.
---
Get literally any green ring and it's better for you. Fuck.
---
Yeah 
---
Rogues wanted the change for the longest time, it took ages to get it
---
Thanks! I hope you get him soon! (Atleast before they remove the layering in phase2, after that I suspect it's going to be even harder.)
---
I always try to select the character to whisper thank you, and many times the character is already gone or blended in the crowd, 
---
Now I know, the next time I will YELLL!!!!
---
I have a funny story that is related to this...
---
The wife and I had our first child in January this year and our sex life has suffered due to tiredness/working/new parent shit so we try to “plan in” quick ones around naps and stuff...
---
So, a couple days ago she asked if she could give me a blowjob instead of sex as she hasn’t showered and was pretty tired, ok, no problem at all... BUT I was in the game queue and only like 400 places from getting in...
---
So I said, “Yeah, but can you do it here at the desk in my office so I don’t lose my spot and get logged out..?”
---
“Yeah sure...”
---
Cut forward like 20 mins, I’m in game, running through Orgrimmar and getting a blowjob from my wife at the same time. This never happened when I played Vanilla. Therefore, Classic is better than Vanilla. 
---
TLDR; Scheduled sex, blowjob instead, queue time popped and so did I...
---
Name it Australia.
---
Good summary thanks
---
Uh, no? 
---
That shit is ridiculous.
---
I don't except I'm asked to pull. Usually the tanks pull.
---
You are a credit to our race, thanks :)!
---
So many grown man weirdos play horde.. it freaks me out.
---
2007 is still vanilla
---
I gave water to a hunter around lvl 25 and told him it is the best tasting water he could find. When I got to lvl 40 I got an whisper from him, saying how much he liked it and that it truly was the best tasting so far. Around that time I was often mocked by my healer friend, that my water wasn't good enough, so I told this hunter to whisper him too. He flamed my friend with much humor and we had a great laugh on TeamSpeak.
---
You having never actually been apart of the guild and not being able to comprehend jokes makes this comment invalid.
---
Watch the kill video, it’s very clear, and was repeatable, I did it till it’s gear broke
---
that's on me, I looked at the pic too quickly and jumped the abs section !
---
And this is why y'all join a guild.
---
I was just joking :D I wait this long for regular mobs.
---
He is getting attacked by a person 14 lvl higher than him, and you’re calling him the coward?...
---
you don't have to, its like a drinking game...but different
---
there are some already
---
Considering its another person's screenshot, it's quite literally not your classic.
---
Saaaaywhat. Know any others?
---
Yes you can pull with eye and do Aoe.
---
I worked in an Internet Cafe, and a few of our members was part of one of the leading EU guilds. 
---
They all used bots and bought gold to fund their raiding progress.
---
Yea, did a full run of every dungeon so far and I'm almost 44 now and tanked every single one of them with a two hander in arms spec (5 into fury) just fine. If I ever drop in HP too much I quickly equip my shield but that very rarely happens.
---
Nope I only get fake minecraft ads
---
I turned those off when I made my character because I hated the way it looked. I just wanted to see exclamation and question marks.
---
Think it’s a phishing scam that people will sign up with same battlenet account details?
---
Yea i meant the Mage's skill. Wow so I need Arcane and Frost for Mages. And Shadow for Warlocks. I am going to put them up to 90 resistance each and sees if that actually creates a difference. TY.
---
Go to stone talon where the goblins are and pick the chests on the ground. It’s a bit more of a pain in the ass but you’ll be able to level relatively quickly.
---
Thank you so much!
---
As a lock I am giving to any warrior I see and I am able to a healthstone. I would randomly trade it to them even when traveling. Gotta help the less fortune leveling classes.
---
Almost lvl 30, that's me today :)
---
2007 is TBC
---
patch 2.03
---
 You can try all you like, but the fact you are wrong isnt going to change
---
The Burning Crusade Patch 2.0.3 (2007-01-09): Combo points added to a target should not be reset until you add a combo point to a different target.
---
Deep purple
---
Jebaited :D
---
You sir, are the real MVP!
---
Like said in the thread, it is if it was stated that loot will be rolled on and then they switch to MasterLoot and ninja an item, and the bans are usually 'short' (depends) and temporary, unless they might be a heavy repeat offender
---
LMAO, this video was the end of this douchebag.
---
Classic is what we’re playing now and it just came out so “mid classic” is a long time away. No need to thank me for that correction friend, I know you appreciate it.
---
I'm just one of the non-vocal minority that thinks people should be healthy THEN play games. I'm only 34 in classic so I guess I can't talk too much shit, though.
---
You k ow what the definition of obnoxious is? Repeating cliche quotes thinking it makes you look clever.
---
If you think 39-40 is shitty I have some really bad news for you...
---
Maybe after they finish the whole phase thing sure.
---
I'll take over the chat invites to "LFTANKBUYGOLDWOW.COMDM" or some other nonsense.
---
I mistook it for a ready check in a dungeon and I deeply regretted it all the way through Van Cleef.
---
Yeah and know what follows? 
---
"If you gonna heal in melee range, you will get aggro."....
---
pickpocket sm lockboxes to 170, get dark leather gloves then pickpocket zf until 250 then goto brd and make alot of gold while lvling pickpocket :)
---
Since you assume they have a chair for dips, you could lie beneath it, grab each side with your hand and pull yourself up. If you position yourself properly, that could be a row.
---
Also, if you can change the picture, I would recommend the "chair dip" picture have stretched legs with heels on the ground. That makes it easier to not accidentally use the leg muscles instead of triceps.
---
IIRC party leader says something like, "is it cool if so and so gets [item], it's the only reason we're running."
---
Husband says something like, "I don't need to be in a group where I'm not allowed to roll on certain things that would be useful to me." And drops group. 
---
Then he gets whispers along the lines of, "dude, I just asked if it would be okay, you didn't have to leave, wtf." and so on...
---
I don't necessarily think anyone is the asshole in that scenario until the whispers. 
---
But, I do think it's not super cool to invite people in and *then* tell them your expectations.
---
When we form dungeon groups my husband has a copy-paste he parrots for the occasion about rolling for chests, sharing nodes, etc and we've had zero kickback for it. Everyone enters understanding that it's meant to be an equitable experience. 
---
All of tonight we just formed our own groups, it was smooth sailing.
---
There isn't a precedent that suggests they would.
---
Example of claw:
---
You have to tame a bear every 10 levels to get a new rank, starting at the level of 4
---
rank 1: lvl 4
---
rank 2: lvl 14
---
rank 3: lvl 24
---
rank 4: lvl 34
---
The bear you tamed has to use the skill as long as it takes a message to appear in your chat which says: "claw (rank xy) learnt".
---
Then you can dismiss the bear and teach it to your standard pet (your pet needs to be able to use that skill)
---
Crunches can potentially be pretty bad for your back, I'd recommend planking for the duration of the flight path (if the flight path is too long, alternate side planks), or hanging leg raise if you have something to hold on to, or even reverse crunches over regular crunches.
---
I knew about WoW before but never actually saw any footage or gameplay until I watched G4 TV. I found out about Twin Peaks, the Cluck! quest and so much more hidden stuff in the game. In fact, on my first ever Alliance character, I went and did some of those things just to see if it were still in the game at the time. I really miss G4 TV, it was something for my lame nerdy ass to watch on TV because I wasn't really interested in most of the shows on TV at the time - and then they cancelled it for the service I had saying it wasn't good content or they weren't making enough money off of it (but they still kept channels that were purely not profitable and actually caused them to lose money).
---
Gravedigger? OUR GRAVEDIGGER? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! TREASON! 
---
Alldoe, very nice bro move, all of us must understand that this is all a game and we're all humans, every action you make will lighten or darken a persions' day. 
---
I am a hardcore PvPer at Heart but sometimes I see that 37 Paladin fighting 7 gorillas in STV, I help him, because I know that the Allian-
---
*Stun* *HYAH* *undead death sound effect*
---
#MOTHERFU-
---
Read EULA. It is 100% reportable.
---
Yep.
---
Still going strong with ww-axe at lvl53
---
&gt; In current game, it doesn't matter if you're skilled, all you need to do is press your buttons and you win.
---
yeah not really 
---
also, on classic if you press your buttons (and you only have 1 or 2 of them) you don't win because...?
---
You’re still wrong and parroting the guy that replied to me
---
I don't think the economy will be ruined if 40 guys loot a few hundred gold, some core leather , essences of fire and 20 epics
---
But it's nice to be honest.
---
wow this comment is actually beautiful... FOR THE HORDE!
---
As a mage, if you talented to reduce aggro of frost and arcane its really game changer!
---
I personally use elvui/clique for that but it's a complete ui change
---
Streamlined to shit to appeal to a broader audience. Removed the *need* to interact unfortunately.
---
Punny cake day.
---
That talent isn’t working at all.
---
Ohhh man blizzard will be kicking themselves now. They just need to fix layers. That was the problem all along.
---
Not a buzzkill, it's still a wholesome gesture :-)
---
Welcome to classic :) a lot of QoL improvements were added in tbc. Maybe these will be added as well later.
---
I can see how it might look like bragging if you are 20 something. When you are over 30 and your wife gives you a blowjob it's a cause for celebration and a hive five is warranted.
---
I'd say classic is the place to learn to tank actually.
---
the LFG TANK RFK makes it perfect
---
I like how you said 5% faster to downplay how much faster it is when you know the layout and what to expect. Sometimes because you know what is coming you need to be careful other times because you know what is coming you can go faster. One answer doesn't fit all if you actually want to get better at the game. You learn how to get more efficient not keep a huge reserve cause oh "I don't really wanna think about using my resources efficiently, it's makes it harder to play". Just like tanks would have to use their utillites to tank better or dps squeezing out more dps by knowing the pulls. I think healers could follow suit and get a feel of the group as you go aswell.
---
most geared pretty much
---
It just says "Dependency Missing"
---
TRADING
---
The name "Gun" on shazzrah, for "Gun" on firemaw
---
Gnorc
---
Considering he asked a GM and they gave the go-ahead before doing so, and the fact that they remarked that it would be fair to have the extra items taken away.
---
I don't care how much this place has a bias against streamers, I don't believe you.
---
uBlock Origin
---
Same goes for Paladins to a certain extent. A decent chunk of our aggro is ret aura which doesn't work if we're shielded. Cons takes a LOT of mana and we don't have a taunt just in case someone gets a lucky crit or two, so we need that constant build-up
---
&gt;we all have "le sex"
---
Speak for yourself
---
No changes huh? I guess the new lighting and water are no changes? The way grass moves out of the way where you character walks?
---
Keychain will also be added, now I know it was in vanilla too. But seriously, just changing a few small things like automatically dismounting doesn't break the vanilla experience.
---
I am not asking for class changes or anything, just QoL improvements.
---
You've been visited by the gnome of plentiful fish. Good health and a well stocked bank of mats will be yours, but only if you whisper him "thanks for the fish I guess, jeez".
---
You sound like a bitch.
---
Especially with the economy being so unstable due to exploits.
---
Did he though? I dislike the guy, but I've seen 100 of comments saying he exploited and 0 evidence.
---
!Remindme 3 days
---
I never had aggro on my hunter. Of course I mained a healer in every MMORPG I ever played since 2005. I even started a druid in classic, but after a few DM runs I put him on the back burner. I heal guild groups only because I experienced the same behaviour you described.
---
It's kind of funny. Before launch everyone said that players have gotten better since Vanilla. Nope.
---
Just wait until they turn off layering...
---
Still doesnt help you, suggest you play retail instead
---
Then I usually get “why didn’t you peel for me”. Dumbasses
---
The Rogue experience.
---
Why are you spreading lies. Does it get u hard maybe or are you just mentally challenged?
---
Some people only care about the best and won't look at a 5% drop. 
---
The amount of loot you actually get each week from raids, you may be holding onto that pre raid piece for months depending on the loot system your guild uses or how much RNJesus blesses you.
---
had a similiar experience. I mailed a random lvl 15 two 8slot bags. I just saw him afk next to the mail. I got a response with 60x wool in it and much thx and saying that was exactly what he needed and he wishing me a great time in azeroth. That was great and unexpected too.
---
1 month ban for clever usage of game mechanics? That's ridiculous.
---
I hate how you have more space to move your mouse in your truck-setup than I do on my PC table.
---
It wouldn't break the vanilla experience imo. The game already gotten a few things vanilla didn't have such as the graphics improvements and if I saw correctly also the VoIP stuff hardly anyone ever uses and I remember that was added during tbc.
---
I've been tanking as well and generally that lock is precasting a shadowbolt at a mob I haven't even targeted yet. The mage has dropped a blizzard and the Hunter doesn't know he has FD.
---
What they should do and what they will do will vary depending on the level of autism you are willing to deal with when putting a group together for harder content
---
I like how this guy hears crying and rather than walk over and see what's wrong with his kid he just grabs his phone and texts. That is some first world neglect.
---
Sounds like a great idea lol
---
Just give him a shitty item
---
Should have posted it at peak time. May try again another day. Thanks man :)
---
So imagine, you bought a whole collection of gear (acquired through exploits, unbeknownst to you), replacing all of your previous stuff. and you sell/disenchant all if your old gear.
---
Now imagine blizzard takes away all those things, this most likely leaves you in a much worse position than you were before buying the illicit items.
---
I am with you. I'm sad to see the opinions of the people commenting here.
---
Nope. Most the guys i work with have never done OTR.
---
It revolves around the limitations Blizz has set in the AH though. Bullshit or not, it's how it is
---
As a warrior, I got a 52 to come kill trolls for me, only died 4times from pulling while standing still.
---
Tomorrow III try to kill elementals
---
(I'm 33)
---
Nope r/missionfailed suits better
---
Funniest part is the guild I'm in is also called reborn on blameux, seems to be a popular guild name lol
---
As a warlock with one bas less (due to shard bag) than traditional, I meticulously go through my bags at least once a day just to get rid of everything unnecessary (looking at you, Linken quest chain).
---

legion was awesome tho, its favorite expansion post wotlk for many people 
---
given blizz track record, we can expect next xpack to be really good again
---
The bent legs is because I couldn't find any good stuck figure diagrams.... I'm not a good artist..... And I like the idea of the time but with a computer chair with wheels it is hard to lay underneath.
---
So, you always just believe reddit comments? Lol, theres no addon that automatically buys and/or sells stuff
---

---
AoE is better if you have the cc to pull it off, there's a reason why mage cleave is so popular.
---
/camp
---
nvm fan boy your stupid squre head cant understand
---
so much power!!
---
i play mainly with friends. my main is a rogue and i only go early all in on bosses in dungeons and only when i know i have mitigation ready if i pull aggro from my tank. (evasion, vanish) if not, im not gona make my tanks and healers life hell. just common sense is really helpful lol
---
Another friendly reminder:
---
As a dps, when the tank attacks a group of mobs, target the tank and push "F". It selects the target of target.
---
Righteousness judgement is basically the paladin taunt. If you do that and still don't have aggro you can pretty much forget about the mob unless you have tons of mana to spare and can drop a consec for just one mob.
---
They cant use textures they dont have anymore. Classic is based on Legion. Besides, textures change nothing about the gameplay now, do they?
---
And no, QoL improvements have no place in classic. You get what you had in vanilla, nothing more. If you want your butt wiped by the game, play retail. 
---
Those things DO change the vanilla experience. Lets add auto dismount, its just a small QoL improvement, and while youre at it decrease the cast time. Hey lets add LFG Browser, its just a small QoL improvement. Oh and what about hunters needing arrows? Lets just remove that, just a small QoL improvement. See where I am going? If they change one thing, people will constantly ask about more and more. Thats just how people are, give em the finger and they take the whole arm.
---
Again, if you want auto dismount then make some macros like it used to be in vanilla. I even gave you an example. A friend of mine had macro'd every spell to dismount. Its not as if that was too difficult to accomplish.

I dont need more than shift for frequently used abilities
---
ITT virtue signaling ft I didn't want any thanks but I didn't get a thanks wtf
---
Don't want to remove them, just want them to overlap the action-bar.
---
At 24, imp void talented, still a bit shite, immo corruption and agony pull aggro, so swapped to recklessness to allow more dmg from voidy and less from me. just about works but can't fear...
---
Right, and it’s easiest to get off revenge with a shield.
---
The talents still cut the cast time, beacuse without then the normal cast time keep getting the batching "delay".
---
As a healer I have no problems with slow healings on tanks, I totally don't feel anything like a Nightmare, it's Just... Normal? I like that system.
---
Ah heck, the whole adorable pets thing hunters have really makes me want to try one. I was quite set on druid, though. Still have 3 days till I'm home and can start playing...
---
How do we know if the items are deleted?
---
Back in WOTLK a couple of bad eggs in my guild held a scam where they would craft the bike mount for people but keep it. 
---
They got suspended but kept the mount after the ban was over. 
---
Another time some guys held a GDKP scam. If you don't know what GDKP is, basically its a carry run with people paying/bidding for items. At the end of the run, the pot gets split between the people carrying. So the organizers took the pot and logged out without splitting it. They got banned but kept the gold.
---
How much for the uncensored version?
---
it stops a single fear with a 2min cd...whats wrong with people
---
The high pop realms are so big, that without layering there will be MASSIVE queue's again.  
---
untill they somehow fix that, i'm in for layering, and penalize intentional abusers
---
Doesn't work with my keybinding setup. But so far the only solution I been able to find.
---
Sounds like a challange. We warriors like being challanged. Challange accepted.
---
Not even remotely a majority of all players are doing this. Scumbags and cheaters are using this method, which should only make up a couple of procent of the player base.
---
Luckily *everyone* who abused this are going to get banned so it's really a good thing for the community.
---
But yes I agree that it has to be removed or tweaked.
---
ironic because this is the general consensus on Alliance players
---
no slow trap and less mobs
---
First: let your group know you'll mark the first target each pull. Use the target markers (you can set hotkeys for them in keybindings). Skull on first target e.g.
---
With warrior tanks, DPS can look for sunder debuffs. Wait for at least 1, preferably 2\~3. Druids and paladins don't have any such tells ... but give them 3\~4 seconds to settle in, and you should be ok.
---
Class balance is the weakest aspect of Vanilla/Classic, so I would open to it at some point.
---
You're just jealous you didn't jump on it when you had the chance 😉
---
Lol. As a rogue i just use Vanish. Just need some flashing powder and then it’s all gone by one click
---
First off all, what type of game are you actually playing? :)
---
If you're inexperienced you might be playing ''Retail'' as many are calling it.
---
This is basically a newer and more streamlined game. You can find out which you are playing by following these instructions:
---
''Open the App, and either create a new account, or log in using your existing account. In the App, click on the **World of Warcraft** tab. Select "**WoW Classic**” in the Version or Region/Account drop-down menus, and hit the Install button. **WoW Classic** characters start their journey at level 1.''  
---
Classic, which this forum is about. Is a recreation of the games 1.12 version. This was a less streamlined and in many ways more challenging experience. It will make you have to think about what you're doing and you WILL DIE often, and embarrasingly.
---
The hype is surrounding this version of the game, and i will advice you to check it out. As it is quite lively with lots of players both new and old experiencing the game. If you want a ease of play i would advice you the following: 
---
1. Get addons, These are basically modifications of the gameplay, makes it easier to find quests and so on. It's no big deal figuring it out, but you'll need to be able to unpack a zip file and place it in a specific folder. I would advice new players to get the addon ''Questie''.
---
2. Play a ''easy'' class. Now, this might be a bit confusing. As no class is really ''easy'' just gives you more of an edge later on in questing and experiencing the game. Hunters/Warlocks are decent for new players as you at lvl 10 get a ''Pet'' which will be of great help to you. It is basically a companion which will fight for you. 
---
3. Use classic.wowhead.com , for any questions and confusions surrounding quests and such. Often you just need to google an quest, check the comments on it, and you'll have an idea.
---
4. Get used to the idea of working together with people, you can whisper them by right clicking on their name in the chat. And then ask politely if they can help or if they are on the same quest as you. More often than not you'll not need help until near lvl 10.
---
5. Ask in the /1 chat, more often than not, people will help you out. Don't be discouraged if they are quiet, they are probably busy or don't know themselves.
---
Isn’t that the whole reason why PvE servers matter to her? You guys can enjoy your world PvP while we can enjoy our AFK, fishing, standing around chatting in contested areas without having pesky people irritating us. 
---
I only enjoy PvPing in BGs and Arenas. I have 0 interest partaking in STVietnam. 
---
Downvote all you want. I’ve been playing PvP servers in retail for more than 10 years and have never once engaged in world PvP unprovoked. And I intend to keep that record. Haters be hating that I’m in a PvP server spoiling the fun of not PvPing lol.
---
No. Why aren't you answering my question? Why is one thing that makes things faster better than another?
---
Same. I knew it was a long journey and im really enjoying it (first time player). It is as you said, levelling may take a while but i enjoy each and every level way more than in other games. And sometimes just exploring some ruins in the world with a party can already feel like a dungeon. That feeling of challenge and cooperation is there since level 1. Im not saying retail is bad, quite the contrary but i feel you have to reach end-game to reach the fun meanwhile in classic the fun starts as soln as you create your character
---
The ones that will be reverted?
---
Hahaaa xD
---
For me i just went and got my permit. Then i went to pepsi and applied. They hired me and trained me to get my CDL for free. I've never done anything but local.
---
He was only attacking yellow players. Looked relatively fair to me. Atleast considering how it usually goes. Getting ganked by multiple people. usually orange or higher.
---
I am all doing for it, even for the new character models for example or any additional visual upgrades. Anything that doesnt affect the core of what makes classic different to retail.
---
Ok prostatebasher... I get it.. we have weirdos too
---
understand what?
---
1.You are whining about a change you cant have in this version of the game
---
2.its core to the balancing of rogues currently
---
3, when proved to be wrong you just throw insults about
---
Yup, no wonder you deleted the post to hide the stupidity that flows from you
---
BM is less gear dependent and does more dmg because of the better thread balance between pet and hunter. Without mana, your dmg won't drop that hard and your pet is able to support others with through tanking.
---
I don't see a single reason to spec MM/SV before hitting 6 % hit without the survival talent (so \~55+)
---
In my experience what happens is: ranged dps pull aggro, ranged dps run all over the place to get away from the mob(s), healer frantically tries to keep up dps completely forgetting there is a tank surrounded by multiple mobs, tank dies.
---
It's also included in leatrix plus
---
Typical for alliance trash
---
Dont think it would be noticeable anyway
---
The thing is you don't even need this exploit to farm the archmage robe. A mage/rogue/druid can already solo farm that and hit instance cap in an hour (this exploit didn't get around instance cap).
---
&gt;Retri paladin(less than shadow) = good enough healers
---
Make sure you got some intellect gear to do this though. Blessing of Light helps a lot as well, but that comes a bit too late.
---
I'm a tank and I agree with you, sometimes being a tank is a pain but that's the game. We just have to try our best. If you wait so long to dps, the whole thing takes longer, if the tanks wait too long to pull cause healers wanna sit on full mama all dungeon, it'll take much longer. The fun about the whole thing is going fast as you can withim your groups limit and every group has a different limit. It's easy to see in the first few pulls how your group would perform and what they can do for the rest of the dungeon. If you realise going a little faster makes things completely shit, then go a little slower. But this while mentality about playing the game so that it's 180% safe every pull while leveling in dungeons, is absolutely insane. Once you going to live, go for it. Classic isn't about playing like a pussy. It's about surviving. And this stupid insult that retail players are bad. Retail wow raids are far far harder at max difficulty than easy classic. Just cause leveling is a pain the end game content is no where near as difficult or strict. Being a top ret paladin on my server in mists and legion. I can tell you for sure in  classic you don't feel overpowered when leveling but damn striaght its not hard.
---
I just leveled on the boat south of ratchet till about 100 then use pick pocket in dungeon runs and on pretty much every humanoid so I get lockboxes. It slowly levels as you level.
---
I'm completely fine with it as long as I know about it before whispering for invite to the group.
---
Example: someone will post LFM MC DPS and Heal, Bindings reserved. 
---
I'm still somewhat ok with whispering someone about invite and him telling me sure we'll take you but this is reserved. 
---
What's a big no no is being in a group, traveling to entrance or straight up being in dungeon without knowing. I'll then roll if I need it.
---
I’m surprised you were even able to read my comment. Good job boy.
---
Now you are comparing QoL improvements with class balancing and making yourself sound like a dick. Good job.
---
Haha no, a hunter and a priest this time (for now). But you have to live the story a bit. Red = dead!
---
Everybody needs tanks all the time.
---
So what you do, is demand group leader. Let people know at the start of the run, that you'll use target markers and want people to attack skull first.
---
If anybody nukes wrong targets or pulls, you warn them the first time, kick them the second time. There's hundreds of DPS to fill that spot.
---
This was in vanilla. Parryhaste also, which is why melee DPS should definitely stand behind the boss, not just to increase own DPS but also to save the healer some mana because the tank eats more hits than he should.
---
Whine like a little bitch.
---
Just be careful with chair dips, they can be bad for your shoulders.
---
Well, maybe your tanks use a shield. It just feels like crap when you get the cast animation and hear the cast sound just to notice 0.3s later that oh yeah, that heal that you casted didnt count. At all. 
---
It would have topped the tank off, but because of spellbatching, it didnt even register.
---
the point is, you shouldn't be using swipe as an aoe threat ability. It is not that. It's an instant attack that you use when you have excess rage. Maul is your bread and butter when it comes to threat generation. You have to target swap and maul one after the next. That is the only way to hold aggro against dps who have strong aoe abilities. But this takes some time, so dps should hold off their aoe abilities for a few seconds. That's just how it is.
---
That bit about BoS and Reckoning sounds scary AF
---
I was expecting at least one person to claim the whole "racism" thing.
---
No it is not racist to be annoyed that I cannot communicate effectively with a large number of people in an mmorpg where communication is key.
---
Also it is against the rules to speak another language on an english realm. It ends up just being spam.
---
can someone recommend me the best healing addons?
---
I do circuits this is what I do....3 days a week for roughly 1 hour
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/skmbeiZ
---
Yes, but I personally don't know any high level (horde) player. And a lot of people asked for help in local chat - no one answered (there was only a single lvl 50 warrior who couldn't have done anything anyway).  
---
And going through "who" and whisper random 60s in completely different zones to help is a waste of time. Nobody travels trough half the world to  maybe safe a couple low levels they don't even know. Especially when 1 lvl 60 horde might not be good enough to kill 2+ 60s + followers.  
---
So in reality the solution isn't quite that easy and you're left to dying or you just can't to that/those quest(s) as long as those people keep camping.  
---
I like pvp even when I'm losing but going in a 30-40 zone as one or more  lvl 60 and camping people for hours is just pathetic.
---
I watch streamers because I have a hard time making friends and having someone talking in the background about something I'm interested in kinda fills the gap. Id never give money to one though.
---
Ikr, I don't understand why even put them there and not have them overlap the actionbar. Guess I'll have to look into making addons haha
---
Or just go 2 arms warris with 2h.
---
You dont need shield for 99% of lvling dungeons (except certain bosses)
---
What is the intended way to do this?
---
My classic experience was not being able to stay on the curve and doing quests 2+ levels above.
---
Today is the opposite.
---
Get ripped like your in-game self
---
Well its not a surprise if you get banned for exploiting, most people knew it was exploiting and still kept doing it.
---
Class balancing? Oh I didnt know hunters gain more damage if they dont have to shop for arrows. Good to know.
---
I healed as retri with mostly STR gear for lvling, and managed to do it, of course smaller mana pool leads to quicker death in accidental or too big pulls
---
I have a blacklist, like so many of us do, and a special area in it is for the auto invites that pop up on my screen and the rando whispers that ask me to join whatever sad guild they're trying to push. 
---
I tell the whispers straight up, I don't join guilds that recruit like this.
---
I'm playing Warriot and I'd let a Hunter have this no problem since my job is to tank, would definitely be nice for farm groups though.
---
?
---
Exploiting a bug to gain an advantage over others is the definition of cheating. Imagine being this dense. Smh
---
imagine unironically buying into that.  as if there was a server where the only thing people did with their gold was buy some dudes pristine hides, lol.
---
nobody has that money, this exploit was legit best used for skinning the beast (nobody is buying hides right now regardless, so those hides are gone) and enchanting recipes / mats from the last room of scholo.  my guild knew about this last week and decided that ungoro was just better gold lol
---
Can someone explain what the OP did to get banned?
---
Damn you feel offended.
---
Has taken pictures with your phone become a socially acceptable meme now? Or are people still this moronic?
---
Tf are they gonna do ride ponies across the trans Atlantic land bridge? Mount up malplebois
---
Grid2 works fine, I use it alongside Perl.
---
r/rigsinrigs
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TalentedBillowingGorillaDoritosChip
---
There it is
---
Depends on the content you do in retail. Mythic raiders need a tight group to succeed. While classic might require some teamwork in just day to day questing/leveling.
---
hey i'm a noob what do you mean by the honor grind/honor decay?
---
Except they didn't break in or steal anything. The player did nothing to cause the bosses to respawn. I'm just saying punishing the players because the devs fucked up seems wrong.
---
You might have given them to a bunch of people who did not know how much of an upgrade, and for how long, it actually is and just assumed its some dude giving away leveling crafts.
---
I only spend about 30 minutes when i did it. It has sparked funny moment. Like when i walked near his spawn (called him brokentooth) and a lvl 43 attack me abaddon his PET and was full on trying to tame bt for a good 12 second. Before he figured out what was wrong
---
It's so much more than that. In retail humans have the best PvP racial and the Horde still dominates PvP population &amp; rankings. It's about culture. 15 years of player culture that says you go Horde for PvP. You can't break it.
---
Still doesnt make it okey in any way.
---
lol just write a list urself wtf are you asking
---
That first sentence of the quote doesn't make sense tbh. Otherwise great picture.
---
I think the first part of the first sentence should be:
---
Be wary of charred vale, ...
---
Its a meme, it didn’t really happen
---
I never used autoattack as a button. I always used right click its so much better
---
Pretty much recapped what I've learned so far, so I'm on a right track, I always tank dungeons and have macros to switch weapons with the two battle stances, but now I will get the fury one and I NEED an addon to map all the abilities and stance switches, which addon would you recommend for that?
---
LW is a money sink, not a money maker. 
---
I would keep mining and just build up your bank of materials. Maybe even AH it or just place it all in a bank alt or two.
---
They all remove lotp
---
I use diamond for fear target and then triangle to mark pats or point out like a rare spawn or something since triangle doesn't get much use normally. But I'm just a lock so I usually don't need to mark much
---
I've never used it.
---
He’s a speed runner, I don’t think he does end game, just rushes to 60 and starts over to try to beat his times.
---
Another friendly reminder, targets are target swapping a lot if they're playing correctly, so getting the tanks target does in no way shape or form imply that's the target he's generating threat on.
---
Any tips for doing this at 30 or a guide that will be useful? Just hit 30 on a warrior and I've never played wow before.
---
Just like yours, you mean?
---
OP claimed he googled and he obviously lied if the poster you replied to had a hit with the first thing google spat out.
---
What's the joke here? 
---
You haven't made a single point so far.
---
Wand upgrades are most important. Other gear not so much but a few upgrades don't hurt 🙏
---
NOT PERMA BAN!?
---
I'm new too. My fiance finally convinced me to try playing again. (I play retail a while back and didn't like it. It was all the same to me). So glad I decided to try playing again.
---
"You have been indicted."
---
yeah that would be the sane solution, but then I'd have lesser keybindings
---
Appreciated, was gonna be a good post, should have written comment before posting the pic
---
I'm 32 and I haven't found a better 2 hander than Verigan's Fist
---
&gt;Additionally, the loot from the princess does not trigger a roll
---
Lol it definitely does, for those who have saved her
---
Outdated gear while leveling isn't a big problem for casters. 
---
Melee and Hunters want a good weapon everytime, but you should be OK with a good wand and appropriate stats (Spirit &gt; Intellect &gt; Stamina. Agility makes your wand crit more often iirc)
---
Hello, Decision Anxiety, I'm dad.
---
Sometimes it’s better to make a macro who activate auto attacking plus one of your skills, otherwise it’s better to bind your auto attack, you won’t be missing two free hit when a mob is on you.
---
So you actually believe that Asian-Americans can't speak English or what? That seems pretty small minded.
---
The people on Whitemane are very clearly not from an English speaking country. It is not unrealistic at all for people living in the eastern side of China to choose a West-Coast US server. Apparently a lot of them are from Taiwan.
---
This is a very real problem which negatively impacts the game experience for the non-Chinese players that the server was aimed towards. If you can't understand why not being able to effectively communicate with people in an MMORPG is a problem, then it is not worth explaining.
---
Yes - right click or if you have rage build up already you can start with Heroic Strike and after that you will Auto attack
---
Thats smart! What level are you
---
The values are, and have been since original vanilla, well known for 99% of situations, the only time it doesn't work is when there's a specific mechanic messing with it.
---
I think I was IP banned or something. I'm not sure how they connected all the accounts. I may have been an idiot and used the same CC for all of them though, I can't remember.
---
Attack low level mobs
---
Just a reminder: people sell tailoring made bags in AH for dirt cheap (at least on my server). Like 1g for a 12 slot, it pays itself back right away.
---
Regards, idiot who rolled with 6 slot bags until lvl 34
---
Priests not wanding and standing doing nothing drives me more crazy than waiting for them to drink.
---
Would be smart to macro in your autoattack
---
I’m finding it hard to believe someone called SmokeCocks isn’t overjoyed at that idea haha
---
This is the correct answer.
---
&gt;This was not how Classic was suppose to be...
---
This stuff happened in classic aswell as clearly stated in lore's post. (It even happened on private servers occasionally, or atleast the one I played on)
---
It will happen again to your guild/other guilds if blizzard doesn't fix this, which they probably won't as the couple extra items don't matter.
---
Oh no :O
---
At least the canadians are nice guys.
---
I hope you get banned 😁
---
I am alliance level 55
---
Druids requiring almost everything to be macrod really, really scares me. I'm extremely OCD when it comes to my keybinds, and druids aren't exactly the simplest it seems. Even more so with the constant form swapping :x.
---
I read about an addon that dismounts you when you try doing interaction with something you can't. Wouldn't that also theoretically work for druid forms, so you'd instantly poof to human when you try talking/looting an item/etc.?
---
So how many of y’all play this shit constantly, don’t have jobs, and live with mom. I know it’s a lot because reddit is the only other thing those types pretty much do.
---
Nice throne
---
When is the anime coming!? WE need this
---
Start vs low level mobs or you will likely die or run away. Boars outside OG work pretty well iirc. Move to higher level when those start dying too fast.
---
Someone told me Esfand and Asmongold did it.
---
It's fine to feel overwhelmed, it all can seem like a lot. Take it in small bits. I took a day to look at general advice videos. A day or two to get the basic addons and learn how they work (advice here: use the twitch client, it makes installing and updating so much easier). A few days to find a proper pve build and learn how it works.

There's nothing wrong with asking people specific questions ingame or in this thread. I've learned a bunch of stuff from my guild. Remember everyone had to learn this and most people will be happy to teach you.
---
as a mage I already know I'm the nerd
---
A few things to keep in mind:
---
* Intellect helps to speed up the process, so it's a good idea to save some intellect gear to help with this.
---
* The vendors in the starting zones sell fast weapons of every kind with low damage. Those are your best bet.
---
* Any attack can trigger a weapon skill learning proc, so make sure to use those too.
---
* If you are going to level up maces, then obviously dual wield maces for extra chances. 
---
So depending what your level is, look for mobs that are ~10-15 levels lower than you and just farm them. It's a very fast process until the last 20-25 points.
---
Cleared Rag on day 13, feral druids are rubbish tier. Warriors are the worst levellers and the most gear reliant and DPS was dominated by warriors on day 13. My guild took a feral druid on our week 3 clear and the DPS of the druid was closer to healer DPS than real DPS.
---
Yeah, I'm not really worried about something I did 12 years ago though. You and I both have done much worse things than botting in a video game in the past 12 years.

**Godwin's law**
---
Godwin's law (or Godwin's rule of Hitler analogies) is an Internet adage asserting that "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1"; that is, if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds, the point at which effectively the discussion or thread often ends. Promulgated by the American attorney and author Mike Godwin in 1990, Godwin's law originally referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions. It is now applied to any threaded online discussion, such as Internet forums, chat rooms, and comment threads, as well as to speeches, articles, and other rhetoric where reductio ad Hitlerum occurs.
---
Godwin has stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in memetics.In 2012, "Godwin's law" became an entry in the third edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.

Did you even read his post?
---
He wants to NOT SEE auctions from certain People he puts on a blacklist...
---
I think the win doesn't mean "good punishment" here. It's more about "another subscription paid and the user no longer abusing stuff".
---
last one died with 0 votes in 5 minutes after post and disappeared at the bottom, i thought maybe guys hated that i posted it as a link from twitter, so i deleted last one and posted as an image.
---
macro all of your abilities.
---
    /cast Heroic Strike
---
    /startattack
---
No I don't think there is... Just gotta write the names down and not buy off them
---
You right, I just happened to find another Lighto (the same as my name on here! What luck!) with the achievements to prove vanilla was played on that account. You can go back into my post history on this account and see that I was recruiting for a guild, on Mal'Ganis (the same server my character is on and my alt  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/malganis/Krieger](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/malganis/Krieger)  is the GM of.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowguilds/comments/96mlxx/hmalganis\_late\_game\_new\_morning\_team/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowguilds/comments/96mlxx/hmalganis_late_game_new_morning_team/) 
---
It's all been an incredibly constructed plan to trick you!
---
Did i stutter? What do uou not understand? Why dont you have an alliance guide? No reason for you to be rude at all
---
[https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/)
---
1) Wait outside a goblin town.
---
2) Turn yourself to At War with the faction.
---
3) Mind Control someone in to the town.
---
4) Watch them get slaughtered even when the MC drops.
---
It's called using an example, I might have overexagerated some things, but I'm just trying to get a point across.
---
You're playing for fun right?
---
So is everyone else, let them have fun too and let them have the BiS BoE. You can make all the money in the world, but that might be the only time that player ever sees a Krol blade drop, let him have it and look how happy you just made someone.
---
Priest second easiest class to level
---
Yeah I /say a lot, even with a translated "HA L L O" to the alliance, I believe it barely gets through.... might report this.
---
Screenshots? Videos? Any proof or are we going off of hearsay? I encourage everyone to read this post with a grain of salt. The fact that this is a throw away account, this person won't provide any evidence that they are indeed apart of Crusade or have been apart of any raids. No one with a brain should take this seriously. While some of the things said here are fact as you can view them on the stream, a lot of this is subjective takes on what happened or simply things that apparently happened yet are only coming from this single person only after the MC run became controversial. Its already been confirmed by the global Community Manager for Blizzard that it was a **separate bug that actually existed in 2004.** I know its easy for some people to see this and think its true because of confirmation bias but its important to consider all the facts. This can easily be someone just trying to poison the well.
---
Had a guy do this once in retail was gone for like 20mins, ended up replacing him.
---
3 minutes? I poo poo slow.
---
I can tell u that healing in enh with int and healing gear is a non issue. I run every dungeon as heals and haven't had a single issue or hiccup
---
This is great to see; I downloaded Questie yesterday, and was utterly baffled why it doesn't offer this as an option. Incredibly stupid design decision. Just because somebody wants to streamline their gameplay doesn't mean they want to cut out all immersion and context entirely.
---
In all seriousness though! Going to the gym before grinding WoW is the absolute best feeling. You're mind is sharpened, you have more energy and its just an awesome feeling.   
---
\#DontSkip
---
Force yourself to use those abilities. I had that same problem when I first played WoW, I mever utilized my rogues full kit. I forgot about Gouge completely. 
---
I forced myself to use it on every single mob, and it became second nature real fast.
---
Don't sell yourself short. You provided an hp buff as well with your imp.
---
Is this Zandalar Tribe? I recognize the name of that person.
---
wands exist
---
What is this wall of unintelligent text? Where in that do you THINK ( think because none of this is actual fact) is true? 
---
Most of the people here have been understanding and given valid reasons. You are just without reason.
---
hahahaha
---
That reminds me of my coworker from 13 years ago when BC was new. He was grinding for his mount/riding skill (my ex bf’s coworker had bankrolled ours, holla!) and I told him I’d send him the gold. I would also often send him random items I crafted bc he was playing on my server but we rarely played at the same time.
---
I think he had 70g saved and needed 100g iirc for his riding skill. He gets a BAG OF FLOUR in his mail, accepts it not realizing it wasn’t from me, and it was COD for 50g.
---
He ragequit the game. I think his corpse was still in Tarren Mill 😂
---
Make a macro for every ability you have and replace it on the action bar containing 2 lines.
---
/startattack
---
/cast hamstring
---
Do this for every ability otherwise when you swap target with 0 rage you will just stand there afk.
---
Is this a Horde q.q. Baby right there? :D
---
Don't roll pvp Server if you can't take it
---
If you can take it - you are fine calling me trash ;) I know I am but I gotta revenge my fellow people
---
nope. that's how you get retail
---
balance is how you ruin the game and make every class feel the same just with different colors
---
Each player when they log in are assigned into an layer for that login period. Layer is essentially an subserver. The point is to lessen the load on servers at early stages of the game when there is a large surge of players playing.
---
Players have a way to swap layers by joining a group of someone from another layer. Idea behind this is so you can play with your friends but people started to use this to look for fresh spawns of materials and monsters to kill at first but found out that this could be used to respawn instance bosses without leaving the dungeon so you could farm months worth of equipment within matter of hours.
---
As for the latter part of your question you probably have done layering if you joined groups but it is intended and safe. The exploits in this case require intent and pretty specific actions to be taken which are easy to identify and punish accordingly. So if you legitimaly had to ask this question you can be 100% sure you are ok.
---
For more info refer to blue post (easily found in mmo-champion for example) where Blizzard employee goes into detail about this case.
---
What if the group already has a tank? No offence dude but who are you to tell anyone how to play the game, if somebody doesnt want to tank then they dont have to. Also half of you says you cant tank mid-end dungeons without being specd for it because mobs start to hit harder, other half or you claim its ok to tank with a 2hander, I just dont wanna deal with this nonsense
---
omg stop whinee already
---
go back to retaill
---
This is a shit tier troll post.
---
Blizzard GM's specifically gave them a green light because this was a vanilla bug and not a layer exploit.
---
Staph talkin
---
@
---
Provide healthstones
---
What's mor important for me is that I keep as many of he mobs in one place for cleaving. If someone agros I let them take it. If's its a single mob, and I'm still holding 3-4 more, then I'm prioritizing keeping the 3-4 in check.
---
Couple questions as a mage who specced AoE to start but thinking of switching to single target.
---
If I switch to single target will Frostbite cause issues in AoE dungeon groups?
---
Any recommended single target builds for levelling?
---
That's brutal
---
What people like about grinding dungeons or raids is getting stronger. Getting a new piece with better stats than your old one, and maybe some cool effect. With your suggestion you wouldnt get that sense of getting stronger, sure you might be able to complete the next raid, but in a sense you didnt progress at all. People like getting better gear, thats just how it is.
---
&gt; Unless there's definite proof of this working, I'm calling bullshit. It worked on private servers, but not here.
---
I leveled from 34 to 60 as reck pally and it 100% does work in classic. Though it requires crisp timing and hitting it consistently is moderately difficult even with a swing timer addon.
---
I don’t know about that, but thanks!
---
Which addon is that ui? look spretty clean
---
You're correct of course, but the most vocal and rude certainly seem to be like that.
---
Thats not an exploit. The exploit is switching layers in dungeons and raids to be able to kill the same boss over and over. Changing layer in open world is not abuse.
---
How well is Classic optimized?
---
I have a fairly old PC and backwhen I subbed for a month in Legion I just couldn't play in WoD and later dungeons because of massive performance droop and extremely long loading time. Performance was overall bad in WoD and later zones.
---
TBC and up(Azeroth is Cata content) until the WoD zones however the performance was fine.
---
I'm assuming Classic shouldn't be so resource demanding but thought of asking to be sure.
---
Also very useful for Cthun stomach to get rid of the acid debuff. Basically allows you to stay inside forever.
---
As far as i have seen, you only get the Button when your Realm is full and you're waiting in Queue.
---
He isn't going to. Blizzard devs gave him the go ahead to reclear it due to it being a vanilla bug and not them purposely layer abusing.
---
bartender, even just for easy mouseover-keybinding
---
He said warriors are gear dependant. Which they are. Nothing is backwards here.
---
Rogues are way less dependant on BiS than warriors are.
---
The same issue was happening in Undercity with Sylvannas and whoever that dick is stood next to her. I was doing the same for my guild mates. No-one could access them.
---
Try to make sure the first nuke lands just a millisecond -before- the mob aggros.
---
Quite happy in classic, killing terrible rogues like you over and over
---
Keep in mind that the game has been out for 18 days. Furthermore, netherwind I believed came out a week later. Its going to take some time for there to be enough people. Just work on bis for now and maybe professions and that kind of stuff. Make an alt in the meantime.
---
Prot warriors have a harder time generating rage than other kinds as rage is based on how much damage we are doing/taking.  Prot does less and takes less and thus generates less rage.
---
In any event, if that is what you are going for it should be: do not be weary in charred vale,....
---
thanks! hopefully someone can help with showing multiple mobs nearby.  There was nothing to find at wago io :(
---
You need to slow down! You’re somehow creating this amazing art and STILL out levelling me?? I need to play more.
---
Thanks :) cheers
---
Harpies are THICC!
---
Good point, ty.
---
Yes frostbite can cause issues in AoE dungeon groups
---
Thanks guys I'll give Mograine ago
---
New to wow and new to wow classic : I have the addon to display my 5 bags as one. But is there an addon to sort the content of the bags? quest items in the middle of my consumables, next to gathered plants...It's driving me crazy.
---
Only the most intelligent inviduals know about Classic Codex
---
This is how you get green fire for warlocks in classic
---
1000g easy
---
This is wrong. You have to use the ability you want to learn,  doesnt have to be in combat. Standing in a city spamming dash will teach it.
---
I know this isn’t a macro question but hoping to catch a well educated hunter. 
---
Is there a list of some of the most helpful and more likely common (not .01) drops from dungeons on the way to 60. For example I’m level 18 and spamming WC for the venomstrike bow, but not sure what SVK has or after for valuable hunter gear.
---
"thinly disguised suggestions to grind"
---
In some cases they aren't even suggestions... "go kill thirty or so of these fuckers then come back and i'll give you my shoes" is just a fancy way of saying "go grind for xp and shoes"
---
Hahahaha
---
Classic is classic and should stay classic. I can't see any future in developing new features and content for it. #YouThinkYouDoButYouDont
---
You might want to try ArkInventory then.
---
If you have an issue with an add-ons ability to scan the AH, which is literally just a data parser, then you aren't allowed to use add-ons DBM or Questie. 
---
However, given the tenacity in which you seem to despise add-ons, I can only assume you aren't using these in the first place.
---
Can some explain it to me. I be the big dumb dumb
---
Druid mostly pve. I keep hearing about all of the fun stuff u can get from eng. I've never done it before. What sort of benefit would I get

Not enough Trump spam to be barrens chat

Exactly my problem as priest. Fortitude for everyone!
---
Vuhdo/Grid/Clique/Healbot
---
I personally use Vuhdo, but I'm pretty sure most of these will provide a much better experience than the default!
---
One method of buying gold: you put some boe to AH for obscene amount of gold, gold seller buys that item, you got your gold. Sounds similar, like you did nothing wrong.
---
What level are you with your feral tank?
---
That's how it worked in vanilla, no changes
---
I agree for pieces like that but %hit gear is mostly mandatory til cap if you want to compete with mid to high quality raiders. The 1% are a different story and will level engineering just for a monocle and a minor dps increase
---
It's not about the headshot. It's simply winning at any cost, If cheating is what it takes.
---
Totally. Makes no difference. You won't get the benefit of sharing resources between your characters but that is really about it.

Do other pets also gain value like that? I have some cat from DM and wonder if it will ever be valuable
---
Also you're second question, yeah. Its classic. The goal isnt end game or at least it doesn't have to be
---
You can easily make enough gold for a mount if you spend some time killing certain mobs. STV is the best place to farm gold without having to play AH
---

You don't need an add-on for that. Learn the class.

Took me \~4500 slime kills back in the day to get that drop. If you'd waited a month or two, it would have been worth 800g+ easily.
---
If something you did it a fake game is affecting your IRL ability to work then you have far more problems to worry about than a fantasy game...
---
bruh I'm level 49, have pretty crazy roll luck, and am out of shape
---
this will kill me
---
We all need this
---
When I played vanilla, raids started 10am Saturday and went until 6pm saturday. If you missed one raid or couldn't be there the whole time, you'd let the whole group down and probably not be invited back.
---
You can of course have more casual raids, but then they won't be "top tier".
---
In my minds eye I now see a whole cadre of dudes in red trampling through rural russian villages going:
---
"Sorry sorry Celine Dion maple syrup sorry, eh"
---
What? Everyone in the raid knew, including the guy who rolled. The roll was only done for show, the entire thing was 100% staged. It's like you're getting legitimately upset about a sketch.
---
for some reason i believe this guy tho
---
i bet you aren't even 60 yet
---
Yes, I have decided to put my talent points somewhere else instead of in frostbite. I do not do any pre-planned AoE grinding, but I do use AoE tactics to kill mobs for quests all the time. I have no problem killing single enemies or pairs of enemies without frostbite, but frostbite will often cause my death during AoE pulls.
---
Another liberal idiot who doesn’t know what they’re talking about.
---
Why do you have immunity?...
---
Same, I have no issues with it currently.
---
Doubt I'd play WoW without it to be honest :P
---
Clique. It's the most straightforward thing in the world. Works flawlessly with blizzard raid profile
---
As long as you keep the video settings on the lower side, likely you wont have a problem running the game if everything upto WoD ran fine.
---
Is fire mage any good in classic? I adore mine on retail and don't want to follow the frost/aoe meta.
---
Those types wasn’t talking about people in reddit, clearly you can’t read. And yeah I’m on it while at work because I get bored
---
Or just use durnholde/ angor fortress / lake around ST for a faster method.
---
There's a lot of that going around in this thread.
---
So many squats, I think I'm going to give this a try. If anything happens to me I hold you personally responsible.
---
Hi, /u/BigFudgere
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5ewrf/whats_the_classic_equivalent_of_the_brontosaurus/). 
---
Does the wow community not know how to take screenshots? Just started playing
---
Change your WASD to ESDF. Much more buttons around ESDF so finding a new key to bind is much easier.
---
Count 3 strikes on the mob, generally speaking. 
---
As a tank, mark primary target with skull (you should have skull, x, square and circle keybound and throw them up before you pull). 
---
Good DPS players will have a threat meter and will know to use /assist so they’re attacking same target as you. I haven’t played ClassicWoW yet but as a hunter I had a macro for misdirect so I wouldn’t pull agro off a tank.
---
But before that, I was also a dumbass who forgot my pet’s growl on (or didn’t even know how threat worked), so always count on a DPS not being too bright, and you having to ask them not to pull shit off you.
---
Considering the average is between 8 and 12 days to reach 60, I'd say you've done pretty well.
---
That was a fascinating read and keep up all your good work! We need more players like you.
---
Isn’t retail in a way based on classic?
---
might be a timer for when your mana regen will restart? can't make sense of the acronym though
---
He was replying to a comment about situations where groups are looking for a tank.
---
Yeah, you say that now. But before launch, every retail drone said that in 2 weeks, Classic will be "dead". So, even the most populated servers should at least have no queues, and the lower ones should be "dead".
---
Blizzard started with what, 34 realms worldwide? And now we have 4 times more? Whatever expectations they had, be it launch numbers or dropout rates, are clearly way off.
---
I don't think Classic will see a significant dropout (one that can be perceived in raids and dungeons and leveling) earlier than 6 months.
---
Phase 1 is mainly leveling and MC/Ony. Basically casual all the way, hence, no dropout outside tourists. Phase 2 is Honor phase, World Bosses and DM. A good amount of content, which will keep players in. Phase 3 is BWL, which should at least keep most raiding guilds and PvP guilds active.
---
The first 3 Phases will absolutely be packed with players, on all servers. And that is easily 8+ months of Classic being very, very alive.
---
When layering will be gone, in Phase 2, people will realize HOW MANY PLAYERS are actually on a MEDIUM realm. Answer : it will be 5-6k concurrent (or 25-26k total).
---
I don't see most realms dropping under 3k concurrent before Naxx. maybe some odd Russian or Oceanic realm, but all others will have a solid 3k+ concurrent for 12-18 months at least.
---
I too am in Esfand's guild and I can confirm he is actually a nazi.
---
No I am not. I dont really see what that has to do with it?
---
As one of those noobs, thank you for teaching people.  I know it's a rerelease but it seems like almost everyone just expects me to know everything. I got kicked from a group for asking where in town the entrance to stockades was, and ever since I've just been frantically googling everything instead of taking to people lest they see that I'm new.
---
It's a race if you want it to be, and it's not if you don't. As simple as that.
---
I don't need to go to details if it's one of first options which are there x)
---
Maybe i am just too sensitive for this kind of stuff. I see too many people od daily basis complaining about stuff which is already implemented. That is how i imagine complete ignorance. Not saying you are the case.
---
Being a bitch about healing priority was always my favorite part about being a healer. Esp when the mage pulled aggro, ice blocked, and I died bc of it. Now the hunter’s pet is about to get more heals than mage.
---
Because people want to do content when it's relevant. Not start mc when bwl comes out
---
sounds good
---
We slaughter everything in video games humans, animals, children, weird creatures. It is just a game. It would be stupid if my undead character would be a vegan as much as a carnivorous being a vegan.
---
I had a similar experience. I wasn't handing out wands, I was selling them on the AH. But I did receive a random whisper from someone who had bought one of my wands thanking me for my craftsmanship, and that it had served them extremely well.
---
Really brightened my day 😀 ♥️
---
Looking forward to phase 2
---
Depends on the prices of your server/factions AH. If you can buy the mats cheap or farm them fast then go for it.
---
Hybrid versatility is also a good reason not to take a dps druid in your group as the cheeky fuck will probably roll on every single piece of gear that drops regardless of the spec they came in as.
---
This is beautiful.
---
So you're not against addons, but you want an addon to "blacklist" people instead of just installing an AH addon like TradeSkillMaster that displays 1 item auctions as one entry? Why?
---
Yeah smart ass comment, why i am not even surprised.
---
Protip: if you go to the gym for an hour *before* hopping on WoW, your playtime will be much more relaxed and rewarding. 
---
I always try to make sure I did something that day to 'earn' playing a game or drinking a beer, because it makes sitting down and doing them so much more enjoyable.
---
It's too early in the game to even consider a poll like this. It hasn't even been a month yet.
---
It does if you turn off your auto attack
---
This is the kind of content I want in Classic Wow moving forward
---
for me the dungeon finder already destroyed alot - warping to a dungeon with complete strangers you didnt talk one word with - just to rush trough the dungeon without any communication - and then port out after that again with "upgrades" that dont feel rewarding at all .. 
---
forming a grp by talking to people  - being specialized in a build - running to the dungeon and making preparations like bringing food and water makes it feel rewarding - dungeons are actually a part of the world and not a warp to thing in the nether ... there are so many things which blizzard casualized over the years which added up and destroyed so many aspects of the classic thoughts and feels - Im really glad we got some of that back!
---
I was a bit underleveled questing in ashenvale and this priest mage duo tried to steal a mob as I was obviously gonna open from stealth and failed. The kicker is when it dropped a intellect and spirit waist that I ended up giving to another mage that actually invited me to their group.
---
You seem confused.
---
i sell the magic wands for cheap in the ah
---
making almost no profit but I sell like 20everyday
---
Thanks, if I'm not looking to heal should I create a new character?
---
That's crazy talk.
---
People that wants to stay in 1.13 or whatever should just continue to play on Private servers, like they did for years already.
---
Blizzard needs to step up and realize that what people want is the golden age of WoW, which was from Classic up to and including WotLK from most public opinion (I didn't really think it went down hill till Pandaria, but thats just me). 
---
Technically I think they should just keep spinning up a new round of fresh servers every 2 or so odd years depending on how fast they want progression to be. They can look towards Daybreak Games, that run the EverQuest service to see how it's done. Progression servers alone has kept that game afloat for many years already.
---
And let us be able to buy stones to throw at them that do 1 damage each! Or is that too much?
---
Okay, I'm bowing out of this one. You clearly want to just keep arguing about this for some reason.
---
Why do you think that is?
---
Invite for layer pls.
---
on zt there is a &lt;Guild&gt;; also pretty funny i think
---
Just pack a pet priest to heal you. Bandages are meaningless when you have health on tap.
---
I took you misunderstood vanilla warriors. You don't use even close to all your abilities. You shouldnt even be training most most of them.
---
True true. Didn't have any other quotes to use but I liked the eerie nature of this one.

FTFY. I'm not wrong, and you know it.
---
Mage here, I am the tank.
---
It's called jacking off, don't beat around the brush
---
Man, I had a run like that today. We had a bear tank, and basically every pull our priest would pull aggro right after the start. I then ended up searing pain to pull aggro and off tank the guy.
---
Hello all, my mage is approaching 60 and I’m wondering are there any good spots or ways to farm up some gold at 60 for my epic mount? 
---
I am a 300 skinner, so spots with mobs I can skin for thick leather or higher is a huge+.
---
Any spot is fine though even if I can’t utilize skinning there and it makes more than a skinning spot.
---
Also, I heard SM catch is a good place but I assume with my fresh 60 gear that would not work out so well :p
---
I give out far too much stuff tbh but it's nice to do a good thing.
---
Logged on last night in thelsamar and a level 5 just stopped and looked at me mounted. I was still tabbing in / getting settled (queue ftw) so I chased him down and traded him a gold before heading back to IF.
---
&gt;Something for questing
---
&gt;Something to make my bag one bag
---
ArkInventory / aBag / Bagnon are the common ones (I haven't tried Ark myself, and Bagnon didn't work for me)
---
&gt;Something to show two action bars at once
---
What do you mean? You can enable more action bars with the normal UI in the options menu
---
Questie and  Onebag for the first two
---
Auctionator is mandatory for buying some stacks of basic mats.
---
Indeed, but my impression at least is that taunting/holding threat on multiple enemies is easier as prot. I could be wrong though!
---
!RemindMe 8 hours
---
I joined a guild a few days ago and plan on leaving it soon. It has almost 300 members but seems completely dead. I'm not sure what the point of inviting randoms into your guild if you don't even want to talk to anyone. Not sure what the point of a guild is if not social in the first place. Oh well. I guess I'll play WoW like I do life... Who needs friends anyway.
---
Not THAT kind of red!!???! Ayyy CYKAAAA
---
finding and using bugs is fun. it adds a whole new out of the box aspect of a game. harkening back to the Halo 2 glitch days on the OG Xbox. its the devs fault for not testing the game enough to make sure the bugs arent there. they should be punishing themselves. lets all boycott WoW until they stop punishing us.
---
*Thank you*!
---
If you did, you wouldn't still answering to someone you don't agree with.
---
arent game bugs the developer's fault tho. why should they punish players for exploiting them?
---
Not trying to rain on your parade but you might be forgetting it says your name on the wand and he likely saw it when replacing and wouldn’t have remembered your name to thank you otherwise
---
It would have been suicide on any of the private servers (where the 3 involved guilds come from).
---
Does it work in classic? Still to low to try it myself :(
---
the real question is, why spam the acution with 1 item auctions. But tnx for the addon suggestion I will check later
---
FRESH. LAYER. FREE. SERVERS.
---
That's it. That's all I need.
---
It's a decent emergency CC. If a mob is attacking the healer stun the fuck out that bitch. But don't stun mobs the tank has control of, no.
---
That’s elvui
---
Where is the list of methods expressly authorized by Blizzard? There are lengthy blueposts on how you can hop layers and what happens if you're still not seeing each other after partying and what you can do to ensure you transfer layers. I find it weird that Blizzard would be this helpful and provide detailed descriptions of exploits. (although it would not be the first time they did this)
---
Of course it is an exploit. Not as severe as spawning bosses in dungeon, but still you are abusing game mechanic in not intended way. Layering is not there for you to be able to avoid pvp or farm more ore/herbs/mobs. Misusing game mechanic to gain unfair advantage over other players strictly breaks EULA and is reportable.
---
I was wondering if anyone knows, if you camp a vendor that have a ”rare” recipe that spawns sometimes if you have to close the interract window and re-open it to be able to buy/see it or if you can just keep the window opened and it pops up ?
---
The whole server being rolled back to BRD attunement would do literally 0 for anyone less than lvl 50 but that fixes the economy of farming those 5mans. This would punish those who chose to abuse it at best and level the realm for a fair economy. But the people who spent all the gold they have for those patterns will just reset their gold and be out the pattern.
---
They can just make you new servers to that you can play TBC and Wotlk. I have no interest in those expansions.
---
I'm personally torn on that one. In some ways it was an amazing experience being a part of the ride and trying things no other games had really been able to live up to prior to that point. On the other hand, the execution of many things was utterly disappointing and ruined some of the charm, sadly. I think the game had such great potential to achieve greatness, but the initially released project was too rushed and ambitious (which is a bad, bad combination).
---
Didn’t Jesus heal a bunch of lepers or something and only one said thanks?
---
Life-changing wands or miracles, seems like the TY drop rate is about 10%.
---
I see a lot of idiots.  I assume most of them aren't new.  If they don't ask, I'm not wasting time on it.
---
Kek
---
I love you ;-*
---
&gt;  and do they clear the hardest shit in the game? Yes, but they're the exception, not the rule.
---
In the top 10 Eternal Palace guilds there are
---
 - AFK R
---
 - FatSharkYes
---
 - Unwealthy Homeless Men
---
 - ScrubBusters
---
So I mean... they're a minority, but not really an exception.
---
&gt; If mana is not an issue, you may want to wait several seconds after the tank has started taking damage and then use a big heal to stabilize him
---
this is a misconception for leveling. The bigger rank heals are more mana efficicient. If you are able to only cast your highest rank flat heal then you use the least mana.
---
The downsides are that your tank drops lower and you might risk him dying when theres a sudden damage spike and that you don't want to overheal. So if you heal 60% of their hp, start casting when they lost 40-50% of hp.
---
But the downsides rarely happen during leveling at all. So let the tank start the fight and let him drop low until you cast the heal. Saves the most mana and doesn't pull aggro away.
---
Downranking doesn't work for healing until end game
---
Because it's not possible for someone to have played a mage from Vanilla until retail, and to simply want to skip the leveling process as easily as possible to get to (what I perceive to be the real) game at 60?
---
Don't need to PVE quest and engage in the occasional fight against a rogue with Ambush to prepare myself for PVP.
---
&gt; So many grown man weirdos play ~~horde~~ WoW
---
no layering no classic+ no changes or additions at all. never.
---
&gt; how else do people know which one to focus on? 
---
Well, if you pay attention to the mobs, have a little game knowledge, and use your brain, you'll know what should die first.
---
First: non-elite mobs should die before elite mobs (lower armor and lower hp means they can be killed and removed from the fight quickly, reducing total incoming damage and number of mobs to manage)
---
Second: caster mobs should die before melee mobs (casters can do annoying stuff like massive aoe damage, massive single target damage your tank can't dodge, heal, or cc; casters typically have lower health pools and lower armor and thus die quicker)
---
Third:  misc. mobs according to desire, typically the lowest hp mob in left in the pack, "pet" mobs from hunter/warlock style packs (usually they are the lowest level in the pack and will be low from taking some aoe damage), mobs that run away, or any mob that is currently enraging.
---
...you can in retail fyi, but just not in any scenario that you care about (in combat, in m+ dungeons)
---
Where is the hunter2 joke coming from?
---
I've said this to a lot of people, but your go to way to farm gold isn't to farm at your current level, but to continue questing/leveling so that your G/Hr goes up. You will naturally build up more than enough gold through questing.
---
To prove this, I had 96 gold when I hit 40, so I never did have to stop and farm. I'm currently 48, and now have 120 gold. I never stopped to farm gold, all I did was quest and level/dungeon. So in the time I took to get to 40, I had 96 gold. In the time it took me to earn 8 levels, I earned much more than I could earn in initial 40 levels.
---
You'll be spending so much time crafting things to get money, that you lose out on XP/hr, which directly affects your total G/hr. 10 hours grinding at 40, 50, 60, is a huge difference when it comes to how much gold you make. Everytime you stop at a certain level to farm gold you are spending the same amount of time trying to earn way less than you would earn at a higher level.
---
Sick.
---
The person may not have needed to 'remember' you if they had a wand by you. Likely just whispered from the 'created by' text. All the same the wands early are a huge help!
---
Discussing individual bans is against the forum rules, so all of the topics regarding that are being removed.
---
Not even that... haha 😅
---
Holy whiskers you go sisters
---
What level is this available, both character and tailoring?
---
Kind of, but luckily so far only morons attacked me. Early levels it hurts way more to not have it in beat than that 40 energy in cat
---
Creating a System that can be easily be abuse... starts banning people. Not Sure if the players are to blame, as its not even a Bug. Abusing "Game Mechanics" is the best Title :D
---
Ye but you cut 3times faster through it. Additionally do warris usually have great armor. Go 4 warris 1 heal and enjoy.
---
Btw. You dont have to heal to 100% asap. Playing as a warlock i can tell that too many healers do that and its a pain in the ass.
---
60, for the second time. 3 60 warriors too. I don't even mark targets for groups with all single target/cleave dps, just tab swipe and if anything turns give it a maul. If I have less than four mobs on me I'm walking to the next pack to pull while the dps finishes off the ones following me.
---
It depends. At level 60 the expected tip is some, relatively small, amount of silver (10-20). At low levels it tends towards “what you can afford that’s still meaningful as a tip” (so not 2c, but not 30s either, I find 1-5s is usually fine for low levels). 
---
You can also use trade chat in general with a specific price. “Looking for a rogue to open [item], tipping X silver.”
---
Im sorry :(
---
What about not being ableist, and instead just showing me?
---
I would just stick to gear with a lot of spirit and just make sure my wand is up to date.
---
It appeals to the male fantasy.
---
&gt; At the end, they are stripped naked of everything and thrown back to their original server. 
---
Please brandish them with a tatoo on their forehead or something to boot. Just for the kicks!
---
90% of guilds wont take a druid as a dps or tank sadly. If you really enjoy it you can try to find that white whale of a guild that will but it will not be easy.
---
AOE basically exclusively from SM GY, Lib, Arm and Cath into ZF until BRD Torch Room with a very occasional quest outside.
---
Happened to me before too. But then my next act of kindness was reciprocated. There will always be a few sociopaths out there
---
Who let racists out of their mom's basement
---
People who get upset at their character dying in a video game enough to play on a server where two of the six phases are completely irrelevant to them are extremely sensitive snowflakes.
---
It’s also Reddit.
---
The way I understand it, layering lets them have more players per realm, so that by the time the anticipated "tourist" population drop begins, they can reduce/switch off layering so we don't end up with low pop/dead realms.
---
Hunters be like: Tank pulled? MULTISHOT!
---
It sounds like you need to try and make your way in to some dungeons. Try finding a decent warrior friend or leveling guild to make groups. Ret paladins pre-raiding are still fine for 5 mans (coming from an enhancement shaman who hasn't healed yet).
---
I'm a warrior, apparently every day is leg day now
---
Pretty perfectly describes the retail experience, especially what BfA was like. People sped through the leveling experiences, dungeons, and world quests all before the first reset, then talked about how bored they were. They ate a month's worth of chocolate in less than a week. You can't satiate someone who indulges like that.
---
Herbalife might be poison
---
You dont even want to know
---
To be honest you have a point are we really playing without a name plucked from a teenagers mind that thinks he’s being some edgy meme lord like it’s cool and in fashion ?
---
I'm an undead warrior in an undead only on Grob, I will alert my guild about this guild and Huin immediately, though my GM is pretty in the know so he may be aware already
---
Mageweave? At lvl 33/34? Not really
---
don't use renew, it's expensive and very manna inefficient. It will generate unnecessary threat.
---
Just let your tank drop enough to give him a big heal. Repeat, done
---
Are there any plans to open up paid character transfers?
---
&gt; you don't win because
---
You didn't peel, kite, interrupt or outplay your opponent. Which is unnecessary on retail. You just need to put ~~10~~ 3 CDs into one macro, approach target, smash your head on the keyboard like a mongoloid, ez pz, 3k rating.
---
Enjoy your R1 title and mount.
---
GG.
---
I did it during and after the AQ patch on my mage. I would solo it to level friends through 50's. 
---
No where near as fast as folks are doing it today but it was most definitely done.
---
thats not the same at all
---
Yeah this makes a lot of sense. However a lot of people, including myself,  have getting a mount at 40 as one of their classic goals.  I know it's probably hurting me in the long run, but it's something I want to accomplish.
---
If you found the secret stash of starbucks pumpkin spice and added 3 huge spoonful without paying each time you went, would it be starbucks fault for not having a huge lock on it, or on you for knowing it was wrong and you still did it?
---
For pugs... you set up an all need on boes rule before entering the instance, in order to minimize ninjalooting, fake upgrade looting and general drama.
---
If you dont get that you are actualy retarted.
---
Dont get confused even more tho new guy...you can discuss and setup w.e the hell lootrules you want.
---
I’ll have to look again tonight, couldn’t see one last night but it had been a long day
---
Doubtful. Blizzard has been mass kicking people who stay in one spot and only move to reset the timers. Most people who AFK only do it for an hour or two while they drive home for work. There's just a lot of people wanting to play.
---
- No politics in guild chat
---
That's the number one rule which matters in my opinion. I've been in countless guilds over the years (on private servers as well), and the ones I enjoyed had this rule, vs. the ones I didn't like.
---
Aren't those skeletons detectors?
---
Stormwind.  
---
Not sure what level for a dps, went as a priest at 25.
---
Still almost got banged tho
---
We would need a working mobmap addon in classic .
---

---
The internet did not let me down.
---
You comment is actually way beyond useless... Fenald actually gave Information while you seem to be a braindead Person just trying to get upvotes by commenting useless shit xD
---
everyone leveling tailoring/lw and spamming high level dungeons is gonna flood the market with enchanting mats.
---
maybe you should go back to retail, since you're clearly a retail baby who's been suckered into this 'KEEP IT PURE!!!' bullshit, as opposed to being an actual vanilla player who would be fucking salivating at the prospect of them doing hyjal in vanilla (as intended) and karazhan in vanilla (as intended)
---
Does it change the way the UI looks from the default ? I’m trying to play as addon free as I can but if I couldn’t see it I could pretend it’s not there
---
20-30 is hard for everybody. You just need to grind a little more.  
---
So if quest is to "Kill 10 skeleton horrors" - kill 50 of them.  
---
Or run dungeons in between. Stockades/BFD/Gnomregan/SFK - they will give yo upgrades and some exp boost.
---
Wait, pickpocket levels up?
---
Mostly two things: you get instantly matched with random people that you'll never see again, and most content below raids/M+ is so easy that you don't really need to communicate to clear it. You don't have to talk to people, and if you're an asshole there will be no real consequences because you'll never meet again.
---
It can never be 20 seconds on a player, HB grants 100% succes before that. You can't get poly up to 30 seconds in a row, that's just not possible.
---
I rerolled off my old realm because of faction bias, to my friends realm
---
Of course they pick Faerlina. 4 hour queues after 5 pm. It's so gross
---
I think it is too early to worry about population. I am not on eu so I don't know for sure, but I would guess that there are still a bunch of full realms with queues. A whole lot of people will still need to either stop playing or take a free transfer before phase 2,which may end up on your server. Also, I believe blizzard said current medium is approximately a full vanilla server, so it's not like your server is empty.
---
Thank you, a friend also recommended this spot. I will definitely try it out.
---
This. After a while being 15+ higher than most of my guild made me feel disconnected, so I rolled a Warlock alt. Hit 20 for summons and now am leveling a druid for tank/heals. Will go back to my higher char when more ppl get close.
---
Also, deadly blunderbus's,gyrochromitom's and unstable triggers sell very well since they are required for quests.
---
Well, according to Blizzard it is not an exploit since it is not a bannable offense.
---
obviously there is no right answer but i tell you what works for me.
---
my keybinds i use: 12345, q,e,r,f,t,g f1,f2,f3,f4,f5 mousewheel up down 3 additional mouse buttons and almost everything with shift modifier
---
i have abilities only usabel in x stance on the first bar which changes when you change stance. sharing the basic functionality on the same keys.
---
most other abilities are universal accessable.
---
for example pummel is on 3 in berserker stance / shieldbash is on 3 in defstance. they basically do the same thing so same button.
---
shift f is for charge or intercept.
---
f is the 31 talent ms/bt/sslam depending on talents.
---
i use mousewheel up/down/button to manually change my stances. battlestance has also overpower bound on it as bers stance has berserker rage so i can quickly stancedance.
---
some o shit buttons are a macro to change in the right stance no matter which one you are in now. taunt / mocking blow for example.
---
if you want to check out my bars and hotkeys you can find me on twitch.com/nakedozzy 
---
playing as mt.
---
my bars are still a mess but muscel memory and routine make it hard to change something :/
---
you can't really play a paladin tank without a dedicated spec, you simply won't be getting enough threat otherwise
---
Lets ask the people with the actual data...
---
Oh it seems its not blizzlike its blizzard.
---
,zzzzzzzzz,zz,z,, za
---
Also for us locks that's more time dots are ticking down. In solo play it's usually immolate into backpedaling while casting curse, corruption, and siphon life. That back peddling will save me like 1 or maybe even 2 hits from the enemy. Also in some cases may open up just enough space to enable a fear juggle that I'd consider risky at the mobs initial location.
---
Of all the comments in this thread, you chose this specific comment to reply to? Were you trying to find the comment where your reply would make the least sense?
---
I'm not min/maxing, and I like using the imp. That's all.
---
No wonder truckers be going slow af on the highway
---
The abusers in a WoW discord he's in are complaining. It's not an WoW exploit discord probably
---
You can't send stuff from retail to vanilla through the mail.
---
I always read about the classic experience but on my server players say hi, do a dungeon and just leave.
---
I read somewhere that Blizz took away the silver reward for turning in the quest. But that could have been back in '07. Do you know if this still works now?
---
*just dance*
---
Kick them and find more dps. They are a dime a dozen lol
---
I would say the one advantage is, through the exploit they still could only farm aprox. 5-7 times faster. One boss for each layer. So it is not as if they could go through 50 of these at once, not enough layers for that.
---
I've been handing out stuff left and right to people.
---
If I find greens that might be useful to their class, I'll give them it.
---
Any potions or fish made...  Recipes I have cooked are given back to random people - generally lower levels to get them running.  
---
I just do it because I want to see them succeed in the game.
---
Only 26 but if I can help others, it brings me joy.
---
Looks like a priest item to me.
---
Ooh, that's rough but it happens.
---
I once got a gnome warrior stuck in a fence. Charged a wolf on the other side of said fence.
---
You're a few fries short of a Happy Meal arn't you.
---
Ironically this made their audience shrink, which is now so clearly proven by Classic smashing expectations and still going strong with queues after multiple weeks. Supposedly people should've realized how bad vanilla was by now and left for retail since it's the better game or something.
---
I guess if it's available for you without trespassing anything it's Starbucks fault. .. you don't agree ?
---
Blizzard has no excuse for this to happen. They have enough money to pay testers
---
&gt;I think you use the default "Z" to move forward, what I do is using "E" to move forward
---
are we talking about the same game?? absolutely 100% of all players I know use W to move forward
---
32-36 sucked IMO cause you have to switch up areas a ton, some stv, arathi, hillsbrad etc. What I did (and it felt much faster) was just to run SM GY and then LIB from 32-37.
---
are these supposed to be used togheter? or are all different alternatives?
---
The big problem is when RPG elements are butchered for the sake of accessibility. This is basically one of the things between Retail and Classic. It doesn't mean that increased accessibility makes the game more fun to more people. However, it definitely removes the fun for people who truly enjoy RPG elements. And RPGs feature slower gameplay and difficult challenges. (DarkSouls, Classic WoW)
---
I all have le sex
---
Nah, I'm also gonna buy a fedora now cause you called me a neckbeard. Cause you can't be wrong apparently, so I must be one. M'idiot.
---
wait until p2 when layering is gone and alot more people are 60
---
Class Color enabled, retail WoW has this and also addons do this.  I have ElvUI which does this.
---
That's how i got my mount and 50g after that. Bought silk cloth dirt cheap, and farmed Iron. On average 1 vein would land me 50s.
---
To me it’s basically saying “don’t get tired of Charred Vale, stay strong!” In a way, it makes sense to me.
---
Apparently not, since it is only millennial fucks who think this is acceptable
---
Love this. I did this a ton back in BC. Now I’m an Uber-broke level 10 rogue with all of 3-4 hours a week to play and can barely afford my own skills training.
---
It’s all good though. Last week a paladin randomly gave me 5 minor healing pots and they’ve saved me exactly 5 corpse runs.
---
Isn't it in Sternwheedle port?
---
Its tough when you’re doing that way. I’ve did it like: took a priest with me for the island duel. Got the quest. Took 2 friends 35 with me to STV for the trolls. Bought the charms for around 10g (yea I’m stupid) in the AH. Whispered a 60 warrior in undercity if he could provide help. Tipped him 2g. He helped killing the 40 elite.
---
Should be in the top right after clicking keybinds menu--just a checkable box.
---
These things aren't about truth honestly, they're about story telling. If you entertain your audience, no one really cares if it really happened.
---
I have a friend who writes great FB stories. I know her well enough to know there will always be fake details to make it more fun, but I don't hate it. They always brighten up my day a lot as she's a talented writer.
---
Here it's the same thing for me. I don't care whether OP "got lucky" or not. I don't know him. But the person he's describing and I'm imagining had a great experience. I can relate to that. It's not important whether it's OP, his friend or just a fantasy. The image of it put a smile on my face, that's what matters to me.
---
The trick is IMO to have a plausible amount of believability while keeping a light-hearted tone to not sound like a braggy idiot.
---
To be fair, we're pretty much at the end of the current raid tier. My guild got AOTC and then we all just started dropping off (this tier really took a lot out of us). 8.2.5 is probably a month away, so it's a great time to dive into Classic.
---
So, by that logic, the people that "cleverly used game mechanics" by killing a boss over and over... thats fine. Blizzard didnt say dont do it. It was a feature in their game that people found out.
---
When they announced classic, i was mainly thrilled because blizzard could keep the game fair, with nobody getting majorly ahead because of bugs, having GM access, people selling gold etc.
---
But whats happened with layering, this has been more fucked up than last private server i played on. Im sure i could have made a lot of gold with layerchanging gathering herbs. But i opted not to. Thats just how i play, not the most resistance, but i want to feel that what i have, i have earned. Not for anyone else, but FOR MYSELF.
---
If you can justify getting ahead, abusing the systems in place, go ahead, abuse them. But jeesus, dont come here and tell like esfand didnt know what he was doing. He saw extra loot and took it, because he wanted more loot. Saying "gm said it was ok", doesnt change the principles behind it.
---
Not in this context
---
Not even close. Flat AP vs obscene haste.
---
So looking forward to the black lotus monopoly in phase 2 from all the hoarders, they'll go for 100 gold each and there will be layer hoppers with stack upon stack of lotus.
---
Layering has fucked classic in multiple ways.
---
/cast NAture’s Swiftness
---
/cast Healing Wave
---
This actually made me giggle
---
It depends,  I have been caught on that some times, some times not. 
---
If you bought the item for a price that it should fetch, ex a pattern and learned it, ut probably wont be removed. If you bought it for 1silver it probably will. If you bought 20 patterns it will probably get removed.
---
&gt; And the GM just gave them streamer/method treatment. Oh sure, you can abuse the system, but just ONCE. 
---
except thats not what the GM said, he said kill them again and it will be looked into over the weekend and if found to be a bug you may get your loot removed. that's not saying sure go ahead and exploit it is?
---
So you're lambasting that you think are wasting their life, while sitting bored at work posting shit on reddit?
---
The irony.
---
Saw someone yesterday named ranalape
---
Why not? We don’t have to save for a mount. Plus, with how many people spam dungeons with mages, it’s a decent ability to have.
---
What's the best way to farm gold from 39 to 40?
---
I'm sitting at around 40 gold and am going to need some help for that dadgum mount.
---
Kinda ridiculous ye, i did something simiøar with a ten slot bag, just opened trade with a random low lvl guy.
---
I did it to help, but him thanking me mde the experience better
---
i think it was poor wording, i was trying to say that if you log on to a bunch of successful auction house sales to do a maximum of 20 dips....additionally this was designed for someone who doesn't heavily utilize the AH....or atleast maybe someone still leveling (like myself)
---
It’s the real life equivalent of someone handing you a crisp $100 bill.
---
You can't with retribution, but you can with hoyl, because you get Consecration which gives you enough AOE threat.
---
What, are you from the department of nomsayins?
---
There are multiple vendors in Gadgetzan.
---
It allows you to hide things like the xp bar, or the blizzard art bar if you'd like to. Otherwise you can keep the stock bars as they are.
---
There are guilds were it's for elitism, then there are some genuine ones that just want to preserve a nice community. All depends on the guild.
---
Then you misunderstood my whole point.
---
Did I ever mention that PvP servers are about corpse camping  and lowbies ganking? Nope I didn’t. I merely stated that neither me nor my gf enjoy those crap. 
---
So please point me to the exact message where I stated that world pvp is nothing but hunting for lowbies or getting ganked by 60s. If you can, I will apologise. If not, you’re the one putting words in my mouth.
---
Don't feel sad. You have a life :)
---
Dumb as hell. Punish someone for finding flaws in your own system. GG. That's like banning wall jumpers.
---
Good XP though with all the quests and how quick and easy it is to run
---
Donate me some gold I will thank you lol.
---
Ask any real PVPer, It doesn’t matter if you win by 1hp or 1000hp, winning is winning.
---
This is great! 
---
I have a "routine" I do during play. For those worried about the squats: they get easier if you keep doing them!
---
The arena chest is a lot of fun. I have 6/12 trinkets for AGM, but I haven't really gone for it in a while.
---
Does it provide a well fed buff?
---
Okay, that's definitely exploity and weird.
---
I keep handing out my buff food in stacks of 3-5 and most ppl seem to just accept and say thanks lol. A few ppl have turned it down but not many
---
We just have to agree to disagree.
---
That’s the most annoying thing? Well then damn online gaming must be on an upswing lmao
---
I'm so tired of these friendly reminder tank posts.
---
This isnt POE.
---
elvui with healbot is going ok here
---
That's a redesign of the game as it stands, which is likely not something that would happen, because such efforts would be better spent going into WoW2 (if there even is such a thing :))
---
Least effort / highest reward comes from player nostalgia (the first three expansions), and former players that joined late and so never got to experience the "golden age", and now get that chance.
---
There's no real problem in having X amount of servers at different expansion stages as long as they become evenly fanned out over time. As noted below, Everquest has 8 different Progression servers active currently, with at least five of them at different expansions. (There, they release a new expansion on progression servers every 3 months on average)
---
Have the same Problem! Maybe Our addons cause These disconnects?
---
I love this, but mostly want to give you +10 internet for that jumping Jack icon.
---
My zone knowledge is not great, but personally I avoided the hell out of STV, it's just and awful overcrowded gankfest. (Even on a PvE server I imagine there's too many people to quest effectively).
---
As for your role in dungeons - whatever you feel comfortable with! Hybrid classes can fill all of their roles well enough until endgame.
---
Wait so everyone’s a winner ? No obviously your thinking here is flawed.
---
Let’s say there’s one guy who can use the item and equip it as an upgrade 4 others roll for it that can’t use it but want gold &amp; ofc it goes to one of the players who are rolling for the item to sell, now by your thinking one player will get gold but let me say they won’t split that money and meanwhile the poor Pearson who actually needed the item now wants to run it again to try and get the item because their item is several levels below where it should be currently, they try again to have this happen repeatedly over the course of lvls 10-60 in any manner of the game. 
---
Seems that the person who gets the item is benefitting not the person who needs the item, which perpetuates the problem as more people get screwed over more people will do this.
---
Also it’s not benefitting the economy as it’s not adding gold to the economy or the players on mass it’s just benefitting the ninja looter and moving a number onto their account.
---
Well there are 3 factors
---
1. You know what you do
---
2. You have a group that does the same and is online at the same time
---
3. You play 16-18 hours per day.
---
Dude I have the same issue with dominos. No resolution yet. I'll check back here if you get one and recomment if I figure it out.
---
I hope they will. Just stay away from the Classic servers and force people to play their expansions. They should probably also make servers will all new content. 
---
As long as servers are differentiated they can do all they want.
---
I feel ya, but you should also spam your drink-button right as the last mob is about to die, that way you can drink for a good 10 seconds while they are fighting the next pack
---
And in songform

No Joy for Roy.
---
It's called Fizzle (the sound I think) and I will see if I can find my working one for you tonight when I get home.
---
Thats heartbreaking. I leveled a Tauren warrior and one of the reasons I swapped for alliance was to be able to see, just SEE more murlocs. What a sad moment to play Classic. I guess I gotta go to the next Blizzcon just in case they bring them back.
---
It's probably the hardest class to find instances and raids because the class is over populated and they bring little CC/utility to groups. It's not very fast to level, but once you get to lv30 things start to speed up.
---
Honestly, if you are 30/40+ and not arms, you are just asking for a hard time while leveling lol
---
I'll wake up in the crossroads inn on thunder fury fully refreshed and no que.
---
The point I was making had nothing to do with what level you're at in the game. My point was that the so-called "Devilsaur Mafias" dont have the power they once held. There's no need to take things so personally. It's a video game
---
Yup, those cloth Int robes the feral druid just can't live without, when there's a priest, mage and warlock in the group who are all wearing plastic bags
---
Priests die a lot less though, and it's not the time to kill that slows down leveling, it's the time spent dead and corpse running and eating/drinking.
---
Thank you very much! Seems like not all of the reddits suddenly hates art stuff, right?   
---
Really, thank you very much, i've catched a tilt cuz of all this stuff with blames and downvotes.
---
There's a big difference between enjoying the standard UI and calling any custom UI a "cancer interface".
---
Hi all,
---
I played in vanilla through WotLK but this is my first time plying a paladin. I’m still low (10) but feeling a little confused about how to play since my previous experience was only with hunter &amp; priest. I’ve got a weapon swing timer so I’m making sure I’m not clipping my auto attack with Judgement. Other than that, what’s the best rotation/seal to be using right now? I’m leveling with my boyfriend (he’s playing frost mage, this is his first time playing) and I’m trying to tank and heal for us as best I can.
---
I really want to be healing in dungeons (wish it was BC so I could try out tanking too!) so I’m wondering what gear stats/suffixes I should be looking for for both leveling with a mage as well as healing. I’m aware he and I will be competing on some level for spellcaster gear but I’m just so unfamiliar with paladin that I don’t know what I should be collecting for either role.
---
And finally, if you’re playing Alliance on Azuresong-US...we’re looking for a guild, preferably one with that nice “no politics whatsoever” rule in guild chat.
---
Thanks y’all, I’m sure I’ll have more questions as we keep going but I really want to make sure I learn and master my class.
---
The real reason is that you dont have a good argument, cause there arent any. It is literally a question between keeping it as it was back in 06 for nostalgic reasons or being able to actually play the game.
---
Guess which side wins in that argument?
---
Just stop buying stuff and none vital spells.  
---
There is quite a bit of spells/skills that are not worth it pre 40 just from a cost perspective.  
---
Stop buying stuff of AH between 20-40 (seriously) 
---
Stop trying to level your professions between 20-40 
---
You spend a lot of gold on both recipes and ingredients.   (None gathering). 
---
Example: weak flux cost 1S each so to craft 30 items you spend 30S. It adds up.  
---
Consider either mailing your alt stacks of mats while leveling your gathering prof.  AH off what you don’t need.  Once at 40 just click return mail from alt and level prof then.
---
You're actually retarded holy shit
---
That’s what I do, and honesty if that bothers people they can fuck off. How else are you supposed to field a 40 man raid? I play on Faerlina, there’s ONLY mega guilds. I always try to have a conversation with the person.
---
Does it annoy you to get invited to a raid group? Well it annoys me more to have to compete against larger guilds with streamer names and have people leave randomly for no reason or with no notice despite putting time into helping them out.
---
It’s just a byproduct of how the game’s social and raiding systems work.
---
I just gotto wetlands and the "Spawn Angel" is so far away, the amount of times i saw a corpse and ressed them. I just know how annoying it is when you die, added onto the fact that you now have to run for 7 hours to get to your body. Even though i enjoy hunter, I rerolled to Priest just so i could heal random players if i saw they were low, or ress ppl etc. The community is so worth that extra effort!
---
Trust me, I do!
---
even so its very mana inefficient. Look at how much mana it costs and how much hp you save with it. Compare it to your biggest heal.
---
Only use it for emergencies as it is an instant cast
---
What’s the addon that tells vendor price??
---
What’s your class, out of curiosity?
---
Just because you found it behind an unmarked door does not means it’s okay to get it. Starbucks has tons of money they could have paid for a sticker on the door.
---
And in both case if you done it once could be an accident, if you do it each time you know you were asking for it if they found out
---
Yesterday in Mulgore I was handing out cloaks I had made. I would find someone without one or a lower one, and then whispered to ask if they wanted a free cloak. Then on the trade I would give them a little gift with it. One guy got an added bag, and another got a green shield. 
---
It always makes me feel good to be able to help out others.
---
Did anyone actually transfer from Shazzrah-Eu to drsgonfang?
---
I'm curious to know the state of that server since last night when I logged in I had a 5k queue and it was sitting on "low" lol.
---
Yea purely farming select mobs yields a lot more gold than questing per hour.
---
Those rock eles in badlands are cash money.
---
Select flair!  Sidebar of the subreddit.  :)
---
if people don't wait a second and go ham, then they apparently want to tank. But if they wait a second for you to use some aoe threat, then they can start their aoe abilities themselves and everything is fine. Those 5 seconds were an intentional extreme example, obviously...
---
Never said it was good bro.
---
Having to main tank his wife is rough.
---
\+Better gameplay (faster and more interesting rotations etc according to me)  
---
\-Alot of the stuff you do feels like useless fluff just to keep you playing, neck lvl mostly  
---
\-/+Can't speak for classics raids but the raids in retail is awesome atm (and have been for a while) just as long as you stay out of lfr  
---
Those are the big 3 things for me in the game  
---
Sidenote: I no longer play any of the games due I feel they are just endless grinds and I don't have the time to play enough for me to have fun
---
Yeah I just prefer it, because it makes everything lots easier for a first time wow player.
---
No, many probably can't. Thats why they can build new servers with new content, other expansions, all sorts of shit. But that should be new servers, not current ones "evolving".
---
I never found most quests interesting enough for me to care about reading the text in detail anyways.  In vanilla I usually just skimmed them and if the location wasn't obvious or I went where I thought something was and it wasn't there I just looked it up.  So I find having the things marked on the map/mini map must less immersion breaking than jumping onto wow head or whatever.
---
Walked through yesterday on my way to Stonard - bright &amp; sunny. Only seen weather once since launch &amp; that was in Mulgore at level 6.
---
I'm a feral druid all the way and been healing everything since SM. Had 1500 mana at 34 and healed every dungeon just fine. Then along the way I got all the int gear from SM and now have over 3.2k mana and am healing just fine every dungeon. Thing is it's faster to level, since I don't have to be a high level and care if I hit mobs. I just have to heal my team mates.
---
I did SM Cath at 34. And RFD at 38 just fine. I was even healing SM while warrior was wielding 2H. Although I had to drink a lot in between.
---
&gt;edit: USE THE FUCKING PRINTSCREEN BUTTON FOR GOD'S SAKE MAN

HASHTAG WHITEMANE REALM

Another sole lost to the neglect of reset exp.

Press f to pay respects.

-cheers
---
So we just not going to talk about the EU server that somehow managed to be like 98% Alliance? How the fuck
---
You're an idiot.
---
You realize that I'm talking about winning actual fights, not just getting a title or a mount?
---
Typical retail player, no wonder you enjoy it so much, it's perfect for you.
---
I also /Y whenver I thank someone
---
Look at this mastermind over here who could program a software with probably over million lines of code without any bug.
---
My usual cat rotation on mobs:  
---
Prowl - Ravage - Rake - Rip &lt;-&gt; Shred (claw) - Shred (claw) - Shred (claw) ... - Bite  
---
This depends on if you are solo or group and  how fast the mob goes down.  
---
I am leveling all the time with a hunter and we are doing around the same damage on mobs.
---
Farming whelpings is good silver from greys and the have a chance at dropping a pet. The pet will fund you all the way to 60 if you are lucky enough to get one.
---
There's a murloc pet in retail wow, there's a LOT of them actually. Both from blizzcon and from ingame.
---
However there will not be any murlocs pets in classic.
---
Which class are you playing, out of curiosity? I’m getting warlock vibes.
---
Another Innocent ruins the day of the murderous elevator.
---
This I can absolutely agree with! We need a way to express this stuff to devs as a group.
---
Could be a reward though, as you could get items that are now unobtainable.
---
Master at the game? Buddy, its Vanilla. Its not that complicated to do anything in the game
---
This.
---
One of the quickest runs of gnomer i've ever done was 3 arms warriors with sweeping strikes and a healer.
---
I'd say respecc when you can afford  [Doomforged Straightedge](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12535/doomforged-straightedge) for off. Yes you'll miss alot but it aint that bad if you're human &amp; got trinket for mara etc.   [Doomforged Straightedge](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12535/doomforged-straightedge) &amp; Thrash blade is Bis until 55 ish.
---
How does it feel right now to think that anything you type is funny or smart &amp; your pushing the boundaries ?
---
#feelsgoodright
---
Well, where did you get your misinformation that you were spreading then? I just know that vid says &lt;crusade&gt; did what you say they did, which is incorrect.
---
It was a side note about where the wrong info could've come from, not the main point which is how the layering bug was not connected to Crusades raid reset
---
I didn't get a suspension or lose any items
---
"It cant rain all the time."
---
9/10 the healer is oom because he sucks though.  Just because the tank is a dumbass doesn't mean the healer isn't also a dumbass.
---
You read the part where I said leather right?
---
Still got \~10d for the guys that signed for 1 month at launch. That might be the first cut off, another coming month after that.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pve-stat-priority
---
Leveling though, an upgrade is upgrade regardless of perfect stats.
---
It’s an example to show how much wPvP turns her off. The misery far outweighs any joys from  potential decent PvP. Sure, there are great PvPs, especially when you turnaround a difficult match. But any single time she gets killed = alt-f4 time. Spending time looking for revenge (regardless of revenging the same dude, or take it out on others) is a turn off too. There are absolutely no way she would ever enjoy PvP servers based on that. 
---
Yeh my fault for getting her into a PvP server. I’m used to getting attacked in retail, but not her.
---
We had a Hunter doing this non stop.  He caused three wipes before I figured it out.  Then I caught him in the act and asked wtf he was doing, “I’m kiting.”
---
Kicked him on the spot.  Then the fuck goes and aggroes every monster can he find to wipe us.
---
I did not know it was a bad thing. I am glad I had only a warning for it. You have to consider that even if it's called an exploit now, it took a lot of effort, so it's fair that I keep the few things won.
---
20 seconds? Your doing it wrong lol look up some  priest guides and all the pros and experienced wow players will say there one of he top solo leveling class. Mage is obviously OP, but if you find the right rotation and know how MP5 works then there’s no down time at all. It’s constant exp. lvl 52 shadow priest here. 
---
Has no one told you? Wands are OP in vanilla
---
On Firemaw, we've had around 5-10 of each long before the exploit was made public.  The pricing on these items (rn being 100-150 gold) is not because of people "farming 100s" of them. It's because everyone is literally spamming Strat and scholo. They are bound to drop for alot of people. The demand for them is way lower than the supply. Regardless of exploit or not.
---
Blizzard have forums for exactly this reason. Post it on there, it becomes a popular post, gains attention from a community manager, they shunt it up the ladder to a bluey, and hey presto.
---
Stop using the word boomers incorrectly
---
Weird as it’s exactly what you said it belongs on the AH right ?
---
I'll chime in that rested bonus really makes a difference here if you get to play less. Make sure to always logout at an inn.
---
If conent can be cleared in a week and doesn't make players want to repeat it, it's poorly designed. You don't need tons of unique content, you need conent that people enjoy for the sake of it, not for the sake of completion or rewards. People don't play Starcraft or Counter Strike repeatedly for loot, they do it for fun. Battlegrounds, arenas dungeons and raids can provide that kind of fun, but PvP systems are confusing and poorly balanced (oh boy I could spend hours writing about all that is wrong with BfA PvP), dungeons are dull, uniformic and sloggish (especially on fortified weeks, compare that to challenging but fast Fractal system in GW2 or, conversely, the immersive vanilla dungeons) and raiding, while still very enjoyable on its own, is hamstrung by terrible class design, uniformity and  pointless grinds for AP, titanforges or benthics.
---
thanks, if you like that you should look closely at my chair dips icon...some of my "finest" work
---
These posts are so... Pathetic. Take it up with your groups. Reddit doesnt care about the 100th "wait for sunder" and "healers need mana" post of the day.
---
Have some self respect and leave those groups instead of suffering through them.
---
"But I thought that you had to kill ragnaros 8 times!!"
---
Shadow word: pain on multiple targets can be problematic in my experience. Although I’m playing as a healer, and doing dps inbetween. I’m only level 33 though. 
---
I would only attack the tanks primary target, and remember to use fade!
---
If you draw aggro, run to the tank. He will usually try and grab the mob/mobs off you. It is hard for him to do if he has to chase you around
---
True, but it’s not unreasonable to find a group. Even if you’re spec’d into Arms or Fury, you can still slap on a 1h and Shield and tank pretty effectively, and tanks are always in demand especially for those two sections I got my WW axe at 31 and just got Bonebiter last night as I dinged 36 in Cath.
---
I’d rather have a ret DPS than prot pally tank
---
I see this sentence a lot. In practice never ever seen a warrior doing a good dps. Is it too early to warriors to be the king? or am I missing something?
---
After doing many quests with a priest including some Arathi elites - they are quite good at tanking and holding aggro :\] but for DPS a lot is locked behind good wand.
---
I find it interesting when one of their selling points is " we have over 1000 members!". Dunno about you guys but I'd hate to be in a guild that im just one of the masses.
---
Look at that pretty picture you drew! We’re so proud of you. We’re going to hang it up on the fridge in the break room.
---
Cool setup dude. just dont like the term "to be quenched" D:::
---
This. I've never used any addons that drastically change the UI. Wouldn't feel comfortable doing it now.
---
The sad part is layering has diminished the blanket trust I once had in the game. If someone had something you can just be happy for them with no strings attached. 
---
Arena Grand Master? Probably layering
---
Epic mount early? Probably layering
---
Rich early? Probably layering
---
Special pets? Probably layering
---
Tidal Charm? Probably layering
---
&gt; hell ive seen people fury tank raids on overtuned servers
---
Speccing into fury and fury tanking is recommended at certain points as holding threat is a bigger concern than mitigation.
---
This ^ I used Bartender 4 to rearrange the bars and even replaced one with a lion!
---
Whisper me about the Edgemasters Handguards, so they can drop for me please.
---
Weapon skill-ups seem to depend on the difference between enemy level and your skill. For starters pick something ~10lvls below you. The enemies should ideally have no abilities and just melee.
---
Are you making the best use of your mana pool, by casting a few spells then switching to bear to finish the mob off? Then your mana regenerates while you are bear. Can get pretty efficient leveling that way.
---
To add to this - if you're running as DPS then you do want to get SW:P on everything, and it's worth experimenting to find out how soon you can apply it - it will be different with each tank. (And I mean that both in terms of classes and individual players). Often you can apply it immediately, but if you find yourself getting aggro hold off for a few seconds on future pulls. Most trial and error isn't gonna cause you to wipe :) 
---
If you're healing it's not really worth the mana to cast at all.
---
The same way a healer knows which rank of heals to bust out at what time on each player. It's from trying different approaches on the given player in that run. Every tank will generate threat differently, so you have to experiment with when to start nuking to reduce your chance of pulling. It is the art of dpsing. Or use add-ons.... But don't.
---
Thank you for the disclaimer. These types of posts circulate frequently with video games or tv shows and they’re always acting as if it’s a quick fit scheme, they’re always misleading. It’s a great idea to remind people to get up and move every now and then.
---
how long do you take a break for? and also 15 years ago i hated the gym
---
Normally the server transfer is closing for starting the procedure. If you already started it, and your char is on the other server, it's no problem.
---
As a level 30 hunter and skinner, thousand needles again, just going around again and again killing everything in the wyverns. 
---
Leather, gold, the occasional chest spawn.
---
With the ability to annoy the hell out the the horde players doing the escort quest to break the monotony.
---
Pull aggro run towards tank, 
---
Tank pulls or have a designated puller.  Aka not you!
---
Don’t cast pws on a warrior/Druid tank pre pull, they need rage to manage threat 
---
Don’t cast hots pre pull if you don’t like getting the attention of all the mobs. 
---
Manage threat and if you pull aggro stop dps that target. 
---
Be nice to your fellow groupers
---
Depends on the guild we have 2 war's 2 ferals and 1 pala tank, 1 real ret and 1 spelladin the ferals do dps mostly. Had 3 below lvl 60. Most of us hadnt set foot in MC in years killed Rag in 1 try yesterday. Raiding is piss easy right now. Naxx and AQ might require a more balanced set up, but i am certain there will be a place for sub optimal specs in non try hard guilds. So follow your heart and dont listen to these wannabee method players doubt they even 60 yet cause seriously everything is piss easy
---
Going to try when I’m home tonight. Does it work with the gforce experience on?
---
Honestly. You can blame retail for this. Itemization in classic is more freeform and honestly better than BFA. Itemization is not as clear cut as in live where plate dps wear plate; leather dps wear leather dps. Warriors use str; Rogues agi.
---
Not to.mention personal loot.
---
I agree. I’m level 39 warrior currently. It’s a genuinely amazing experience. Level 1/30 I wS struggling to fight one mob at a time sometimes. Now I can take on 2 with ease. I highly recommend doing the cyclonian quest. Whirlwind axe is as op as they come.
---
Another thing to note I haven't seen here: 
---
Stay behind the tank: don't pull for him and literally stay behind. It's easy to accidentally aggro in lots of places if you are off to the side and don't notice enemies on a ledge or around a corner. Though keep an eye behind you for wandering patrols (pats).
---
Also, you are slightly more durable (and less important, sorry) than the healer. In an emergency situation where the heals is taking damage and the tank is struggling, you and your pet can take a mob or two off of the heals.
---
Running a few dungeons will help push you up the levels and open up a few more zones. As mention stv right now is hell on pvp too many players.
---
This is referencing a feminazi statement that [has since reached meme status](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/video-games-appeal-to-the-male-fantasy).
---
Does this also go for the mage that exploited layering to get world first 60?
---
yeah...i found some clip arts and re-colored them to match my theme.
---
I agree. Let's ban everyone who's been hit by a bug.
---
Sounds like a country filled to the brim with gypsies.
---
Now that's my kind of fitness plan!
---
Ya boy
---
that's a good addition.
---
Personally I think there shouldn’t be any bans...They just shouldn’t have added layering that was so easy to move between.  They put in the effort, just turn of layering.
---
Im thinking go the OSRS route. They add new content to the old style of Runescape that's exclusively OSRS because people didn't like the route "retail" runescape went. 
---
There are many parallels with Runescape and WoW in this regard.
---
A big thing to take away is that in OSRS, next to the bank, members can vote every month or so on re adding features and even adding new features. Majority with a winning margin percentage enacts it. Anything else is a No.
---
Making it happen ingame and making it ingame public knowledge is the way to ensure that ALL players can have a say in this new fresh chance we have.
---
our client is running 1.13, witch is based on 1.12 running on 7.3.5,
---
im confused by that item because being added in 1.13 would mean it was added for classic, and that surely didnt happen.
---
in vanilla there was 2.0 after 1.12
---
Is there a difference between tukui and elvui?
---
Einstein criticised the experiment done by Niels Bohr. Bohr claimed that through quantum physics a delicately arranged experiment where you should only expect one outcome produces different results every time. Einstein said that this is madness. The „god does not throw dice“ quote fits the same way. 
---
Quantum physics explains a lot through probability. Einstein didn’t like that idea.
---
HaHa
---
None have been announced but they existed during Vanilla's era so it's not impossible that they will at some point allow it, as it doesn't break #nochanges.
---
Whats the average xp/h at level 40? level 50?
---
Okay, roblckbiter/earth shock are what I was going to ask about. Tell me about your rotation, then. And as for your usage of earth shock, I’m assuming it’s only rank 1 for interrupts?
---
So use an item that zooms in... can we delete this shit please?
---
without addons try via a macro:
---
/console MainMenuBarLeftEndCap:SetFrameStrata("TOOLTIP") MainMenuBarRightEndCap:SetFrameStrata("TOOLTIP")
---
with addons try download the [Gryphons Remover](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gryphons-remover/files/2773127)
---
install as you would any addon - then open the xml file and change the code to:
---
 &lt;Ui&gt;&lt;Script&gt;MainMenuBarLeftEndCap:SetFrameStrata("TOOLTIP"); MainMenuBarRightEndCap:SetFrameStrata("TOOLTIP")&lt;/Script&gt;&lt;/Ui&gt;
---
My ass is going to look great before phase 2.
---
Would be 30k+ minimum for a site like this. Probably more if done in the US.
---
Everyone knows it’s a joke, it’s just not that funny. Don’t get too butthurt over the downvotes.
---
its better than the hydration and leg checks that were circulating the barrens chat throughout launch
---
splitting the community is such a bullshit argument. you assume everyone who now plays will keep playing whatever you give them. that is just wrong.
---
some people want to play classic, some tbc, some wotlk and wont bother with the other 2 options.
---
This happened when I hand out bags. The other day I was in Deathknell and I could barely give a bag away. After announcing that there were free bags for new players repeatedly, I had to just go up to people and initiate a trade. The best I got was a single bow.
---
This is not right and does not save time. Everyone knows you have to eat some tp before you shit.
---
Im 52 and still got WW axe running.
---
Yes, but Shoot is an repeating action that triggers GCD, most of the time it's better to be ready to cleanse or heal then do 60 dps.
---
Here’s the thing though: the people who don’t get banned from the layering exploit (hopefully blizzard catches everyone but some people are gonna slip through) WILL have that much gold and some items may actually end up going for that price, so idk someone might buy it.
---
Someone is maining mage
---
I'd say likely not but I could be wrong. While we're on client 1.13, they're somewhat staggering the release of loot tables with the phases to coincide with earlier patch/releases during Vanilla. Dire maul and other similar catch-up loot tables aren't out yet, and those came along pre 1.13.
---
there is a purple parrot (Hyacinth Macaw) that is the rarest in game with a estimated drop of around 1 in 10.000, that should go for a ridiculous amount of money on a aged server.  A green whelpling or this oozeling should also set you up good.
---
How is this a thing? If this is supposed to be 1.12, why aren't Brokentooth and Lupos normalized?
---
thanks a lot for very detailed answer. i really feel like i should use q,e,r,f to some extend and your answer clarified it. did some macro work as well so some skills also change stance if needed. I'll be checking your channel on twitch as soon as i leave work :)
---
I was there last night!!  What server are you on? I may have seen you, although I'm horde.  Zone is super fun to level in and very populated with both factions!
---
This.Is.classic.
---
K U N G E N B O Y S
---
I meant a link to the blue post..?
---
fair enough, thx
---
Not running out saves a lot of time. In instances like mara or brd where you have to take off your gear and die and run back it saves you even more time.
---
Is that what they call a throng of gnomes?
---
I believe rockbiter is better dps however in dungeon its better to use flametongue as rockbiter causes extra threat like earthshock.
---
Go into options and block channel invites.
---
You can still see the gray text showing that you get the invite, along with extra text that says “you have channel invites blocked in your settings.” Or something along those lines.
---
Setting this also gives you the option to right click their Gray Name and report them for Spam/Name/Cheating/ETC.
---
You have to right click the name in the gray text, doing /who will not work for reporting.
---
Hope this helps!

Hunters will almost always be your best bet because even if they don't want it for eating themselves, they'll need it to keep up their pet's happiness.

Alright good to know cheater.

I played fury 2h til 36 when i got ww, arms til 49 when i got my thrash blade, went fine to lvl 60 with it. But i also had human sword perc.

''communist theme plays'' u must share them with your class uh uhm faction
---
Regarding resists if you have the shadow talent ”Shadow Focus” you have better chance on not resisting against higher level opponent in PVP
---
Downranking works later in the game when you have lots of +healing on your items. Slow healing spells are also more mana efficiënt and benefit more from +healing.
---
You know blizzard has made every single test about everything with their "actual data" right? That's why several bugs appears like raid exp not working properly.
---
I literally run dungeons all day (I come from EQ, where that is what you did) and ive met plenty of cool people long the way.
---
I actually dungeon run with a lot of the same people daily , my servers medium pop and you can easily make a name for yourself is what it appears.
---
Apples to oranges my friend.
---
you put your hand up on my hip, when I dip you dip we dip, you dip yours and I dip mine
---
Check out the addon "5 Second Rule".  It puts a castbar-like bar under your mana (assuming you're using the default ui) that shows exactly when your mana ticks hit.
---
As far as the hows of it, I just wait until the tank is below half and use the most efficient heal I have and hots on dps, but I'm a pretty crappy healer to be honest.
---
enjoy it, exploiting bfa plebs. cant play the game normally, can u?...
---
Its actually more fun imho
---
&gt; while none of this really happens. I have yet to be ganked once by a ?? player and I am 42 on a PvP realm.
---
A single instance of anecdotal evidence doesn't really mean much in the context of hundreds of thousands of players. It's akin to something like using the Queen of Denmark (who has been smoking 20-40 cigarettes per day for many years) in a claim that smoking isn't unhealthy, since she is still alive. 
---
I've had lvl ??'s gank me a couple of times and I'm only 33 on a PvP realm. Furthermore, I've seen multiple gankfests happening, so you claiming they simply don't happen is absolutely ludicrous. But I guess that is to be expected if you are basing your claim solely on anecdotal evidence.
---
In offence but this gives me eye cancer
---
It shows all incoming heals, your own included. I think it would be useful now that I'm downranking certain spells to have an idea of what heal to load up after the one being cast has landed - even more so when raid healing comes into play.
---
I might give indicators another shot perhaps! Also, I can't get the stupid thing to work with showing absolute HP of my target (might be enemies only, but I do have the RealEnemyHealth addon which should take care of that part, but doesn't mesh with ElvUI). It also doesn't show exact Mana or HP numbers after exceeding 1000 HP/Mana, and it insists on showing the first 5 letters of names in the party/raid interface.
---
If I managed to fix those issues I could live with Elv, but some seem impossible to fix.
---
Holy shit. I know what I'm doing when I get that level. Put on some chill music and stab and kill away.
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Lupos was normalized then, Broken Tooth wasn't until 1.9
---
I hope all the streamers, Asmongold included, get banned.
---
Fuck them all for promoting this shit.
---
If you feel guilty getting the loot just delete the items yourself. Why make this post?
---
Pretty sure reckoning as a stacking buff was patched out before 1.12 due to it being pretty exploitable.
---
I *think* they way it works now is by instantly resetting your swing-timer to grant you an 'extra' attack after you are crit.
---
I don't think it's a very good talent when you consider how far down in the tree it is. If you want to do some AOE tanking/grinding as a paladin hybrid specs work much better.
---
Yup, exactly, just as the paladin said, thanks
---
Watch out. There's a rogue named "rocketman" with with him
---
There's a box to untick in the sound settings of the game. No need for an addon.
---
Nice troll. Hunters are supposed to kite, that's how the fucking class is played.
---
What kind of retard thinks "pussy hunter, FIGHT ME IN MELEE LIKE A MAN" lmfao
---
Hey folks just don't do the chair dips with your fancy wheely chair.
---
An alternative to bartender is dominos, which I prefer.  I find setup way more convenient and straight forward.
---
I wouldn't use at the start of the fight, or at least use it on a second target -&gt; use CP to slice&amp;dice -&gt; switch to main target. Tanks generally need the rage or the damage from shield-blocks.
---
It wouldn't help for this particular exploit but it could help for others.
---
It's really not that much data. At my job (financial, so different sector) we record hundreds of billions of events per day and store them for at least 2 years, and our system is on the small side.
---
It's like if you borrowed your dads car to take your girlfriend to dinner and then later on your dad finds out you banged in it and didnt clean the leather seats or the gear shift. Yeah you went to dinner but this wasnt an intended use of the feature.
---
Omg really? That's very surprising. And discouraging Haha.
---
Might give that a go ... Who an I kidding my ocd will make me try it. Ty!
---
IMO (for Classic+, which would be at least a year away at this point), QoL changes are fine, they just have to be implemented in a way that actually makes sense in the world and doesn't slowly eat away at immersion and RPG aspects. Let me give an example of a QoL change that is already in the game: Flight points. They're certainly a QoL feature, and it could be argued that not having flight points to a certain extent would make the world feel bigger, since you'd need to travel through it properly every time.
---
And yet flight points are fairly unanimously liked in their current state (I think)? Because they are a QoL change that makes sense in the world, and doesn't break immersion. An example of almost the same QoL change that would be much worse would just replacing all the flight points with portals. And an example of almost the same QoL change that would be catastrophically bad would be to just have an interface button which allows you to fast travel from city to city, because that has zero ingame representation of how the travel actually works.
---
So for bounties, what would be terrible is just having an interface window that is accessible everywhere that lists every bounty on the faction and you can instantly redeem it. But adding a "bounty hunter hut" (or whatever) to a couple of major cities, that you can actively go to and pay for individual "WANTED: Asmongold" items that you need to keep in your bag during the kill (maybe the kill gives you a head) and until you then redeem the bounty at that hut, would be a great system. (At least design wise, no idea how it'd play out, but it sounds like it could be fun. There should probably a cooldown between bounties on a single player though, so you can only get successfully hunted once every 3 days or so.)
---
Yeah I got an alt sitting at the auction house all day so that would be disastrous for me :)
---
You should never get AP over agility, unless the upgrade is so blatantly better. 
---
Without having the exact number, I’d say three AP at least. Your most important stat by far is crit, which agility grants.
---
I was 100% sure this is going to be a screenshot from a different layer because you missed it. Glad to see its not. Nice fight!!
---
It has gotten better, during launch week the queues were like 10-12k when attempting to log in during peak hours. Now its like 4-5k, when I get home from work like 17:30 put my self to queue Im usually in by 19:00.
---
I use questie and zygor its really good, zygor is a must have on retail for me its not only a leveling guide but on classic its good to but not as good as for retail, so im not sure if u want to pay for it if u only play classic maybe just use questie or take the free trial if u can.
---
Pretty much all of wowhead is "updated" for 1.13 since that's the patch we're on.
---
Are being dumb on purpose or does it just come naturally to you?
---
All underrepresented classes are underrepresented because no one wants them in raid.
---
If you want a raid spot, play a healer. Paladin/ Shaman / Priest
---
If you want to DPS Warrior / Mage the. If you are super good, warlock or rogue.
---
Every other class is borderline useless.
---
My favorite thing in WoW is all the glitches. Unfortunately wall jumping is gone so I'm focused on my other favorite thing. Raiding. And thus I've leveled somewhat fast. Hitting all the quests. At 57 atm. But I've also got my professions up and plan to make money off summer fish before the season changes. I'd say for anyone playing always set a few end goals but make daily one step goals. If not it's easy to lose focus on the marathon ahead.
---
Are we ever going to get an armory, and accurate server statistics ?
---
Where can I find accurate data like this ?
---
I have the same error, no other addons activated, if I load into the game with all the grid2 addon parts active, /grid2 or using the interface-&gt;addon menu will show grid2 is here however no option menu is showing up it doesnt react at all and even if I join a group, no interface or any change is showing.
---
Redownloaded it with your link because I thought maybe I downloaded a wrong version but it still doesnt react at all.
---
I have no option to make it appear, LUA Error arent showing anything either.
---
Do I need another addon for it? Do i need to change my settings of the blizzard UI to make it work? Any help is welcome :o
---
The most helpful hunter macro would be
---
"/s Sorry I pulled"
---
Insectoid meme is real

How can he get banned for something he didn't do?

Ally scum here but this actually gave me goosebumps, gj
---
Sounds like someone thinks everyone did what they did to rationalize being shitty
---
Starts off well and as combat your killing speed it good but finding groups can be hard.
---
They sure are blurry on the rules aren't they? Is changing layers to kill a quest mob when mine has 500 people in it considered exploiting? These fast and loose rules are hard to keep up with.
---
Hi, /u/runawaycity2000

realy, 50 chars O\_o ?

not the best fate😔
---
jokes on him, I'm an efficient programmer that writes buggy 3-line codes on a daily base 8)
---
These are mobs that drop valuables semi reliably. I farm some specific mobs at certain levels for this reason. A post the other days said ogers are always great to farm as they have a higher chance to drop greens.
---
Check my other comment but yeah I hear “I don’t care if I die as long as I do meeega damage” and shit like that all the time. 
---
You’re fucking my healing up and making me burn through your conjured water, so can we TRY slowing down?
---
Can you pasted your macro code here?
---
Well, I think the issue is that your question kind of falls in the same category as asking someone who bought a car why they didn't buy a pickup truck as well. He wanted a car, why would that make him want both?
---
Most people tend to have a horde/ally preference and making a guide like this takes a lot of time an effort, so a lot of people (myself included) might consider the answer to your question quite obvious: He didn't want to do it
---
Dungeon mobs on classic do like 1/3 the damage of pservers. So if you go prot you will be rage starved. Use a 2h and get rage that way
---
It's actually really inefficient, from the level you step into BRD you sacrifice all loot, all gold, you're just gaining raw exp.
---
Meanwhile you could be doing actual BRD runs, completing important quests you need to do as a Mage such as the one for the ring, MC attunement, obtaining gold from loot, obtaining BIS items from BRD bosses (there's about 3/4 pre raid BIS items in BRD for Mage), as you get a little closer to 60 you can move this to Strat and LBRS and Scholo to work towards your end-game set/epic mount WHILE gaining exp, instead of sitting in a little room mindlessly killing mobs for 24 hours straight and then doing all that content which would otherwise give you exp anyway afterwards when you realise you need all of these things.
---
I use a addon called dominos. It is a neat addons to switch your bars around. Just remove the main bar. 'hide it" so you don't have switching stance bars. Make macros on all abilities I use charge and hamstring on the same binding Also for intercept to safe a keybind. You have a better overview over your abilities then when you switch around all the time. I use ctrl and shift for extra buttons. Gl
---
Lol look at damage meters in raids bro. If warriors are lower than rogues it is because their weapons are horrible or they themselves are.
---
You tanks don't get it. We know, we choose not to care as topping the dps meter in scarlet monastry is paramount.
---
Pretty sure most of the Uldaman quests are shareable, at least they were on alliance.
---
Love it nice work!
---
Druid
---
Just like flash, it'll crash your computer because of poor coding
---
I hate when I get invited to a deadmines group and there's a paladin/warrior and they say they're both dpsing. Dude do you guys just wanna wait all day for dedicated tanks and healers?
---
Besides not having a pull exercise like pull ups, it's a pretty good whole body workout.
---
Oooo all 'dat inventory space you just cleared up! And all that tasty silver!
---
Level 22 Paladin here going to SFK, gotta get that hammer that the IF weaponsmith left there so I can get that sweet  Mace :)
---
But yeah, SFK, WC, Stockades, Gnomeregan
---
&gt;but I could be wrong. While we're on client 1.13, they're somewhat staggering the release of loot tables with the phases to coincide with earlier
---
Okay that's confusing but i got an idea, thank you!
---
Try to find people while leveling. Add to your friend-list and ask them if you're looking for more people.
---
A lot of nerds on here crack the shits when you don't screenshot...but shit its easier to just take a photo with your phone and upload to reddit whilst still playing
---
if you need it because its an upgrade press Need.  
---
all the rest is geed, or discussed otherwise with your party members
---
Thanks for the reply. My view on alchemy/enchanting is their is no personal benefit to it as you can do for everyone else what you do for yourself (outside of disenchanting BoP's), so I can just rely on a friend who has these professions.
---
I've toyed with picking up herbalism, but I'm not sure how easy it would be to have two gathering professions that I rely on mini-map tracking (I know nodes are generally easier to see in-game).
---
Can I have two?
---
Please
---
I already leveled 2 characters over 30.
---
I've grown to absolutely HATE tanking over these past few weeks. I feel like people don't understand how threat works. As a Warrior there is no way I'm going to consistently hold aggro on 4+ mobs. I had a Shaman in full cloth gear in the thick of the fight. He kept asking me "why am I getting aggro bro?!". I don't know "bro" maybe its because you're fucking earth shocking, auto attacking with rock biter on and healing. All of those generate a fuck ton of threat. I'm not going to be able to keep up with that, a rogue back stabbing, mage AoE and a Warlock nuking them with Shadowbolts.
---
This dude is literally whispering into the mic. Lmfao
---
Why do people make these stupid video game fitness images no one does them and if people do they arent going to help you get in better shape like at all
---
Thank you lad!
---
Gotta reserve them names man.
---
I ♥️ Questie - it makes playing so much easier, particularly in Classic. When everyone's hacking at mobs in the main area of the map, Questie shows you that other spot where they appear that no-one is farming...
---
Since Scarlet Monastery I've been solo tanking as an arms 2H warrior. A bit of stance dancing to get your agro generating skills running and then switch to defensive stance. You'll be pretty resistant while dealing some nice DPS, which translates into getting even more agro.
---
The few level 40+ alliance I encountered in STV were patrolling it like cops in an economically depressed area of town, never dismounting and pretending not to see the havoc we reaped upon the alliance lest they attract attention and be pulled down by a pack of low 30s horde whose only goal was to make the alliance feel unwelcome and unsafe.
---
Bind to f1-f5. Tank doesnt need to target party
---
Uh what? You’re implying the rogue should pop Vanish and then use Cheap Shot if a mob is attacking the healer? Gtfo lol
---
What content are you looking at? I'm talking MC and up.
---
In BC felsteel longblades got duped on my server and blizzard took everyone's and didn't give their gold back.
---
All i see is mages in the top followed by rogues. Dont know which meters you look at but warriors dont have enough gear yet to be top of the meters. Unless everyone else is afk wanding.
---
I like how you’re whispering but using the loudest keyboard and mouse I’ve ever heard in my life
---
As a hunter, as long as you have a pet that eats meat, you get more than enough meat from just looting beast mobs.
---
Was always star on my realm back then.
---
Shaman and paladin look overrepresented at first, but the further you level the less of them you see, also true for warriors.
---
Bahaha! 😂 
---
It’s true!
---
It exists. But u cant expect epics to fall out of the sky though.
---
is this from the instance  layer abuse or are they also getting the people who where spamming "layer me!" 24/7 ?
---
I have Questie, I just don’t really have much that are 32 or 30-32. My biggest strength so far has been completing quests with couple level advantage, however that gap is closing now hahah
---
Reminds me of Trojans from Conquer Online back in the day.
---
Downranking becomes a thing when you have massive amount of +healing. It makes the low rank spells super effective in healing/mana.
---
Can you explain how +healing works? If it gives a hard bonus to every heal, then I would expect that the smallest heals benefits the most.
---
People don't know how to use line of sight (LoS) to pull ranged mobs closer or especially healers just stand there out in the open and hope tank goes pick up that one super far away mob.
---
ok, so if they say its from patch 1.13 its definatly in classic
---
i guese the version number after that (.0.28211) means phase 1
---
Kek ???
---
The towers at Scarlet Monastary look like they are horrified by the horde and alliance murdering each other
---
I guess you stopped reading at invented by ninja looters and didn’t finish the whole sentence which states exactly the concept you’re discussing.
---
He’s on about abusing layering in dungeons, not just farming them.
---
That should definitely be doable:
---
    /cast YourAbilityHere
---
    /salute
---
The least pop classes are druids and hunters
---
Good mages aoe farm, op is the dumb one
---
I like memes and dip
---
Google
---
I'm on a high pop server that was full with 2 hour queues but now there are never any queues.
---
Well I've got a method to my madness. I have to have 3 things to do to get up out of the chair. Usually that's a bathroom break, water refill, and weights. I've been doing hammer curls till I can't lift my arms and then back into the game. Sitting in a chair makes ya weak. lol
---
You are welcome. The drop rate is abysmal so don't give up!
---
Back in vannila I farmed basilisks in desolace for a week to get my mount.  Plan on doing.it again as this time I have skinning to help even more..
---
Great answer, thanks!
---
I see how that is a pretty fucked up way to ruin economy and get way better gear way faster, which is bascially cheating....
---
APU

Yet.

You can purchase the items that drop from the elementals on the AH. Worth every penny to get the axe asap

Carebears unite! /s
---
Agreed with the leveling thing :) good luck! hope you figure something good out.
---
I think so, but not by much. They have a free trial version
---
Are you retarded
---
Especially if you’re tank is a dwarf. My stumpy lil legs don’t run tha fast, so you damn mage come to me.
---
need on everything
---
Yeah i love all these posts about "you chose the wrong class". I've been grinding through the SM dungeons and will dps some whenever i get bored.
---
Your problem is that you're probably not shred'ing and ravaging. I have a fair bit of agility and now some strength (have 4 points so far into heart of the wild). 
---
Sure, a combat feral druid has zero AOE ability but if that feral druid can be behind their target shredding (literally shredding and nothing else) the you'll be doing some damage.
---
I see a lot of feral druids trying to use combo point spenders. Its just not worth it at these levels. A five point ferocious bite is like 200 damage. :(
---
If you have ‘Baz’ or ‘Sixnine’ on Nethergarde Keep I’ll give you £5 for it. 😞
---
You can head over to stonetalon mountains, next to the barrens, and quest at Sun Rock Retreat. Those are green for you I think. You can go to Hillsbrad Foothills and do Tarren Mill quests as well.
---
didn't happen to me. didn't happen to drakedog. if someone goes after your pet, then fear them, or do dmg to them, you have options.  in open world pvp, soul link is probably superior. BGs is all about burst damage, which makes conflag spec the best spec, alongside its added CC of having the succy, since you are using less dots, it goes better together.
---
The website states this:
---
"Smart Injection:
---
Want to use our guides on characters you've already leveled up? No problem. Our Smart Injection System will scan your quest history and automatically find the best place for you to start in the guides." 
---
Do you have any experience with this? If so would you say that the addon is able to do that well? Thanks bro.
---
It's not pixels, it's time. This game can take up to 4 hours to just get in the login screen at peak times. So most of my mates who are working 9-5 can barely play. If someone done this at the end of a  regular session (\~1-2 hours after queue) for them that'd be around a 4-8 hour time investment down the drain. This is a game, for entertainment. You remember fun, yes? 
---
TL;DR we get 1 life and people are spending theirs being shit for little to no reason, of bloody course people are going to be upset you absolute melt.
---
Can anyone explain what this exploit is and how they do it?
---
Tipsout is a known fraud.
---
As a druid, would skinning &amp; leatherworking be a good match, to craft my own gear? To later swap LW for ENCH. Or would I be better off just buying the hides and get ENCH &amp; LW from the start?
---
Also, for leveling, I mainly need to focus on agility as a feral, right?
---
Screenshots are soooo 2018.
---
Utukondo with the 10/10 troll
---
We cant...
---
Sorry to shamelessly piggyback off on this - but any recommendations for a clean UI for healing? I want something that shows debuffs, health status, threat levels etc without having to tinker or customise too much.
---
Yup, I remember this too.
---
&gt;  risks a possible fix by Blizz
---
That is literally impossible.
---
Should have texted “pics or it didn’t happen”
---
I know a kid like you dont get my point. Grow up a few years and then come talk to me
---
wow gz! ppl used to grind hard to get this
---
7am? Amateur!
---
I would have blew that number up.
---
I hope you get a permanent ban on your account
---
Diddnt asmon do this though
---
I really like neat plates. Look clean, have different skins to pick from, tracks dots fantastically, changes color if you have aggro or soon will pull aggro etc. They are really neat
---
Is something you shouldn't do. Because them you're putting out heal aggro before the tank or Dps have hit anything and the mobs will run right past them to your succulent squishy ass
---
no pounds pls, I'm in EU. ;)
---
[A more accurate shaman meme.](https://imgur.com/a/Lyms4Gs)
---
I main a hunter in retail.  Leveled up from TBC.
---
1. Turn your pet's taunt, OFF
---
2. wait 5 full seconds before you start DPS'ing
---
3. Your primary target, until dead, will usually be whatever the tank has targeted, at the time you start to DPS.  The tank may change targets, You don't
---
4. if anyone is marking, the kill order is:  Skull dies first, X dies second.
---
5. have your pet on passive!  you will always order your pet to attack whatever you are attacking.
---
It's not sustainable
---
I actually downvoted this post because i thought the title was serious at first xd. Now its a upvote.
---
the warrior pulled with a single bow shot time to run ahead and backstab everything. oh nose pulled more shit who would have known?
---
&gt;\[@targettarget,help,nodead\] is his currently target's target friendly and not dead? (probably not needed for rejuv, because usually targettarget is an enemy if you're a healer)
---
I use that one when things go crazy, I can target the boss or Horde player and just heal whoever they are attacking now.
---
hunter traps, hibernate
---
Yup. Just pick a show, put your brain on auto pilot, and go to town. Idk what class you are but I'm an Ambush Rogue so I just kinda plowed through them. Good pick pocket skill-up too, and lockboxes for lockpicking.
---
I’m not proud to say it but back in the day when my hunter was my main, I bought/rolled on +healing gear.
---
why? for mend pet 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ 
---
don’t get me wrong, my pet could take a lot of dmg that way but a couple of people were like “wtf is your gear” before someone explained shit to me (as well as not wearing cloth)
---
I also leveled tailoring on that hunter to like 225 until someone else explained I should just do leatherworking.
---
I think you confuse what weapon bonebiter is. I was wondering if the 2h drops from acheadas would be a upgrade?
---
There’s millions of us who don’t go insane and love it.
---
i remember moonwalking and walking while dancing! It was an odd bug that Blizz decided to keep because it wasn't hurting anybody.
---
Does this mean phone screen shots are socially acceptable now?
---
FYI it has a 2% chance to appear in a ooze bag, which has a 4% drop chance from oozelings in EPL. 
---
That gives you a 0.08% drop rate. On average you'd have to kill 1250 oozelings to get it.
---
Bagnon does it with the latest update I believe
---
No it is not the respec price goes up to 50g
---
&gt; It was already mentioned that intentionally proccing Reckoning (or similar effects) through using /sit was removed from Classic. Unless there's definite proof of this working, I'm calling bullshit. It worked on private servers, but not here.
---
Along with the old Vanilla vid the other guy posted, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc) proof of it working in Classic. Keep in mind that Blizzard only said that 
---
&gt; Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.
---
This is true, and how it works in Classic, hence why it only works when you combine it with /stand.
---
You will use a 10x stronger ah addon to blacklist people , but not use simple auctionator that lets you see lowest prices and buy amount of materials you want no matter how they are posted ?
---
Details. It has dps meter and threat meter. Works great.
---
EU vs USA, Miles vs Kilometer, Azerty vs Qwerty
---
oh i've seen those, like if you pull your self up like laying under a table or under a chair or something.
---
What new players seem to do wrong the most is unloading all their damage before the tank can get them in position. 
---
Most times tanks range pull to pull the mobs away from other groups, this allows a bit of flex room for runners or any nearby patrols. As any dps, please wait until the enemies reach the tank AND establishes a bit of threat. We position mobs in a way where we can best cycle through each enemy to maintain threat. So when one gets pulled away we can snap threat taunt.
---
Now another case, please for the love of god. Follow the kill target. We mark enemies with a skull or x or whatever not because its pretty, but because that's the kill order. Skull first, then x, then whatever else the tank throws in. 
---
So when a dps decides to spam all attacks on x because they want to get their rotation off because they feel if they kill skull first they will not get everything off and thus possibly lose dps.. guess what, you pulled aggro. Why? Becauae skull is kill target and tanks are maintaining bare minimum threat on any thing besides skull just to keep them off the healer. 
---
Now your asking, why dont they just aoe more or do more threat. Well buddy speaking in terms of a bear tank. We have 1. Yes 1 aoe skill. It hits 3 targets. We dont get to choose which other 2 besides the main target. Plus it cost 15 rage per swing. Since we dodge so much we dont generate as much threat as we want. So it's hard to aoe. Now, you add this to dps not following kill order, that's less people now attack me, which means you guessed it. Less rage. Also now I'm trying to snap threat that mob off you that you pulled, using a strong single target. So that's 10 more rage I'm using on a non kill ordered target. So guess what. No aoe now. Now skull is going to attack someone else, and the other enemies will attack the healer. You see where I'm going with this right?
---
 Sorry for wall of text, but this is how to be a better dps. While it won't matter too much early levels.. it's better to practice now.
---
Oh and if you do pull aggro. Dont fucking run around like a retard. Either bring the enemy to the tank or stand the hell still. Ok that's all I wanted to say.
---
This is gold. Thanks for giving me yet another reason to skip the gym in order to play WoW!
---
I'm glad I reported everyone asking for layer invites in chat.  I didnt think anything would come of it I figured blizzard would just sweep it all under the rug.  
---
So glad to see they arent.  If they did just sweep it under the rug I wasnt going to stick around after the first 30 days.
---
Offtopic and humble flex:

I still keepsake my Lvl 60 Vanilla character that obtained the Champion (Rank 10) title. PvP Server btw.

I do enjoy Vanilla PvP in the past. Now, I just want to enjoy Classic with my gf in a PvE server without disturbance from wPvP (:
---
There is a calculator for healing spells. Classes like shaman for example get more heal per mana on higher level spells which changes later on once they get +healing items. As they give the same amount of extra heal on spells with the same cast time.
---
&gt;You're merging 2 abilities into one button, that doesn't mean it's the same as botting.
---
Of course, it still requires manual input. That said, I'd argue that while some of these addons/macros aren't technically botting as they're not automating actions, I'd still consider them kind of sketchy(from outside perspective). Simply because not every action is "equal". From the perspective of the API / game code, it is--but from the player's perspective / human experience there's a huge difference between casting a spell, jumping, text output etc. and something like shifting through the AH finding items. The former requires way less attention/thought/busywork.
---
&gt;That is the standard that has been set by Blizzard, and if you don't want players to have an advantage over you, you have to use them as well end of story.
---
I hope I didn't come off as someone who doesn't actually use addons, I use them quite liberally. I still detest a lot of them, because they've changed the game for the worse. Of course the good thing is classic isn't going to be changing at all so most of the power lies in the hands of the players as to how it's played. ClassicLFG being purged is an example of this.

Been wondering about when is it okay to need roll. Leveling as a mage and I've seen items that are a pretty decent upgrade for me like wands etc. But i usually pass if the healer rolls need. Should I also be rolling need on these if we both need it, asking ahead of time, or just keep passing on it?
---
Add in a type of hinge. You can hold a can of paint (or something close) and do a movement similar to a romanian deadlift. Bend at the hips, keep your shoulders back, when you reach the bottom of the range of motion drive your hips forward and lock out.
---
Every time you need to break for food/drink do hinges until health/mana is filled.
---
I'm only 22 atm because IRL is just busy (wife, kids, job etc) but I remember paladins being able to be pretty scary?
---
Please don't tell me they are a meme spec, I mean I'll be playing pala regardless but it would be nice to know if I can reck bomb people at 60 or not.
---
Their game, their rules. Follow the rules or get fucked.
---
In Path of Exile the devs said that you can get banned for taping a popsicle stick onto your keyboard to press 1-5 at the same time. So yeah, you can get banned for anything.
---
Mages have iceblock
---
It's simple, as soon as the tank pulls aggro you just pop CD's and go balls to the wall, and when you pull aggro you blame the tank for not generating enough threat.
---
Sincerely, every DPS player :)
---
I usually tell people I need to take a fat ogre shit, no one has really complained so far.
---
Like I said in another Classic post, that's the point. To work for your gear. That great feeling of accomplishment, when you finally get your desired item. 
---
People who just exploit everything to farm their BiS asap, just rush everything and don't wanna enjoy classic overall can go back to retail. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to insult anyone here, but retail is much more fitting for joyless grinding.
---
Can someone help with advice on how to lvl up shaman? Whats spells to use, rotation and whatnot. Currently im either always out of mana or it takes long to hit it to death!
---
I don't join guild s that spam this crap..iny experience.tjey are generally full of douchebags and drama  since they will invite anyone and everyone.
---
It’s misleading. It’s company turnover which means that they leave one trucking job for another job. Truckers are notorious whiners and will move companies constantly. When I did my orientation a few years ago, one of the safety guys in the class welcomed a student and pointed out it was his sixth time being hired by the company. Guy was in his 40s.
---
Personally, one thing I've noticed is that if I pull aggro from the tank and run towards them with the mob, all the mobs are bunched up together so the tank can't tell that one of the mobs is attacking me. I tend to get about 5 yards away from the tank so they can see the mob is not attacking them so they can then taunt or whatever.
---
Why don't you just raid in offspecc? You can heal just fine specced into shadow for example. If your guild is strict about it then maybe agree to make sort of a hybrid specc while you gear.
---
Transferrrrrrrr

I honestly think servers like that miss out on a lot of the toxicity.  People messing up the markets just so they can tell their ego they control it, or trying to unfairly micro manage group content etc.  I was watching one of the more popular streamers today, and some rando mailed him some gold for no reason other than him being a streamer.  I can do without that kind of stuff.
---
Holy shit man, going from burning all of my mana to beat a single mob and praying another didn't wander into us, to being an unkillable MG42 nest was such a freeing experience as a solo-leveling priest. I can actually regenerate mana while I fight! I have a pool to dip into in case of emergencies! Anyone playing priest who is reading this, go buyout a wand on the AH immediately! It'll pay itself back in time within that play session!
---
This is the best news I have seen today.
---
Good sport

Macro switching to Defensive Stance and putting on your sword and board. Macros for switching to Battle/Berserker Stance and putting your Axe back on.
---
Classic is just better. Obviously that's only an opinion but you can't convince me otherwise.
---
I originally played vanilla hardcore R14 PvP and up to bwl server first. I now play ultra casual and both sides so far are better than retail and imo have been better than any expansion (although I did enjoy wrath and MoP) 
---
I can log in, do a couple of quests and log out ready to continue tomorrow. In retail at that pace it just becomes pointless. Gear rotates so quickly and catch ups are so easy I never actually have anything to work for and the things I can work for... Well why not just wait and get the next cycle of easy gear. Honestly retail is best just ignored until the last month before a new expansion... And you can quickly catch up enjoy the content and unsubscribe until the next end cycle.
---
Id don't know, estimated queue times seem pretty on point lately. During the first week it was completely fucked though.
---
Leatherworking and skinning work well for a druid. Enchanting is an expensive profession, you'll go broke if you  take it and don't have a steady source of extra greens. If you want enchanting, drop the skinning later on in your levelling to grab it.
---
Resto druids are decent healers but not as good raid healers than priests. They are better on horde as horde does not have any paladins. In later phases they will only be useful for mark of  the wild buffs. Feral druids are good tanks in five man because you don't need to tank five man's, just hold aggro and that is what druid tanks do pretty good. But they scale really bad with gear so the deeper you get into content the more irrelevant you become. Good flag carriers tho
---
Underrated genius
---
I don’t have a set up like that but I do have a dog and a laptop and a hotspot and love my job.
---
Except they're not? Innervate and battle rez are great tools, they arent main healers but they help a lot during enrages, their hots basically become extra mitigation for the main tank. They're great as off healers.
---
Q de te voir à 6yyyyyyy66yyyyyy
---
Some of them honestly don’t know and panic. 
---
“If you can make it to the instance reset you can Rez again right?” Shit like that honestly. Ppl just don’t know until you tell them but the fan base is so opposed to being told anything that you just get silent groups of passive aggressive rage nobody ever says.
---
Lol. I just vendor them for 15 silver a piece.
---
So are we!
---
Or are we...?
---
I don't even know anymore.
---
I mean I had no problem with healing as ret in retail either, at least before the late game content. People are usually chill about it and some even encourage to run dungeons faster
---
I had two 430+ healing mains, occasionally it would take me forever to get in a raid, mythic+ or RBG in spite of having experience with it all. WoW became so disgustingly elitist with everyone expecting people to be mythic raiders to join their heroic pugs, etc. 
---
I'm honestly giddy at the thought of those assholes(not your guild mates specifically) sitting in an empty world spamming for 440+/AoTC for heroic EP pugs and it taking forever to get a group together. I could honestly care less if retail died altogether..
---
Oh very nice thanks for this!
---
Is this limited to people abusing the instanced layer exploit or also in open world settings?
---
Work smarter, not harder.
---
That name seems familiar
---
A 1050 would be enough
---
That sounds great, but a magic nipple in my mouth sounds even more appealing!
---
Way back when in vanilla, the rock elementals where what I was grinding for my mount. Elemental Earth sold for about 1g20s back then and I spent two days there.
---
I knew coming back it'd be camped to fuck 😂
---
I can feel the guys pain as he posted the link lol.
---
I can see myself doing this and feeling like an idiot its easy to forget what you have copied last.
---
While I mostly agree, I had the time of my life in Redridge when we were trying to raid that castle full of elite orcs. The amount of fun our group had only surviving by a sliver of health after a risky pull, running back a few times, spending 18 silver on repairs, and how we worked together with a second group to cc and kite mobs so eventually everybody could get the kill - I wouldn't trade that for the world :)
---
Sometimes that bold pull actually turns fun.
---
On the second week of Classic, I realized that group leveling is endless fun to me, and we've been running as a group of 3 ever since, and I made a new friend for the first time in years.
---
To also support your claim: traveling on foot can be fun! I can't stop enjoying the heavy storms as I pass through certain zones, finding hidden recipe vendors, finding quests I've never done before and slowly acquiring every single flight path in Azeroth even though I'm only level 35 :)
---
cool thanks for this
---
Okay thanks just wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing out on anything haha
---
i just assumed we all smelt like that all the time anyway
---
welcome to the internet, it was built upon foundation of videos of cats doing silly things.
---
Problem is there's quite a few folk like you that'll actually shun people for outing ninjas (fuck knows why), decrying that they're 'tattling' or some such other pathetic bullshit. 
---
How can the community be an effective self-regulation mechanism if at least some of them are like you; eschewing the social contracts that you apparently espouse by labelling people trying to warn others as 'tattletales', resulting in a net loss for everyone involved. "Paramount to tattling" fuck sake take a single casual glance at any given justice system then come back whining about 'tattling' and talking about self-regulation in the same bloody sentence. You don't know shit mate.
---
If it saves a wipe, it's not a bad idea...
---
But that axe looks like shit.
---
No, *I* was going to say that, dammit!
---
Nope. Just your talent tree.
---
Are you one of the devs on Questie? Been meaning to get it but people were saying it wasn’t working okay. How about now, everything’s good?
---
Haha 😂 
---
You’re part of the problem with this mentality. No better the mage who says “IDK if I die, I did stuuuupid damage and you guys can clean them up!”
---
Like the guy below said if you are honored its 18g to train the skill and 72 for the mount
---
What are peoples opinion on the following:
---
5 players running an instance, including a hunter (can be replaced with tank, healer, DPS, depending on the BoE)
---
A bind on equip epic bow drops which can be sold for 300g on AH. 
---
Who would you expect to roll need / greed in this situation? 
---
I would honestly expect any BoE epic to go to the class that can equip it. In this case, I would expect the bow to go to the hunter. If it was a shield, it'd go to the tank, if it was healing robes or whatever it's go to the priest or druid. 
---
But in reality I do expect that everyone would roll "need" because they "need" 300g, even though this is the definition of the greed roll. 
---
What do others think / has anyone experienced this?
---
&gt; your /sit and /stand macro requires a very specific timing to work rather than the old reck-bomb method
---
It doesn't really, you just spam the button while in-combat, [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc).
---
&gt; Can you show the divine favour crit?
---
No, but [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c925c0/possible_elemental_mastery_bug_on_the_beta/) a post with the link to the video and timestamps on the "double-crits" from the Shaman parallel talent Elemental Mastery, this was also back in the Beta.
---
&gt; You also didn't mention the negatives of spell-batching, like casting a holy light on a semi-low tank for a big heal, only for him to die because the heal won't register for another 0.3 seconds.
---
I actually did mention healing dead people at the beginning.
---
You dont ever find an item like this so i atleast am enchanting it with weapon damage and Then keeping it forever, perfect for heavy trash like brd aoe pulls or aq trash
---
Drink water on mana breaks. Keep yourself hydrated too!
---
Considering I have about 1200 hp at lvl 41 and die in 3 warrior hits, that mana shield buffer from my 4000 mp pool is absolutely invaluable in pvp.

---
i, warrior, got chased down by a priest recently, was not a fun day
---
Yeah, I have died jumping off that Zeppelin prematurely at least twice so far.
---
Everyone plays rogue/warrior/mage/warlock/priest it feels like. Other classes have extremely low representation compared to those. Mostly because they are just sub-par in PvE in every way.  
---
  I play hunter and I get hated on with a lot of bias very regularly, there seems to be this massive circlejerk where everyone is telling each other that hunters are retards who pull stuff constantly, need on everything and have no place in raids other than being a tranq shot bot.
---
The horse whinny is the most important part of that whole exchange. Well done sir.
---
Garrote is rarely ever your best opener in pvp.  Perhaps only against prot-warriors.

I picked a night elf as my warrior for flavor since I’m playing with friends on a rppvp server. I’m planning on going fury so I was wondering if anyone knew where I should plan to level for the best gear?
---
I just hit 10 so in a few levels I’ll be leaving teldrassil and I need a good path so I can max my gear progression (I’ve heard that warriors are really gear dependent)
---
I’m not sure I’ve seen a Tauren hunter yet.
---
Hey thanks for the inputs.. I guess there are no excuses anymore to not start with it x)

Stop doing aliance people famous
---
Step by step guide on how to be a hunter without pissing off old players.
---
Step 1 - Do not shoot anything, ANYTHING, before the tank pulls.
---
Step 2 - Multishot = bad. Single target ur tanks target. In higher level dungeons there will always be a kill order where particular mobs need to die before others ie healers. No point multishotting if u need to burn a healer. Multishot later when the tank has some aoe threat built up and important mobs are dead. And if there is any CC, dont even think about multishot!
---
Step 3 - If you do pull threat and ur not a good kiter, run the mob back to the tank ffs.
---
Step 4 - Keep your healer in view as much as possible, if the healer pulls threat on an add, your the best dps to take that threat and take it back to the tank. saving healers is a massive job that most hunters just dont do. Your healer will be grateful, believe me.
---
Step 5 - Make sure pets taunt is off. Everytime a mob attacks your pet that can add extra work for your healer (if they heal pets, i do). Its also rage that a warrior or bear misses out on because the mob is hitting your pet. 
---
Step 6 - Dont demand a healer heals your pet. Use mend pet as much as you can and if the healer can, they will keep it topped up. 
---
Just dont be bad and one of the idiot huntards that i seem to be running into at the moment. I like the class but you have a rep for a reason. At the moment im just seeing hunters do dumb shit after dumb shit after dumb shit and it frustrates the hell out of your tank and heals.
---
You are about to get downvoted to hell. You are preaching to atheists here.
---
Loot council is the best way to gear your raid to make content easier for farming, but all these people care about is gearing their Moonkin meme spec
---
that is good advice.
---
Its a patrol that spawns after some time i think.
---
They walk past the door so if anyone is standing up top they will pull. Had it happen to me as well, they were chilling in tje corridoor after we wiped too
---
There. Are. So. Many. Beached. Turtles. 
---
And so many murlocs guarding them.
---
Wow, I typed my comment (which includes “you’re part of the problem”) before I even read yours!

1060 is good enough to stream, 1050ti as well. But.. The 1050ti has so much lower performance than a 1060 but isn't that much cheaper so do your self a favor and go for the 1060 directly.
---
Uh.... I'm at Hillsbrad.... and its patrolled by lv50 alliance...so .. should I participate in the next Olympic?
---
I disagree on need on boe... What if a game changer drops like flurry axe for orc warrior or edgemasters hand guards? If I was in a group that insisted on needing shit that would save ne a fortune to line their pockets it's blacklist.
---
Yeah maybe so. Im a warrior main so we always go Staff of Westfall/ Serpents staff.
---
yea i was just thinking out loud, lol. the lowest bar is wand timer, he doesnt need the other two but i guess its his screen i dont need to look at it :D
---
I had actuy updated it just prior to getting on yesterday, so it was up to date as of the time of the post
---
I highly recommend speccing into Enhancement. Improved Ghost Wolf talent is mandatory for faster leveling and gives you a nice mobility boost at level 20. 
---
Enhancement is also way more comfortable to fight mobs as your regeneration times happen less frequently. Due to your weapon enchantments even as Elemental you’re melee attacking your enemies in lower levels so there’s really no point in not going Enhancement for leveling.
---
I started playing shortly after the european release of vanilla and I also thought they were introduced before TBC and was really shocked in classic when I couldn't click on the stone so you are not alone but sadly they were introduced with the release of tbc and as a warlock now I have to walk to every single dungeon and port everyone sigh :D
---
Now go Beast Master and make his attack speed 0.7
---
No you are not saying what we are all thinking
---
If you were you wouldnt have to ask people not to tear you apart in the comments
---
Idk, haven't done any of those. Not my cup of tea.
---
I'm on Sulfuras and I've seen it near the 4-5k player wait but it's never been 200+ mins. It's usually 35-45 mins at that many players.
---
My god in that case my boner is justified!
---
I would use my lvl 60 to send big bags and like 2g  to start with and just lvl like normal. Getting boosted by a lvl 60 ruins your XP gain quite hard.
---
You can’t compete with that which has no life
---
Nah, just being completely honest; I don’t see why people are so upset. If anything you should be upset for Blizzard “modifying Classic”. 
---
I’m playing a rogue priest dual-boxing combo and I’m still only lvl 25 on either machine.
---
It’s just selfish to not recognize the ingenuity....OMG, they have so much more than me ban them. These people still put in time and effort to do this.
---
I knew Blizzard would take this stance, doesn’t mean I agree; thus I opted for the slow and steady....Just saying, it doesn’t bother me in the slightest that some people did this. If it affected other people in any real negative way, like stealing from their accounts or something; I would def have a different opinion.
---
Then again, there are many things that I don’t agree with society on...Like keeping classic exactly how it was...2004 sucked...
---
You’re a douche lol
---
Yeah, nah
---
If you wanted to push content hard and realm firsts, then you're already done. Both MC and Rag are cleared since at least a week on most servers.
---
Congrats and thanks ! I would use yours but this time around I joined the Alliance to play with coworkers who are also old time vanilla raiders like myself. So I'll try Sage or TUG ! thanks a bunch
---
I understand your point . But if I have daggers with same damage as my current swords (29.7 DPS at 1.90 and 29.1 DPS at 1.80 OH) why would my damage be lower?
---
If you ever become a heathen and make alliance, you could be Gnomsayin
---
How you could write so much and be so wrong is impressive. There was a bank error in their favor. Esfand could not have known what was happening. Other that he may have thought “hey good for us” 
---
They at minimum deserved to get at Rag. You’re being Salty.
---
Move on
---
Rip legs of all warriors
---
Or you know, go to a gym or run outside instead of doing autistic fitness you will probably follow for a week, tops
---
You're way ahead in gold compared to some people I know at 40+ at least. Also generally the levels 35-45 are really slow unless you are dungeon spamming.
---
Im level 17. Am I behind? Kappa
---
I wish, then it wouldn't have ruined the game's economy somewhat
---
Don’t judge yourself on other people. If you start rushing to catch up with other people then you will just find that you are not enjoying yourself.     
---
What exactly are you missing out by not being 60 with a mount?
---
Exactly. I could do on my bed for example.
---
Does shadowmeld allow for trinket swapping in raid encounters?

Better to macro your big heals like this:

When pressed this will stop whatever you're casting curently and start another cast of Healing Touch. Change the rank as you see fit.

&gt;They are not to be confused with [catheads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathead)
---
At least that part is already somewhat accurate.
---
You are missing one thing here. Blizzard is reducing layers on dailu basis. Just because queue is similar to the one 2 weeks ago doesnt mean thw same amount of people playing, but servers becoming smaller.
---
&gt;I farmed harpies in Thousand Needles for 4 days. Got 6 levels and about 90g. Farming works.
---
I had 100g at lv.20 back in 2006 from simply grinding crabs in westfall and selling the crab meat on AH. It was always in high demand
---
&gt; But, if you're just going to kill the mobs you're told to, or click the random object you're supposed to find, then yeah the game's going to be boring.
---
I've been playing classic with a friend and I adore it but their so negative about the whole thing and it's killing it for me. We just finished a quest chain and my friend goes "So when does the actual story content start? Not just kill X? I'm getting bored".
---
It's like.... this is it. Your playing the story. This isn't Dragon Age or  Witcher. This is the game and quests are the story.
---
not going to lie there are a few holes in this game......i designed it for those who play similar to me....2-4 hours per session....so i guess those who do marathon sessions might need a reminder go get up and do something else.
---
Fanfuckingtastic!
---
Trust me mate spec resto if you are healimg i did same as you and exp hr almost doubled when i wemt resto from saving time not drinking as often and bigger pulls possible
---
OMG I can't believe they have that, what a lovely avenue for scamming!
---
Cant get my hand on my mouse or keyboard at all
---
It actually REALLY does. Doesn’t even matter what class you’re referring to: Leveling up AND talent trees unlock new skills for you (so long as you spec right, stick to 1 tree before 40) Level 20 is a glimpse of your classes potential, 30 is a decent picture of it, 40 is where you truly begin to see what your class and you as a player are capable of achieving in combat and that’s where the real fun in this game begins IMO, plus it gets exponentially easier to make gold as you climb above 30
---
hahaha, sick of getting splattered in blood I expect
---
I use sprint all the time in dungeons, but most of the time it's to run and kick a caster to bring it to the tank.
---
Debating whether too annoy bliz about something so dumb haha
---
Someone wasted their time making this graphic. Imagine that
---
That's interesting case, I never experienced that. Always thought if it's raining than it's raining for everyone
---
bro last night was running library. rolled on a chest, had that red knapsack and blue priest gloves. gloves of old. woot woot
---
Vibrant Plumes are worth some good silver.
---
wait, the free transfers haven't been done? so thats why my low pop server isn't getting bigger?
---
And cloth to sell or spin into bolts and vendor.
---
I give a heads up when using my gun to pull I will have zero threat on anything at the start.  If DPS still jumps in and pulls I whisper the healer its their choice whether the deeps live or die.
---
how do you remember your username ?
---
wait a minute, you get time to drink in your groups? I'm lucky if I get to do every pull at 20% mana...
---
It's a 21 point talent, so you'll do wc, sfk, bfd, rfk without it most likely.  While questing, I've found that I end up having to shift out to heal a lot between mobs if I'm going fast, so the furor has been nice for shifting and immediately attacking something.
---
All up to someone's personal preference though.
---
Play backwards and use your other hand to mouse.

I've seen very very few druids over the last few weeks, are they terribly unpopular?
---
To be fair here, they probably dont have anywhere close to the level of logs and tracking that blizzard has. 15 years of MMO experience. 
---
I'm betting that they wouldn't have been able to just run a DB query that removes gold and items  won solely from the exploited zone when this game was first released. Only years of improvement got them here
---
😂😂
---
And to add to my mature comment, stop caring about Asmongold. You obviously dislike him, stop stalking him, stop reading threads about him and stop watching videos about him.
---
Grow up and get your life in order.
---
Good thing we aren't playing a "stripped down wow" then.
---
well when you need to bend the elements to your will, it helps if you can bend them harder ;)
---
On my hunter, I always give the tank a few seconds after the pull is stabalized before I start attacking, then at first I only auto attack.  I really only do more than auto attack on bosses.  As the dungeon goes on and you get a better feel for the tanks ability to hold agro, you may increase your damage accordingly.  
---
I try to avoid multi-shotting in group pulls really.  A warrior tank, especially while leveling, has very shabby multiple-target agro abilities.  Your multi-shot right after a pull is going to get agro every time.  Also, it helps if you put an ice trap down in front of you before you get into combat.  So if you do pull, the mob will get trapped, allowing a few seconds for the tank to react before you start getting pounded.  Another strategy is to FD a few seconds after you start shooting, resetting your agro before you can pull.  
---
Also, you can preemptively relieve the tank at the beginning of the dungeon by letting him or her know that you don't mind popping into aspect of the monkey and taking a few hits if you do pull agro, and that you understand that it's not a reflection of his ability to hold agro, but yours to not pull.  If a mob is beating on you, run to the tank - not away from the mob.
---
That is a whole new take on "ass to mouth"
---
Sounds rough, you got an umbrella?
---
Why would everyone agree collectively to greed. Why not just all agreed to need it.
---
Oh ya, waking up at 5:30am on the weekend to level is the best feeling. Less people around to farm and the Horde who are around at that time are usually less inclined to want to fight.
---
Gotta draw the line somewhere. And the slippery slope "fallacy" is often missunderstood. ;-)
---
Yea I see it on three different reddit threads. And I can't see anything wrong with that. Let's then agree to disagree and wish each other a nice day with no queues hopefully 😊
---
I can see why you complain but see it from the paladins POV. If he wears exclusive str/agi/stam gear as a ret he'll have enough mana to heal 2-3 times his manapool in HP before going oom. At level 50 that would be about 5k hp in heals andhe won't have mana reg abilities to extend this without drinking pots or water. 
---
Int gear or healing gear needs bagspace. And I know quite a few paladins that don't dedicate one full bag to int gear but either keep it in the bank. 
---
I always have my int gear with me and can switch it with a button press - drink to full and I'm a fully capable healer. I don't mind doing it and will in fact volunteer. But this is no guarantee with every ret specced paladin.
---
that makes sense only I'm on Earthfury, pretty low pop. less than 50 players were between 55-60 when I was fishing and not anywhere near 50 people in Tanaris.
---
You were in alpha beta fish in closed beta right? What server did you land on?
---
I am level 34 too and played the day after release.  I only have 20g, so don't worry about it.  I'll probably be lvl 45 before I get a mount.  I knew that picking enchanting/tailor would not be kind to my bank and that was ok.  Leveling professions as I go is more enjoyable to me.
---
"IT GOIN RAIN"
---
That's not true. They system will start ignoring your reports if you submit too many false ones, so let the rage babies spam that button all fucking day.
---
Kromcrush :D
---
THANK YOU
---
how do you have skinning at 300 with level 34, you cant train past 225 below level 35 O\_o
---
I'm glad to hear it!
---
&gt;They're jumping layers, but inside instances. 
---
Oh, and they can get more layers than the five people from the party?
---
In the old days you had instance locks; but five people meant five locks.
---
I assume they're farming the same boss 6 times or more with the same five people....
---
Get one of those "mouse balls" and put it on your knee, it's stationary so it can just sit there and you can alter the height with your knee
---
But orc has stun resist AND axe spec. Undead is just a sub par pick. You will do less damage and you just have a decent 2 minute cooldown. Orc stun resist is always up. It’s not like you’re getting charmed or slept all the time. What classes even do that?
---
Sure, I might not always be the last to roll though, or people simultaneously roll need and greed. 
---
I suppose everyone rolling need solves the problem. Only thing is that some people might feel like the person with the profession should be the ONLY one needing and has more right to the pattern if they intend to use it. Then we have a discussion again.
---
The problem is that people aren't putting reddit on their 2nd screen anymore. They're only logging on their phones, so the picture upload process simply doesn't happen without taking a photo. No one is going to screenshot, then save it on imgur, then open their phone up, then log on reddit, then upload the imgur. The reddit app almost makes it *too* easy to upload photos.
---
So your original complaint about not being able to manage threat when the tank doesn’t have CTM—was that in reference to ele? If so, yeah. You’re going to have to get used to the spec before you can anticipate threat situations. Kind of goes without saying that you’ll get better as you actually play the spec.
---
If you go into the dungeon as a feral, the cloth stuff is for the cloth people. And the heal gear is for the heal people.
---
'cept they're not. They're hardcore capitalists who like to feign "our system is for the people!".
---
lol, I guess innervate is reserved for healers
---
Are you retarded? Having 100 layers means more BoEs/herbs and so on enter the market, which devalues them.
---
Well, someone on Faerlina already has the helm, so I guess you need to go drag them away lol
---
ofc i'm talking about a high quality professional web-app with UI/UX designers, front and backend devs etc. working on it. 
---
essentially every other full stack dev can pull this off themselves, with the most important features at least. but you have to consider that it might not be on an enterprise level then.
---
BOP = need if needed, otherwise greed.  BOE = need.
---
If ur around the 36-38 bracket farm swamp jaguars in swamp of sorrows, they have great respawn the zone is usually pretty quiet and they drop 2 grey items one sells for 8s a piece and one for like 7s 80c, it’s quite a well known grind but there may be people that don’t know
---
I play on the Buccaneers server so it’s never full LOL
---
They're handy for people with professions. Sometimes it's awkward meeting people in person, so I'll just mail them the finished item and charge them on delivery for whatever my "fee" was for making it (often depends on whether they sent me the mats or not).
---
Your current level is fine for both.
---
/focus
---
There is no shame in cumming quickly from a BJ ... I mean oral is about the receiver
---
&gt;or should everyone greed
---
I am specifically referring to OP's comment. Why would everyone agree to roll greed. its just asking to be scammed.
---
It's a two-way street though, loot funnelling to real-life friends seems safer. Less likely they will screw you over and leave the guild.
---
It also looks like nepotism. 
---
Personally I think that loot funneling is understandable, but also unnecessary in Classic, I think it is more beneficial in TBC and Wrath when the raids get much harder. The content available now is quite easy for competent players, loot funneling is just not necessary. Being "Hardcore" is not that necessary in general, considering the average player's skill and knowledge is so much higher now, half of the community can be at the level "Hardcore" players were 14 years ago.
---
And grenades
---
Made what? Wtf are you talking about...
---
Streamers are nothing more than egotistical fuckwads who prey on the teenager's primal need to 'belong'.  I hate them on pure principal.

Wait you add first though...? 5*11*7*3. WHY DOES HE NEED 1155 CHARACTERS!

Buy a left hand razer naga mmo mouse. They’re only 400-600 usd since razer discontinuing it, causing disabled people with only working left hands to go crazy buying them all.

Can I get an invite to Asmons layer?
---
Well you know what war declared god damnit I can't believe I'm facing this kind of discrimination
---
yes i wasted my entire lunch break. granted i could have done much better things....but this is my life
---
&gt;It's utterly ridiculous to let a raiding guild get double gear from a raid so early on in the patch cycle.
---
It was a different bug than the exploit and it existed back in vanilla. #Nochanges
---
I can not use my broken arm at all:(
---
No windows in this cave besides my OS. :D
---
This is actually the best thing i've seen in a LOOOONG time. Have my upvote sir.
---
Except abusing layers is, and Blizz is pounding the banhammer atm.
---
That isn't the right method if you have two monitors. Ctrl+alt+print screen only screenshots your active monitor.
---
Because people are little drama babies
---
Talking about PvP not raiding. I wouldn't say shadow is awful but its definitely not optimal. Though you likely want 1 in the raid.
---
That is how i feel when i rez randos out in the world and they dont even say thanks after i depleted 3/4 of my mana so they dont have to run back..... literally rezzed a guy on top of those pillars in 1k needles and he just sat and eat and said nothing. Have yet to rez anyone after that....
---
I tell locks to tap if they need it because most of the time I got mage water coming out my ears. A renew is worth you having a full mana bar. I top people off if I have to but don't sweat someone playing for a min at half health. I also drink during the initial part of the fight a lot too so while the tank is taking damage I'm still topping off my mana. It works well but newer players will want to wait for me and that throws the pace off. So generally healing 100% asap is totally possible when everyone is doing what they are supposed to and warlocks life taping doesn't bother me either. I even DPS when I can which is often. Just a few places where things get tricky or with a group that doesn't know whats going on.
---
It really isn't. I have healed several dungeons without a tank and just 4 dd's. As long as it isn't a mage that takes the aggro and dies in 3 hits it is all dandy.
---
In dungeons, probably not the open world.
---
Am I able to use all the weapon types for a warrior as a nelf? Or am I limited? I’m hoping to end game raid with friends as dps and I’m a little behind so I want to be optimized before hand
---
Pro-tip: Alt + Print Screen captures only the selected window. 
---
This can be helpful if you have dual monitors, or are capturing a window smaller than your entire screen.
---
A true gift does not expect a thank.
---
Oh, didn't know you have to spam it. Cheers.
---
Wtf, 400 USD for a mouse? Dang i hope this heals after 3-4 weeks...
---
There's mechanics in raid encounters?
---
I don't think so. Also apart from a piece here and there (ravagers from SM for melees,l etc) I don't think it's wise to spend much time farming dungeons for pieces that will soon be replaced.
---
Focus doesn't exist in classic wow.
---
I liked the Nihillium - Kungen Looting System.
---
It isn't an issue if it happens sometimes. But it is annoying as fuck if it happens all the time. :/
---
I thought that too. I was completely boggled.
---
This retail graphics is nice
---
You are, those are used for two potions that are pretty powerful.
---
Barrens is not contested territory actually it’s horde territory. Ratchet is a neutral town similar to Booty Bay, meaning the goblin guards defend both factions if you attack within the perimeter. 
---
If they appear yellow they cannot attack you unless you’ve attacked Alliance recently or been in contested territory. Contested territory flags you for PvP and that’s how you know the barrens isn’t contested. (contested =/= neutral)
---
No one can tell who has that profession. The recipe is worth equal value to everyone. Everyone should just roll need.
---
Holy shit, that's good!
---
or just go to the gym for an hour, way more sensible

i would say that would be a true cave dweller but i feel that True cave dwellers would be on linux

I kind of like it.  Makes solo grind a bit more exciting when you can't always do the exact rotation over and over.

It's really overdone though.
---
Hellooooo! *waves* Small internet eh? ^_^
---
I am a shaman and I have tanked 9/10 dungeons I have run up into level 40 now. 
---
I even did some SM runs the other day where I was 38 and we had a 44 warrior...
---
He was the one "LFM need tank"
---
I just wanted the gear anyway so I said sure, when I saw it was a 44 warrior not willing to tank SM I nearly shat myself laughing.
---
Feed your pet food of the similar level. Example: feeding a lvl 25 pet with lvl 5 food will only increase his happiness a little bit for a short time, where as a lvl 25 food given to your pet will keep it happier longer.
---
In summary feed your pet food of similar level to it.
---
I'm in a big guild on my server.  I have no idea if they'll have a good raiding team.  I have no idea if they'll stand the test of time.  Honestly, once I'm ready to raid, I'm not even sure if I'm gonna stick with them - their raid schedule isn't ideal for me.
---
But it's nice to have that social element available while you level.  It helps break the monotony.
---
that's a funny way of spelling Gatorbite Axe
---
As a mage utilising the run-drink trick.
---
More like 10-20 flasks a pull
---
One born every minute
---
I tried using sunder armor Instead of heroic strike on my arms warrior, but my experience was that it took longer to kill the enemy and hence I was left with less health after the fight. 
---
It must be noted that my “test” was from around level 10 to level 16 or so. I can’t remember for sure my level but I was relatively low level. 
---
Maybe sunder armor is better after level 30 where I have access to stronger attacks I dunno.
---
One thing to add... on the Wingclip macro you should add lower ranks below it so that it'll fallback if you're OOM.
---
Try and see when you someday do it at 44 with same level group or at least tank, as you are kinda supposed to be for last encounter, then it should be much easier. We were 43 tank, 40 healer and dps was between 42-50 and we had same problem, got him to 2-5% both times
---
I use the Alt at maximum. I'm telling you that Alt + 1,2,3,F,E is a life changer. It fits perfectly with your hand and you should quickly get used to it.
---
Word of caution though. When you are Tab-ing through opponents, careful with Alt shortcuts because you might Alt+Tab out of the game :P. But this is easily manageable to not do and i highly recommend using the Alt for any combination.
---
You do need higher level of food once your pet is getting higher level. 
---
When you feed your pet, look at your combat log (second tab in the chat) to see how much happiness your pet gains from the food. 35 happiness per tick is the maximum, so as long as you get that you don't need a higher level of food.
---
I think paladins are better because later they will turn in absolute insane tank healers that will never run oom
---
Typical of someone like you to resort to a spelling mistake from autocorrect when a 5 year old can figure out what it's supposed to say
---
You're understanding the 5 sec rule correctly and it's a good idea to use it. However once you're at a higher level (closing in on max) you will be stacking +healing instead of spirit, any spell rank you learn after lv 20 will scale with +healing same way as any lv 60 spell etc so using certain ranks will give better healing per mana.
---
Currently as a priest I'm mainly using Heal rank 2/3 and greater heal is only for when the tank is about to take a bit hit.
---
I mean. I’d have fucking giant arms. The auction house is mine I tell you! It’s mine!!!!
---
Hey, this is great. It will compliment the constant posture/hydration checks we throw out on Skeram quite nicely. 
---
Saved.
---
Nothing off the top of my head.  I would search on YouTube and sort by number of views.
---
Sunrock Retreat :D
---
See I can never grab screenshots like this because I’m running around with auto loot on 100% of the time.
---
It's not a game, it's war!
---
Yeah I've had similar comments downvoted before, I guess a lot of people have been listening to too many youtubers with sub-par healing guides. I think a lot of people see the raid guides which recommend to downrank (which is correct), and think it applies to dungeon healing as well; not realizing it's an entirely different ball game.
---
IMO you're really right, 50-60 is fine not downranking. But it's the first time where someone can realistically get enough +healing and MP5 to make it worthwhile; below that, you'd essentially have to twink your character to get the appropriate items to make downranking remotely effective.
---
Not that I would layer, but I can't anyway bc I have no friends to group with.
---
Honest question,  what is layering?
---
most likely, but at a minimum more poeple will think of doing something during flights....maybe
---
meanwhile I´ve been looking for a guild for the past week with no succes
---
Are you me, because thats exactly what we did
---
Layer hopping out in the world is how layering is meant to work you are supposed to be able to join a friend's layer and go kill mobs together. The people abusing layering are going inside dungeons killing the boss they want to farm then having someone invite them so they go to their layer inside the dungeon and it respawns the boss. Abusing mechanics to gain an unfair advantage has always and will always be bannable (it's against ToS I believe)
---
Also, doesn't sweeping strikes get cancelled if you change stance? So I should wait until after sweeping strikes ends and then go berzerker?
---
Thank you so much for the absolutely massive help!
---
We need to have a channel to summon priests to mind control the bots. Trap them beside a bookcase in a nearby inn.

Gankers just make me sigh, log out for ten minutes while I take a short walk around the house, then log back in when they're gone.

This would be the applicable passage (My emphasis)
---
What can I help you with?
---
Omg this sounds exactly like my group. Youre not on Grobbulus are you lol
---
You could have done the ol drowning trick off coast of menethil harbor. Would have saved you a 30+ minute run.
---
Havent seen a single good mage sobfar in dungeons .
---
:/ we aren’t all like that. I even have my sheep bound to mark with moon and announce it to group.
---
No.
---
Early on, sp ret and sp holy do roughly the same output. 
---
The plus side for SP ret thoigh, is that once you get full T2 is pretty much BiS all the way to/through AQ40 into Naxx. So long as you make sure you have a Manual Crowd Pummeler for every second of a boss fight, you can actually do some pretty absurd sustained damage with pure seal empowered autos, but pair that with a blazing rapier &lt; flurry axe &lt; ironfoe &lt; ashbringer/TF/Hungering Cold and you really can go nuts. 
---
It’s just awkward because you want 1h since most of the damage comes from seal on hit spell dmg. But that does leave offhand open for some fun stuff
---
Can someone explain? What's layering and how people abuse it?
---
Maybe they would've had to rescale every npc instead of just applying a 15% scale buff to everyone with the race gnome.
---
What a disgrace! Your ancestor would be so ashamed! I hope your in-game parents disown you!
---
In fact, I went almost a full hour before realizing I’d looted a 14 slot bag off some random basilisk in STV.
---
This is why I do not allow hunters in my dungeon groups... there are too many bad eggs out there that pull the classic "that's a hunter item."
---
Not all hunters are bad players, but all bad players are hunters.
---
Alright, I agree with you. But judging by the replies here you would be ignoring half the server then. A lot of people obviously feel that a valuable BOE item is worth the same amount of gold to everyone so everyone should need.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Almost no one will let me prove that Shaman can tank just fine. I get removed from most groups as soon as they see my class. The only way I can tank most of the time is if I start the group. 
---
  But people won't bat an eye at an Arms warrior who is too low for the instance trying to tank it with a 2 hander..
---
Thank God I rolled rogue.
---
No Gandling EU :-)
---
It depends on your class, the expansion and your healing strategy.  
---
As a druid, there are a lot of ways to be "efficient".
---
Using downranking allows you to "fish" for procs of "Nature's Grace".  
---
This way, you'll have a faster heal available, when you actually need it.
---
Also keep in mind, that you're being a shapeshifter. I'm not quite sure about the exact numbers, but you can also fish for "Omen of Clarity" procs as a cat, when there is nothing to do.  
---
You're generating mana while in cat form aswell. So you invest (I think) 684 Mana (minus Mana-Generation) for your catform to get a "free" Healing Touch (800 Mana) or Regrowth (880 Mana).
---
Ideally, you want to make sure that the act of shapeshifting doesn't break the MP5 rule. So you want to shapeshift as early as possible.
---
However. Once you're as mana efficient as possible, it's time to go the other way around.  
---
If you have 100% mana at the end of the fight and nobody died, then it's time to make use of that 100% mana by dealing damage during the fight.
---
A "perfect" healer leaves a fight with 0% Mana, deals as much damange as possible accordingly and makes sure that nobody dies.   
---
There is always something to improve in your gameplay. Never assume you're "done".
---
\&gt; find a player that killed a dungeon boss back to back in the span of 15 minutes. 
---
Maybe not even just time, I don't remember when but iirc they published the what killed everyone the most list back in vanilla. So if they were already data tracking why not also track the boss kill counts and have the ability to see that you killed the first 5 bosses of this instance 15 times and the last boss you killed 50 times.
---
They added a new system to the game, than when you invite new players to your grp it changes everything. Can you not clearly see that this system was under developed and left holes everywhere, allowing people to abuse gold and dungeon farming? 
---
The dungeon exploit wasn’t as obvious in the beginning, but layering was a huge concern for a lot of people, It was pretty obvious how people were going to abuse it before the game launched. The dungeon exploit is just a little more efficient than, the using “invite to new layer” in world chat to xp and gold farm. 
---
I don’t need to spell it out for you, but I’m sure you must have been one of the people white knighting layering, telling all the people concerned about the negative affects it would have that they were “over thinking it” and “ a month of layering isn’t that bad.”
---
There is a direct correlation with layering and all of these exploits.
---
That is pretty sick! But I'm still curious why APES didn't go with the guild name EBV. European Basement Virgins.
---
Part of the problem by making newer people afraid to ask. That’s it really. The attitude you’re giving off isn’t helpful to a new player and we usually want to show them the good side of WoW. 
---
If you’re a god that can faceroll dungeons and know everything that’s great, but it won’t help the guy who’s attacking X first. That’s all I meant by “part of the problem”. 
---
Now that I’ve read the part where if your pull goes bad, you will actually explain. That’s totally fine. You’re no longer part of the problem at that point and it seems like you’re there. 
---
We were all new once and many people haven’t played more than one class.
---
What is layer abuse if i may ask?
---
He was asking why some upgrade it and some don't . I was giving an example numbers arent exactly correct and may not apply to TC but someone said dont waste your money and he said why. This is why I used overpower as the true example, becuase its literally (weapon dmg) plus 8 and then weapon plus 15, literally 7 more damage when I crit for 600-800.
---
it still doesn't make any sense
---
w a s d are the same place in both layouts and I never ever heard someone use anything else to move (some wannabes map S to a skill so they can't backpedal)

Ohhhhhhh, you meant an actual cockpit.

*hugs* I was just having a little troll bud, didn't mean to upset you! Hope your day goes well!

Some guy in my party went afk halfway through cath because his baby started crying. “Brb guys baby pulled aggro”
---
I'd still recommend pure questing all the way to 60, despite people having great success with farming. You're a lot more inclined to do a quest and gain rep from it while lvling than going back at lvl 60 just for a few points of rep.
---
That being said, I've grinded from lvl 34-35 so far in STV just killing all kinds of beasties, and it's fun :P
---
I was gonna say, " fairly normal". Uhh I doubt it. Fingering alone fine, while playing not so much.
---
Uh, not true at all. I botted accounts in vanilla. Never did I get a suspension/temp ban and have my gold or items removed on the accounts. Perma-bans you just lose access to the account but the characters/items were still even viewable from wow armory.
---
I raided until WOTLK as a druid healer and I have to chuckle about your "worst healer" note.
---
They are the superior healers in your raid. They are the backbone of your heal. The only thing that you need if healing with a druid in a raid is minimal brain from your other healers.
---
I admit that this is almost never the case but the problem is caused by them and not the fault of the Druids.
---
I can only repeat what Blizzard said at Vanilla: "Druids are fine, learn to play". 
---
Thing is, this statement was never for the druids. But to the other players.
---
For some reason Ctrl+P hasn't been working for me in Classic like it does in Live, so this is good to know.
---
You're my savior. Seems like a lot of work but I will definitely be doing this. Thank you so much dude.

I have a chin up/pull up bar that I use every time I get up to go to the toilet. Just do as many as I can.
---
It's actually amazing what a difference it does make. When I first started doing it aged 19 I couldn't do a single pull up and struggled with even a couple of chin ups.
---
Now I can do about 20+ pull ups and loads of chin ups. Made me wonder what I would have done if I fell from something and was hanging by a ledge and my life depended on it prior to that! I am in my mid 30s now though and obviously life has gone up and down and spent a big chunk of my 20s actually working out seriously but it was a great start to it all. All because I realised how long I was spending playing WoW just back in the original beta and I should probably do _something_ and that's what I found worked for me. Pull ups are also an excellent exercise anyway.
---
So yeah - spending a lot of time at the computer is no excuse in WoW when you do have the downtimes of flight paths, waiting for dungeon groups or a timer on something etc.
---
In real life, this kind of thing is a high profile white collar crime scenario.  SEC and FTC would be on their asses like glue in a real world parallel.   Do we sieze the property of ill gotten gains for these people or do we seize it and send them to prison?

Tab Sunder is the best pack threat gen in game. If you can charge Sunder revenge the focus and then tab Sunder all targets, you're mostly OK.

---
Yeah, good luck, because the official LookingForGroup channel obviously isn't meant for getting groups..
---
Had that problem in stockaids the other day. We would have the marked one run off at low health then grab more adds. So im tanking 6 of them because they all switched to the new ones instead of finishing off the ones at half health. Then they wonder why we wipe when I have 6 mobs hitting me instead of 3. Like im not invincible. Kill the ones with lowest health first. And kill the adds before the boss.
---
&gt; This subreddit is in no dire need for your shitty phone pictures I’m afraid
---
87% upvoted btw
---
Chances are if you’re reading any guide, you’re doing enough. Try to stick with dungeons you slightly outlevel, in your case Blackfathom depths and Stockades are just still green for you. This will help you avoid getting parried/dodged/miss somewhat so you generate enough threat.
---
Keep a target marked so your team can focus on one mob and you can prioritize extra threat towards it. Your priority should be: just stay in defensive stance, use revenge, use sunder, and keep shield block on cool down (if rage allows). Don’t use any other abilities except the occasional demo/battle shout. 
---
It doesn’t hurt to ask them to hold off their DPS for a second on pull. Literally no warrior is able to hold threat on three mobs at a time if they started with low rage and your mage casts blizzard in the first second of the fight. 
---
Tanking is like 60% skill, 40% confidence. Don’t be afraid to get aggressive on your pulls. Enemy damage in dungeons isn’t really scary and the more things that hit you, the more rage you’re getting, which means you can cast more sunders and revenges, which means more threat. It’s all about threat.
---
I’m kidding about the trees. As a kid I would love to draw our DND maps... they were never this good.
---
no it stays up, thats the beauty of it you can pop it, switch to beserker use whirlwind and either hit 8targets once or 4targets double
---
From scrawny to Schwarzenegger in 1-60 if you lever a warrior solo.
---
It's in interface options...

---
You need help lmao.

Id think its due to the lack of talents. The bleeds are nice, but you didn't have improved overpower yet.
---
WTF does being from somewhere have anything to do with this post? Lol.
---
I'm from Davenport and I say permaban them all.
---
I like open world pvp. STV is always extremely fun. The problem is the people who really don't pvp but go in "starting zones" (yellow stuff, not green obviously) and camp lows.
---
Why would you sit on a questmob in a lvl 20ish area with a lvl 55 shaman for a whole afternoon? What kind of asshole do you have to be?
---
Someone needs to sort out their priorities. But don't downvote guys, he doesn't play WoW remember!
---
I tend to give some fair warning to the party when I'm drunk; there's a good chance I'm not paying a whole lot of attention to the healer's mana bar when I make pulls; so I just ask the dps to pull and I'll take aggro from there.
---
if i had to pick who to permaban between layer exploiters and role players

i'd choose role players

Fun Fact: I've only ever had one hot pocket and it was in 2000 at a friend's camp. It was the pepperoni pizza hot flavored thing. I was appalled that something could be cold as ice and hot as magma at the same time. All the while smelling like an ash tray after someone tried literally smoking a dirty, diseased sausage. A true assault on the senses. Have they gotten any better over the years?

Back it up then. Prove to me that the only options are "layering" and "do nothing". Prove it.
---
This is how i feel for the most part. I think i did the 1st 15 levels of my shaman without questie and it was great. I felt that immersion, but after time it really was just a kill this collect that. Instant text also changed things, sometimes i was resenting accepting quests because of text wall, especially when trying to get shared quests for dungeons. 
---
If the classic minimap was more detailed i would probably turn off minimap icons. But as on now its hard to find sub areas. North of cross roads is pretty broad or near that unnamed watchtower is frustrating when its on other side of a mountain. 
---
If i was a teenager again maybe, but being a father i only get a limited amount of time to play and i do want to level a char to 60 being my 1st time really playing wow.
---
How is this gonna work when layering is removed? Are q times gonna be tripled?
---
I have all my keybinds on the action bars the same on all characters, and if I wanted to do what you were doing I'd bind one of my action bar slots to F, then just put Charge in that slot on the warrior and Pet Attack in it on the hunter (should be available from the pet spellbook, otherwise you can write a macro).  easy peasy.
---
At least take skinning as one profession. So many lower level beasts you are killing anyway then just vendor everything you skin. You could also take either mining or herbalism to add to that if you want double gathering.
---
I have 4 friends that I'm going to play with for most of my max level playtime.
---
And I'm currently in the dilemma of choosing a main, between my 46 shaman, and my 31 warrior.
---
My friends play the following classes:
---
Druid tank
---
Druid resto
---
Rogue
---
Hunter
---
I made my shaman thinking, as usually no one else wanted to heal, but that turned out to not be the case.
---
So I made my warrior and found leveling it a blast, and had a lot of fun, not going oom every time I think about using aømy abilities.
---
But now I'm at the level where it starts to take a lot of time, and I'm back to wondering what would be the best fit for the group.
---
I know warrior will have higher dps, but the shaman brings more utility and a ress.
---
And the warrior as far as I know, shares a lot of pre raid bis, with both rogue and hunter.
---
So what I want to ask is: given the four classes my friends plays, what would be the best fit, choosing between warrior and shaman? (Both will be as dps)
---
I will most likely end up getting both to 60 given enough time, but I would like to focus one, when my friends are online.
---

---
No, that's the command to make a cooking fire in any of the major cities.  Saves you a run to the inn

nah

yah
---
What’re you talking about, “be in charge”..? You’re acting like I’m being some elitist or something and taking it personally for some weird reason. The game used to have a great community that worked together and that’s a big part of what made the game so special. Now, it’s becoming dominated by assholes, such as yourself.
---
Partyin partyin yea
---
"The gameplay is bland and boring, every class feels the same/has a bland rotation. "
---
Yeah, vanilla/classic mages and warlocks have 1 skill in their rotation, that is less bland.
---
And FYI I play classic too.
---
I have been getting a lot of comments about this...i think a separate AH version might be good.
---
Can confirm Deja stats.
---
Okay unwanted morals warrior pack it up.
---
He was asking about threat you know that right ?
---
I murder everyone at every opportunity, the point is to make it inconvenient for the otherside.  Honorable fights are for duels outside the city gates.
---
Someone in a thread further up used this argument seriously
---
That's wotlk.
---
Healing wise truly druids will be outclassed by other healers fairly easily but they are more than welcome for their utility (gift of the wild, faerie f. , combat res)
---
Try foot
---
I have enough to deal with leveling my alt ! Stop bothering me with healthy stuff !!!
---
Worried about losing all your shit?
---
That's not always true. Blizzard has been using hardware IDs to prevent Overwatch players from making new accounts for a few years now.
---
They'll track your credit card and prevent you from adding game time for WoW too.
---
I personally lose my energy / motivation to work out after work.  I find if I don't do it in the morning, I probably won't do it at all.  I'm all for people taking workout breaks though.  Means I'll get yelled at less for going afk to check the chicken and broccoli I'm cooking.  Lol.
---
I use Mik's Scrolling Combat Text (MSBT)
---
Requires some configuration, but it works great
---
Nice. Thanks!
---
I don't play paladin, what exactly is being shown here? All I see is a pally unloading 5 reckoning into a squishy warlock.
---
Also I don’t think there’s a mailbox there (I can’t find one at least) so you can’t mail stuff to a bank alt if needed.
---
Perma ban is more appropriate. We aren't little kids, people who were doing this know very well what they were doing.

I also know what you mean by the first part, too. I ran around handing out 4x 6 slot bags to people in Elwynn Forest for a while (plus stacks of food) and didn't get much of a response either. Not like I did it for the gratitude, more because I had the bags and knew how much it sucked to NOT have bags starting out. But it made me wonder if I was just giving out free bags to a bunch of alts that could have easily afforded their own. :P
---
One of my worst aspects playing WoW has always been professions. Currently only level 27 as a shaman and I rolled with skinning and herbalism.
---
My question is, when I need money for my level 40 and eventually level 60 mount, is this going to make me money or should I switch to one of its counterparts (leatherworking or alchemy)? 
---
I have always been bad at what herb or skin is selling well so any tips on using these two professions would be great or even if I should sub one of those out.
---
Thanks.
---
These posts are more annoying than the actual abuse.  So is the anti-streamer circle jerk.
---
How do you feel about an item you need, but cant use it for another lvl or 2?
---
Hi, this information is coming from someone that attempted to tank 5 mans like it was done in Vanilla wow. You will simply not have enough rage to tank properly with the way people will open up on mobs immediately/stun the mobs on pull. I highly recommend “tanking” with a 2 handed weapon until at least SM Cath.
---
Fuckin lold
---
oh damn, that's a lot! how the hell are people supposed to make that by level 40 lol wtf
---
Since no one specifically answered how lockpicking works: a rogue has to level up lockpicking just like any profession. You lockpick by opening trade window, dragging locked box into the "Will not be traded" slot and rogue uses his skill on it. Then you both click Accept. You can also put some money into the trade as a tip.
---
Tipping is encouraged as it takes at least few hours to level up the skill. Anything between 5-50s is reasonable depending on the level. Best course of action is to always ask first how much they want for their time. Also like other people have said, don't just go and open trade, whisper the rogue first asking for the service.
---
2 resto druids cannot stack their healing over time spells on one target. So thats why people label them as least useful.
---
Getting corpse ganked is a side effect of the freedoms offered on a PvP server but it is not the intention. I never corpse ganked anyone so far and nobody corpse ganked me either.
---
weird, i am usually referenced by my class they never say blue troll or soemthing
---
Easiest way to fill your guild is recruiting by being helpful. Save someone from dying and buff them up, thats a ginv. Have 20 stacks of mithril shots lying around? Trade them for free to a hunter and throw in a ginv. Go into the starting zones and trade away free bags (worked well the first 2-3 days after start, now you will probably just fish casuals, which is ok - there is enough place in the guild, but not going to help with endgame) It works surprisingly well. My guild currently has 250 members without spamming in chat, with ~20 60s and the rest being on the way.
---
Thank you. And if they appear yellow to me, what color do I appear to them? Eg what do they see when they look at me in Ratchet?
---
No ragret
---
Recruiting from PUGs is incredibly effective.
---
Isn’t this the pet that’s borderline necessary for the c’thun fight, since it can be used to remove rebuffs?
---
meanwhile last sunday there was a level 60 alliance warrior killing lowbies in hillsbrad non stop.....
---
We have it the easiest bruh. I'm pretty sure we are the only class in the game that can reliably handle 10 mobs at once. Its slow if you're killing one at a time, but also you're doing it wrong if you are ;)
---
In Retail you can view guild rankings on wowprogress.com  it lists every guild in the order they clear new content.
---
Eventually down the line if Classic takes the same route as private servers, there will be “speed clear rankings” the best guilds will clear raids in crazy low amounts of time. For example I think there was a horde guild who cleared the entire Onyxia’s lair in like 30 seconds.
---
I think MC was down to sub 30 minutes probably shorter.

I mean at this point attacking someone the same level is pointless.  Attacking a lower level is fun it's just a different kind of fun than a close fight with someone near your level.

Somebody gave me a greater magic wand and it made elwyn forest &amp; westfall SO much easier.
---
Voila, no need to bother with 3 brand new server and all the shit because players can't click on a button I guess
---
Tanaris?
---
I prefer "mage".
---
They need to make a fresh server without layering so that way it wont be low pop as it will be full 3-5k population, but also that it wont be full of people who expolited everything as well.
---
I'm a level 12 priest and just made myself a wand. Have seen lots of posts about spirit tap and wand specialization but can't find where to train them? Can't seem to do it at priest trainers. Thanks!
---
I already explained to the other guy that there are more solutions beyond "layering" and "do literally nothing" and I guarantee you know this. Stop it with this stupid argument.
---
&gt;Not listing class or faction
---
Not sure how we're supposed to give advice without the two biggest factors. Also, yeah 1-39 just levels waaay faster than 40-60. Halfway point for XP is 45~ish, and you start having to spend a lot more time running around for quests and doing much longer grinds. Just wait for 50+ content...
---
Well sir, you qualify as an douche bag and probably a ninja.

Dummies play classic and will leave at 60 cause they want to show that they're hardcore to their friends when all they did was manacleave spam.

Nah, thats a case of being few druids in a raid and luck (unluck for others).
---
If you are a mage it should be easy to farm SM Cathedral or Armory.
---
I've had my character do the same with my 2h'er.  I think it is a bug that has something to do with the fact that my 2h'er takes the space positional slot on my character as the quiver does.  If I DW or use a 2hander that does not use the same location as the quiver every think works normally.
---
Also yeah the hawk thing is annoying.
---
Solid bait

You're asking everyone to conform to whatever you want, and insulting people who disagrees with you. This is the internet, you can remove yourself from people you don't want to associate with in literal seconds.

Hahah you remind me too much of myself dude. No rogue will think twice to fuck you in 11 different ways till sunday, so why should i show them mercy hahah

If your horde head to shadow prey village in desolace, on the dock is troll who will give you 55s and food for turning in 5 shellfish which are found in fishing traps underwater from the dock.
---
I did this for an hour and with selling the grey items I worked out as 8.5 gold per hour, there is a chance to drop a fishing pole which is bis for alliance now and it hard for them to farm it. Sell that on the Ah for a gold or two.
---
Why do people think layering will somehow reduce the servers capacity? Did blizzard announce they were going to lower the capacity of servers?
---
You can paste it as a file?  Does reddit just know to upload it?
---
I don't get how people would be afraid to ask what a mark means when you don't explain what a mark means at the start of a dungeon.
---
Seems like you are reading way more into it than what I wrote...
---
Push-ups? Jumping jacks? What’re you trying to do kill these people for a shorter queue?
---
It's choosing the fight.  Hunting, chasing, and catching someone you have a clear advantage over does have it's appeal.
---
Layering is sharding.
---
Asmongold didnt do this. He's actually against all sorts of exploiting.
---
I've been opening lockboxes under the assumption that people are saving for their mount, so I don't ask for anything. I've already done the grind for my mount, so I'd rather people get extra money for their own needs.
---
If someone insists to pay, my usual suggestion is 5 copper per skill point needed to open the lockbox. Some examples:
---
* Heavy Bronze Lockbox (25) - 1 silver, 25 copper
---
* Iron Lockbox (70) - 3 silver, 50 copper
---
* Strong Iron Lockbox (125) - 6 silver, 25 copper
---
* Steel Lockbox (175) - 8 silver, 75 copper
---
* Reinforced Steel Lockbox (225) - 11 silver, 25 copper
---
Opening a lockbox doesn't cost anything for a rogue, but they do have to train up lockpicking which takes some extra time investment while they're leveling. Blacksmiths and engineers can create their own keys and explosives (respectively) as alternative ways to open lockboxes, and would want a larger tip to cover the material costs.
---
These will drink the beer that the vendor sells in .... that molten core... key place ... brd?
---
You either have no idea what layering is and/or seem to think that it is the same as sharding
---
it is not
---
Layering was implemented for a couple of reasons
---
1. Ensure a playable launch experience, this mainly affect the starting zones, but applies everywhere.
---
2. Ensure healthy realm populations in  the months/years following release.
---
3. As to not take away (as much) from the community aspect like sharding does.
---
"Layers" currently, are essentially full sized realms ( we are unsure on the actual size of each layer but it is likely close to a full realms size) and, they span the entire games world 
---
When they "remove layering what they're doing is reducing the amount of layers per realm to 1 instead of the current single digit amount of layers that there are on each realm, This means that when they "remove" layering, the realm capacity decreases to the capacity of 1 layer ( we are unsure how many this wil be, just like we are unsure what the capacity is now)
---
I hope this clears some things up for you, it's kind of hard to explain how it works in text, without writing a whole essay
---
Any high activity levelling guilds on Herod (Horde)? I’ve bounced between a few, trying to find one that has lots of active players and dungeon groups being formed at all levels. Not sure if one exists or not?
---
You need some reading comprehension my dude.
---
So what happens if everyone chooses the same server at step 2...
---
Nobody seems to remember BFD. You're about the right level for it. There is a quest in Darnassus that rewards you with an amazing wand that should last for 10-15 levels.
---
Sex instead WoW? Filthy C A S U A L

The xp potion exploit really did solidify that catchphrase for me.  
---
I didn’t exploit it, and in turn people that did got a slap on the wrist and a bunch of max level toons as a result.
---
I think it's down to the current meta. I think but also rogue we're always a dime a dozen class. Brought little but damage and other classes could out dps.
---
Why you gotta personally attack my plan to head to Arathi today at level 31 eh?  I see how it is.
---
Pattern is not bound, anyoen can see/roll.
---
You should not need to say truefaith is reserved. It should be obvious if there is a priest in the group; it's a BoP item so it's literally only useful to tailor priests.
---
you got this
---
&gt; Never got it and killed at least 1200 of them. (Can tell due to rep)
---
Holy cow you singlehandedly committed a war crime!
---
I use it pretty proactively, especially if the tank isn’t an all star
---
Better for form and fitness, crunches end up really working hip flexors instead of abs and put unnecessary stress on the spine through strenuous repetitive motion.
---
Do it
---
I’ve seen the mage pattern on AH. I bought the priest one in vanilla. So my guess is that the pattern is bow, and the crafting itself is bop.
---
Sitting on a shitty chair playing wow all day is bad for your spine too! What a combo!
---
Honestly this, if everyone rolls need you can avoid being ninjad and then just pass the boe to the player who intends to actually use it.
---
maybe.....
---
Not while leveling.

If he's not willing to do a quick google search, he has no interest in arguing in good faith, and I'm not going to spend time defending an idea (that's not even mine to begin with) when it's been defended to death already. I'll debate him if he responds admirably, but I doubt that will happen.
---
Kinda unhealthy way to look at things. Hopefully you don't apply same logic IRL...
---
With that being said, how does someone else having more gold affect you? There are extremely efficient legit players with 10k gold  as well, not just exploiters. Other than couple boe items and epic mount, your only money sinks are skill resets and consumables. You easily generate the gold for all of that by just playing the game normally at 60, selling greeded items and picking up gold from dead stuff in dungeons.
---
 After I get my epic mount (should be few more days!) I don't have to worry about the gold anymore unless I REALLY want some pricy boe purple again.
---
It is indeed! One of the first things I picked up :)
---
&gt;I have a lot of panic abilities to keep everyone alive and well!
---
Really? This was what was keeping me away from druid, I seem to remember that when damage became a bit much there was nothing I could do because of the long casting time and lack of panic abilities.
---
I’ve been playing on Kirtonos and I agree, 99% of the people I’ve met have been very kind, generous, and fair. 
---
Except getting killed by an opposing faction hunter this morning after finishing a mob with low health but hey what can you do it’s a PVP server.
---
Skinning Yetis. They drop money then you skin them for more!
---
hit mobs like 5-10 levels below you. it really doesn't take that long to be honest.
---
It was the same thing in vanilla in most groups so it is not something new. But often you will decided within the group how you act in each case.
---
Is not sarcasm, for me is relaxing see the sea, hesr thr music and enjoy with views... Idk why people need to be always so negative .
---
Man your server must be saturated, I'm easily pulling 50s a stack for deviates and oilies every single day all day.
---
I just use sunder armor in battle stance.
---
nah just autism
---
As someone who just dinged 53 last night, I'm pretty sure this is an assassination attempt.
---
People dramatically overstate how much of a "problem" this is. Ragnaros was cleared the first week of Classic by a less than full raid with less than half of the raid level 60. If you put in the work and show up for raids, they'll take you. Its that simple.
---
Are you using WiFi?
---
Under cutting the buyout is a rookie move.
---
You can match the lowest price but be listed above by having a lower bid price
---
Once again a person not reading my post.
---
You have several weeks notice to select 1 of 3 servers to select. The transfers are live copies, you keep your name and full character. Allows ample time to coordinate with people. 
---
Good luck in Phase 2. Random person who has 0 rebuttal but likes to complain a lot
---
No axe is better dps.
---
But how do I know I'm doing damage if I don't ambush then backstab crit and pull aggro off the tank immediately after the tank pulls the mob?
---
Agree to disagree I suppose, your just not going to win any loot that way
---
It's only considered "gambling" if you're using real money outside of the game.
---
Yea but some of us are hunters that buy arrows and food to feed pets. I've probably spent 5g already on that :(
---
Sunder armor can be used in battle stance!
---
Oh, retail might be for you dude.
---
I've seen plenty of quality content posted from cell phone photos of screens, some with hundreds of upvotes. Of course they still have pissboys like you complaining over such a mundane aspect of a post.
---
As long as the message gets across why does it matter if it's a SS or a photo? Didn't realize there was SS police out there on Reddit LOL
---
You make yourself look like a whiney elitist by bitching over something so stupid LOL
---
They akready added kayers to servers reducing queues , they wint do that indefinetly because they dint want 15k ppl queues at phase 2.
---
Send them to a bank alt, or put them in ur own bank
---
He sounds like a communist
---
90% of the playerbase chooses server 1.
---
5% choose server 2
---
5% choose server 3
---
You now have 2 dead servers and still too many players on server 1. Great job, you just made 1 problem into 3 problems
---
I like to gank the opposite faction but I won't go out of my way to camp low levels or kill Q mobs. That's pretty lame lol
---
Flight paths are probably the worst hahaha
---
okay man, you don't get it. good luck talking to like...anyone, about anything.
---
best spec for 5 mans is by far arms because of sweeping strikes. you also get cruelty and enrage from fury. you should not put a single point in prot for anything but raids.
---
I think this is the best solution and the best reply. Discussing the rules for BOEs beforehand solves the problem. It's not common to see that done in 5mans though but maybe we should. 
---
My plan if in doubt will be to wait and see how others roll, and in the worst case need and give it to whomever really needs it alternatively offer a reroll.
---
I realize now my last post missed an explicit "sorry".  So to be clear, that was supposed to be an apology for upsetting you :)
---
&gt; they asked a GM what they should do because they wanted the ragg loot and he said its ok to reclear the raid.
---
I don't really care about who/what with esfand etc, but this logic is super weird.
---
People say "The GM cleared it" as if that somehow washes away the benefit of getting to re-kill the bosses in MC for a second time in a week. That is a hugely beneficial thing to be 'cleared' for players to do; many important loot is from mc bosses that aren't rag.
---
no-lifer?
---
Hey, what guide did this template come from?
---
Went to Wetlands. It was raining. Really wet. 10/10 name
---
I think the discussion is based on a false premise.
---
I really believe they would have no issue with going down to one layer from a hardware perspective.
---
The reason layering is important is because the game would be unplayable with 4x a high pop vanilla server all sharing resources.
---
They'd have to have dynamic respawns in a zone so quick the same mob you are killing would be respawning on you.
---
Ahh ok, never went warr. Did it as a mage
---
I haven't seen a dungeon that would be messed up by frostbite in AOE groups. Sm, ZF, and BRD are all totally fine to have frostbite in if you're in a spellcleave group.
---
The first seconds of a pull are crucial for the tank. If you start attacking as soon as he pulls, you might steal aggro. That means he's not getting attacked by the mobs, thus not building rage and limiting his options to get aggro back. Also, he needs 110% threat to steal aggro back so it's even harder than just keeping it from the start. So he might end up just trying to get aggro back during all the fight instead of focusing on damage dealing/mitigation.
---
If you see you're stealing aggro almost every pull, try waiting 3-4 seconds before attacking, and make sure you  attack the same target as him (normally he should mark).
---
As someone who doesn't play PvP at all, is it worth getting this? My hunter is 32 right now, and I'm using the white ghost cat from Duskwood. Since mobs don't suffer from spell pushback, the only advantage is more frenzy procs, ie. higher frenzy uptime, right? But how significant is it really? Are there other advantages or disadvantages to high attack speed in PvE?
---
dungeons don't have a 24 hr reset.
---
You could just keep your stupid comments to yourself?
---
Most toxic on reddit? Have you been to r/apexlegends? I think they may take the cake.
---
The two big things they did were reducing the draw distance so you couldnt see very far so theres less data being transmitted.
---
Also they made clusters of zones each with their own servers instead of having 1 server for the entire continent.  For example like Tirisfal, Undercity, WPL, EPL would be hosted on a server so if you moved between those zones it would be seamless, but if you say moved between WPL and Alterac mountains (which is on a different zone cluster), youd see characters phase out as they move between clusters/servers.
---
For really high traffic times like at a launch you could do clusters of only a couple zones.  When the server calms down a bit you can do a large number zones per cluster.
---
As a feral druid, I would never roll on something a cloth wearer in my group was rolling on. When nobody rolls need on it, only then will I ask if I can roll on it for my healing set. This isn't a hybrid class problem. This is simply being being an asshole. I'll have warriors and hunters rolling on leather gear even whenever I or a rogue are also rolling it.
---
&gt; auto &gt; pull aggro &gt; multi shot
---
I see your problem. You're opening up before the tank has done any real damage. Or on the wrong target. Then you throw salt into the wound by multishotting.
---
Huntard.
---
except it makes you look cool
---
Thank you! That's the mix of the hearthstone and warcraft promo arts style :)
---
Blizzard appears to be perfectly happy with players utilizing the layering system outside of dungeons to improve farming.  They have made adjustments to it, but in no way have banned or punished people from it.  They are clearly fine with how it is currently implemented despite the communities concerns.
---
If the current trends continue they'll just hate themselves.
---
Some people just love griefing to the extreme. This is that case. Guy was probably watching TV or something on the side.
---
During mana breaks you have to have good posture, sit up straight, shoulders back, feet flat on the floor.
---
I try to remind myself to have good posture anyways but my reminder is when my head dips below my computer screen because I am slouching so hard core haha
---
Take the flight and enjoy with all and stop be so...
---
i would suggest farming mats for the azure silk belt (15% increase swim speed), as well as water breathing elixir (works for half hour). then put on a show and grind. At your level you could prob handle a crab jumping out of the crate and another one aggroing. I almost died on second cage and i would have lost my elixir, ended up dieing when i had 5 minutes left. turned in my lobstas for over 5g. Only prob is this can get busy at peak hrs so make sure to do something else at those times. Good luck
---
i hope we're playing this shit in vr in our nursing homes.
---
keep your minds fresh peeps, even when our bodies are spent our minds will still fly.
---
You do realize the armor type only affects armor value, right? If the stats are good then the stats are good
---
PVP happened
---
Can confirm I got an account banned for botting back in BC.  There was no temp just straight up complete ban.
---
Thanks a lot! Appreciate it :)
---
I was hoping that was an addon.
---
It didn't work in raids.
---
you might only have to do 4. its all random chance ;)
---
I was grinding there for like 2 levels when I was around that level and nothing. Tried for Deathmaw for a couple hours and again nothing. I'm jealous.
---
!@#\~ yeah it is!
---
Cool man! My IGN is Converter if you ever see me on. ✌️
---
Why does it matter to much to you?
---
I agree with you, but man it seems to take forever, all the running and travel, etc. 
---
From a pure leveling speed perspective, grinding seems better. Seems like I get levels faster and then your bags are always full of junk to sell.
---
The whole point of  classic is to play the old game, if u want new features play retail :^)
---
Could be, but looking at the “desk” on the left hand side of the “cockpit” against the wall, it does not look like the father is of any serious height;)
---
But the important thing is that he was unable to disprove your equation.
---
If you have the profession need, if you don’t greed. Doesn’t matter if it’s a boe
---
Keggle after every crit
---
Tough, it depends on how much you plan on leveling solo and how much you plan on healing. Realistically, if you aren't in a melee cleave group or something where there's going to be *a ton* of damage going out, you can heal just fine in shadow and it'll be a massive advantage for solo.
---
But if you're dead set against shadow, it really comes down to how much you will be on your own. The less you are, the more aggressive you can be on healing talents. Smite spam holy is a mostly viable holy spec that is very good at healing dungeons; you could try that.
---
Gear queer, wtf does that even mean.
---
To be fair, the blueberry is garbage at holding aggro in vanilla. It's why I switched to a drain tank build on my warlock.
---
For raiding it doesnt matter because youre bringing a wolf for the party buff. Also frenzy is already 100% uptime with 4 points into it on most other pets. And 3 points isnt rrally reliable enough for broken tooth.
---
What addon is used for the group unit frames?
---
Yeah same with me, I've found an alternative called Plater but I really prefer the look of KUI.
---
You need a mirror to look into
---
This is missing a few new realms like Earthfury and Heartseeker but I imagine it will be updated.   They're not finished making realms yet.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090143/world-of-warcraft-classic-community-resources
---
When leveling, the only reason you should down rank is because your heal target's max health is too low to safely heal them without overhealing.
---
For instance, if your tank has say 1400 hitpoints and your highest rank healing touch heals for 900, then you need to wait for your tank to have only 500 hitpoints (about 35%) so that you don't overheal.
---
In an ideal world you'd want your max rank heal to hit for about 1/3 of your tank's health pool and then wait until he/she is at 50%. Likely it's only going to heal them up to ~85% but if you get lucky and the heal crits you get a bunch of healing for not that much mana. Sadly this doesn't happen often at low levels as your tank is either under geared or not prioritizing stam, which means your max rank heal is probably closer to 50% of the tanks HP.
---
In terms of the rest of your party though, down ranking makes a lot of sense. Your mage friend may be at 50%, but that might only be 700 hit points worth of damage. If you pop that guy with a rejuv that heals for 1k, you wasted 300 points of healing for nothing. Here it would be a good idea to slap a lower rank rejuv that heals for say 500 and then use that to top off people who get hit by the random AoE spells or ranged attacks.
---
It's far more important to have max health and armor w/ pet class skill.
---
Meh they can stay out. Now they will spam trade/world/lfg at the same time.
---
Fishing is a secondary profession. You can have alchemy and fishing at the same time.
---
I am not a fan of his. I'm super tired of overly dramatic streamers, but with that said, I feel like he's probably doing his best to not exploit and stay on the straight and narrow because he does have a target on his back from the general WoW community and if he was to do anything, it would be all over Reddit and YouTube within minutes. He has moments of logic, he knows this is how it would play out.
---
&gt; but when one class is limited to rolling on 20% of drops vs another classes ability to roll on 40%-60% of the drops, it just seems unfair. And I honestly don't think it's fair to other non-hybrids to just say that it's a perk of being a hybrid.
---
It's not really unfair, beacuse you know about it before the run. If you prefer it the other way, you can make your own groups and make it clear beforehand that tanks can only roll on tanking gear, healers only on healing gear, etc. 
---
Like I said, communicating loot rules before the run should remove drama. Ask the tank beforehand if he's going for DPS gear. If he says yes and you don't like that, you're perfectly free to find another tank.
---
You say this in jest, as if that wasn't *extremely* common in Vanilla. Many a raiding guild believed the stats benefited the tanks more than the small damage upgrade would help the hunters, all of whom should have Rhok at that point anyways.
---
Love broken tooth, managed to do a wPVP 1v3 with him. Also had this wholesome interaction against a horde who also had BT.
---
https://imgur.com/a/WTZWJAB

I still haven't named him ‾\_(ツ)_/‾
---
On the twitter thread of blizz announcement of the fix, there was this guy replying everyone with "banning players for this is wrong, come to my discord to debate me about that"
---
I wonder if he got banned already lol
---
Daggers with ambush / backstab is excellent for rogues while leveling + the added benefit of preparing you for pvp and being great for vs cloth and leather.
---
Just look for a slow dagger for your main hand to maximize ambush and backstab damage.
---
How can I enable coloured Classes in the Chat?
---
All I am saying is that I originally thought that one should use sunder armor instead of heroic strike the moment you get sunder armor. Is it level 10? But this did not seem to work for me. 
---
So what you say is that the use of sunder armor is ment for arms warriors above level 30?
---
No. A good person does good things without expectation of thanks or acknowledgement. The deed itself is the reward.
---
30 rogue here. It's not great. My hunter and priest have 0 downtime, but my rogue has to slow it down.
---
As for groups, I've had 0 issues when it comes to people wanting a DPS.
---
Mages are *everywhere*. So if you dont mind being the most popular DPS and spamming 1 button in raids, go ahead. Locks are much more rare than mages.
---
Well, it's hard to be all three. DPS and Tank and heal between wipes to save time, but healing without at least some gear will get you into OOM in 3-4 heals. And keeping your healing gear while leveling (with small bags) is hard unless you create a lot of bank alts. 
---
It's different on level 60 where you can afford bigger bags, bank and generally carry less items.
---
But it's no an issue, since it's seems that Tanks are much rarer than healers this days, and i think with a small investment a non-tank build Druid is a better tank than non-prot Warrior.
---
Only works on Elemental Mastery (your next Fire, Frost, or Nature spell has a 100% chance to crit), Divine Favor (your next Holy Light, Flash of Light, or Holy Shock has a 100% chance to crit), and Inner Fire (reduces mana cost of next spell cast and increases its crit chance by 25% if it is capable of a crit). I suppose it might work with Mages and some trinkets but I can't think of any off the top of my head.
---
Shoot-a-doot 🎺💀
---
Not at all.  But keep posting 0.o emojis like some 13 year old and his first time posting on the 'interwebs'.  (or for that matter, maybe use your main account instead of posting on an alt? really 0 comment karma?  either you rub people the wrong way or you're a troll).  Either way, I do enjoy getting responses like these,  let's me know who to easily block/ignore.
---
But before you sputter, foam at the mouth and create some half-assed retort. Let me elaborate for ya child.
---
A 'Tank' in the general sense in MMO's is the designated role of someone that redirects damage to them, or absorbs most of the incoming damage.  A 'tank' in "melee cleave" groups is generally the highest level/best geared warrior in the group.  They are going to be the one initiating, and getting most of the inital snap-aggro.
---
But if you think there are no tanks in the cleave groups, by all means go make one WITHOUT any warriors, see how long it takes to grind or how far you get in an on-level dungeon.  (psst: enjoy your repair bill!)
---
But back to my original statment which was mainly about gold generation, and the dubious efficacy of "meme groups" (aka Melee cleave groups or mage aoe spam).  
---
Neither is more efficacious at gold generation than any other "normal" group on-level.  And it's a a topic for another discussion to farm instances with over-leveled/over-geared toons alltogether.
---
Suffice it to say, you need to sit down, shut the hell up, and go back to playing the game or grow some balls and post on your main account.
---
There's a lot of people who are having a bad time, but they don't say it because they don't want to have edgelords and shit-stirrers swearing at them and calling them snowflakes for growing out of a middle school insult mindset.
---
Yeah, you're all playing vanilla.
---
Runecloth bags were high a few days ago so I said no thanks. Week later 4 journeymen backpacks. Guess grinding useless rep is good.
---
That's a good idea, I might try that or the other options. Thanks!
---
Anything created some aggro, I believe there is a bug that makes it higher than normal.  
---
Best thing is to keep switching targets and applying sunders as best you can, mocking blow/taunt the ones that get away.  Hope the dps doesnt start aoeing on the pull like they normally do.
---
Not Folgers?
---
My logic is that if I cast it immediately after my swing I can hit 1.5-2 seconds later at the cost of 15 rage. Rather than waiting 3.8s for my next auto. Effectively speeding up my swing and adding a bit of damage on top. 
---
Definitely an upgrade over HS, but I'm not sure about sunder.
---
It's a cultural value that is incompatible with Western values. Either you say it's okay to cheat and get ahead at any cost or you say it isn't. The thing is even they know it's wrong or else they wouldn't publicly shame those who get caught. It's a bad mentality to have.
---
da da dudum
---
Yeah I did, but since he decided to respond to a post saying not to invite druids because they would need gear, I pointed out that I and others go for int leather or agi/str leather. But it’s all snark all the way down at this point.
---
Also he said the same bullshit about the spec they joined as. That’s such a fallacy. We can heal or tank or dps. If we are in there as dps but specced resto, then we are also looking for gear to help with our main spec. Or if we are feral but joined as a healer, then we are probably doing that dungeon to try for gear to make our leveling experience better.
---
If you don’t want to compete for gear, don’t play with others. Don’t get pissy if a class that is flexible needs on gear to help them out with their other play styles. Grow up.
---
It's not crazy threat generation however it can make a difference. 
---
I gave this advice to a tank the other day when he said warriors have no AoE agro.
---
As a healer it felt smoother when he did this.
---
3 spawns? these things are all over the barrens...
---
All you have to do is have her not dead when emp dies. She could be at 1% health and the quest will still complete.
---
No, because tauren deadzone would be 5-10, like I said it doesn't affect the ''too close'' zone
---
As a developer, I somewhat admire the first 'exploiter', and I think they deserve some positive credit here. I'm not talking about everyone who used this exploit, i'm talking about the first person who figured out this exploit. That person stumbled upon a random series of events, likely unintentionally and without trying figured out they could use it to there advantage. The only reason this exploit was possible is because there is a bug in the game, and blizzard is responsible for that bug.
---
From a programming perspective this type of bug would probably be referred to as a 'failure of imagination', they simply didn't anticipate the series of events that lead to this exploit. The person who identified this exploit did Blizzard a favor, they revealed a problem and because they did that blizzard was able to fix it.
---
Bathroom emergencies are perfectly understandable. I had 60% of my group walk out of an instance to go vendor because their bags were full. It was probably 10 minutes of my life dedicated to waiting for someone elses greed.
---
Precast as in start the cast before the tank takes damage. You can cancel before it goes off if it's not needed.
---
I think it has diminishing returns every hit knocks back less.
---
I was just making a joke about mages having a lot of downtime. Was not expecting so much criticism, sorry guys. 😔
---
DPS is just a function of damage and weapon speed. 
---
For instant attacks, weapon speed was normalized and thus weapon speed does not matter when calculating damage. 
---
All you want to look at is the weapon damage. The higher the weapon damage - the more benefit  your instant attacks (sinister strike, whirlwind etc) will get.  Weapon speed for those calculations are normalized by this patch in the game.
---
I’m sorry I didn’t check your post history :( it’s mainly due to me not needing to to get my point across.
---
At the end of the day if you do this for all boe’s when someone in the group needs it for an equip it’s ninja looting plain and simple, I like your justification for this is it all adds up and I guess it does when you ninja everything on your way to your mount. Have fun out there as I’m sure people your playing with won’t.
---
So you are saying that warriors are the new hunters of classic.
---
It's not a warrior axe, it's a shaman axe. It was taken from us unfairly and given to the warriors.
---
Think about it, you're fighting air, water and fire elementals to craft and item to fight an air elemental to get an elemental infused axe right at level 30 when shamans are getting their wind totems and windfury. 
---
See https://youtu.be/xMexuxbOaSQ for a full explanation on how us shamans got screwed and how warriors do not deserve that quest.
---
Oh hell yeah! You might be in a slow phase right but get that sword and it might just make all the difference :) 
---
Best of luck!!
---
Behind what? The made up race that only the winners and losers are saying exists?
---
Took my 3 months to get to 60 in Vanilla.
---
Take your time. Enjoy it. Play for you.
---
I've seen your name before. 
---
Are you on Pagle?
---
Yeah. I guess I'll have to see and balance it. The problem is Ambushing/Backstabbing and seeing big numbers is so fun.
---
Stab? Your class is showing.
---
I never noticed that prior to using ElvUI.  Good to know.
---
Don't believe so. Nameplate addons can. NeatPlates does so without adjusting any options. I just wish there was a way to get name plates to start showing at farther.
---
Gotta play 1 month of actual playtime in retail before you are allowed to play classic again.
---
What was that Rough Stone(4) for?  I whole 10 copper?
---
This is dope, thank you!
---
thanks for the positive feed back :D
---
*insert trollface*
---
Yeah, and it was clumsily worded by me, but "hit what the tank is hitting" is not what I'm saying. Your additions and clarifications are good, though.
---
I guess the gist of it comes down to "don't go crazy on poorly attended mobs please"
---
I am litteraly going to try this at least 1 day :P I think one day is enough to get Ripped!
---
The farthest she got was 20 and kept rerolling no wonder “never got into” .. the game doesn’t get really fun til 30-40 when you get more spells. 
---
Not to mention she’s manipulating you. Plain and simple. If you don’t see it that means she’s doing it really well.

---
I think the transfers are finished now. They were letting High/Full realms transfer to specific newer realms.
---
You cant say that with 100% truth. 
---
They do play off stream and you never really know what they are doing. 
---
(Not saying they are cheaters, just pointing out that it's not impossible for them to be cheaters.)
---
do what you can. sometimes they can be agonizingly long.
---
In dungeons its a no no but i think in world they changed it a little so you cant hop in and out so fast
---
I generally agree, but this one wasn't a surprise - it was literally one of the most repeated concerns about the layering system.  While I don't really feel any sympathy for the people that got banned, I also feel like Blizzard is passing the buck a bit here.  This one was on them.
---
Then again, I tend to be a bit "meh" when it comes to in-game exploits that don't require any third party software or file manipulation.
---
Thats just EXP waste..
---
Yep yanked a full emperor run as arms/ with ass gear.
---
It's a boe recipe, but the robes are bop.
---
I got the recipe yesterday after like ten runs so it's relatively rare but not obscenely, based on that and other people's drop rates.
---
Costs rather a lot to craft given the mats though and it's something I have been working towards since before I hit 60 getting tailoring up for cd etc.
---
All people can roll on patterns. It is probably worth master looting it but tell people you will be doing that before you go so have to roll for other loot manually.
---
I suppose we can also determine the rule to adopt during such a case but for me the rules are explicit.
---
Have a nice game :)
---
Doesn't the TOS have some vaguely worded, yet still legally binding, as to the effect of: "And anything else we deem to be unhealthy for our services."?
---
They took the weeby anime retail Jaina model as reference.
---
print screen button, and then it stores your image in your wow directory
---
that is a good indicator
---
Where do you get your SP gear?
---
Name it bt
---
I agree and she should know that. We started in late 2005.
---
Yep, another small detail that didn't show up on pservers. Once all people in the group have completed the quest, Moira is replaced by [a Dark Iron priest](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10076). Same loot though.

I’m only level 17 right now so that’s not a problem atm but I’ll still remember that

Well even in wow people like Soda and Reckful have been banned before. Blizzard doesn’t give a shit about steamer clout.

The best part of waking up is a blumpkin?
---
Kui doesnt seem to work right now. Plater ist a really good alternative and more cumstomizable too.
---
So should I just make groups and reserve all the items I want? That basically sounds like what you're saying and it just feels kinda like a dick move.
---
The shouts do generate some threat, but very little. Idea is to shout once or twice just to get enough threat for the healer not to draw aggro with a single renew - however if you're already thunderclapping, that's more or less moot.
---
I would say if you have 3-4 mobs that you're charging in, then charge, TC, if stuff doesnt hurt much then zerker + whirlwind, then def stance and tab sunder. 1 sunder/revenge on each, then shield slam skull, pop a few more sunders/revenges into it (dont bother if its below 30% or so), and then just keep tabbing. I generally dont use cleave unless im rage capped.
---
If its more targets than that (i.e. 6-8) then tc, whirlwind, demo shout and grenades in prot stance. Also praying. Because no way in hell you can out-threat a blizzarding mage in aoe without AOE gear (like engi gear/grenades, immolation oil etc). I just taunt on CD and try to grab single mobs at a time after the initial burst.
---
selling on AH or Vendoring?  I read somewhere to just Vendor all the leather up to a certain point.  That seemed odd to me, but I havent looked into it to see if it actually made sense or not.
---
Oh, well you'll always get those.  I mark skull and I see the rogue facetanking a mob next to me that I only mauled once to get initial aggro while the mage walks into a wall the entire fight.  Some people are just going to ignore the marks and play poorly regardless.
---
it is so much wasted time...its not like you can even do crafting or anything while just sitting there....perfect time to do something else.
---
You have the burden of proof buddy.
---
So put yourself in the shoes of the average horde player on Herod. You didnt roll horde because you knew ahead of time your faction had majority population, you rolled horde because you like horde. You've busted ass these last 3 weeks to grind and level up and save gold for your mount.
---
Then one day you get home from your job, go to log on only to see an inflated queue, or worse a message encouraging you to abandon your weeks of effort because the server wound up being imbalanced.
---
I just dont think it's a good idea to screw over the average player just because their faction happened to become the majority population outside of their control.
---
Thanks, that’s very kind

&gt; 10-12: Early Westfall
---
*shivers*
---
1- 11 elwynn
---
11- 12 - dun morogh 
---
12 - 14 loch modan
---
14 -16/7 westfall
---
16/7 - 19/20 loch modan
---
then finish westfall/deadmins = roughly lvl 22.
---
You are then set to do redridge, wetlands and duskwood on your way to 30. You'll never run out of quests or have any issues finding stuff for your level.
---
No more going to westfall at lvl 10 and complainig at 24 that all your quests are orange.
---
Honestly I preferred KUI as well but after using Plater since launch I now prefer Plater hands now, def worth checking out! :)
---
RTX
---
It's almost like a combination of the two made the entire thing cringe.
---
Pretty sure It doesn't work like this lol
---
but then you'll kick your self later..."man i really did need those shoulders"
---
As someone who has to study when I get home from work, the queues are a lifesaver.
---
Get home, jump in queue, make dinner, study, THEN play
---
Not everything is about the numbers. If it was, only mages, warriors, and priests would ever get into raids. Every class has something that is needed for raids. 99/100 times, if you master your class, you will be invited over the flavor of the month. Warlocks also scale really well later in the game, and become pretty strong at AQ40 and Naxx. Just play what you like, get good, and you'll be fine.
---
Did this happen on ashbringer server. I recognise the bitchyness
---
People leaving STV like they've shit themselves.
---
She does. Maybe she gets off on being controlling.
---
It needed to be said.
---
Correct.  Hemo does damage similarly to SS in that it is based off of weapon damage.
---
Unless blizzard offers free transfers then yes you are abandoning your progress. And I dont see them doing that anytime soon. They only did that early on to help reduce server loads. 
---
Personally I just see this as a reality of pvp servers, one side will become the majority. The minority faction will have a harder time. This is true across all pvp servers.
---
People have very elastic criteria when it comes to abusing gameplay mechanic - more precisely they will rationalize obviously exploitative behavior as them just "being clever" or "not really giving them any advantages" despite that clearly not being the case.
---
for a human you only need to get to 6% hit for swords due to how weapon skill functions. more is beneficial, but 6% is the soft cap you should be aiming for
---
You don't need to be the group leader to mark pulls and call the shots. Anyone who knows what to do can and should do it. It usually falls on the tank to do it anyway. Just create a group.
---
It did work in raids
---
Or you could just move servers yourself and spare us from these idiotic posts
---
Contact Blizzard an appeal it. Should remove the ban.
---
Only had 2 bad dungeon experiences in Classic. Both mages who rage quit mid dungeon because we were going too slow and CC pulling.

Kids really want to race to 60 in phase 1 so they can raid log lol.

How trash heap of a human being do you have to be to not even have the common courtesy to say thanks to people giving you free stuff.
---
Technically yes. However the amount of axes you get around this level that you use for multiple levels is so much higher than maces. You go axe spec for the WW axe, Ravenger, rockbiter etc. you get FAR more value out of the 5% crit to all axes. Combine axe spec with cruelty and that’s just baseline 10% more crit for the majority of your leveling
---
Sorry the truth is something you don't want to hear.
---
yeah I know but I haven't leveled it and don't want to go back as leveling is my main priority
---
Name checks out

I also want to say 3-6 months as those are subscription options as well.
---
And all other BiS BoP loot is worth the same to everyone else as well; it's worth the DE value. You're a ninja if you need on truefaith vestment recipe, or any BoE BiS that someone in group would use; full fucking stop.

Many previous cash cows are over supplied atm below lvl60
---
Imagine being this guy, so hateful over a locked chest.
---
Yes. Take the ship to Ratchet and swim north close to the coast until you reach the Echo Isles. Tame your tiger and take your hs. Don't forget food for the pet.
---
Where are you leveling? If you're in darkshore just follow the roads to ashenvale and the barrens, make your way to ratchet then swim the coast to the islands. Easier than going through durotar itself. From the eastern kingdoms you can either take a boat from menethil to dustwallow marsh then risk swimming the coast (lvl 46 sharks) or risk going through stranglethorn vale to booty bay for a boat to ratchet, then hop from the boat quickly and you'll be right at the islands.
---
I’ve been playing on PvE and now really regret my realm choice. Is there any way to migrate to a PvP server and keep my character?
---
Any time!  Good luck and have fun deleting everything!  ^ ^
---
i was thinking of it for someone who plays 2-4 hours a night...so each of these things might happen 1 or 2 times per gaming session....granted i might have underestimated gaming time and the frequency for others....
---
Blizzard is stupid AF and does not plan out or accurately assess situations.
---
If they were smart they would have
---
* Implemented balancing mechanics and provide information for people upon character creation on server
---
* Discourage rolling on overpop faction and incentivize the lower pop faction
---
* Advertise that BGs would be server specific for at least the first few phases. This encourages people towards 50/50 balance so they won't wait in crazy BG queues.
---
I'm sure there's other methods and means that they could have exercised. They chose not to. Don't fucking tell me #nochanges or I'll bite your face off.
---
I do use blood rage but that also has a relatively long CD so I can’t always use it. And there are often instances where I can’t even charge. I just have to continue with hitting the next mob etc hehe. But with blood rage I do have some additional rage that I could use for sunder. And I did. But somehow it still felt as just using heroic strike was better. 
---
It might be my gear, or it might be the fact that I have 5 points in cruelty making me crit 5% more I dunno really 
---
Bottom line is that I am not sold on sunder yet.
---
Honestly, I don't think Cleaving should be used for tanking.
---
I do exactly as you with some differences:
---
* Charge
---
* Thunderclap if rage is available (if not, use Bloodrage before)
---
* Demoralizing Shout
---
* Switch to Defense Stance
---
* If you did not use Bloodrage on Thunderclap, use it now.
---
* Sunder Armor + Revenge on one target initially (you're group should be focusing this, usually healing mobs or casters with horrible debuffs)
---
* If there are 3 or more targets, you should be tabbing between them and distribute sunder + revenge among them.
---
* If the other mobs go to your healer, select them, taunt and spam sunder armor + revenge on that one (the previous one should be dead and if it's not, it should still be on you).
---
Note: Remember, if Taunt is on cooldown, you still have Mocking Blow (battle stance) and in worst case scenario, challenging shout.
---
Im almost 100% sure if you appeal this the ban will be lifted.
---
Druids are really solid dungeon tanks, and can be used just fine in raiding too as offtanks even if it's not ideal choice. Their tier gear isn't suited for tanking, so that's a big downside in that.
---
But if you aren't that fuzzed about raiding, there's nothing stopping you from tanking as druid.
---
It's our chest. If you want to open them, you spend your gold to level lockpicking.
---
Oh wait, you can't, because rogues are the ones who invest in lockpicking. Sucks to be you.
---
Point is u can tank with any spec
---

---
What level are you? There might be other ways of getting mount money. Or if you are 40 might be more beneficial for you to just keep playing instead of fishing.
---
You might mistake me with Aero. I didn't play any beta and I am not on board of Questie for that long
---
&gt;  dont understand do people just underestimate rock eles 
---
On our server there are 5-10 people farming them at any given time.
---
I do not think it is an underestimated spot.
---
You see, if you always have a pot of coffee ready to drink, you just chuck a cup down the hatch after sexy time
---
&gt;  if you see me pop my AOE 6-second taunt, RUN
---
You could also macro that ability to a /p chat that said something like, "We've done fucked up! Everyone run to entrance!" to remind them if you wanted.
---
just put in a ticket explaining the situation
---
i got a ban last week from their auto flag due to some shit i had typed, just needs to get a real person to look at it
---
Looks like pitbull unit frames but it takes a lot of customization.
---
Can someone explain what the deal is with the layers and abuse of them? I play classic a little bit but not enough to know what it's about.
---
Totally agree. Unless you are max level with max mount and all the biggest bags, The moment is more important than the long con. 
---
For me, I just send those things to my bank alt. The vendor money will always be there if I need it, but I took a moneymaking build so I don't really need cash right now.
---
Do you roll on rare herbs / ore in a dungeon?
---
It's a gray area.  I don't like it, but I can see the justification.
---
Oh I work very hard around here. I’m also the sole bread winner. We have a medically complicated child though which does complicate things.

No, you aren't telling something. I dont believe this.

Like I said, they're for the long con, as they'll be a much more sought-after commodity when AQ comes out and people will need them for [nature protection pots] (https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17576/greater-nature-protection-potion).
---
People saying you should enjoy it now but I don't agree. Pre lvl 20 the game is definitely way slower. Way less moves, it's a lot easier, less options regarding what to do. You don't even have your shoulders and head gear pieces yet! 
---
Around level 30 is when I rly enjoy my character. The game actually slows down significantly at level 30, and more so at 40, and even more so at 50 but imo it's a lot better because your character is way more developed. 
---
The most important part of wow is the social aspect. I've been loving classic because a few irl friends have joined. I also love it because I found a rly fun and funny guild with great chemistry. 
---
(This will be hyper unpopular) bfa is way more fast paced. If you're finding classic is too slow you may enjoy bfa.
---
After the nerf to demo shout it's not very good for holding aggro.
---
As far as I can tell, it seems like battle shout only generates threat on application of the buff and refreshing it doesn't do much of anything. If I'm wrong about this, then it's the best ability for generating AoE threat provided everyone in your group is in range for the buff.
---
After the nerf to demo shout, I tend to demo shout only once in order to reduce incoming damage and establish initial aggro. Then I just cycle through each enemy I've pulled and land a single white swing and a single sunder armor on each one. Throw a few extra on the highest priority target so I don't lose threat. I will switch to battle stance and drop a thunderclap only if I really feel I need to reduce enemy attack speed, it doesn't generate that much threat.
---
Then I also feel like cleave generates piddly aggro for the amount of rage it costs, so I only use it if I'm absolutely swimming in rage, which isn't often.
---
I rely pretty heavily on sunder, but shouting is the way I generate initial threat, which may be enough to buy me some time to sunder and white swing everything.
---
In supermassive pulls I just don't hold threat as I spam shouts. I don't think I'm even expected to hold aggro in that case, except maybe on high priority/dangerous mobs.
---
Why don't you transfer yourself into oncoming traffic, ya racist fuck.
---
Hahaha it's a joke dude. Imagine being the guy who lies to everybody about his lock picking, then sneaks back to get the chest after the run.
---
I'm sure a lot of cloth wearers will have a problem with a feral druid needing cloth they need.
---
I was pretty much first hunter to badlands on my server and waltzed right up and tamed him immediately. He was great until I hit 48 and could get an owl (horde). I haven't put my owl down since &gt;&lt; (lvl 57). I loved BT, and will level him but man owls are just OP broken for hunters. Even with best claw and bite, I would pull agro off my pet all the time, multiple times a fight even. Now owl unless he gets a resist, I aint pulling anything off him.
---
what is a layering exploit? I keep hearing about them but don't know what it is.
---
Good tips so far
---
I would say level 20. At level 10 there's a milestone for many classes (bear form, hunter pet, ...) and the talent trees become available.
---
At level 20 you spend some talent points, got some gear, did your first dungeon etc. If you don't like it at level 20, WoW maybe isn't your game.
---
I fee it’s absolutely within their right, if there we’re a blacksmith or engineer in the group and they had a key or seforium charge, do you think they should share with everyone else. Lock picking is just like any other trades kill, the rogue had to invest time into leveling it up, why should he give that away for free?
---
RFD, oops.  Also... its 37 on horde, huh.
---
If you actually want to fill the role of tank at higher levels, Warrior -&gt; Druid it is.
---
If the healer is remotely decent it's really not a big deal. In some cases it's actually easier, even.
---
IIRC I saw enhancement shamans dropping stormstrike due to manacost and using rank1 frost shock just for crit proc fishing having good output, especially in raid since they can sustain the fight correctly
---
Not yet I'm afraid.  It's possible they will offer paid transfers in the future, but nothing is certain.
---
Exactly, and the reason we have these high pop realms right now is so they will still have a healthy population after the population starts dropping (which I think is a reasonable assumption to make)
---
Literally every rogue ever.  But you do you, bud.
---
Pagel's queues aren't too bad. Over the weekend I would maybe have a 15 minute queue, but on the week nights I haven't experienced any.
---
U literally have downs
---
I wouldn't make too much fuzz. If the rogue wasn't there noone would get it anyway. It's a perk of being a rogue  
---
Besides you can level engineering to open it. Should all that leveling, crafting and bringing charges not reward you with the lockbox that nobody would be able to open anyway?
---
Not true. Rogues can stealth in, ninja chest and get out no problem.
---
Locked chests are there to reward rogues. If you want to share the wealth, good for you but the choice is ultimately up to the rogue.
---
I didn't mean anything negative by that picture! Just a joke, haha! 
---
.. unless?
---
Level 52 Warrior here. Never went DPS on a dg. Always the tank.
---
Let me first say: I didn't even learn ThunderClap or Cleave :D They are not even in my spell book.
---
There are pretty much 4 scenarios of how I pull a pack in a dg.
---
1/ A pack of 3 mobs on which I can safely Charge to without pulling extra packs:
---
* Charge the closest mob.
---
* Switch to Def Stance (mid Charge. I do it with a macro). Blood Rage if I can.
---
* Sunder Armor the first mob.
---
* Change target to the second mob, Sunder Armor.
---
* Change target to the third mob, Sunder Armor or Revenge if it procs.
---
* Switch back to the first two mobs that the party is attacking, droping Sunder Armors and Revenge on them.
---
* Casually Sunder or Revenge the 3rd mob (the least attacked one).
---
* I stop attacking the mob when it's near 30% Health because it will die soon anyway and it won't matter who it's attacking.
---
--------------------------------------------
---
2/ A pack of 3 mobs on which I can's safely Charge to because it's near other packs:
---
* Pull with Ranged Weapon and break line of sight (so that ranged mobs can't attack and have to walk to me first).
---
* Blood Rage. Demo Shout for some initial aggro on the mobs when they arrive.
---
* From here it goes as /1. Tabbing between mobs and hitting Sunders and Revenges.
---
3/ Packs of more that 3 mobs.
---
* I spam Demo Shout and only Sunder on the Elite mobs and mostly ignore the non Elite ones and simply use taunt on the ones that are hitting a healer or a mage.
---
4/ Only one mob.
---
* Easiest one. Charge, def stance, Sunder Armor and Revenge when you can. Revenge &gt; any other ability (outside of Shield Slam).
---
got to start somewhere.
---
Reddit on my phone is just so painful though.
---
Doing it without the app is a headache and a half, and last time I used the the app's search function was literally non-functional. 
---
The reddit app is good for uploading photos, but that's only the thing it's good for.
---
How can you say it wasn't done or "intended"? Are you saying that pulling alot of mobs and then using Blizzard wasn't thought of? I generally don't understand wtf you are talking about.
---
They should always offer free transfers for an overpopulated faction. It's silly they don't.
---
I agree with you completely. Knowing that the rare recipes I can learn won't be made obsolete by a new expansion makes it feel much more rewarding for me to play with a long-term mindset.  And I've never done an RPPVP server, that sounds awesome!
---
Yes, many zones have quests that you can come back and complete 10 levels later. Questie helps with identifying these. By default it will place exclamations around the world map that match your level range, but there is an option for it to also show low-level quests that you may have missed.
---
Open a ticket it's not that hard.  I agree automation of bans is super stupid.
---
Low respawn time and they drop valuable grey and white items.
---
Bottom left corner of the image you linked shows default nameplates. That's health bars, not nameplates. I don't know if that's stock.
---
You have something turned on that is making the yellow bars. Turn off all your add-ons and go through interface options if they don't go away.
---
Currently only if it's full enough that free character migration is a thing.
---
I saw someone advertising their guild as “semi-casual”... like, what?!
---
When I start getting so restrictive over others loot it paints me in a bad light. Sure they have a choice to not go, but why would anyone wanna group with the guy that wants to reserve all of his loot?
---
You can tell that I've been jade by others in pugs, and ultimately looking for a fair reason to still pug with randoms, but my current solution is to just run with guildies. Then it doesn't matter who wants/needs what, and we all are in it together til we get what we're all after. 
---
As for pugs, I just don't feel like there will ever be a fair distributions or I'm just being a selfish prick.
---
The run I've struggled to tank recently was a group with 2 warlocks, priest, rogue.
---
The priest and locks would dot everything up, and the rogue would nuke single targets. There was no way for me to keep aggro on everything, so I would do my best to keep enemies off the casters, and taunt off the rogue when his health started to dip. Not a pretty run.
---
Battle shout does aggro per player buffed on each mob in the area, its good in melee heavy groups and not so great in caster heavy groups that are usually out of range. Demo shout does some aggro but no longer the amount it did a few days ago because they fixed that bug.
---
Most of the time i gather the mobs with both shouts and then sunder armor tab to the next mob and sunder armor again till they are all dead.
---
This guy mages
---
Do it every now and again when you get a chance, you need a fair few scans to build an accurate picture of the market, otherwise all your prices will be set based on what it saw on that one day that you scanned.
---
Id skip pi in start , and still keep spirit tap while leveling. Spurit tap has already saved dungeon healing few times , id go to spirit tap, spirit buff in disc and then move to holy to get spellpower.  At lvl 60 drop spirit tap to move more in holy tree for those 5 points
---
Mostly right except for the cooldown. It's 4 or 5 per hour until you get locked out for awhile, definately not 24 hours.
---
If you can argue that greed option is not for gold then go for it
---
Good to know. Been able to 2h rage dump tank up until lvl 45 but now is the time to start ironing out my threat/ mitigation tanking.
---
I agree mostly, but in this case I still think it’s a need roll for everyone. We aren’t talking about a few gold. This is a BoE drop that can sell for a 1/4 to a 1/3 of an Epic Mount. This is a 10-20 hour save on grinding for an epic mount or anything else. It’s huge.  
---
On my server, I’ve never seen anyone try to make the argument that only X class should be able to roll on a 300G drop. Just doesn’t make sense.
---
True but nothing can prove that the guy who cried and you pity gave it to him won't sell it. For all I know he could have it learned already and just wants to make extra money...
---
I just Mind Blast, SWP and then wand 
---
My wand ticks are faster than the cast time plus damage that smite does
---
I guess we just slightly disagree that you're "getting fucked". To me that implies that others are stealing your gear, whereas I am saying that people are perfectly entitled to roll on things like off-spec items as long as it's been agreed upon beforehand, and everyone in the group is fully aware of the situation. 
---
That being said, guild/friend runs are always going to be more effective for getting gear, for the reasons you say above. In the same way that guild raids are better for gear, because you can earn the right to get items, whereas in pug raids everyone as an equal chance.
---
Blade flurry would like to have a word with you.
---
I believe those are the only ones that drop it.
---
standing desks are seriously underrated.
---
I've tanked a few dungeons as an Enhancement shamans with the defensive talents selected. Viable as long as I pull in small bunches, but not having an AoE taunt does hurt.
---
So when I my leveling up my druid that I plan on healing with I'm not allowed to roll on cloth unless I spec resto the whole time? I have to intentionally make it impossible to solo quest just so I can get healing gear?
---
15 years later I still think WoW is awesome, I play again and have no regrets about the time spent all those years ago.    
---
I wonder how he'll feel about having begged his parents for v-bucks 15 years from now.
---
Blizzard's RaidFrames + Mouseover macro
---
Druid can turn into like 4 things and run 4 specs including a spec that hucks magic at things. Mages can only huck magic at things.  So unless making conjure food is just super value to you I don't know why mage is gonna be better.
---
I believe fish will go up over time as less and less people level fishing while leveling and more people are buying consumables.
---
I personally like to have pretty clearly defined roles in a group and having to constantly fight for aggro (or just constantly scanning which mobs are not yet controlled properly) is insanely stressful but doesn't happen with a "proper" group. Which simply means I have fun as long as I am the one tanking but I am getting stressed out if people constantly pull aggro.
---
Dude, having a baby myself you are a genious, how come i didnt think of that !?
---
You should do scans before you create a bunch of new auctions so it knows what the current values are for everything when posting them.  
---
When you mouse over items auctioneer will tell you what their market value is on your server, scanning the AH updates all these values and keeps them up to date.
---
I prefer TBC as well. It gets a lot of hate for outlander and lore people don’t like, but the classes were more fleshed out, arena was added, and Kara was awesome. Also some great QOL changes such as seeing targets health was a nice addition.
---
I've always pictured the semis with the big sleeper cabs to be like moving forts. I would just want to take naps and hang out all day and let the auto pilot from Simpsons do the work.

HANDLE IT!!!
---
And usually it's for a handful of silver for all the items.  Not really that worth it.
---
Idk. But my stonescale fishery business is not doing well since the recession lol. But im hoping stocks go up with more raiders investing in my company!
---
It’s sad because common sense isn’t that common. When a high value boe epic drops and people who think they should greed and only the ones that will use the item should need are creating the perfect environment for ninjas. These are the people that will spam on /2 and /4 that somebody ninja’d an item, when it’s in fact their fault. Needing on boe epics give equal chance to win an item which is EQUAL value to everyone, with zero chance of being ninja’d. There is absolutely no reason to greed on a boe epic in pugs.
---
Is anyone else having issues getting the chicken escort to drop in Feralas? My friend got the drop in like 4 kills.  Three of us were in a party.  2 of us didn't get the drop.  Since then I've done all the quests in Feralas, my friend has specifically grinded mobs for the damn beacon.  We haven't gotten it.  Anyone else having this issue?

Well, you are free to leave if you prefer the BfA approach.

Same!
---
First time i saw it happen, i thought the guy insta-died.  He had pulled aggro from the tank.  I felt bad for not keeping him up.  Then all of sudden, he has health again, and i'm thinking, who had Rez?!
---
After the fight, is when i realized it was hunter who had used FD.  thankfully, i said nothing in chat...so my embarrassment was all my own.
---
That is called kiting are you new to the game?

It's not so much that it's "intended", but more that people have literally been doing it for 15 years and Blizzard has never seen it as so game breaking that they should actually fix it in that entire 15 year period.
---
I type, on average, 65 wpm (probably faster for this because of muscle memory). It takes me about 7 keystrokes to upload a screenshot to Reddit (not including the title). The average word is 5 characters long so it takes me less than 2 seconds to finish. You could even configure it to go right to Reddit but it's fast enough without it. So you can't guarantee shit. You just aren't very good with computers.
---
People have been quitting, they are shrinking the number of layers
---
Heal all the tapping locks its invaluable!
---
Fuck the chir dips when selling hundreds of the same item cause selling in stacks wont sell.
---
My main worry with rerolling is "will i get bored?" doing the zones i done few weeks ago again. gotta try level the mage and see how it goes.
---
Yea, i went through 100 water as a shadow priest the other day in BRD... and i still had to borrow some from others by the end.
---
That's not fair, innervate is great to basically double one other healer on long fights :)
---
Certainly a pain that it's from the end boss that's for sure!
---
keyboard looks cute
---
Sorry I just respecced to arcane frost for raids, could you not make me feel bad?
---
thanks
---
Server?
---
Thank you.

?? not sure i follow

I'm glad you have enjoyed yourself friend, keep doing things the way you want to do em.
---
My healer got them lol, nah mine are way better for me. It’s the necromancer onces with 11in  12sta and 10 shadow damage if I’m not mistaken. I just wanted to bring light to this
---
Is it a need option if the Priest doesn’t have 300 Tailoring yet? All I’m saying is that it comes down to the fact that items worth multiple hundreds of gold that are BoE usually follow different rules than normally BoPs dropped from bosses.
---
51 Arms warrior, just spent my 11th fury point in piercing howl. It's awesome.
---
My question: Since I need to drop a point in either Improved Battle Shout or Enrage, which should it be?
---
I am assuming that 5% more melee damage is much better than the 5% more AP from shout when enrage is proccedn but I'm also assuming enrage doesn't proc that often dpsing in dungeons. Still, I do tank often and Enrage has to be better for that (and questing), right?
---
I'm leaning towards 5 points Enrage 4 points IBS.
---
And they told me alliance warlocks would coveted.
---
Feelsbadman
---
Because the timing on a renew vs shield is entirely different? I’ll cast renew at the beginning of the actual fight because the mobs hit so hard but if it isn’t costing me mana in the fight why not use all of my tools.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Just steam roll through one mob at a time until you get sweeping strikes and whirlwind, or you've got a full bar of rage to dump (which is super rare). The biggest tip I can give for generating rage is to not use heroic strike. Instead use sunder armor. Think of it this way. When you heroic strike, younsoend 15 rage, and you dont generate rage on your next auto. So the cost of it is actually like 30-35 rage per HS. Plus, It only takes like 2-3 sunders for most world mobs to be at zero armor, and then nearly all of your regular auto attacks will hit for nearly as much as a heroic strike on a fully armored target. So that's like heroic striking and generating rage; so that you can dump it on other things like cleave or WW.
---
Gonna try to level the mage and, lets see how it goes.
---
It’s not cool when you play with a mage and he pulls everything with no effort (but then he dies tho) and you struggle to taunt at least 1 mob from the pulled pack
---
Generally harder to play and the players that play for meters pick other classes with one button rotations.
---
Remember that those items are BoE and they will disappear eventually when their owners get better items and vendor them.
---
I knew i'd forget many things which should be mentioned and that is one of them, everything matters.

Look at his Profile and posts.
---
This is what I love to do and the damage gets mitigated between the two and the run is quite fast.
---
GM's dont know shit, I dont know why people in this sub regard them as trustworthy
---
I seriously doubt that most GM's even play the game
---
https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/25/wow-archivist-the-martin-fury-incident-friday
---
Oh no someone might say mean things about them on the internet.
---
You listed 5 classes as the ones everyone plays. If you are on horde, throw shaman in there because there are just as many as the other 5.
---
That’s 6 classes, out of 8 total available. Thats pretty good representation. Just druids and hunters are under represented.
---
/ plank ?
---
It will as time goes on and the player base becomes a higher average level.  Its still so early that the economy is wonky
---
Knowing when to AOE and when not is a hard lesson that every mage must learn by trial.
---
 But if in doubt, single target. In raids, always single target unless asked otherwise.
---
I always explicitly ask for chill groups and no gogogo mentality because I have no fucking clue where shit is in any of these dungeons. I havent been there in 10 years. Either other people navigate or we will have to explore.
---
&gt; The problem with Paladin is we really only get a few spells but lots of ranks of it, so downranking as a paladin is a necessity
---
I guess you could make that argument at low un-geared levels but paladin is the class you actually use your max ranks. We actually benefit a lot from using higher levels because we get Mana back from illumination. I used one step down ranks and current ranks until about level 35ish then went to mainly using the max ranks only. I keep a down ranked holy light for when a max ranks is too much but a flash isn't enough from splash damage but that's it currently (level 42). Haven't had any real Mana problems like I did at early level either. There were some fights (Herod and VC early on) where Mana was a problem but no fight now gets me below 50% unless I'm just spamming to be lazy. 
---
From my understanding and research in raids Mana is even less of a problem because you have a lot more crit. And looking at old healing meters or from p-servers paladins are MILES ahead on healing done over priest. This is because of the lack of Mana problems because we're getting all of it back on a crit, which we do a lot. Everyone tends just max ranks their spells.
---
I believe demo shout got nerfed.
---
I really don't want to sound callous, but it sounds like you just need better addons, or the group is underleveled, or maybe healing isn't for you.
---
With Grid + Clique, so long as the person tanking isn't a clothie and we didn't pull more than one group, I've generally not had any trouble healing ANY group as an enhancement shaman. I'm usually able to just auto-attack with Windfury most of the time and get groups down even faster. 
---
Good luck all the same.
---
I always wished that they actually added something to the major city bosses for loot. It's still pretty damn hard to get enough people together to do it and whatnot, it wouldn't have to be even gear. Something as a token or whatnot to say you did it would be fun. I remember taking part in a few of these and they were absolutely crazy. Took quite some time and tons of back and forth pvp trying to get the city leader down.
---
Again that duping problem was with a mount, not BIS gear. As someone above pointed out, they do sometimes go after the buyers too.
---
*rolls 99* “brb guys gotta do 49 jumping jacks”
---
I said we should remove rogues after the run jokingly, but after reading these comments, maybe I will. Then they will get ported out, and there's no incentive to leave the chest behind.
---
Sort of a slimy way to force them to share the chests. Play nice now.
---
I do kind of agree but if someone is not using the item it does not belong on need, sure you might decide on some custom rule for anything, but generally speaking.
---
Been playing everyday and when I was initially building my rogue I built into improved sap because I wasn’t sure how good the tanks and healers would be in classic. I respecced of course later down the line since all the tanks and healers I’ve had for dungeons have been great and any planned hard cc hasn’t been needed.
---
Oh...
---
I dunno man just get up and get a drink once in a while.
---
society is extremely ungrateful and entitled...case in point, A rogue overpulled questing and I proceeded to heal him through it and save his ass only for him to run to the next mob w/out any sort of thank you/interaction. wtf people suck
---
I really dont think anyone understands combat in the game. Correct me if I am wrong but- any melee unit should attack from behind to increase DPS. Not just backstabbing rogues. Why does everyone pull the bare minimum to where if I go behind our target Im going to pull tons if trash...
---
In-practice dps is always going to be subject to variables like spellpower, talents like Fire Power, mob resistance, ect. For what it's worth, that applies equally for Warlocks.
---
Sir, this is Wendys
---
I keep it as a habit, charge, rend, sunder, bloodrage, sunder, sunder, auto until dead. I don’t have MS yet.
---
Just found this on an old post 
---
“I believe it said "increases damage and healing by magical spells and effects UP TO x" meaning it was based on cast time. Where something like "increases shadow damage by x" would always be the full amount.”
---
He could just tank it with a 2h at that level jeez.

Dps should be standing behind the mob anyways to prevent parries
---
Man why do retail players constantly need to try preach about how hard their raids are. When will they realize that classic raids are easier yet still way more fun and rewarding. If anyone wanted a game to play purely based on difficulty, wow would be the least choice.
---
That's exactly what happened.
---
seconded, it's one thing they really got right. Loved facing off in 2v2's with my gf.
---
thats also a way to do it! Also ensures that youre always up to date on gear.
---
Had a guy during our ZF run go afk "brb 10 mins going outside with my wife" while we were stood by Sergeant Billy. Sergeant Billy and his friends got bored and hearthstoned away right in front of us, he came back after we realized we wouldn't be able to continue and hearthstoned ourselves.
---
I'd likely have two buttons assigned, one for non-pet attack Corruption and one for using the macro.
---
ClassicAuraDurations works for me, have you tried that?
---
This 100%  
---
Side note: No hunters, your pet is not a tank.
---
Nice way to put it! Thanks i will! Finally a place to call home, and not just say it this time, to "know it" this time.
---
Dancing reminded me of another mentionable i forgot and that is of clan mates, friendships which are forming through shared experiences. Another part of what helps you bond with your character in the memories you share with other players.
---
CS:GO and LoL are old people games as well. LoL based on a mod for Warcraft 3 originally ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense\_of\_the\_Ancients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients) )  and CS was a mod for the original Half-life. 
---
Fornite and Apex though are kids games.
---
no no no, the true mages blizzard any pack of 2+ mobs.  using spells like frost nova is only for if you are getting chased.
---
Ok. I was in the same area on my server and saw a Tauren hanging out, thought I might've seen you.
---
God no its horrible questing area every quest require long runs and often back to the same spot for the next part. It's honestly rather poor leveling experience. Also the level range is vast. From 14 to 27 or something crazy.
---
It's not like 2 level 120s are taking on a iLvl450 my dude. WeirdChamp
---
Run cath or quest until 41, then hit RFD.
---
I run up to dot and fear to help, then a cloaked rogue wrecks me
---
I meant when you are on the side of the valley, like coming from Camp Narache, or going to the dwarf digging
---
But Arathi is good also.
---
I didn't say these are bugs, it's just the last one I listed that might be a bug.
---
It's crazy how much different threat works in classic.
---
I feel like in retail I feel like you can basically just go balls to the wall right when the tank pulls and you're basically fine. 
---
Last night in SM I was still pulling aggro off tank every now and then as a shadow priest even after waiting for 3+ sunders and not going too ham.
---
Yes, it's a problem with how Blizzard implemented layoring.
---
I like the beasts in desolace
---
I mean, this person is complaining about queue times on a server they were allowed to free Xfer off of to play on a server with no queue times. There are actually almost 6,000 morons in that picture alone.
---
I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure certain skills require a dagger in your mainhand? Can someone confirm?
---
In an AOE run the tank IS NOT going to generate really any threat nor will the healer. This sounds like you have no idea what you are talking about. The threat will always be on the mages or Warlocks. If a warlock runs into then to try and “help” then they will die for nothing since the mages will gain agro.
---
Look at that, I learned something.
---
Strongest class when doing some very complicated exploit that give so minimal gain and some of it look like a bug, actually laughed while reading

I’ve had several boe and patterns drop in groups and we all followed the simple rule of everyone needs on blue boe and the patterns are need if you need.
---
Keep yer feet on the ground !
---
How’s it cheating if it’s in the game? Thousands of people abused layering to get camps to respawn or to escape ganks. Why aren’t they getting banned?
---
&gt;Whats the name of that auction house addon everyone uses?
---
The most common are Auctioneer and TradeSkillMaster.
---
&gt;Also what addon announced moves on your screen.
---
WeakAuras2
---
Certain circles? Thats disgusting! There are so many circle's though. Where? Which cycles?
---
Lies. Seems to be an agenda that the layering community is pushing so we all think Blizzard started taking action and we hush about it
---
I feel like this post was written by a rogue who hasnt specced anything yet ahah
---
Sap takes you outta stealth, stealth is slow..
---
But also no aoe, and daggers
---
Oh quit your bitching and move the fuck on. It's a piece of loot if it gets Ninja's that's part of the experience.
---
I know it doesn't mean much, but as someone who only ever main'd a rogue in Vanilla and now Classic, I would never assume a locked chest is mine in a grouped instance.
---
Mainly because it's one way to ostracize yourself from other runs by being 'that guy'.
---
But hey, other rogues want that chest and to upset 4 other PuGs, less comp for spots. Unless you're in a guild I wouldn't do it, and if you are, why are you in the PuG.
---
silly boy, us warlocks don't have arcane explosion.
---
As a mage, I hate all these images doing injustice to the rest of us. I literally wait around 5 seconds after tank gets hit before I start blizz and I top dps meter. And to the two other mages wonder how I am not pulling aggro ..idiots.
---
Bro. I just wish I took screen shots, if the warrior said he wanted it for gold for his mount while being lvl 46 would you feel the same? You don’t have to believe me since I didn’t take a screen shot but that was the excuse. He just wanted to sell it in the ah, they went on to nag my healer to put it on which he did instantly
---
Auctionator.
---
There might be a specific addon for warlock abilities, but Weak Auras should do the trick.
---
Oh I have custom themes off
---
Spirit is very good for warriors BEFORE level 30 because it adds a very strong regen (much stronger than other classes). However, this does not scale very well, and after level 30 its usefulness drops off very fast. If a warrior wants spirit or intellect, that's great for them, but I think it's ridiculous to need an item with int and spirit, when a caster needs it.
---
If the situation in SM with the necklace occurred, I would have checked whether the casters wanted it. If not, then I would have needed it if it was better than my neck. To be fair, necks are very rare at that level, and I myself have not found anything better than some shit like +4 STA myself.
---

There's zero defending this nonsense, it's lazy, inferior quality, and a slower process.

gz
---
lol blizzard gives one reason to bring a rogue into a group event and you don't want want to share their utility.  
---
I would boot your ass out of the group immediately.
---
Welcome to the life of a healer. I just sit and wait forever so hopefully they whack each one before I need to heal somebody. Undoubtedly I rip a mob off. Luckily my brother got consecration so at least the aoe threat seems to be working a lot better.
---
But I still rip shit off if I throw a big heal. Life of low levels lol
---
Rip im retarded
---
A mixed doing it with Hillsbrad
---
Nah, this awesome dude put it on himself and rezzed while we all ran back.
---
Hahahahahaha haha holy shit that got me
---
OP, you should be behind the target whether you are daggers or not. Mobs can't parry your attacks from behind.
---
Heathen.
---
Level 48 and 50*
---
holy shit y'all must be bored
---
&gt; Your party does not have to finish a pull at full HP. You will use a lot of mana trying to ensure this. Instead, move to the next pack, then ensure full HP bars.
---
Depending on how hard the instance is, this is a sure way to drive a tank completely mad. It's the equivalent to a mage starting to AoE just when I pull, with the difference that I'll happily let an overeager mage die, not so much my healer. Once all mobs run off towards the healer, mass taunt is the only chance I have to save that pull, and that's once every 10 minutes. Without getting hit, I'll never generate the threat on all mobs necessary to get them back. I'll chase one mob after the other, losing others in the mean time again, while the healer spams inefficient emergency heals to keep everyone alive. A lot of stress later we now wait longer for him to drink than if he had properly topped the group off before the pull.
---
Well if a fishin pole was the best weapon the druid had for tanking then i would agree with him, he really NEEDED that mace.
---
You were being incredibly selfish.
---
Don't you know how hard bag space is to come by at level 15? Here you are taunting these poor folk who are juggling which quest item to destroy offering them amazing food.
---
He got it and sold it for vendor, a guldy that was later kicked. I also forgot the mention the warrior wanted it for gold to get his mount. We are lvl 46 an up at this point.
---
For leveling, you should probably be in BM and bestial wrath will help with pet being cc'ed by gankers so I wouldn't bother with resist, just armor and Stam(armor is better because it makes mend pet more effective), just make sure to grab BW when you hit 40. When you hit 60, you should be repecing your pet for raids, i.e. fire resist in MC. For bgs I'd also respec to frost/ shadow resist but that's a judgement call based on what is causing you problems in the bgs.
---
It is their profession though. I’d say it’s theirs.
---
They took the time to level it, they get the loot for opening it.
---
You should probably replace it as soon as you can. I'm 27 and I don't have a single piece.
---
Well then it should be intact then shouldn't it.

Drunken Parrot was originally founded back in 2007 on the Stormrage server. We played the crap out of BC, WOLK, and Cataclysm ‘till most of us moved on to different games, and different life pursuits. A small core group of RL frainds have returned for classic, and we’re looking to fill our ranks with other awesome weirdo’s to share this experience with. We’re mostly middle aged with families/jobs/responsibilities and varying levels of general dysfunction (but in a fun way!). We don’t take this game (or much of anything, really) too seriously, we take our time, we level our fishing, we /dance and /cheer, we don’t much care about efficiencies or leveling guides, we make a lot of corpse runs, we level alts, we play solo, we play in groups, we make bad jokes, we make good jokes, we quote dumb movies, we are silly, we crack wise and act a fool. We are Drunken Parrot.

A few people like skarmtank were being so blatant about their cheating too. Him in particular was being overly smug about how easy it was to get away with.
---
Grats man
---
I look like this irl
---
Unless you have an addon that organizes AH prices by percentages it will always list whatever had the lower bid price first.
---
You can notice it yourself in high level areas. Similar amount of people when you /who a zone, yet you meet way more people that a week ago.
---
Oh yeah, if the tank pulls and I'm drinking, I keep drinking and go when I'm ready. Unless shit is hitting the fan, I won't  use innervate, mana gems and potions just because you can't wait.
---
Na, Kromkrush
---
Here is my trick.
---
I tell dps to kill casters first.  Mark them with skull.  I don't attempt to hit them at all. They die fast because they have no armor.
---
During that time I get aggro on the melee mobs.  By the time the caster is dead, there is no way to pull the other mobs off me.  This is very easy as a pally tank.  I just sit there and let the melee mobs hit me the entire time and that's how I build aggro.  So easy.
---
Yes, far from a personal best. 
---
I really sunk my teeth into pvp while leveling this time. From the lake in ashenvale that 1st night to the &lt; Countdown&gt; raid on redridge I really enjoyed it.
---
It was worth the extra few days /played
---
I feel like your at the same level as the average player tbh. Don’t worry bout it too much bud, it’s only the third week, you’ll get there ;)
---
Well, I had just played a Tauren and had some specific view in mind.
---
I've tanked a few dungeons. Just as long as you let the group know you got no idea where to go they haven't minded.
---
GM on Blaumeux as well (alliance). I don't recruit in chat because everyonr says the same shit. I try to find like minded people while questing or pvping. So far its just the group of friends from vanilla in the guild but all playing at different times. If you want to combine, we are a democratic guild. No one person making all the decisions. We are strictly Casual, not looking to be hardcore raiders. Likely just pug raids.

It's a manual from the bottom level of Booty Bay, far under the flightpaths.

Is this a picture of you, or your character? JP, Grats on getting 60.
---
*Christ* am I glad I play on the server I do if people actually play like that. ENTITLED? The hypocrisy... 
---
Entitled is thinking that you *deserve* someone else's BiS BoE because you can AH it. I've passed on fucking twink items so that someone could equip, worth hundreds of gold in a stable economy. I've passed on *heartseeker*. Because if someone needs, you give it to them. But that's entitled to you, what a joke.
---
buster was right
---
Blood fury
---
Berserking
---
Kinda works either way
---
I mentioned BiS because it proves fully that... you use whateverbumps up your str/agi stats. Im playing fury warrior and a good +agi piece drops? Im probably going to take that.
---
My beef is with them kiting it around the instance away from the group. I assume its new players who get in a pinch start kiting and forget there are 4 other people there. I have had to go and find where a hunter died in the instance a few times since I started playing classic.
---
It might be but i dont know why everyone seems to fish lolz. On retail theres barely anyone over the course of expansions
---
To add to this: If you’re on a PVP server then you should know Warriors aren’t particularly great 1vs1 against enemy players while levelling - unless it’s a Rogue you’re up against. The situation changes when you’re level 60 and geared though.
---
You just subscribe. 15$ for a month (or the other options)

Yeah damn. Tell that bitch to let you rock bro, my girl plays animal crossing as much as I play WoW. When it's time to clean, we both clean. When it's not, we both play our separate games and we are happy. 
---
For gods sake, she made you re roll, you got to 20, and now you're not allowed to play? Is she your mom?
---
Yes at lower levels it's bad to spam SA and you should use rend and heroric strike. Around 30 you should stop using HS and Rend and use SA, WW and maybe even Hamstring instead.
---
I had another warrior in my party who would charge after my bow pull, and aggro all the other mobs... like don’t you think I would be charging if I thought it was safe!?
---
Locked chests are there as an incentive to actually bring rogues along as they don't bring anything else to a 5 man party.

Attacking anything from behind takes block and parry off the table iirc. (For melee)

I played on a Dell Dimension 3000 (https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-dimension-3000-home/specs/) back in 2005 as a kid and I only had problems in ironforge before I upgraded the ram.

I dont think that you should have a problem with your pc on classic.
---
All cheats are “in the game”. Bugs, exploits, “clever use of mechanics”.

I personally think those people should also get banned but I’m sure so many people are doing it that they would need to ban too many people.

You never had the sadistic fun of dropping an Infernal in Crossroads or some Alliance equivalent.

Ever seen the beginning of Mobile Suit Gundam where they drop the space colony on Sydney? It's like that.
---
Sadly no, but that would of been good shit.
---
Maybe you can't. But I can. =)
---
Yeah i scrolled over the spells and i feel like they didn't say "so and so of shadow damage" like shadowbolt does
---
That's why i was wondering
---
Did you hold eye contact to assert dominance?
---
Bingo.
---
I do believe you that it is OK'ish on Warriors.
---
Then again I can't believe that it is anyway good.
---
The HP Regen only take affect outside of combat. So it literally only boosts the time you walk from one mob to another which will not take a lot of time off you because most of the times you will still have to eat as a warrior. 
---
Especially given the fact that if you go for a couple Points of Spirit you in return loose damage. Which will make you loose even more HP in a fight which will make you have to regen even more. 
---
I'm not saying it it useless to warriors. (Just like intellect) it is just not a stat that you aim for as a warrior. You take it if it is on your items from quests etc. but you will not roll for it.
---
I'd even say a couple of Points like +10+15+20 something like that would probably be really useful I agree but not by rolling on items that a caster could've used.
---
I think we agree in that Point then :P :)
---
Meanwhile the guilds that are clearing Molten Core already are just..... silent. They know their shit and they are all set.
---
I'd hate to miss out on late-prot goodies till 51. Consecration is great for grouping mobs up, but it costs a ton of Mana and offers no mitigation. I'd very much suggest a respec at 40.
---
No. Profession materials aren't the same thing as BoE greens, food, water, and potions.  
---
If rogues got poisons out of chests they unlocked, would anybody but other rogues want to roll for the items?
---
I didn't say it was bugged, just that one last bit of the post which is only partially related to spellbatching. No, the double-crit thing is a core part of spellbatching and is authentic Vanilla, and that's why people aren't getting banned for exploiting the game.
---
I've also been enjoying these super long quests that take multiple zones.  
---
Like I went from Ashenvale to Stonetalon and back...with 2 quests that are constantly throwing me to a different spot.  But everytime it is something new, seems like there are quests to do around that as well.
---
I finally finish it all up, sends me back to Tyrande to update her on the progress the Nelfs are having in Stonetalon.  Which is cool, I'm a little dorf priest that is helping the Nelf effort of expansion.
---
Did I get any loot?  ...not really.  Did I get some cash? That I did! Enough to nto feel guilty to buy a couple of stacks of Wool to finally get me over the wool to silk hump.  
---
It was awesome though, I'm now heading down towards 1k Needles and seeing about joining in the genocide of the Grimtotem.
---
I always assume that the camper just couldn't get a dungeon group

Not even close to being able to do MC buddy. FYI, I can always respec lol.
---
Problems arise if you don't have just 1-2 normal low lvl dungeon mobs. Then you have to be careful about your mana and can't just spam your small heals because you'll be OOM in no time. Besides, I might remember that wrong, but lvl 60 dungeons don't allow "zerging" anymore.

Scholo quest which starts at the entrance and fordring quest and the ony pre quest. Just for the items and attunements. Lorewise i cannot tell, never read a single quest.

TBH you don't need shield for all dungeons. My fastest Strat runs were so far with 1 or 2 warriors cleaving the shit out of it.
---
&gt;I wont let a fking tank stand there for 2 minutes  
---
No one is asking you to.  Don't be hyperbolic.  At most they are asking for a sunder or two.

&gt;Ill get threat either way.

Everyone gets threat.   Its a matter of how much and how quickly.

&gt;Almost only need tanks for bosses

Oh god.

Which server are you on and what is your player name so i can make sure to never, ever group with you in any 35+ dungeon?

This is such a uninformed retail thing to say.

MESSING WITH A HIGHER LEVEL GONE WRONG

Isn't it supposed to turn you green? Or was that added in later?

Druid healer through Wrath, currently around 22 and relearning how to heal as well.  I tend to throw a rejuv on the tank after they have agro, that's usually enough to get them through trash pulls at low levels.  I keep 2 ranks of HT on my bar, the highest and one below. Watch their health, if the rejuv isn't keeping up with the damage, use the lower level HT to catch them up to where it can get them above 50%.  Also, regrowth is an agro magnet when you first get it.  I keep that for oh shit moments when I need the big heal but want that extra time to cast.
---
Should be able to fix that by killing some pirates!
---
Why are you rolling on a PvP server in the first place then ?
---
It's fine not liking wPvP, but you just created your character on the wrong server.
---
That’s a good idea to add to the list! Gotta stay hydrated

Based Hunter Mastermind plants to seed of doubt to weed out other hunters who may camp his spawn. 300IQ move.

Ha, tell that to people on my server. They seems to think Deadmines can't be done without a Prot Warrior, Holy Priest, and 3 Mages.
---
I do IT for a trucking company. Can confirm the turnover is that high.
---
What level are you? 
---
For ZF farming Frostbite isn't an issue since you'll be AEing over blizzard any way. Just keep cock up for slow and don't use it as a damage rotation. 
---
Not sure past 52-54 but ZF gets you like 10 levels where the blizzard AOE spec isn't really needed.
---
Welcome to the Love Palace ;)
---
In Dreams is a cool quest chain, starts at 52. You might not finish until after 60, but it’s well worth the trip.
---
Fair, but I don't think that's how you use that meme; the cat is supposed to represent something innocent or irrelevant to the accusation.
---
Not so much as a guide but if you go to sixtyupgrades com it will show you bis gear and if you click on them you can see other gear in order.  When selecting the items you have the option to go to wowhead where you can collect the information on like where it is from and how to acquire.  Sixtyupgrades also does this. Little by saying if it is from a quest or dungeon drop etc.
---
Yikes. There's not a lot you can do there. You must've done well enough if there wasn't a wipe!
---
&gt;Test of Faith
---
Infamous would be more like it.  The rewards from the quest are minor.  The biggest draw to the chain is a lot of lore and sight seeing.  You will travel a lot and not get much financial or loot reward.
---
That cycle is never ending. Though I don't kill lowbies if I dont have to. Prefer a fair fight in my level bracket

I mean, if you're fighting next to it I'm still gonna tap it once for the level. #sorrynotsorry

Good. If you did this fuck you die. Trash.
---
Remindme! 3 hours

Those squats are ridiculous bro, like 100+ squats every time you die at max level. Ppl gunna die IRL lul
---
As an undead priest there is nothing more fun than drowning alliance players doing underwater quests with mind control.

Mostly it’s similar level characters so it gets even better when they try to fight back on the water. Between unending breath and levitate you have such an advantage.
---
Frontstabbing is definitely removed? That really sucks but I guess it was janky. Swords is the only really good leveling spec then.
---
Lvl 41 ATM. My max Pyro crit is around 850 and max fireball crit is around 750. 
---
Tack on 4 ticks of 50 from Pyro DoT and 40% from ignite, and it's around 340 more damage than Fireball for 20 extra mana.
---
How did they find out?
---
Unless you're an indian mage, then you just need your hand.
---
The raid dungeon thing is meh to me. Those people would have been 60 a day later or so with out the "exploit". Many legit levelers got there shortly after, it wasnt that big of a deal.
---
The instance layering people though. They can DIAF (to use an old vanilla term) as far as I am concerned. Exploiting the economy effects the game for an entire server, not just the gear on a few dozen guildies. When you negatively effect the game for thousands of people, you shouldnt be allowed to participate in said game any longer. I hope with bans and the removal of gold the economy will recover quickly.
---
No you
---
No you both
---
Did you expect order or rational decisions from someone who takes a picture of their screen?
---
Get a little spell power.
---
Even 40 or so will go a long way, that that can be easily achieved with just a few cheap items of nature's wrath (cloak, bracers, boots, etc.)
---
And get a good shield.  It will make your life easier.  Stat priority should be SP, Int, then Stam/Spirit.
---
Oh it definitely does!

lol just transfer

Your kit is what got you invited so your kit is to be used for the good of the party, not for yourself as an individual. If you would've informed me up front, I wouldn't have brought you to begin with so the if a rogue in my party ever pulls that crap, he's out. It only takes one message in /1 atm to fill that spot right back up.
---
&lt;The Deathstalkers&gt; has more rude people than just the GM, sorry if you get any flak from their name being close to yours. I'm on Grobb and I'll definitely keep in mind that it's very specifically &lt;The Deathstalkers&gt; who are the douchebags.
---
Truth
---
let it die from monster so its durability hits 0. Hopefully he will get stuck trying to kill monsters
---
Green mobs my dude. Find and do green quests. After 44 burn ZF runs. Then Mara/ temple/ BRD. BRD till 58 LBRS till 60. When not running dungeons do green quests. The XP per kill will be less but you won’t miss and mobs will die WAY faster. Good luck.
---
I am on Alliance and have never offensively attacked a Horde player.  I often get ganked by higher levels and groups, but usually never by Horde of my same level and when they are alone.  So that we can all get our quests done peacefully, I usually help Horde kill mobs if they look like they are having trouble as a gesture of good-faith.  Just a couple days ago, in the Hinterlands, I saw the streamer TimTheTatman (I am on Faerlina) fighting a turtle boss on the beach, and he was about to die and I saved him.  I was the only Alliance player on the beach, but everyone mostly left me alone.  I think building a reputation not only within your own faction but even among the other faction members can be important.  Also, just look at things as a moral decision.  Someone is just trying to quest, minding their own business, using their presumably valuable time to play.  Don't waste your own time and their time by killing them, its just the wrong thing to do.
---
but at the end you rode the frostwolf howler which was a free ish epic mount from getting av exalted.
---
In the first case, wouldn’t it be bette to switch to shield block right after the charge? Then you’d get a revenge in right away on the primary target. Otherwise, it seems like it would take too long to build enough threat before dps can safely unleash.
---
It lasts 18 seconds. So when that’s in cd what you’re saying doesn’t apply. So go ahead and git gud and get engi like a good player.
---
I just did, downloading the game now. Thanks!!
---
Next up some loser will say that better players are exploiting because they're better.
---
Pretty much any guide like this is going to include dungeon gear. I doubt one that is just quests exists.
---
You have a valid argument but there are still holes here.
---
You are using British and US currency as an example but it doesn't work here.   There would have to a calculated exchange rate then if you were to bring move gold from one game to another.  The economic value of gold is much different between the two games.  How do you think they would be able to create a constantly changing exchange rate?  
---
For example; 3 retail exchange to 1 classic gold
---
And even then it would be super difficult to put a exchange on it.  Different farming methods, different item value, different quest reward increase..  the list goes on and on.
---
It simply doesn't work
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Possibly
---
As a mage, I've never seen a partial resist, ever
---
Yea... It's basically a brand new game. We will run into the same problem a year from now..in classic
---
I got majorly lucky on a lockbox from Scarlet Monastery and got the formula for Enchant Shield - Lesser Block. There were a couple copies on the AH on my server in the 150g-200g range. How would you go about using this? Should I go with Enchanting (had previously been considering dropping my second prof) and actually use it, sell it now for market value, or hang onto it for a while? My understanding is that the formula is pretty useful at endgame but there's a limited endgame market at this point. Maybe value will increase as more guilds get into harder end game content? I haven't had a boon like this before so I just really want some advice on how I should handle it.
---
These show warriors on top, but everyone is saying warriors need gear... yet they are on top. This is why I'm asking.

My girlfriend and I are heavy into fairly rough BDSM, so we've had "slave training" resulting in her pretty much outclassing 99% of porn-actresses out there at BJs.

For some reason it still takes me anywhere from 10-30 minutes to nut from a BJ, it's like there's a mental block or something.

Not a positive thing, the courteous thing to do is to nut as fast as possible.

You know, so she gets her daily allowance of proteins.

Hahahaha nothing worse when there is a banana or a watermelon left in one
---
If you went engineering there would be no issues because you could simply unsheep your pet. Instead you’re blowing training points on resists.
---
Wipe? Lol. Have you been doing anything at 60? If we need somebody we can just summon a guild member. Every BRD, Ubrs/Lbrs, Strat, and Scholo run I've done at 60 has been a giant AOE fest. The stuff is way easier than PS or my memory of original vanilla. 
---
Rogues arent exactly making the runs go faster. Sort of doo doo in the AOE department. If they don't open chests, they are contributing even less.
---
This is fine to do in a sense.   You always want the best weapon you can get in hand during leveling.  Even if you have max sword spec you still want to fill your hands with the best weapons available while you are leveling because the only time sword spec reall matters is in long boss fights where you can get a lot of procs.
---
There's exactly one quest you can do in Arathi at level 30, though.
---
....and it's pretty much the only Alliance quest there until the elite ones at 38+.
---
How do you mute yourself.
---
as much as it sucks i suggest you just level as ret
---
consecration is so expensive it sucks anyway , i guess you can down rank for tanking but pally tank leveling ia prob going to be a bad time
---
*laughs in hunter*
---
Ah, I see. Seems like the majority consensus is that "layer-hopping" won't be banned for world play. It'll be interesting to see what Blizz does about it though.
---

I see a lot in the starter zones, but that level 10 to 20 push is brutal. Even after cat form they're not an easy class to play.
---
Cringe
---
Shadoweave is just flat-out bad compared to Felweave or Robe of Winter Night, but even in the latter case it's probably better to get Robe of the Void and level up tailoring yourself. Shadoweave is basically a leveling stopgap at best.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/ is a decent site. There are a few things I could conceive of as errors in a mathematical sense, but it gives an intuitive and very comprehensive info chart for all class BiS gear in various phases (1 is the tab you want now, since 2 includes DM and BG gear).
---
Both are valid options? Guess it will depend on the server. Having a dialog before people roll should solve how you act in each case.
---
Don't bullshit your party... I was in one the other night and stocks and said "2 min I need a drink" I come back to a mage trying to give me water and someone commenting my mana was full.

No my bourbon and coke was empty guys...

Plenty of people complaining about performace issues on curseforge and there has been no update for a month. Questie has been updated yesterday and there are less people complaining about performance using it.

The item in TBC was different, materials are different.

And the image is from Patch 1.12.0, but the guy wrote that it was due to a wrong item restoration from a GM.
---
Nope, not required.
---
Here's your general strategy: For a single mob just frontloading some damage in the form of a judged seal should be good enough. You should have ret aura and righteous fury up. For two you're probably looking at judging target number 2 and autoattacking the primary target. For three you're looking at the same thing but being ready to stun the first mob that pulls away, which by the way isn't a forgone conclusion if you have enough mitigation to allow your healer to not have to heal you too much.
---
&gt; pedantic
---
Just saw that episode of Family Guy huh?
---
Agreed. While leveling I largely stay within my armor bracket. At level 60 unless you are a tank, armor is largely irrelevant. It stinks but clothies will always have the most competition for gear. +Int gear can be effectively be used by 5 classes. (With that said main spec&gt;off spec)
---
&gt;You don't have to chase them. In low/mid lvl dungeons there really is no need for 100% tanking   
---
As a current tank and end-game tank in vanilla, this is true BUT it's a bad habit to get into.  Its best to develop the skills to 100% tank just for the practice for raids later.  
---
&gt;It's also not the healers job to waste mana on them, and if they can't handle it without heal let them die   
---
Agreed.
---
I did this in good ol vanilla. Only named Nazdregsux and died infront of org AH. Was there in the door opning for a month. I recived a 3 day ban. So worth it. Nazdreg was getting whispers asking why he sucked &lt;3

I'm just trying to play the fucking game but I can't mention prot without "suboptimal bUiLd ThO" I don't care.

Adding a space before the hashtag looks fine for me but i am using the old reddit.

Yes, and Corpsemaker is good enough until 37. That's why the WW axe isn't worth it.

It had the potential for sure, but if the community actually starts using the whole system as designed the problem is alleviated. 
---
I don’t think ninjaing is going to be incredibly common and if anyone ninjas they deserve whatever punishment is sent their way. 
---
I just don’t like the idea of needing and then hoping the guy who “won” will give it to the guy who actually needs it. If everyone is doing things right all these situations are avoided. 
---
Long story short people should stop sucking because abusing a system to prevent others from abusing it isn’t a real solution.
---
Stolen*
---
Will I need artisan skinning to skin max level mobs?
---
Yeah I noticed this hard with Ashenvale in early night elf lands. Darkshore is fine as immediate progress, but even though Ashenvale is theoretically level 20 I think you probably shouldn't really try to do it serious til level 24 or so. You're probably better off with Stonetalon PAST the Ashenvale, or just catching a boat to the other continent and hitting up the low level zones there, even if it involves some spook in the Wetlands to do so.

Alliance ganking --&gt; Delete character
---
I'm at work and not going to dig through blue posts for you but you're deff wrong.
---
They said they were opening up more layers during the initial launch to reduce queue times. 
---
Having everyone at max level does nothing to reduce the "clusterfuck." It just moves the clusterfuck from low level zones to high level zones. They are removing layering in phase 2 because they expect the population to decline to a point where it would be reasonable to do so. 
---
10k in one layer would be absolute insanity no matter what level everyone is
---
Bad habits people picked up in retail, I suspect.
---
Huge chunk for me is that Retail, you're considered to be the BIG SUPER HERO... but in Classic you're just a scrub working your way up.
---
I help horde kill mobs that are about to kill them then they heal and gank me
---
I  could, but in all honesty it’s my work computer, I’m lazy, and I’m just 2 more week$ away from my new rig.  My mouse is set up for the game, but I haven’t done anything for the keyboard.
---
Really dont know how those aq+ encounters are going to turn out. Back then I went oom in the learning phase. Will see
---
I’d agree, but also bear in mind with the extra cost needed for each level in terms of number of xp, completing yellow/orange quests can be beneficial in getting you more xp at a lower level
---
I was doing a little research last night, what is it about firefins? Fire oil isn’t used in too much, is it all just for those fire resist potions and firepower?
---
Let the rogue have it. If there are multiple people that can unlock the chest, let them roll on it. No one else is entitled to it. 
---
Seriously, I've never played a rogue and this has always been the etiquette. They leveled their lockpicking, not you. No one gives a shit if they "wouldn't have gotten there without a group," this is literally the same as mining/herbalism/skinning in dungeons. You don't roll on that either, it's essentially another profession.
---
it's only stupid if they fuck up.
---
Wtf. How old do you have to be to handle this game?
---
I had two separate regular level appropriate group dungeon runs of Deadmines where Smite happened to drop the 2H mace. Both times someone else accidentally Needed, the second time we had discussed that I was to be the only need if I joined the group. Ass loads of work and time up in smoke. I just let it go, however I was really fucking pissed. I continued on with the runs and did my duties without shrieking. I was so pissed, when one guy tried to give me gold I just canceled the trade window.
---
Whatever. I bought killmaim for 1.2g and sort of moved on (ran dm five more times, fucking thief blade each time).
---
No I'll just take them without asking lol
---
Care to explain why you don't care?
---
EU.
---
I'd change but I only have a couple of friends and they're not budging, plus after being stuck on dead servers on retail (even after moving several times... I've had multiple die over time) Im a bit paranoid.
---
Thankfully I make good use of teamviewer and can log in whenever I want from work!
---
It doesn't matter what material its made of. The only difference is armor and hunters don't need armor.
---
Fuckin Classic!!!
---
BRD gates plus shadowforge lock are pretty easy once you get to 250 though by that point you can also open heavy junkboxes which were how I ultimately hit 300. Just make sure you pickpocket every 52+ mob you can, or if you're lazy just install a fast-autoloot addon like Leatrix plus and macro pickpocket onto all of your stealth openers.
---
Same here man, I also had 225 alchemy/herbalisn at lvl 35.

---
Just be me and forget to turn off autoloot before unlocking, then when you unlock and auto loot everything, apologize and offer to trade it all over to whoever won the roll. They almost always say nah it's cool just keep it. lol
---
Ok? What does that have to do with opening chests in dungeons?
---
They occasionally do some questing.
---
Me jokes.
---
One gets applied before taxes, and the other after taxes.
---
Soooo what’s the trick ?
---
&gt; In the first case, wouldn’t it be better to switch to shield block right after the charge? Then you’d get a revenge in right away on the primary target. 
---
The reason for that is: There are 3 mobs attacking you. It's very likely you're going to proc Revenge for free anyway. (The more incoming attacks, the more likely your character will block/dodge/parry one of them).
---
If you Shield Block (10 rage) to proc Revenge, and your character decides to block/dodge/parry on his own 1 second later, then you wasted 10 rage on the Shield Block.
---
---------------------------------------------------
---
Look at this:
---
You charge in and Shield Block (10 rage) and Revenge (5 rage).
---
I charge in and Sunder Armor (15 rage).
---
We both used 15 rage to generate aggro.
---
BUT your Revenge is on cooldown, and my is ready.
---
So after 2 secs, if we both get a Revenge proc and we both have 5 rage total, I can cast Revenge, while you can't.
---
So in this 4 seconds fight, you only used one Aggro ability, and you have rage that you didn't spend. While I used 2 aggro abilities and I maximized my aggro usage.
---
This is my logic behind my abilities choices.
---
I only use Shield Block when we are against one mob only, because it's very unlikely I gonna proc Revenge with just one guy attacking me.
---

I dunno.  Vanilla WoW had several million players, and most of them were max level.

Plus, there's always leveling alts, etc.

I only do this when there is nothing to LOS on. I will kick and pull mob to tank.
---
I am on a pvp-rp server and have tried doing some cross faction rp. I am level 30 now and have had very few successful encounters, usually I just get killed on site. I have given up entirely on cross faction rp now though and go out of my way to kill horde now. a good horde is a dead horde.
---
Shout out to my guildie then. I too, sometimes help the Alliance. Unless them or some other ally rustle my jimmies.
---
My friends are gonna have hench butts.
---
All the rogue has to do is kick one cast then it goes into the group... as a mage, I would gave to stop casting in order to counterspell, where a rogue can kick while still maintaining damage output.
---
Zones have a cap on the max skill you can gain.  For starting areas I believe it's 75, so at some point you will have to move on.
---
Yeah if you have a tank and healer MENTALITY. 
---
I cannot tell you the amount of times an spriest or enhance shaman has let me die because they are far too concerned with putting up decent numbers.
---
If you said you were going to heal and tank please just heal and tank.
---
Yup had this happen a few times....was like well I guess f me then, and just moved on lol
---
I am not a fishing expert, but I have read that it is just number of fish caught. I am not sure if the level of the fish actually matters, only that you catch a fish. I somewhat tested it by fishing at 200+ briefly in ratchet and gained levels in about how long it took elsewhere. But not complete verification.

Good work. I was able to convince *most* of my friends to come to Faerlina as well, but not all of them. I wanted Faerlina because that's where my entire guild is. Deff makes it easier without a guild, but you're lucky all your friends were so amicable
---
I enjoy world pvp even without the rewards, but man horde on bigglesworth just run away, just yday me and my brother who are both level 56 priest and rogue, land in tarren mill and save a group of people from a 60 rogue and a few of his lackeys. We kill the 60 turn around and literally everyone just ran away instead of helping so we evnded up being wittled down. Why play on a pvp server if you don't wanna pvp. Also if its bc you don't have honor why the fuck doyou need a reward to enjoy something in the game.
---
Start trading them, that stops the mining ;) repeat until they surrender
---
&gt;Seaforium charges gained the ability to open chests and lockboxes in patch 2.1.0.
---
You must have many friends with that attitude.
---
One of them was a well known consequence of layering, the other was a massive bug that blizzard did not foresee.

Hold up party I've got to do 67 jumping jack's for winning that roll for whitemane chapeau over our healer.

---
Honestly we have always rolled for them but I think I would be okay giving one to the rogue for his hard work
---
A lot of the useful macros that worked on vanilla servers involving variables unfortunately don't work in the current game.
---
You sure can. And if you play on multiple monitors, use `ctrl + alt + prntscrn` to only take the screenshot of the active window, and save it to your clipboard
---
Well PvP is already around and well. I kill and get killed everyday while questing... and it’s amazing :)
---
I only call it garbage because the people who made those addons actually learned the abilities and know what they do and when to use them and if they can do it everyone else should be able to read abilities and know when to use them :)
---
I just pick it and move my character as soon as the animation is finished so I dont actually loot the chest.
---
Nah, if he was a hypocrite, he would fly off into the distance after telling you to keep your feet on the ground.
---
&gt; Sweve that exploit xp to get to 60 asap then exploit bosses to get gear faster.
---
Its funny because nearly everyone who is actually doing this are **RETAIL** players playing Classic.
---
Probably because they can interupt spells with kick, gauge, stun and that caster mob does no damage/healing.
---
Great guide, used it for a few levels in the 20's but to anyone still looking for leveling resources like this remember we're not in retail, doesn't have to be a race to cap to farm some time gated nonsense to feel competitive in pvp or raids, I've had a lot more fun running around blind and leveling a bit slower than I was trying to follow the guide and be efficient. 
---
We're all responsible for getting what we want out of classic, if you want to really experience the exploration and guesswork and weirdness of early wow using a guide like this might not be for you, if you just wanna level quickly and catch up with your buddies or get to a specific dungeon/raid it really is incredibly helpful.
---
Yeah, level 42ish was frequently when I was like 'eh, I'm tired of this character, let me reroll'
---
Boy, is it awkward because you were *way* off. The addon is "Perl Classic Unit Frames."
---
Now apologize to them for being an asshole.
---
If you can't at least 1v2 the majority of classes as a warlock you need to reroll.
---
Just wait until you get a Traveler's Backpack
---
Nothing wrong with that, if it was me, ill just state im needing it, so the team can decide whether they need or greed!
---
As my party and I fought stitches last night I started googling if someone had gotten stitches into stormwind before. This answers my question, ty
---
How much you at?
---
Neither would I too be honest. If that makes me a bad person so be it.
---
preach
---
Basically you could respawn bosses in a dungeon on repeat and kill them for loot and money (the ones that drops rare recipes and such).
---
Ah if that's the case I wasn't aware.. I can only speak from personal experience having zero issues since launch. I just find the spawn points and mob level range much easier to read on Codex.
---
It’s pretty fun ngl. I did it for a few hours until people started /saluting me. Then I would let the salute people thru. Idk if they were sharing that info on their side, but I suspect they were.
---
&gt;Layering doesn't effect how many people a server can support.
---
Yes and no. You're looking at this with a closed mind. If there are too many entities in the same spot, it can give the server trouble. If you remember, back in WotLK, the sheer amount of people in Wintergrasp would crash the server sometimes.
---
But you're correct about the distributing. The world itself of Vanilla isn't designed to handle 5,000 players distributed between the 6 starter zones. That's one reason why layers are capped at 3,000, to reduce this effect.
---
&gt;Instead you have a few hundred people spread across a dozen layers.
---
Layers are capped at 3,000, not a few hundred. And layers are continent-wide.
---
That's literally the opposite of what I'm suggesting. 
---
Look, all I'm saying is, I hold threat easily, don't take damage, and have relatively little downtime. With consecration, I had more downtime and generated less aggro on bosses. I can't swear my way is the best, but I think I'm checking all the boxes for successful tanking right now, and I often tackle content I'm underleveled for, so I must be doing something right.
---
Most dungeons I’ve run, X is the second target to focus. Also blue square is freeze trap for hunters.
---
charge + hamstring + intercept is a hell of a drug
---
Nop
---
Try going to System Settings -&gt; Advanced and enabling the option for "Reduce Input Lag"  
---
If that doesn't help you can try installing the "Advanced Interface Options" addon which has an option you can enable to have abilities be cast immediately when you press the key down (rather than the default which is having them activate when the key is released)  
---
You can download it through the Twitch app, or from here directly https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/advancedinterfaceoptions
---
At the risk of sounding like im judging op, he has shift 2 (one of the most accessible keybinds) as resurrection
---
It’s not in game. You need an add on. I use miks scrolling battle text, which gives you heal text but is also a much nicer ui for damage as well.
---
How is the picture from 1.12 when the item was added into the game files in 1.13?
---
At 37 I'd say STV easy. You'll crush the first half super quick since you'll be a little high at first. They give decent rewards too. 35 silver - 1 gold ish items. Sell and bank all quest rewards, once your about halfway done STV you'll have saved/made like 20g easily without any lucky drops or a whole lot of green drops. STV is also crazy good if u have skinning, AH heavy leather on faerlina is like 80 silver per 20, and even if you don't feel like doing that they sell for like 30 silver to vendors.
---
The orange moon always been sap for me. X is kill this thing after skull.
---
I leveled to 60 mainly AoE farming on Firemaw EU as Horde. I dinged 2 days ago. So yes, it is still very possible, though I won't lie to you—my best grinds were in the small hours of the night.
---
I say mainly because it does get old at points, which is when you sprinkle in some questing or a dungeon or two just to avoid your brain becoming mush.
---
You, I remember you, from the mountain..
---
Did I say that? You realize there's a message that pops up when someone gets loot out of a chest that tells you the loot right?
---
Shoutout to pickpocket runs
---
A macro is a series of commands in order how of they are entered. 
---
Let’s take for example, my really simple macro to equip my Whirlwind Axe.
---
The macro is just called Arms, and has the symbol of crossed sword. These are just so you can tell what they do at a glance. 
---
When you create the macro you choose that name and symbol and save it, then you go the bottom of it after you select said macro and begin typing in its “code”.
---
In my case, it’s one line. 
---
“/equip Whirlwind Axe”
---
/equip is the keyword, and the item that comes after it is the name of the item in question. 
---
If I set up multiply /equip in the same macro I can put on a entire set of armor in one press.
---
The punishable part of it is another player coming out and killing him
---
Lol dps metering SM
---
If someone levels up blacksmithing and creates keys, do you think that person should let everyone roll on his key?
---
On that note- Dont try to play outside your spec if you dont have the gear for it. 
---
if you are playing shaman as a tank- have a shield, and a dagger/mace, and stamina focused gear. 
---
if you are a shaman playing as a healer, Have a Stave, and a ton of INT/STAM
---
trying to heal in full dps gear will end poorly. Also know the dungeon you are doing. E.G. Shaman healer SUCKS for SM CATH farming before level 40. If you pull 2 sorcerers, theyll blast your group down too fast for you to cope with since you have no AOE or Hots at that level.
---
Sap secondary target, lol
---
I just thaw them out...
---
They taste better quicker that way.

Are you interested in our premium snap chats? We even have a special *mayonnaise only* section for exclusive members ;-)
---
Now's a good time to start grinding Scarlet Monastery - take your pick of the wings.  Be sure to pick up the quests for in there.
---
As for out in the world, I would go to Swamp of Sorrows followed by Badlands.  Disclaimer:  I play PvE so PvP leveling meta might be different.  Grinding dungeons seems to be a good strat to avoid gankers.
---
I will for sure spec into overpower:)
---
I can try the sunder tech one more time with this new knowledge and see if I feel it
---
This makes me super curious as to what the other bug is. These little oddities are generally pretty interesting.
---
Ima get so fuckin jacked
---
They damn well better
---
I thought it was an unspoken rule that nobody talks in lfd groups.
---
Where did you grind?  badlands? Swamp of Sorrows?
---
I feel the same way with Alchemy.  Upvoting for a solution.
---
That is such a false comparison because anyone who wants ore could level mining themselves. Unless you want to imply that a party of 5 rogues is on par with a regular tank/heal/dps comp, you can't blame me, a warrior tank, for thinking a class' skillset isn't just there to aid the player personally.
---
Furthermore, it is generally assumed (though often done incorrectly) that a miner is also a blacksmith/engineer, hence having a reason to need the ore. A chest's content is purely economic 99% of the time though, so its everyone's business.
---
"A hallucination? What are you hiding?"
---
yea thats fine, but the named quest mobs EVERYONE is going for still have the 10 minute respawn. they both need have parity
---
Pagle is really nice. Minimal to no queues while also marked as Full. I was torn between Pagle or Westfall but I chose Pagle in the end.
---
Also known as Neptune's Nuzzle in some circles.
---
I'm glad I read this early on. There has been times where a good PW:Shield is just what the doctor ordered though. Almost out of mana....just enough left to cast 1 spell....Tank about to go down....
---
You could respawn bosses inside a dungeon to kill them on repeat.
---
Was mostly going along with the joke, and I do realize that you have a ton of survivability in any paladin spec for leveling, but the “what’s REAL booty” about leveling a holy paladin is it’s even slower than ret, which is already slow enough to make you contemplate jumping off the nearest cliff during every leveling session.
---
Last night I invited a mage to our group. Immediately upon entering the dungeon he started pulling mobs and yelling for bubbles and heals. I said "please let the tank pull, 2 people aren't even here yet. wait for the rest of the group to get here."
---
He ignored me, and started pulling again...
---
Then he finally stopped pulling mobs and started drinking. I asked him for some water and he said "5 silver per stack". I asked if he was joking and he said "now it's 10s a stack".
---
I booted him from the group, put him on ignore. He was replaced within 10 seconds by someone that wanted to work as a team. The rest of the dungeon went smoothly.
---
I had the luxury of grinding through STV with two friends which made the questing and grinding experience a bit more enjoyable. PvP was manageable and as a priest, having them deal the damage while I healed was ideal. 
---
I've found as you get to the 50s range (At least on my server) PvP is a bit more passive as people are trying to just quest and hit 60. Whenever PvP is not on my side I tend to just stick the bushes and finish my quest without being spotted or simply move to a different area of the zone to find less hostile horde.
---
Mage envy, mmmm
---
And this is how we ended up with Trump.
---
To be fair, if you're not any good at pvp, you'll be getting farmed at 60 as well.
---
It’s really not worth it, i was able to get all the tusks at lvl 32 but the charms are dropped by lvl 40 mobs which are being farmed by higher lvls of both factions and require pvp to even hold the spot. Just wait until you can farm sm arm for ravager.
---
 You could respawn bosses inside a dungeon to kill them on repeat.
---
I've always thought skull is "don't touch".
---
didnt realise, thanks
---
gotta admit, all this information makes me want to play tank myself, haha
---
I guess I'm just far more forgiving of others in this game because if someone didn't want to give buffs for whatever reason I'd just think hmm that's weird whatever lets move on.
---
&gt; theyre gen Z(or fornite gen)
---
They are called Zoomers, zoomies or zoombots, granpda.
---
That is Mulgore, hands down. No questions asked.
---
My bank alt is a tailor/enchanter and I've been leveling professions up by hanging out in razor hill, advertising free cloth armor, 6 slot bags, enchants, and wands to all the lowbies running around.
---
We've gotten quite a few people to join the guild as a result.
---
How do I complete escort quests in a group? We all get the quest, but only one can complete them
---
Looking at the leveling distribution on various servers.. most people take their time or are alt a holics.  People do seem to be taking their time.
---
I think the biggest groups are around 20 to 30.
---
if this is true (which it almost certainly is not) why do you think they wouldn't get banned? Blizzard is clearly able to tell who has and hasn't done this. They will deff ban Venruki if he did it
---
Do you tank? Do you heal? I find people are more willing to swap if you're competent, play an integral role, and are social. I get a much warmer reception playing as my warrior vs playing as my rogue.
---
Blizzard's minimum specs for Classic are literally a PC from 2008. Most likely whatever you have will be fine.
---
I work out 3 days per week.....it is still a good idea to do something while sitting stationary
---
Good in PVP from what I understand, but yeah, terrible mana issues in raids.  I would be interested in anybody can make it work though!  More laser chickens!
---
Ahh gotcha, yeah that makes sense i can see how you thought i was talking BiS
---
And yeah i'm a slow leveler so i don't really have issues waiting tbh
---
&gt; paladin just refused to heal us, becouse" im ret

i want to make a shaman, but im worried about mana regen? is running out of mana a problem for shamans?

It's "Perl Classic Unit Frames"! Do enjoy!

Also, u/hoarsehorace owes you an apology. LOL.

Oh shit, that def deserves some kind of ban.  Thanks for letting me know!
---
arathi is also an option, lots of quests there.
---
Very true. Druid tanks have little mitigation and are great in 5 mans. But in raids feral druids are kept around as off tanks and dps as needed.
---
It's the "Druid bad"  mentality. 
---
I've been playing one and loving it.
---
That I what I used to do but I did not feel it sort of. Meaning. It felt better with swapping out sunder for HC. But....
---
^ this, if you took the talents to keep rage between stances you'll switch to beserker with a perfect 25 to WW and I'd basically ue
---
But if there wasn't a tank, a healer, and two other DPSs, would they even reach the chest?
---
As a warrior tank to all rogues.
---
 I dont care about your expose armor. 
---
But please. PLEASE  dont slap that on a boss,
---
 Else i cant stack sunder, wich gives a higher armor reduction over time, and is one of my highest threat builders. 
---
Tired of trying to sunder a boss and getting the message "A more powerfull spell is active"  while mine is stronger after 2 charges.
---
Thank you
---
Sorta off-topic. 
---
Does anyone have any mouse recommendations? I want like minimum 4 side buttons to keybind
---
Love how the suggestions are non-chalant rather advanced for the stereotypical gamer. People will be surprised how much they can accomplish just by not setting low expectations from the start.
---
So I said to my group, BRB boss needs a phonecall, because I'm "working from home".
---
They carried on without me, and then complained when they received no heals and wiped us.
---
Forget all these other people giving you wrong answers. What you want, my friend, is [BaudManifest](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/baud-manifest), the world's greatest bag mod. It's a list-based mod where you have nested text inside of custom categories. [It looks like this](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/100/321/main.jpg) and it's the best thing ever.
---
Yeah, as a warrior, I've always refused to tank for a group if its a DPS warrior looking for tank like, sorry, I'm not going to struggle through this garbage, just so your scrub lazy ass can roll need on all of the armor upgrades.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
But it is sooooooooo freaking true.  &lt;long tirade of why to follow&gt;  Not really.
---
I have found that there is almost no rhyme or reason to mob levels. There are level 38 mobs directly beside levels 31s in desolace. The quests are also very spread out and seem to give you two at a time. Then when you expect a follow up quest after a turn in you get nothing and think we'll shit is that it? Finding a good area to quest has been a challenge for me since I feel like after the Barrens there are like ten quests per zone.
---
Some of my fondest memories of wow classic are seeing 40 year Olds go fucking ballistic and write down someone's name to get revenge after being  camped.
---
Huehuehue, little do you know brother.  All the interactions you weren't craving are all here!  People talk to each other, spend time doing things together.  No more grind out your dailies and log off, it's quality time... time.
---
I'd rather have a gold in game than a gold on the reddit
---
Button on Heartseeker &lt;--
---
More or less the same, lol. I'm amazed at how much classic has revived wow for me.
---
Are you confused?  The chest isn’t looted until after the group is done.  How would people see that if they are already gone?
---
you sir got a new twitter follower! Love the style and the colours can’t wait to see more
---
Completely anecdotal but a few days ago I was semi-afk for awhile and got kicked to character select even though I was moving/jumping occasionally.
---
cool story bro
---
Completely fair - I haven't experience the bug yet myself as I haven't reached the higher level zones. Certainly I'd believe the Blizzard response over speculation!
---
Thanks for the info - who's the source?
---
in what sort of scenario are you talking? 
---
In raids all healers have mana troubles. In dungeons there's always the possibility. Enhance and Ele both can run out of mana easily. While leveling enhance drinks every few pulls, or I think that's about what's been happening for me. Ele maybe a bit more than that.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Also let Shamans tank if they have the gear/armor, you'll get a lot more instances in!
---
you have my autoattack!
---
Selling a boe so I can have my moubt right when I ding 40 sounds awefully fun to me.
---
Can multiple people grab the same beached creature? If so, this will be a great group activity.
---
Next level Hot Pockets.
---
because its a free class profession 
---
You mean you don't have mining or herbalism and ask to roll for the ore?
---
Yes. I mained a Druid since wrath so I was excited to play one in classic. But one of the only problems with classic is how objectively terrible certain specs are. I was told balance was shit and was called the oomkin not the boomkin. So I rolled a mage instead. I completely forgot that int just increases mana and crit, not spell damage. No Druid specs are very viable at all, besides healing I guess. Effectly you are mark of the wild, the class. And a bush league rogue/warrior/mage/priest.
---
Try inventorian instead.
---
there are corpses of giant turtles and other sea creatures at the coast. if you click on them you will get the quest and just have to go back to Auberdine for the reward. each skeleton is guarded by murlocs
---
We need pally power so badly.  Someone remake it.
---
Follow the mushrooms.
---
I would save it until more people start getting into MC, there will be a way higher demand so you’ll get a much better price
---
Oh please sir, may I have some forgiveness? I promise never to have a misunderstanding on the internet again!
---
The majority of the biggest guild on my realm has been banned for abusing layering to kill Rag multiple times in one day.
---
Good. They're all Ninjas too.
---
Agree 100%, walking up and having a start attack macro+sinister strike will always do more dps over the course of a raid or instance. And a ton of mobs are immune to bleeds randomly in leveling instances. AND to add, you will absolutely obliterate dps as combat/swords, hemo and even assassination doesn't even come close.
---
It's bugs all the way down.
---
Because they are idiots that care so much about 1 chest... 99.9997% of the times its garbage. The fact that so many people are willing to be douches over trashloot boggles my mind. That said, I have yet to see a rogue unwilling to share. I also have yet to see anyone whine the rogue took the locked chest. Most just see locked and move on. Redditors are cancer.
---
If the other dps identify the caster who isn't grouping up as well, they can burst the caster down first before it runs.
---
I say this as a Warlock who hates Rogues. These Rogues are not the problem. The other DPS should assist them.
---
If you think pointlessly aggravating people for no reason other than the aggravate them is fun, then I am glad I dont know you.
---
When I was level 10 with a warrior friend, I was walking through Mulgore and saw a Hunter almost dying next to a node. The warrior started mining while I did just enough heals to keep the Hunter alive. 
---
He spit on us.
---
It kind of like that scene in The Dark Knight with the boat where both have the ability to blow the other up to save themselves. It's a game theory dilemma. 
---
But in this case both needing is the only sure way to make it totally fair. 
---
A real dilemma would be if you said that if everyone needed, nobody would get it. What would you do? Need or greed? Sorry going on a tangent here.
---
I go to arathi at 30. There's a handful of quests and low mobs to do, then you leave and go back around lvl 36. It's about k owing the mobs and the challenges. 
---
Check out Joana's guide
---
Right but firefin is a dog right now, maybe 50s a stack. I’m asking, based on the experience of people who played vanilla, if those potions become valuable enough for raiding when more guilds start raiding, or maybe when BWL comes out or something.
---
Disagree, it's a social issue because you all accepted that this person would be the party leader and party leaders by default have control over party settings, including loot settings.
---
Yeah but sometimes a little respect works out better in the long run. It's more efficient for both parties to fish out their own pools.
---
That beard though 🤘🏽
---
The biggest mistake i see my feral brothers do is literally zero shifting. Even before you got furor. When at 0 energy and at the begining of 2 second window, shift, moonfire, shift back. Make sure to level up weapon skill so you can also get 1 auto attack in between shifting.
---
I loved it too... 10 years ago. I dont have this large amount of time to search for everything anymore. Even with Questie it takes ages.
---
I thought sap was purple for purple reasons.
---
The game has a built in ignore list
---
Maybe you need to take a look at yourself and try to understand why you even give a shit what he does unless it affects you personally. 
---
Are you playing classic? Are you having fun? 
---
That’s what matters. Not what some streamer does. The sooner you can divorce others’ experience from your own, the sooner you can enjoy things on their own merits to you with utter disregard to what anyone else thinks. 
---
I watch his stream on the other monitor while I play sometimes because I find his and his guild’s goofy antics entertaining. I don’t sub, I don’t send money, I don’t spam the chat, I just listen in because it’s funny to me. 
---
Of course I play on a different server so I don’t have to deal with any of it in-game, and if that’s what is bothering you— grab one of those free transfers off Faerlina.
---
Damnit I lol'd
---
I can never get Salv off unless there's another person, people bitch about not having BoW despite it not even mattering because pulls are over in a minute or less and you drink break anyway
---
Murlocs are the bane of my warrior existence
---
It is crazy how some people are completely unwilling to bring anything except a warrior to tank. Even an enhance shaman with a shield can tank decently well in low level dungeons.
---
As long as you are all on the same step, the other members in your group will get a pop-up saying "X is starting Y quest, would you like to accept as well?" If they accept, they'll get credit. If they don't get the pop-up, then they're likely missing a prior requirement.
---
There's an infamous escort quest in RFD where the questgiver gives two quests, and each member of the party has to complete his first quest. If a single member accepts the second quest, anyone who didn't complete the first quest will be cut out.
---
/LFG is a channel already built into the game. You can even select it from options. Which is different from /Lookingforgroup.
---
&gt; I guess I am just holier than thou art
---
Such arrogance... 
---
I barely even check what buffs I have but if a player in my party uses his skills for personal gain rather than aiding the party, I'll kick him for it.
---
&gt; just wants to fuck with you rather than actually ruin your gameplay.
---
As someone with limited time to play, that is definitely actually ruining gameplay for me. I do not have time for that shit and that guy can go fuck himself.
---
They really aren't.  Personal opinion !== fact.
---
All these testimonies make me so much happier cause so many people tell me the line, "You never had that high a ping! Stop lying" and I'm always like uhhhh yes I did!
---
Yeah, but are they going to delete all the black stone rings they sold to 'non explorers' that simply showed up to collect the loot?
---
Join grp, by the time you make it to the instance they downed enough versions to have it on the body waiting to be looted.
---
Day 12: I am now stronger than my or warrior, now I take on the real threat
---
Literally people were warning others to avoid these servers... I dont feel bad what so ever
---
You cant complete the dungeon without everyone vs only the rogue can open the chest. Not an apt comparison at all.
---
If there's a blacksmith that creates a key while leveling BS, do you think everyone should roll on his key?
---
This is SO funny! This "OMG i'm so badass, no one will pull that shit on me!" atitude "if that mofo even try i'm gonna cap his ass, kick him off the group, blacklist, block, ignore, make a voodoo doll of him, cut his balls off and kill his damn dog!!!"
---
No. You won't. Sorry.... You'll forget about it and wont even notice.
---
BTW, go ahead, kick. 1 min is enough to get to the chests.
---
No idea why so much rage. We're just RPing.
---
I only power word shield tanks who spam blood fury.
---
This is actually not far from where me and most of my Guild lives in Washington :)
---
Larger inventory space will always directly lead to more gold (you should be looting *everything*) so it's not a bad investment.
---
Some people literally don't have time to mix it up in PvP at all times. I have a limited amount of time I can play every day and I'm trying to level.
---
Okay. It’s just a video game man. It’s not that deep. I play on a PvP server so people aggravating each other for no reason is kinda the entire game.
---
First thing I saw was the comment in World "Everythings a pocket pussy if you're brave enough".
---
Use a chat addon like Prat and change the font in the options or download an addon that overhauls your entire UI
---
One of the two only reasons. Second being mark of the wild. “The less Druids in the raid the better. You only need 1.” My friend constantly says
---
well thats what you got for intended exploiting :D
---

Basically all tanks should do this. You should have a macro to switch between your 2H and your shield. In most cases the improved damage and aggro from 2Hing is better than the damage mitigation from the shield. The shield comes out for big pulls, oh-shit moments and (some) bosses.
---
Literally the thing the other guy answered to as well.
---
honestly have such a fun time professions and find the utility they bring downright imperative, and we have travel form so saving for mount isnt really a necessity 
---
had all mine at 225 way before hitting 35
---
may have drunkenly dropped 225 herbalism for enchanting (trinket is BIS for tanking) the other night to pair with alchemy
---
Pet can tank probably into the late 20s mid 30s
---
It's not optimal, but it works
---
The orange one is a nipple, not a moon. Get it right 😅
---
Keys require blacksmithing to use as far as I can find. So a blacksmith could also unlock it, but then again the argument can very easily be made that a blacksmith of any class should get the chest's contents because it cost them gold and materials to be able to use that key.
---
Same, rogue for 15 years and I know not to try and solo any dungeon elite haha.
---
Prat and Chatter are two chat addons if you're talking about chat specifically.
---
Could also be Mik's Scrolling Battle Text if it's like damage numbers and such.
---
I had to google that. Excuse me while I go pick up my Just for Men and Geritol.
---
I guess I downloaded it somewhere else and installed it manually. Just google "auctionator wow classic" and you should probably find a working version.
---
Best weapon upgrades are from dungeons, hands down.  Otherwise, you will have to make do with greens and AH purchases.
---
Level 18 to probably 30 - Crescent Staff from WC questing
---
Level 30 to 45 - Illusory Rod from SM Library
---
That's what I was thinking as well. But I'm worried more will be on the market as well. What's a good price to start selling at?
---
On it right now. Really interested to see how it plays out. Also, it's a not chain per se, but rather a few different chains that revolve around the Sycthe of Elune and the worgens. Very very interesting stuff.
---
This is a video game, bud. I think you're taking this a little too seriously. No one is "hurting someone else". GG
---
I'm probably going to aoe grind a mage to 35 to be an Alchemy alt. Does anyone know of any Alliance aoe grind guides that worked particularly well for them?
---
One classic wow player calling other classic wow players dweebs 😂
---
&gt;I think you're assuming that
---
&gt;`realm_capacity = 3000 x num_layers`
---
I'm not. Maximum realm capacity will always be set to whatever Blizzard feels right for the maximum they want to support (which has to be set to a specific range because servers don't behave right when you undershoot or overshoot).
---
But my point is that they can *change* the maximum server capacity. Fixed means it doesn't change, which is false. They can tune the servers to handle more or lass if they want to.
---
Is there anything we can do for you?
---
don't dead
---
open inside
---
you can just zf till 51 and then brd, thats what i did but as ret
---
Must be.
---
*Challenge
---
There's no way it's the 2nd fastest. It's definitely 3rd hardest.
---
Imo the order of ease of leveling is:
---
* Top 3: Hunter, Druid, Mage (depends on layer hopping, but these are always top 3)
---
* 4-5: Warlock, Priest (not the fastest at killing, but have absolutely no downtime ever)
---
* 6: Shaman (slightly more downtime than Warlock/Priest, Ghost Wolf does somewhat mitigate this in the early levels, but that advantage is gone when the leveling speed really slows down after 40)
---
* 7: Rogue (Gear dependent, no healing, fast killing, lots of downtime)
---
* 8: Paladin (Gear dependent, slow AF kill speed, reasonable downtime)
---
* 9: Warrior (Gear dependent, no healing, die most often due to no escapes, massively decreasing leveling efficiency, lots of downtime)
---
Rogues can struggle to find groups as they are a DPS class, but for some reason the community is in love with Mages and 'spell cleaves' at the moment, which makes it a even harder than usual to find a group.
---
However, at end game they are a valued DPS class, and are frequently brought to dungeons and raids.
---
Correctly talented druids shouldn't have a point in anything but feral until level 41 lol. 
---
And warriors should just use a 2h, that solves a lot of rage and threat issues.
---
Hell, Hunter/Lock pets can tank well-enough for most dungeons :)
---
I tried TooltipNotes. Its neat but kept crashing, hopefully will keep it patched
---
So my wife has decided to play Classic and doesn't have much MMO/WoW experience at all. Ive tried my best to let her kinda do her own thing but shes struggling really bad with dieing alot ( i mean alot).  She rolled a taruen Druid and is level 13 in the barrens.  Im not very knowledgeable about druids in classic but are there anythings i need to make sure shes doing to help eliminate her deaths. Her rotation seems to be Moonfire(?) and then bearform until the mob dies but she has a ton of issues with anything more than 1 mob at a time.
---
[Wowhead shows this](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=768/cat-form), but I'm certain I saw it on Live.  If you doubt, check the tooltip for Cat Form in classic.
---
I use shadowed unit frames, haven't been in a raid since setting it up so I'm not sure how it'll look in that or if it even has raid frame capabilities.  
---
The party frames look great though and are very customize-able.
---
I love that you didn’t even aknowledge balance in a separate line. You just included it under kitty dps and threw in the mage haha.
---
If you really wanna have some fun, change skull mid-combat to fuck with everyone, then join in the confusion over what keeps happening
---
its only getting worse because more players in the smaller faction will drop out and reroll. find a server with as close to a 50:50 ratio as you can and reroll there, sunk cost fallacy n all.
---
Oh ok thank you. Gonna pay attention to that
---
Played classic since 2005. Never liked Ninja looters back then. Stop jumping to conclusions, you almost 30
---
'Details' is the name of the addon?
---
&gt;It's a fixed number set by Blizzard, is what they meant I think.
---
Definition: "fixed"
---
&gt;Google - (especially of a price, rate, or time) predetermined and not subject to or able to be changed.
---
&gt;[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fixed) - not subject to change or fluctuation 
---
&gt;[Macmillan](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/fixed) - something such as an amount, date, or time that is fixed has been agreed on and will not change
---
&gt;[Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/fixed) - arranged or decided already and not able to be changed: 
---
&gt;[Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/fixed) - You use fixed to describe something which stays the same and does not or cannot vary. 
---
If that's what they meant, they used "fixed" wrong. Blizzard can change it all they damn want to in order to meet the demand.
---
&gt;Where did you get any of that information about layering? Your source doesn't back up what you just made up.
---
Yes it does. I said layering is to support a higher total number of people, in the context of having them on the same realm. You can read the source right there and they do it for the long-term healthy populations, and that opening more servers (to meet the demand) would simply cause underpopulated servers. If you read in-between the lines of those statements and put them together, it is concludible that in order to have long-term healthy population, they want to have layers to increase the server cap. 
---
&gt;I can't find anything official that says layering increases server capacity, because it doesn't.
---
Because you didn't click the link and read the part where it elaborates more than what I quoted. Here you go:
---
&gt;**Newman:**  
---
So why not just raise the number of people on a realm?
---
&gt;**Hazzikostas:**  
---
Just raising the realm caps ***without any additional tech***, at some point you run into ***not just client-server performance issues*** but raw gameplay issues, in terms of contention over finite spawn points in a world where mobs tap to the first person who hits them.
---
This quote means that layering is a tech to increase the server capacity. Both for client-server performance issues, but also gameplay issues, as you mentioned. If you think layering was *only* for the gameplay issues you speak of, think again. Because they outright said:
---
Will there really be 2,000 people in the human starting area in Northshire Abbey?
---
There will be that many people and more in every Northshire Abbey and Valley of Trials on Monday. We're not trying to make that better.
---
They outright say they're not trying to make it better. But let's get to the juicy part of that same quote, but on the topic of realm capacity.
---
There will be that many people and more in every Northshire Abbey and Valley of Trials on Monday. We're not trying to make that better. ***We're trying to fit even more people into the server without making it utterly untenable.***
---
&gt;***And the reason why we're doing that is so that down the line and not too far down the line, once the initial rush has passed, we are left with long-term stable, healthy communities*** that can support raid guilds and PvP across both factions and folks that are going to progress into Blackwing Lair and Ahn'Qiraj and Naxxramas and all the rest.
---
hawhaw!
---
still. that's the type of douchy shit i live for on my rogue. sapping someone and stealing their node is still my favourite.
---
I have a used laptop [HP Elite Book like this](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-EliteBook-840-G2-Notebook-Review.139398.0.html) but with 8gb ram and 256gb ssd. I have everything at low and seems to work at 30Hz without any issues with 90% resolution of the screen.  
---
Compared to my PC that I use to play with everything at ultra and 100HZ with 1440p resolution, the game seems to be more GPU bound than CPU bound. If you have any decent GPU I think you should be fine, although I must say I have not entered an effect fest with the laptop.
---
She should have some stamina and agility gear, and buff her self with Mark of the Wild and Thorns. She can start out by casting Wrath from a distance, immediately followed by moonfire and bear form. If her mana pool permits it, she can cast Wrath, Roots, Moonfire, and then a few more Wraths until the roots break, just be sure to save enough mana to switch to bear form when the mob gets close.
---
You should do everything in your power to not fight more than 1 mob at a time. If she does accidentally pull a second mob, run, or cast Entangling Roots on the 2nd mob while you kill the first one.
---
Ensure that her skills are trained and that the highest rank of each is on her toolbar.
---
Oh you're mos def right on that ,  ive grinded half a level killing raptors and i have...3 eyes
---
=P
---
Then play on a carebear server.
---
We haven't seen numbers for retail in years.
---
Will Ferrell has been stricken from my memories of that show.

\*Slow golf clap\* I know wish you were streaming so I could watch you singing this song as you grinded away on mobs. LuL.
---
Have you tried running a "scan/repair"? Some people have said that helped them.
---
Also some have said that running on Max settings was causing them to crash.
---
Last thing I've heard is that running on DirectX 12 was the issue. Switching it to 11 helped.
---
These are just things I've heard. Can't say for sure if they will help but it can't hurt to try some :3
---
Good Luck!
---
Lol spot on
---
Yes please! I’d love to have this as well
---
Download Questie if you don't already have it, it shows every quest near your level range. I think these quests span like 5-6 levels.
---
I def would like an addon like this.
---
Alterac Pass! Im killing the mages and elementals outside Dalaran (the giant bubble thing)
---
I afforded my mount right after hitting 40 too, as a warlock :)

YES. Heck. I cannot heal you if my face is getting ripped off.
---
as a warrior with little bag space, i dont mind, food is food

Yes you can.
---
They're always so good.
---
The only people I'm worried about are the new players who aren't traditional online gamers, maybe their friend or family member said "hey I have a way to make us lots of money/gear" and now they're suddenly looking at potential bans for being ignorant.
---
That said, hopefully that isn't think that happened or happened much, because I definitely want to see the exploiters punished and you can't really accept any kinds of excuses like that since they can easily be lies.
---
Dungeons are probably best because they are instanced.
---
I was out fishing in the swamps at 3am on an EST server and there were still huge numbers of farmers out there. I'd probably avoid it.
---
WTB Aloe Gel PST
---
Because we played private servers without it for years, and guess what? It was better.
---
I'm guessing you're horde? Seems like Tauren isn't the most popular, and it's the only option for druids.
---
I can taste the sour grapes on this guy.
---
The difference in 1.2 -&gt; 1.0 is huge. Knocking back a cast one extra time is an enormous advantage in pvp.
---
Yeah. There was a guy in beta who needed all the agi gear he could. Took cloak of the brotherhood over some rogues. Became quite infamous.
---
But damned if he wasnt top dps in my stockades run
---
Then i add you to the kill on sight list. I am patient with revenge. I've killed people days after they killed me when we cross paths
---
Nope. The most common pulls now LOS everything with a tank/mage pulling and then you nova/cock and kite things with AE. AE does enough damage you can clear everything much quicker and you generally have enough mages to keep things locked down.
---
Still consistent 3,000 person queue after 7pm on Fairbanks. I try and stay logged in all night once I get back home from work.
---
The greed of wanting to roll/share something we all worked towards, rather than let one guy take it all for himself? 
---
That's a very strange idea of "greed" you have there.
---
Luna is a stolen knockoff of shadowed unit frames. Basically, the person took older copies of SUF and made them work on private servers. Now with Classic out, the person has the gall to actually make it work in Classic while SUF is also working on Classic.
---
Or just go to the gym for an hour a day 5 days a week instead of contorting yourself into an absurdist regimen designed to convince yourself you're being healthy.
---
AFAIK, Auctioneer/Auctionator is required for TSM4 Classic to work in WoW. I think it's because TSM4 relies on the scanning that the older tools do, since TSM4 was designed for retail WoW where the auction house has scan APIs.
---
I would use Auctioneer/Auctionator and not bother with TSM4 unless you really want to play the Auction House and even then, a spread sheet + Auctionator/Auctioneer is probably more effective
---
I use Auctionator over Auctioneer because I prefer the Auctionator UI but either should be fine.
---
Literally did it last night
---
Seems to be working fine for me.
---
Firebolt, fire shield and blood pact effects all seem to be in the +30% range.
---
I can agree with that, but when you factor in questing, combat is by far the better spec for leveling. Im not saying its impossible to level as daggers but it will be harder.
---

---
I know balance is not good but i want to try. I've played balance druid since 2011/2012 and i still wanting to play it. I watch this video and gives me some hope for pvp at 60
---
True it's a bit of an overreaction lol
---
Yup. Hell, I've been doing worse than this. Opposite faction killing something that I need for a quest that has a low drop rate and/or low re-spawn time? Kill opposite faction, finish off the mob for the drop. Anyone who says they haven't at least considered this hasn't been hunting bloodscalps in Stranglethorn or buzzards in badlands.
---
But I'd never do that to my wonderful fellow Alliance, hell I'll toss a heal on them if they're fighting a mob or two and are low. But Horde? Life's short man, gotta hate who you wanna hate and I hope they do the same to me. 
---
(As characters obviously. Obviously Horde bros are cool IRL and I mained Horde for 90% of my time playing WoW from 2006-2011).
---
Ive got the Hyper X Cloud Alpha headset. Probably my favorite headset of all time. Sounds great, feels great, and I havent had any issues with them so far. Nice setup!!
---
It's a serious problem, lots of locks say they have lifetap so they don't need to carry water. We had one that was asking to be healed the entire time and then immediately life tapped and managed to pull off of the tank almost every pull. Drinking is a great time to let the tank build up threat, not to mention a great way of regenning Mana.
---
Locks, please drink water between pulls
---
Mages, drink water before you aoe, give time for threat and have enough Mana to make it through the pull
---
Druids, do what you want, but if you're healing please drink before big pulls and don't let the people die
---
Same thing for other healers, keep people alive by drinking.
---
Warriors... You know what fuck it, warriors start drinking too, once other people's Mana is up you can go in and attack your hearts out.
---
Rogues, you don't need to drink, just don't try to sap mobs and end up pulling 3 packs and the boss.
---
Jokes on all of you!  My main is a banker.
---
Attach a $15/month sub to a retail account and you are good to go.
---
Because you chime in with exaggerations about how you **destroy** mobs that are higher level than you as protection specced. What did you expect? That everyone would applaud you? 
---
Play however you want, but don't be surprised when someone gives you facts over your fiction.
---
At 36, you can do Desolace, which was pretty calm when I went there, except maybe around Maraudon. Also playing Alliance on Stalagg.
---
Alternatively, you can group up, which both makes questing faster, and serves as a deterrent to would-be gankers.

Layer is not a mechanic of the game. Is a server feature and anyone knows is an abuse...
---
Someone gets it. Had a tank get mad at me when I wouldn't stay to heal a second ZF run after the first because I said he was too slow. He told me good luck healing in shadow. After a full run where I was begging him to pull more than 1 mob at a time. Yes 1 mob if there was a group, he was ask for cc so he could pull the mob. I literally spent time dpsing the mob because I was so bored.
---
I haven’t been denied a spot because I’m a Druid, if anything I get praise for it
---
Speaking for myself, I have not used layering and I am 2 items short of pre-raid bis blues. This is on Old Blanchy no less, a nearly dead realm _relatively speaking_ compared to those like Herod or Kromkrush.
---
Sad... I'm really curious now... I don't think there are queues in the Retail servers, are there?
---
OMG I need this
---
I saw at least 50 in the starting zones. By level 14 I saw almost none.  
---
Darkshore was pretty brutal for me, so I skipped on over to the human starting area and that helped a lot.
---
IT IS ROGUE LOOT YOU ARE WRONG?
---
Do I get to roll on your herbs and mines? Do I roll on your gear? Well you couldn't get all of it without all of us here helping you right? Well its the same for the rogue, its his class mechanic give it to him, just like if its your profession you get it. Its unreasonable in my opinion to expect someone to unlock a chest then give someone else the items, just like I wouldn't ever roll for an herb or mining node unless im herb or mining. Btw im a priest...
---
What about Ghostly Strike?
---
Thats good to hear man! :)
---
It IS his opinion. OP is asking for opinions. He isn't forcing anyone to play this way or that. Your comment is the epitome of an unnecessary shitpost.
---
Must not have abused it that heavily. Nobody cares about your couple of blues you got.

Nope, NetComm.

I also prefer Auctionator but AFAIK there's no official release and it made a lot of bad sales when I tried it in Classic, maybe I need to scan more.

If you ninja loot you deserve the n-word.  Now go reroll and name change you damn ninja
---
Moonfire into Bear is pretty solid. How is her gear? Is she fighting enemies high level than her? Is she fighting multiple mobs at once? Does she have MotW on? Because one on one with an enemy your level the bear should be winning without even needing to pop a HoT or Heal.
---
There is a low escort in Ashenvale. Also there is one in thousand needles horde have.  Not sure the names of the quests though.
---
just dont dot them up right away, give him a few seconds to get some aoe aggro
---
Thank you!! I'm afraid of notebooks and pen because when you wrote it down, you can't erase it back without making a mess or order them as you want. My head is so messy that sometimes I'm thinking too much in the next steps and forgetting about the current ones so I am always reordering my things.
---
A lot of players either don't read the tooltips on their spells or don't understand their class mechanics.  This isn't my first time on shaman, so once i hit 30 i stopped leveling Rockbiter and I know to only have Rank 1 Earth Shock on my cast bar.  On the flip side, i was running around doing some kill quests with another shaman that had Rockbiter on his weapon and would put up Windfury Totem during fights.  Even when I told him they don't stack, he kept dropping the totem.  I can understand having Rockbiter instead of Windfury if you have a fast 1 hander.  Windfury is less valuable when you're using a weapon that swings faster than the internal cooldown.  But you don't have to waste the mana on useless totems.  You can present information, but you can't stop willful ignorance
---
Just remember... You think you do but you don't.

The group I ran SM GY and Lib yesterday as a low level healer would make your head explode.  Not only did we all roll greed on a random blue BoE that dropped, people were passing on pieces they could have easily greeded.
---
Not every group or every player is 'me me me'.  This is a social game and it is about forging connections with your fellow players.  Sure while leveling you can be dicks to randoms.  But at 60, if you flat refuse to ever open a chest for the group, you will find yourself excluded from runs for that specific reason.  Even if another rogue is not as well geared, I'm not going to take you because you refuse to put the group first over your own greed.
---
Seeing as he came out and said publicly that he was happy people were getting banned for it, i assume not
---
Retail: Oh look some mobs grouped up for a little boost of Exp between quests. 
---
Classic: Oh look a metaphorical bio-hazard I need to avoid at all costs.
---
This is good advice, and about what I do. Rage gen is the biggest issue with SS and Cleave being somewhat expensive, and charge not always being an option. I use taunts pretty much exclusively when solo targets break off and pray that DPS lays off that mob for a bit. Just got berserker this morning, haven't had the time to try it out yet, but looking forward to it!
---
Is it because im on mobile, because i cant see any timezones there, only name of the server, and united states, thats not a timezone
---
Which incidentally is great because you want a slow attack if you're building an alpha strike kitty to come out of prowl.

The best guild on the server will have the best players in it and be more successful at the things they set out to do than the other guilds.

Marginally. Curious, would you demand a blacksmith use a skeleton key and then say everyone has a right to the loot in the box?

---
It's a bit different with professions. This is a class skill. I didn't work on the warriors 1 hand skill. Doesn't mean he should take all the gear in the instance because he used it to complete the run. 
---
I didn't buy the warlocks pet books, or do their pet quests. The healers summoning quest? Didn't work on that either. Did I buy the mages food/water ranks? No. Not gonna pay any of them for that in a run, or let them take extra stuff because of it. 
---
&gt;It is greed due to you rather wanting no one to have it if you don't have a chance to get it yourself.
---
No I want to punish the rogue for not sharing. A man potion could be in that chest, and we could use that to beat the instance. Instead he decided to not open it, and wait till the end of the run to come back and get it.
---
Ok so then I post in general/workd chat making a few people maybe acknowledge this person as a ninja looter while he has enough money for an epic mount. Now what?
---
There are a set number of pulls before a pool is depleted. It's more efficient for you to fully fish one pool by yourself (lets say you get 5 fish) than it is to have to run between 3 different pools to get 5 fish because more than one person is using them.

You most probably did, but in intended way, and not abusing it by "inv to layer" global chat spam.

I wouldn't whisper them that. Could work in a ban against you actually. All it takes is the admin viewing the log and see that behavior and striking you down. Even though we all wanna say it to them.
---
This is a great idea! I workout already and tell myself no wow unless I do so but I like this too.
---
I didnt waste any time, I play for the pvp.
---
Step one: Download Details!
---
Step two: enable threat meter
---
Step three: wait 5-10 seconds after tank pulls
---
Step four: unleash them cone of cold / AE crits
---
Step five: ???
---
Step six: profit!!
---
I tend to pick race mostly because of animations and I like male UD the most on horde side.
---
Are there other class discords?
---
I don't have a problem with there being a free alternative, I'm not a fan of paying for an addon.  I was recommended GuideLime and your guide by my guild, the tipping point was my progress getting borked and me not wanting to spend the little bit of gaming time I had getting it fixed.
---
I'm almost to point where I'm considering this. Hillsbrad was bad enough and it's got me nervous on how bad STV will be. Plus I plan on only really playing my priest to gear up then raid once I hit 60.
---
Last night was doing RFK runs with 2 other warriors and a rogue with me as a warrior tank. It was awesome. We eventually just all went DPS and facerolled the dungeon while I would swap to shield and tank if we pulled too much.
---
They can, but they can't hold aggro whatsoever so it is super slow. At that point you might as well just focus on dpsing everything down as quickly as possible and CC what you can without worrying about a tank or aggro.
---
If not, it would be easy at 40 to go back and bang out all the starter zone quests there to get honored.
---
The chaos is in their hearts
---
I find STV to be too saturated in terms of players. I had a massive dip of XP per hour when I moved from desolace to STV.
---
And you think that player numbers are comparable?
---
Welcome back (to Future you)
---
Glad to hear you had a good experience as a new player.  Don't be afraid of the community, just be open and ask for feedback about what you're not sure of.  Most experienced players have played several different classes at this point and can offer advice about a variety of topics.
---
I will never play retail again.. Just downloaded and sub for Classic so i have no idea how the servers are handle now since i stoped at Cat...
---
Yeah, it's really great to see the world so alive again.
---
I too am humble
---
Okay. There’s thousands and thousands of players out in PvP realms and you’re for some reason particularly concerned about how one of them plays on a PvP realm compared to you. Kinda strange.
---
refreshing a quest mob instead of waiting 30 minutes to get a tag, vs reseting a boss without having to clear the trash.  one is low benefit convenience while the other is high benefit abuse.
---
Funnily enough, most people don't really care about screenshot whiners and just want to share funny shit
---
Your char looks cool like that.
---
No they operate like nodes, they get tapped.
---
Yeah if you blizzard .5 second after I pull, you know what you're getting yourself into.
---
So starting in phase 2 when you kill another player in pvp combat you will gain honor.  Honor is used to determine your pvp rank.  Your rank decays over time to ensure that you are consistently pvping.
---
Taunt has a 10 second cool down and can be resisted, so sometimes your tank isn't being bad, they just got unlucky.
---
Always go left once you hit the maze!  You will kill all bosses, and barely more trash than is necessary.
---
that's alright. that's how it was for me when i first did it right after WoW release. i enjoyed the adventure. it's a confusing instance for new people for sure.
---
There's an addon called "Powered" that's pretty cool.
---
&gt;No my homie won it
---
But you said the other guy sold it for gold? I'm confused.
---
There was an update that seems to fix special spell damage like shadow. Check and see if you have the latest version.
---
The only thing you need to be able to tank while leveling up is realistically just a shield and defensive stance (and in some cases not even those). Your talents don’t really matter, although arms has an easier time because tactical mastery.
---
Yeah, I do appreciate it a little as it's good practice for things getting out of control in a safer environment.  Usually not causing a wipe or anything.  I figure most of the dps will catch on by around 50 when pulling that stuff off the tank might be more likely to kill them faster.
---
Everyone's already said this looks nothing like mulgore. It is a very nice picture though and a pretty place. Def more like hinterlands though
---
That hilarious.... If it wasn't account wide I would so make a character there....
---
Gotta get dat!
---
Literally nobody in this thread said to wand in that circumstance. You're talking a case of healers not understanding the fight. A healer can wand just fine and choose not to wand in the right circumstances.
---
*Crushim*
---
OP is way more triggered than this hunter will ever be...
---
I was wondering if something like this existed the other day! Will def give it a try.
---
Ok so use the dumbbells and or do 1 leg deadlifts.  For deadlifts you can also use the non Olympic bench press bar as well, you only need Olympic of your doing cleans n stuff.
---
From what I've read, fire resistance is a must in the Rag fight? I get that buffs help, but if it's a main tank must, then it has to have high value, no?
---
Says the person flaming in comments, nerd
---
It's not free, they have to level it.
---
I've heard of that, but I was told "always left" and I think that's better.  Still kill all bosses, and those mushrooms can be hard to see
---
It is definitely worthwhile, those extra 15-20s of grey items per bag slot per trip adds up real quick.
---
Unlocking a chest as a blacksmith requires 275 blacksmithing and an arcanite bar. Claiming that's lazy compared to leveling lockpicking (oh my, 5 locks per level which I get for free while pickpocketing, so hard) is just disingenuous. Leveling lockpicking requires an irrelevant amount of effort while leveling a rogue. Meanwhile blacksmithing is one of the most difficult and time consuming professions in the game.
---
As a healer I'm disappointed to see an Orc tank because they use blood fury at the worst time and it makes it hard to heal them.
---
There is a listing screen tip...
---
How do you imagine the tanks feel?
---
One thing I can suggest, before you get dead set on rerolling- play a class to 20. By then the rotation is pretty much set with basic abilities and is long enough to experience the class. If you're bored or not thrilled with the way the class plays, switch it up. Not like there is some big rush "I gotta hit 60 asap". Leave that shit for the aoe frost mages spell cleave lol. 
---
If you do roll a warrior, fair warning they SUCK to level. And you'll be relying on gear moreso than most classes, and your repair bills will reflect that lol.
---
Gotta get that goldshire cosplay money! Or whatever the horde equivalent is
---
Probably because people like leveling shamans, but hate speccing resto at 60 because enhancement and elemental aren't good raid specs at all outside of edge cases for enhancement with a nightfall axe or whatever it's called.
---
What would you think is a good price to let it go at?
---
the fuck is this
---
*brb bio*
---
*back*
---
How did you know what level she was? She would be a skull.
---
gotta remember some players are new to game.  my wife started playing with me and if someone helped her out like you did she probably wouldn't even know what happened.
---
I knew you could bookmark a post, didn’t know that! Thanks!
---
I downloaded Questie last night and I can't get it to work. Have it installed exactly as the instructions said, and I don't have any "Addons" in game. Disappointing. :/
---
Your hot bar is looking T H I C C my man.
---
What's the data usage like on using steam link over data?
---
I've used my owl to tank a couple times when the tank died, that Growl + Intimidate combo is a ton of threat that can hold a mob's aggro pretty well, but yeah, wouldn't want to do a whole dungeon like that
---
It certainly is in part, but there's also a real life counterpart called the Bonneville Flats out in Utah where racing teams go to set land-speed records.
---
Just 2 minutes?
---
You couldn’t wish a worse thing upon someone
---
Now go give that pup a long walk.
---
Careful brother.   Don’t ever voice that opinion around these parts
---
This would be news to me. I didn’t fish at all in vanilla, though, so I’m kind of new to it.
---
Most geared rogue? Wtf. That's sick man. Wanna join my raiding guild? You must be really good
---
If someone else can open the chest then it’s fair to roll. Otherwise, the rogue doesn’t need to share. Consider he may simply choose to say he can’t open them and go back after you leave to loot them. When I unlock a chest I’ll generally link stuff I don’t need to allow a roll.
---
Fishing bank alt, yes totally. Been sending it to my normal one, but you need a lot of space. I think a specialized one is a great idea.
---
I don't play a rogue and their attitude is correct. You have no entitlement to another user's ability that has to be leveled outside of their normal process like any other profession.
---
DP heals you and many consider it a trump card, so even as a healer I would disagree with you saying it doesn’t have much use. That being said I don’t think you can go wrong with either!
---
60AP is huge, and for a hunter 11agi is only \~0.3% crit chance. I'd say it's a great item, especially if you get the gloves and you plan on levelling in STV.
---
You don't need any prot talents to tank dgs from 20 to 55-ish.
---
Every leveling warrior you see in the world is either Arms or Fury and they can still tank dgs no problem.
---
For Fury go [This tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVzV0eoVo), then you go Arms talents.
---
For Arms you go [This tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxbAio0z), then you go Fury talents.
---
For Prot at 60, you go [This tree](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVMxZVcZxizoeMzVo).
---
Some utility talents can vary depending on play style. But the base is always the same and it's there.
---
Classic client is based parially on BfA client actually. Earlier iterations were on Legion one.
---
Gratz on the 60 sir! You may now leave the home.
---
Sry, I see that I've written it in a weird way, or I forgot a sentence... He was asking what X meant so I explained it to him. Because he asked.
---
But I'm not going to explain it preemptively at the start of the dungeon to EVERYONE. I am expecting the majority to know what it means, so I won't bother EVERYONE by explaining it. If someone asks, then obviously I will explain it.
---
My point is very simple: If someone doesn't know something, then ask and it will be explained. But it shouldn't be expected to go into a dungeon and be like "skull is main target, X is secondary target" and get "duh" as a response 9/10 times.
---
That was the sm necklace at and was bop, dude vendored it and got gkicked. The recent one that happened last night was in zf and a mob dropped the necklace
---
No try it , if you reply a whisper and then pess enter youbare replying whisper again not in party chat
---
It works inconsistently.  Sometimes it does one thing, sometimes another.  Which way is intended?
---
Either it's a higher level trainer that teaches it or it's a schematic.
---
If you play with guildmembers and know your guildmember will equip it, go ahead and pass. It's going to let you progress quicker.  
---
If you play with randoms and don't know this player will equip it, go ahead and need. It's going to let you progress quicker.  
---
I have seen it so many times that 4/5 greed on a rare item, only for the last player to need on it. There is *no reason* for 5 people to greed on a item and risk giving the item to a jerk. Which is why you always need on BoE rare/epic items. If someone wants it that badly, they will purchase it from the auction house.
---
Another problem I'm seeing is that people read/watched all these guides that told them not to buy skills they won't use so tanking isn't even a real option for them.
---
It may not be a big deal on some servers but on Pagle with few Horde it's a definite issue.
---
You forgot to fear everything so you pick up more mobs
---
Have you tried dunking your head underwater for...well forever? I hear it works great.
---
Honestly I like the versatility, but the actual gameplay is tedious.  Same with pally.
---
This made me LOL, good job!
---
And what to cut with this? Gnomes... fresh Gnomes.
---
It's gated because of people like this...but you can't disregard the fact that everything in regards to progression is like 3x faster on retailer.
---
wish that happened in pvp ... but apparently not
---
Feel free to reserve it before you run the dungeon.
---
I play mage tank cuz I know how to get all the threat :o
---
I will gladly trade pressing a single button every 30 seconds for free loot.
---
Jesus you have played a lot... you are just way ahead of the curve
---
I'm sorry, but...no. Arcane Explosion is not meant to be used to finish up the mobs. It is the most efficient use of mana to damage and every mage who uses it should also have the 2 talent points reducing arcane threat by 40%. What I do is cone of cold, frost nova, flamestrike, and then jump around doing arcane explosion. Blizzard sucks in my opinion and is only needed if the tank cant maintain aggro and the mobs have to be kited, and only then is it important if the mage actually has improved Blizzard. 
---
We jump around because the mobs are slow and are less likely to hit us. We run away from you because running through the mobs to get back to you is how we die which is why we continue to jump until frost nova is off of cool down or until we can cone of cold them again so we can run around them.
---
Ive got a DE/auction poster alt who also holds my twink items/highly valuable stuff. Then ive got an alt for cloth. An alt for fish/herbs/alchemy reagents. So one alt is kinda my permanent bank alt who has a lot of gold whilst the others are mainly to hold stuff temporarily/buy recipes to resell. The last alt I have is a hunter with herb/skinning who will later have enchanting/skinning so he can run dungeons and DE blues (such as Princess from Maraudon).
---
Not once, did I ever say it was the best spec
---
Ah, I was only thinking of normal dungeons (still not cool imo) but raids would be even more serious. Good thing there aren't any world bosses yet.
---
Lockpicking isn't a profession. It's a class skill.
---
I like playing with new people because they usually don't do stupid stuff and if you explain something to them they actually do it.  
---
The worst people are the one's who do whatever they want and don't care about anything.
---
This is a well made card, I would be psyched if someone made the same thing but with body stretches cause I'm sure many of us already do muscle resistance everyday and dont wanna go over the top
---
I've been following a guide on Warcrafttavern and I'm so surprised by all the long quest chains that span the entire world. Some of them are incredibly rewarding as well, and this guide I'm following integrates them really nicely.
---
Yeah that’s a really good strategy. Skull is now my DPS target 👍
---
Except it does because people were farming bosses before level cap
---
I used to swe this guy fishing under a waterfall(thanks spy) instead of reporting id just mind control helmet him into mobs so he loses gear durability, when he got smart and removed gear then I just reported
---
I think you may have misunderstood why downranking exists.
---
Every rank of a spell costs X mana and heals for Y. Every spell rank gained after level 20 has the same healing coefficient.
---
I don't know the exact numbers because I'm on mobile, but here is an example:
---
Healing touch rank 4 costs 100 mana and heals for 400. Rank 5 costs 150 mana and heals for 500. Both ranks (and every rank thereafter) have a healing coefficient of 80%.
---
Downranking only matters if you need a spell that heals for less (DPS vs tank) OR if you've got a lot of +healing gear.
---
If, for example, you've got 500 +healing, both rank 4 and 5 of Healing Touch would heal an additional 400 hit points (80%). Since the mana costs don't go up with more healing, it becomes more efficient to use lower ranks and rely more on your +healing than the raw healing ability of the spells themselves.

[poor little fella](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/cartoon-funny-dinosaur-backpack-illustration-81638674.jpg)
---
What do you mean?  It's literally just going off of sequential numbers.  
---
After you are finished with the 9th major content patch, you move on to the 10th.
---
lol, that's not clean enough
---
Definitely. The only problem I've run into is when I agree to heal a dungeon as enhance or elemental, some people get in a tiff when I roll on dps gear. I'm there for the dps gear because that's my spec. I'm just healing so the group can actually happen. However I have my own little rule. I only roll need on one or the other. If I'm rolling need on dps gear, I'll only roll greed on healing gear, for example. I don't think its fair to roll need on both. Obvious exceptions are bop items and no one else in the group has healing spells.
---
Hunters should put away their pet unless an off tank is needed.  Too many wipes due to horrible pet management.
---
yeah that's not the normal way for trashmobs that's the bad way
---
My technique does a lot of damage +
---
Phones are not balanced for lean
---
Why do you think it’s useful? Do you have any experience at all in classic raiding? Do you have any experience in classic end game pvp? No, you have videos made by people trying to show off bad builds and trying to justify them.
---
You do you man, I’m done arguing. I tried to steer you in the right direction, but you are set on playing balance. Fine, play balance, be miserable, never get into competent raids, get two shot by warriors, have a blast.
---
Not quite, but mostly. Most of the center of the zone is 12-15. As you go north you see more 15-17, but not a lot. When you go south (just above Camp Taurajo to the 1K Needles line), the mobs are in the 20-24 range.
---
So just because their class has it available to them, now they have to share? lol...
---
Lähdetään!
---
It depends on your tank, and how quickly you apply the dots. As a warlock, this is a big source of contention. If your tank is pulling properly, they should be putting a Sunder Armor or 2 on each mob before focusing back on the primary target. If the mobs have a stack of Sunder, feel free to dot. If your healing though, be careful. Healing causes a lot of threat alone, and the extra damage can put you over the top.
---
Just trying to have some fun with my build?
---
Yeah but everything is dead by that point, so its all good!
---
me dat kind  of orc
---
That's exactly what I did, it can be a little rough starting out but eventually you'll catch up the mob level and it'll get a bit smoother.
---
-*shrug*- I'm not here to teach the world how to play. I don't care if they don't learn that the status quo changes at end game. I'll either explain what I can or find a new group. 
---
Seems like you need to take a step back.
---
you need to target mobs on the far left/right and work your way to the opposing side, to ensure every mob is being hit by swipe
---
takes a little more work, but keeping tossing out demoralizing roars inbetween and its not hard to hold aggro
---
having competent DPS makes life drastically easier.. cant make the same type of pulls with piss poor DPS
---
It's not false comparison at all. If you want locked chests you can level Blacksmithing. With BS you can open it. So now cut the bullshit.
---
Probably the most reasonable comment I've seen on the matter
---
A Warrior tank has an ability called Sunder Armor.  It's a stacking Debuff on the enemy. 
---
Wait for 2 - 3 sunder armor stacks on the enemy.
---
People act like they're just being nice, but then lowkey complain when they aren't acknowledged and post about the nice thing they did so everyone can give them feel-good points.
---
Yes, they should have at least thanked you.
---
If your post were really just about the image depicting "**For some reason this pm is the most joy I've gotten since returning**" then you wouldn't have included the part where you talked about how great of a person you are and the first sentence would be omitted.
---
Congrats, you're special now and I'm evil and toxic for bringing this up.
---
luna ui
---
Very nice. Been looking for something like this.
---
You’re a Skinner? Ok Armen.
---
Uh.. let's see. Its located in the Skills tab and only rogues have it. Yup, checks out.
---
Great, thanks.
---
I couldn't play in Shattrath either, nor could I enter Dalaran for the first half of Wrath iirc. Thankfully I updated my pc around the time Ulduar came out which ended that problem.
---
it depends on the group really. But if it's a BoE Epic, unless it's a full guild or friend group im rolling need.
---
I've done it a total of 3 times for myself and 2 other people. All 3 times worked perfectly.
---
Are you failing it?
---
Well I would say it also depends on whether you're embracing the vanilla spirit or not (aka 1-60 is a journey, vs it's filler before max level).
---
A lot of people are in-between, and some are at each end of the spectrum. 
---
I literally don't want to level fast, because the journey is so enjoyable. Even just walking between places is enjoyable.
---
This past Sunday I spent 17 hours walking in every zone in Azeroth in my lvl 30s. High level zones too. Just exploring for map exp, mining, talking to people and checking out places I used to frequent in vanilla.
---
Warcraftlogs.com....
---
Dude yes, its so annoying seeing people like breh im so stoned. ITs really not like that at all but w/e.
---
Addition to saving DPS by DPS meter performance: even more important might be to check if the top dps can still do dps in the future. A top dps mage doesn't help a lot when shit hits the fan and he's oom. In this case I'd rather save a rogue or warrior even if they're not top dps
---
Yeah, like, I get the random inviting being annoying, but if they are just whispering to ask if you want to join, just say no or ignore them. It's not that hard.
---
I spent hours hunting those buzzards, but I just learned that the god damn wings you need from them can be bought off AH for less than 20 each...
---
There are class and server discords
---
I mean, if it wasn't for him you'd get nothing.  So your not really losing anything.  That said, i generally pass on all chests, i don't think I've ever seen one have anything that impressive inside.  Definitely not worth getting butt hurt over not getting one.
---
Demo shout bug was fixed, but that doesn't diminish its value in aoe pulls. You want that debuff on the pack. Battle shout will still be your main source of aggro againt large packs. Like I said, you don't need to maintain aggro.. you just need time to clump the pack for the casters.
---
[The Rockpounder](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9413) from the last boss in Uldaman would be the next big upgrade before the couple weapons from Mara off Rotgrip and Princess.
---
Username checks out.
---
As a Mage, I fear what the gearing process at 60 will look like...
---
Yeah leveling a mage shouldn’t be too tough. Just hard being 12 in the loch getting ganked by 2-3 level 16 mobs
---
Sure and if you are talking about dungeons below like level 20 then sure. Lol of you have time to pickpocket everything then your run is way to slow and you are missing out on xp/hour imo.
---
Why not tank?  You have better aoe threat than warriors at that point.
---
Tell me about it, but I still mention it due to surrounding controversy.  Shouldnt be wearing a fast weapon anyway I think so the argument blows.
---
This was done with skeletons more than dead bodies iirc. They did change that for classic - there's a skeleton limit now.
---
I guess it's theoretically possible for gold sites to do it with unreleased bodies, like OP. But man, that'd take a lot of accounts just to get cleaned up by a GM hours later.
---
How can you NOT play a dwarf?
---
Very true!! You dont need anyone specc'ed for anything specific to kill every single raid boss. Yes, even Naxx can be done with pvp specs and since no one specs Prot anymore Warriors are laughing especially.
---
Gotta keep changing places, you won't have quests for the full level range in a single area, they are scattered.
---
How much data does this use on your phone?
---
You don't have to pay to be trash at the game in a pserver either
---
What does my soec have to do with bad mages?
---
I like to list my auctions cheapest and  w a lot of 69’s in them hoping ppl will be amused
---
Guess I ain't ever doing leg day... BECAUSE I NEVER DIE
---
alright these PSA you all are reposting every day are getting a bit old.
---
Somewhat true if it's melee pulling aggro off the tanks and they're still in position. If ranged are pulling aggro you're just slowing the whole group down because mobs are being pulled out of the AoE/Cleave ball and people have to run around and clean up runners. 
---
There are also plenty of situations where cleave/AoEing is slower, primarily because you have mobs that heal or other disruptive mechanics that you want to get rid of ASAP, so even if your DPS is higher on the meters from hitting multiple mobs the pulls are actually taking much longer. ZF is a great example of this where it's common to have packs with multiple healers that will just prolong the fights if you don't focus them down (and AoE/cleave doesn't hit their healing totems either).
---
What exactly isn't working? And remember, when you're blaming Blizz for shit, you're getting classic for free, you're paying for retail.
---
You're gonna be fine bud.
---
OP it's people like you that give me the most joy since returning. Anyone out there helping your fellow players out you're amazing and exactly what I love about this community! &lt;3
---
down-ranking in late game is due to the increase in +healing you will have from gear, and the casting times of high rank heals. At lower levels, it's kind of not necessary.
---
TFW you’re tanking with a 90% miss rate
---
The humblest
---
I think youll be fine. You can prbbly do dmg / heal when its needed.
---
Blizzard have tried perma-bans in the past. The problem with perma-bans is that if the account is toast then the offender just re-rolls a new one and continues the behavior. If the account is just suspended then it's not worth creating a whole new account to just be at the same place in a months time. Ideally they take a time-out, maybe learn their lesson and come back. If they continue to not learn after a few suspensions then they'll get perma-banned.
---
it's easy to hold threat with dps who know how not to pull aggro. gotcha
---
It’s not a passive thing like auto attacking with your weapon to increase the skill, you have to actively go out and level it up. You obviously have never played a rogue... you should make one and see what a pita it is to level it.
---
I really like ElvUi, but I cannot figure out how to make fonts bigger down below on your chat panels where it shows things like the time, etc. If I can figure this out I would go back to it. 
---
That and when you do the initial set-up and select what class you are playing it gives me like 10 slots for abilities. And I'm like WTF?
---
Yeah, of course this isn’t for everyone but I also feel like you’re assuming I do this every pull. I don’t even do it every dungeon. It’s just every now and then.
---
I’m a tank main myself since mid-TBC so I’ve had my fair share of idiot DPS, healers and off-tanks too. I know how frustrating it can be. 
---
But sure, if you play with a friend and he pulls aggro once every 6-7 dungeons and then kites it for a few seconds instead of immediately bringing them to you I understand you rather never play with them. ^^^^^^/s
---
I'm glad I'm on a edge lord like that. Yikes.
---
Lol. Instant delete upon realizing he is just bad.
---
Exactly.  I feel like this is the 100th time I've said this.  If you want to make an AoE group do it. But don't join one with a lack of AoE synergy and expect it to work, and decide that for the rest of your group, whether they want to or not.
---
Good. Better than them giving into you whiney babies. If you weren't trying to force them many would just be nice and let you roll, but I hope this entitlement causes them to band together and refuse. If you try to kick them from the group I'll wipe you.
---
Agreed. He’s a beast and what sucks worst about Uldaman is by the time you’re ready for the boss level and gear wise the stuff in the entrance turns grey.
---
Gross
---
Yeah, but that only works if everyone thinks like that. Evidently that's not the case.
---
Yeah isn’t that funny.
---
I'd allow it
---
Run to your mage instead for a friendly ice nova
---
Not gonna lie, that looks comfy af.
---
They're used for a few desirable things. I wouldn't vendor them.
---
Blizzard and flames trike both have higher damage-to-mana than AE does. AE does have higher dps though.
---
I loved the process of doing it. It was a ton of fun and being able to create something inside a game, and inside wow is just outstanding
---
This too. 
---
And I got downvoted. Bad players gonna be bad...

If your server is anything like mine, World chat is just cancer.
---
If you consistently do things that are likely to cause issues then it's dumb when it doesn't cause issues too.
---
Sometimes the mob doesn't run into another pack but it's still dumb to take the chance that it will.
---
Exploiting layers? This is news to me. What was happening?
---
I think layer hopping is shitty practice but just ask around for group invites you’ll eventually change layers...
---
funny enough, you would shit 1 last time after your dead. so who gets the last laugh then?
---
Most of my healing BiS is cloth so I know I will get a lot of unhappy clothies coming at me. But I always say ahead of time that I will need certain items. I never ‘reserve’ items in a group
---
Rogues unlock and loot. If you think there is something that will help someone else in the party, be nice and offer it to them. 
---
You wouldn’t expect a blacksmith to have everyone roll on chest that they are using their key they spent mats on.  You also wouldn’t expect non miners to roll on every node just because there is a miner in the group.   They leveled the skill, so it’s theirs.
---
If an item is worth 50g. Everyone should have a chance to roll on it. If you want it then buy it for 50g or get lucky and win the drop.
---
Generally speaking I think everyone should roll greed.  Though if someone insist that they need it I would tell them that they have to equip it.
---
How does one "inspect" a player in chat? Like to find out what level and class they are. I've seen screenshots of it but I can't figure out how.
---
Thank you for this, it's hands down one of my biggest pet hates when people don't.

Why disconnect in DJ ? That's the only question I had to ask.

A high level rogue was stealthed in the inn on the way up to the flight path ganking people who came through. Some people just really need to stroke their epeen and actually have control over something in their lives.
---
Specced resto on my druid. Swap 3 or so pieces with agi and Stam. Pop the mob with moonfire and insect swarm go into kitty(have the 60% chance for  40 energy talent). Rake then rip, then pretty much claw till they're dead. Pretty much can rinse and repeat the cycle for about 5 mobs then I just stay in cat till my mama comes back. Alittle slower but still fine.
---

---
Oh for sure, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't treat them with respect :). Also, thank you for your kind words :D.
---
It is a decently big server so a third of that should be a healthy population. Since it is PvE imbalance is a smaller concern.
---
You should also keep in mind that most (all?) pve servers have fewer horde so it wouldn't be a massive difference on another server.
---
Blizzard does a lot less damage, and they’d likely cast it at range, so they use the ranged threat threshold of 130%, rather than the melee of 110%.
---
How are the two licenses different? They both mean permission granted, don't they? They both have terms you need to agree to, right?
---
I found going for bonebiter easier.
---
I soloed the desolace quest solo pulling the mobs and had it done in 60 minutes.
---
I then went to sm and at level 36 went through lib arm and Cath.
---
I hit level 37 and had Bonebiter, Ravager, Herods helm and shoulders.
---
Now I can pull 3 mobs at a time grinding in desolace.
---
I couldn't even do the ww axe quest because of the ass fucking I took from horde players in STV.
---
Oh, the party frames? I just turned on blizzards default raid frames for small parties. You can just do it from the interface options.
---
No joke man. I'm cringing when I see people saying leveling as a priest is tough when all they are doing is spamming smite and WoP. C'mon guys, spec into spirit tap and put the rest into discipline. USE YOUR WAND. Or my least favorite, seeing all those warriors out there leveling with sword and board. Spec into arms and just use 2handers. Only use a shield when tanking. You don't need to be a prot warrior during the leveling experience!
---
Sniffing for exploits. 🧐
---
Well, you don't *need* a rogue to open chests.. 
---
You're also making the principal fallacy of comparing a class trait to a profession.  *All* rogues have lockpicking, and *only* rogues have lockpicking.  Anybody can be a BS, thus there's no entitlement to getting those materials since nobody is more entitled to it than anybody else.
---
You alternate/roll on nodes/herbs for those who can gather them because they are equally entitled to them as anybody else who can gather them.
---
You roll on chests when they can be opened because everyone is equally entitled to the contents.  Having a rogue to open the chest is just a prerequisite.  You don't get special treatment just because you're using your class abilities for the group.  That would be the same as mages charging the healer for water, or locks charging for healthstones.  
---
I'm sorry you're so upset here, but you're just plain wrong.
---
Qwert... you can figure it out!
---
That’s not how ocd works lol.
---
The difference is that we all grind because we want too. Not because someone stands behind us with a whip if we don’t.
---
You forget to say you got helped by others.

The gold value of an item on the AH is equal to the value of equipping it. That is how the value on the AH is set.

Ideal is two, but can go to four if they aren't skinners.

Mages do more damage than rogues, you are there for utility. Do your job.

Not sure if you have played mage but yes, cs will pull the aggro, even if it doesnt do damage. Unless the casting mob is close enough to the tank to be taking damage.
---
Thank YOU for trying it!
---
Dude these are amazing and I've been following from the beginning. Really makes me feel that much more nostalgic. Keep it up!!!
---
Lol nah, they are just bad and need carried by the masses. Alliance don't know how to pvp and have to always do it in groups. They've been all garbage pvpers, just strong in numbers. In a 1v1 I have not had an Alliance try anything unless they were red to me, which makes sense, since they're bad.

Revenge is very low damage but threat generating ability. You will get more revenges with shield block, but you will also:
---
1 . Deal less white damage which;
---
     A) Generates less rage and threat,
---
     B) Uses up your rage quicker so less rage for sunder spam which allows melee to do more damage
---
2. Increase mitigation at the expense of rage generation which means that mobs are dying slower, and over the long run is more taxing on your healers.
---
I enjoy complaining. Also enjoy ERP but nobody wants to join in barrens chat :(
---
Not terribly concerned, I remember wierd shit like this occurring in vanilla too honestly it feel pretty authentic to what I remember.

Also in pvp paladins were always a pain in the ass to deal with.

Shift click their name.

This seems pretty squat heavy, which is fine I've got an ass to maintain, but still
---
I have written a reply out to similar questions a bunch of times. Basically, engineering is very good at 60, but it is not necessary or probably even recommended to level it while leveling. Basically all crafting professions are good sinks while leveling them up. Even with mining, you will have to spend a whole bunch of gold to keep BS or engi at your level, with little to no profit returns. Most items made sell at cost or lower on the AH as people offload crafted items from powerleveling professions. Leveling a crafting profession will likely make it so you do not have enough good for your mount at 40 without luck or a lot of effort. 
---
On the other hand, that is perfectly fine. There are benefits to not having to start a new profession all over at 60, and to gradually do it over time. A lot of materials are cheap right now, so some levels will be inexpensive compared to later on. Also, it doesn't actually matter that much if you don't get your mount right away. It just makes it a little bit slower for a couple more levels. As long as you know what you are getting into, go for it, level BS.

That is pretty bad to have to click to resummon pet or swap it if it dies or if you need another one in PvP or raids.

Also, not binding at least water for those short out of combat moments to get a drink in is life (mana-) saving sometimes.

Now you move on with you life because it’s a video game. Congratulations you’re growing up.

Yeah no good solution for shammy. Rockbiter is steady good dps, but adds threat.  WF is next up but can be unpredictably bursty.

The Trolls range in level from 33-37. The lower levels are available in areas with a small number of respawns. You are competing not only with other warriors for the tusks, but for warriors being boosted by their friends / guildies and for others on general STV quests. The same is true for the opposite faction who can also kill you at any time. You need 30 tusks with a low drop rate meaning inbetween failed mob tags, dying to respawns, dying to alliance, you need around 80 troll kills. 
---
Next are the Charms. They are unsoloable at level 30 and sell on new servers for around 50s each meaning you need around 12g of disposable income + a few silver for liferoot.
---
It's far from easy.
---
Yeah that much would be a nice addition, could probably have it play a sound to notify you when somebody opened a trade too
---
This is like if a blacksmith could open the chest *without* a key. And in that case, yes absolutely the group should get to roll on it.
---
Got it. Weekday exploits only.
---
Well similarly in the US if a bank accidentally puts a ton of money in your account and you spend it, you get charged with theft even though the bank made the error.
---
Can't reset with someone still in the dungeon.
---
Only if you both catch the same number of fish each time, which is unlikely. One person is more likely to catch more than the other. If both were the same fishing skill and got the exact same number of pulls its equal, but that will rarely happen in game. It doesn't make you a monster to tap someone else's pool, but its polite to try to grab another. No one is going to blast you in world chat, but sometimes its nice to be nice.
---
That is entirely untrue and you artificially limit yourself to only having 9 major revisions in a game, which vanilla had 12.  
---
What comes after 1.9 in your imaginary versioning system?
---
Also, I don't know if you're just ignorant or what, but WoW has a second decimal in versions that is tied to minor updates like bugfixes.  No one talks about the number after the third decimal, because it doesn't have any additional content tied to it.  I.e.  2.4.3 for the last patch of TBC.
---
Drain tanking and fear juggling ftw.  Dual spec 4 lyf.
---
And I pointed out that druids still can't make up for their shortcomings in initial AoE threat compared to a warrior with the limited powershifting they can do. It's just as annoying for bears and tanks shouldn't be shielded except in emergencies.
---
Doesnt aggro anymore if not attacked, AOE on spawn removed

It took me over 20 years to try another hot pocket after a bad experience when I was young.

Their hoping come phase 3-4 the server is still super healthy population with pugs rolling and crazy world pvp. A lot of servers are gonna lose a lot of players between phase 2-4 due to pvp and people not realizing what world pvp is. “ lvl55+ zones held down buy big guilds farming hks off people still leveling or rep grinding.”
---
&gt;You can break the laws without having the license. 
---
Now I agree with you. This is what you should have led with, and answered with when I asked what the difference between the two licenses are. You clearly don't know what you're talking about well enough to explain it, so I'm still doubtful.
---
The most popular servers are somewhat like a big city IRL, more opportunity for raids, more competitive guilds, more people to kill, more people to queue for BG's, etc.
---
I am on faerlina and I get queues during prime time, but I wouldn't trade it because the level of play is much better and alot of the people I play with are ( more often than not) competent.
---
Smaller servers attract a more casual/new crowd, and in a version of wow where you have 40 man raids that stress personal responsibility I would rather group with more competitive players than fill raid spots with someone who isn't as good just because they are better than nothing.
---
Haha I literally just made it out of that cursed place.  Shout out to the warrior that I met in there that helped me only die like 10 times instead of all the times.
---
Saw a warrior running from 3 mobs. Hit him with concussive shot. Enjoy that repair bill :)
---
Does 45 per kill seem like too much still? It's still not bad xp
---
Hm should be pretty easy to test, theres plenty of Hobbs videos out there to show how much exp things should give when power leveling.
---
Ok, so you agree that you limit yourself to not having more than 9 minor patches within a major update.  
---
Your numbering system was added as an "alternate method" to Wiki and you're still arguing that a self limiting system is better when major software systems, [like GNU](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html), use the exact same versioning system that WoW does.
---
What add-on can I use to show floating healing done to other players?
---
Was he one of the 60s that abused the 10 man dungeon raids? And spammed them because the exp was bugged and not cutting down properly for 10 people.
---
You can always by being on your knees it reduces the difficulty by a lot
---
at first they thought "I am autistic enough to fight off the general masses and the tourists... they will all leave and the server will be better off for it"... only to find out that the server was over capacity of people just as autistic and hard headed as they are to give up on that level 8 shaman on day 3 when more servers were added...
---
Then again when they refused to take the free server transfer thinking "That will be a dead server, only the bravest and most dedicated will stay here" 
---
for people who actually wait the que times... it is a server for idiots, by idiots...
---
Wonder how those weapons get leveled? Oh yeah, normal gameplay. Lockpicking is additional and you can be level capped without it leveled. Just like professions. It's a class perk and no one who cannot open the lock is entitled to it.
---
Awesome, best of luck to you on your quest! :)
---
the stupidity some people express on this sub is hilarious, dont work yourself up with those idiots.
---
To me, there's PvPing and then there's just being a dick for no reason. For me to consider something to truly be PvP it needs to be reasonably fair. Part of the joy of PvPing is beating someone who could have beaten you. If they never could have beaten you in the first place, then what's the point? A lvl 50 killing a lvl 20 is just nonsense. That's not fair and just a dick move. Opening up on someone who is killing mobs and has 100 health or less isn't really fair and just kinda a dick move. 
---
Another aspect that is common in PvP is some sort of reward. You get gold or currency or items for it. Whatever it may be there's a REASON for doing it. Right now in wow, there's no honor, there's no items, you get nothing in return for killing someone else. 
---
So when someone kills me in an unfair situation (either level, health, cd discrepancy, whatever) and they get nothing in return, it just feels weird. It makes me think "ok? Cool man? You really got me /s".
---
You can, yes. But as I said, scales. In larger fights, you can basically imagine two horde teams fighting one alliance team in a battleground. At that point, individual skills starts to pale, and numbers win.
---
Iirc, I did the ZF farming before they nerfed the threat from demo shout. So our warrior would hold threat on the pack the whole time, and run in a circle around the blizzards. Zombies would just die in the blizzards, never really had to move them, since they would stay aggrod on the warrior the whole time.
---
After that bugfix, yeah you might be right.
---
;-; ... I sat there, body pulling the level 15's to which I had to pop like every ability each kill and time out my stuns and other shit. God forbid I got more than two misses and had to drink a pot!
---
Haaha, and from his perspective you're a grand nub thats using a bow rather than going in. Oh perception, perception.

Ah screech does single target damage, but an aoe debuff that causes threat.
---

Uh pardon?
---
Rank 1 of thunderstomp is 67-77 dmg per cast according to the tooltip, and its a 10secone cooldown.
---
if you're gong that deep into arms, you should go deeper and pick up mortal strike. 31/5/15 is a solid build. something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033050213525100001-05-500500302) . i would interchange between imp. shield block and defience depending what your needs. defiance is a must for tanking untauntable bosses.
---
that being said, what's your reasoning for going into prot? i mean, are you planning on raiding and being MT/OT?  i wouldn't put a single point in prot unless i was doing so. i used to do 31/5/15 but then went back to full 31/20 as enrage is too powerful a skill to give up in pvp.
---
Meh. If I see someone in olympus, I try to kill them. Has nothing to do with their level.
---
I’d assume that if you can get whirlwind axe early enough, it makes leveling super easy for a few levels
---
Nice I hit 50 this weekend but work life is slowing me down. :-/
---
It startled me so bad seeing that many i went waaay around before deciding to screenshot
---
Yep! He has a letter in his hand, kinda hard to see.
---
I think the main factor is the rational fear of attrition:
---
Interest in WoW Classic will wain, and the server populations will fall across the board.  
---
Full pop servers will be medium pop, medium pop will become low pop, low pop become ghost towns.
---
You migrate to a low pop server now, by Phase 3 you might not have enough of a player base on your server to have a healthy economy or fill a 40 man raid.
---
People have the long game in mind.  It sucks waiting for 3 hours to play now, but in 3-6 months I will be on a healthy server, and the low pop servers I am being offered free migration too will be empty.
---
If you're looking for fights with higher level people, go to the higher level zones. It's not rocket science.
---
Haha it's just a game and he's having fun! Making toons is exciting for some people

&gt; How is this not labeled as an exploit and punished?

[Bans started going out this week.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/fix-for-repeat-instance-bug-exploit/300823)
---
A random common node in a dungeon hardly compares, but maybe everyone should roll on rare nodes? The same logic applies to both, neither the rogue/miner/herbalist or the group could get it without the other.
---
All this comes down to the social aspect of the game, and if you're seen as a dick about something too many times that reputation will stick.
---
for OP specifically: https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/mac.html
---
That shall do for a repentance! Have a nice play session
---
How many messages did you skip by where I said "if the rogue is dropping group that's fine, no one else has to deal with your shit again" to post this?
---
They take a lot of damage and no way of Regen it quickly without eating after ever mob. It also only get wise not really getting any better without a healer.
---
If you have a healer you're a god at leveling.
---
Yeah, more rested would help.  I always logged off at an inn, but when you spend nearly just shy of 10 days out of just shy of 21 days playing, well....youre missing a lot of rested lol.
---
It also means some more grinding mobs for xp because you run out of quests, which probably slowed me down even more as a priest.  On a class that kills faster and doesnt have to rely on quests as much its not so bad, but i feel like as a priest you rely on that quest xp more.
---
Also i didnt do many dungeons because quite frankly there arent many people on my server that are my level.  If you do more dungeons you'll definitely have enough quests to do (plus all the dungeon quest xp)
---
Yeah, but /cancelform macros work very well, so you can use those
---
Erva is right- you can accomplish the level range if you do other things during the zone such as instances and such once you get higher.  The best way is to bounce between zones.  I have leveled 2 toons to 30 so far and I have split between loch modan and westfall each time.  Doing both of those should get you close to 19-20 for redridge.  Once in Redridge- you will need to split between redridge and wetlands as well.  Helps leveling go by much faster.
---
You downrank at max lvl to conserve mana in raids because some ranks are more mana efficient than others. Even so, when I was a raiding priest, you would cast your Rank 7 Gheal and cancel it before it went off if the tank didn't need healing. I was constantly prepping and canceling heals waiting for morogrim to destroy our tanks.
---
I think getting to 200 shouldnt be too expensive, past that when you start eatin up thorium is where it gets pricey
---
Yep. That's it.
---
They're MINERALS
---
This reminds me of my tanking experience in SM GY and Lib last night. Ask for a second to grab aggro on last boss. Literal 1 weapon swing and level 36 rogue ambushes the boss and unloads. Can’t regain constant threat after that point since boss was 36 and resisted me multiple times. The whole time rogue is yelling “WTB BACKSTAB”. Gave up 1/3 into the fight and just threw on my 2 hand and started dpsing. Still killed boss but frustrating I couldn’t get more that 1/2 second to gain aggro.
---
Awesome! I'm saving this. :)
---
Tfw people think the horde are the chads. Lol
---
From what I remember, it was a pretty big reduction in XP if you had a 60 running you through. Which is why you would only want you and the 60 in the group, and would want to run a dungeon they could clear asap. The goal isn't to worry about XP per mob, but XP per hour and how many times you can reset the dungeon in an hour. You are shooting for the cap of 5.   
---
The benefit of powerleveling this way is that it is low effort for the 60 to clear, you get about the same amount of XP per hour as you would grinding mobs or questing normally alone, BUT you also get tons of mats, gear drops, gold, etc.
---
Private servers are known for not having the correct values assigned to classes. Druids are pretty fast levelers, but you have to get cat form or they're slow as hell.  
---
I've been playing druid since before BC, and while I'm not the best player in the game I was consistently ranked top 3 in healing or DPS in raids (in a top 10 guild on our server). I'm pretty skilled with druid, I think my biggest mistake this time with classic was just not getting any gear and waiting too long to go to the AH. They're not as gear dependent as other classes, but they still need some gear.
---
Same here.  At level 55 with like 11 days /played.  But I also have 300 cooking, 300 fishing, and like 260 gold just from grinding some mobs.  Playing a lot is not necessarily the same thing as "rushing."
---
True! Although it *does* feel really good to be the proper spec too. I’m only around level 25 on my Pally Tank alt, but it’s so cool being able to run dungeons and work on a spec that will make me rank better... as well as for AoE farming.
---
Sorry made a mistake. What faction you at?
---
I'd be fine if it was at least kept to LFG talk.  Instead it's people talking about lore, politics, and IRL stuff that no one asked their opinion about.
---
Don't do it on Paladins either. We need to get hit and to block for Holy Shield, Retribution aura, and Blessing of Sanctuary to work.
---
One tick of golden fart is not enough!
---
This cracked me up.
---
Exactly. My monitor is way too big so i need it closer to center to ensure i pay attention
---
He's on a mac
---
I read "buff" guy as someone who buffs people but as someone who has muscle irl lol
---
But we can get over 16k armor and have allot of health. Absorbing crushing blows is a thing. Just cant get unlucky and get multiples in a row lol but bear tanking is completely viable in raids. Sure warriors are better but bears can definitely do it
---
That’s a good point, such as in situations where you run dungeons without a rogue, that locked chest would just remain there entirely unopened.
---
But I think when running groups there’s still the idea that every one performs roles to benefit the group as a whole. Obviously there’s the standard tank/healer/dps roles, but then there are class specific roles, like mages giving food/water, warlocks giving healthstones, buffs from different classes, etc. The rogue’s role, albeit loot oriented, doesn’t *have* to benefit solely the rogue, they just decide for it to.
---
I see the other side however, and you’re right in that the loot is moot without a rogue, but it still seems like it’s something that should be discussed before starting the dungeon.
---
After cat form maybe, but 10-20 they're pretty damn awful.
---

Ah, nice spot. Didn’t see the logo. Does apple not have a keyboard shortcut for screen clipping? Seems like something windows woulda gotten from apple tbh
---
Lot more significant for Alliance as it's one of the starting quests for Allies. The Stockpile cave in the north east corner. When you go in if you go down and to the left there are Kurezan Elites and Witch Doctors. They don't really cast much and are easy to farm + there isn't any "real" quests down there other than maybe to kill the Captain guy that spawns.
---
It's true though I seem to remember it getting slightly better.  This is probably not gear, talents, or spell dependent as much as party wide skill and experience. 
---
Vanilla was the realm of skill pushing more benefits then most of the rest. Though it is difficult to tease out, due to the skilled and veteran players being more willing to do their due diligence with consumables, buffs, etc.
---
Chair dips will give you massive triceps if you go to max.
---
Not to call you out or anything, but people who hack accounts don't start selling your stuff on the AH. They send any of the valuables off to another character.
---
You're either miss-remembering what happened or not being honest.
---
The progression helps to build up abilities. Besides the most important thing is to do it
---
Well considering OP is using a mac... none of that would work for him jackass
---
Very good!
---
Why would I need to rely on others to win fights when I'm a priest? If you play on a pvp server and level out in the world, you should always be prepared for some moron to come try to gank you. That's part of the fun of a pvp server; not just sitting there mindlessly grinding mobs with zero threat.
---
lmao this happens all to often from my bf
---
Please see the following link; IG yes Counterspell will pull threat.

https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2139/counterspell
---
Not running to your corpse is what matters
---
Yall heard the legend of Churp and the Tin nose?
---
Sure it doesn't *need* to be justified. It's a pvp server. We all get that. But I just dont see how anyone can find it fun to grief players who stand no chance of fighting back. The fun of pvp for me was always the challenge of overcoming a skilled opponent. Not clicking one button and poof they're dead.
---
I played backin vanilla so I’m not too worried about having the full experience of it helps me level a little faster. I have had some major issues with questie where I head out to a location that says I have quests there and then arrive and there actually are no quests available to me or they are grey. This has happened multiple times. What do you mean by upgrade issues?
---
Appreciate it! Been too long since my wow days, played retail for a month before classic because I was too excited and I guess I got too used to the hand holding
---
That's boss 😁👍
---
It has nothing to do with difficulty and everything to do with efficiency. You're 100% correct, the raids aren't as difficult as nostalgia has lead folks to believe but I still don't wanna mess around and wipe on them because people are too busy talking shit in discord instead of doing what they're supposed to be doing. Most "hardcore" Vanilla veterans will tell you that the difficulty of Naxx isn't the bosses. Its the other humans you choose to do those bosses with. 
---
This doesn't mean that I want things to be like a drill sergeant giving orders to a silent mass of people. But it does mean that I expect a certain level of "no bullshit" in groups I choose to play with. If RL is talking strats, you shut up. It's not your turn to talk. It's damn sure not time to start playing music in the discord channel at full blast or telling jokes and side-tracking everyone. You can do that shit in dungeons or when everyone is just hanging out. 
---
I also have respect for peoples time. Especially if they're taking time out of their lives to play a video game with me. I want to play with others who respect my time. I'm going to spend hours farming mats for raid consumables. I'm going to camp vendors for patterns. I'm going to want to spam BRD/Strat/Scholo repeatedly with as little downtime as possible. I want to play with others who have the same mindset and are going to be as driven and focused as I am and want to achieve the same goals and that excludes a great deal of the player base.
---
Welcome to vanilla WoW, where rogues don't really offer anything special to a 5 man. No cc, no aoe, no heals, no tanking capabilities and can't kite. I played a rogue in vanilla and on Nost so I know this quite well thank you. So that's what you're feeling now, being a rogue in vanilla. Has nothing to do with mages doing aoe runs without tanks. You're the one that needs some perspective and experience for that matter.
---
Models are made up of a series of 3d points. Scaling them is just a single matrix multiplication. If there are multiple models, you could do it in a batch run since they're all being scaled by a uniform amount. It's quicker to do it in-engine but barely. It's just a weird shortcut to take when it has these obvious side effects.
---
Eh
---
Nice man, downloaded!
---
From what I’ve seen, all pets are female. Has anyone ever gotten a male undead on this quest?
---
I've used those as well, just a pain to go out and farm the mats, but if they're cheap on AH I snag em and go out to ungoro to craft those too.
---
New folks are coming to zones all the time (especially STV). It's not unheard of to spam for an hour or two until someone sees the bat signal and wants to help. 
---
Besides, that axe is fucking dope!
---
Honestly, I'm about to hit 40 and it's not that bad.
---
Like 10-20 is brutal but beyond that it picks up.
---
If you're alliance you get this two hander from this quest in duskwood (the grave one) at level 28 and it really picks up from there. Just have a good weapon, or try to get better gear as much as you can, It's really noticeable.
---
Saw a rogue who was using it, so it's in
---
With brokentooth I'm pretty sure it's established you only need 4/5 max in terms of Sims and max uptime necessary. Why would most classic hunters agree on this if it wasn't the case?
---
Indeed! There's a lot of interest by women in a space that isn't a sausage fest, so we had quite a lot of success recruiting people prior to Classic launching and have pulled in a few more since. Currently the largest active guild on the server with over four hundred unique active players.
---
What if the OH has different DPS?
---
For people trying to avoid doing this.
---
My druid made a macro for
---
/s Are you going to Gather this herb?
---
If  get no answer, or anything that translates as "no" I gather it, Otherwise I leave it.
---
Well they probably buy all their spells sine they don't need to save for a mount lol
---
I disagree. Unless I have a bad pull (3+ mobs), I have no downtime. Kill until im at 25-30%, regrowth + rejuv, back into cat. Mana is usually full by the time I need to pop out and repeat.
---
Horde about to gank me? Stealth. Horde trying to kill me? Travel form. Im actually not looking forward to level an alt that cant do all of this.
---
I've received numerous blind invites. So many I said fuck it and joined. Last one I got was from Division VII.
---
Dum dum dum.... ass vanilla was during 2004-07 last I checked that’s not five years and also little bear wasn’t around back then # nochanges
---
This seems great, gonna do it this weekend when my gf is out of town and I'm binging!
---
&gt; You cant out run mobs in this game 
---
*Drood laughs in travel form...*
---
Clicking your spells for full classic immersion
---
That's more like it.
---
So this is what a cult look like
---
Yeah sprit is garbage.
---
I think mine is via the ELVUI I use but there are others for sure if you search curseforge
---
I killed a few people that I felt like were mobs. Killed a hunter 4 times last night, he only auto attacked me. Didn't even try to kite me. Same went with a mage. Only 1 spell. Didn't move. Either they were bots or 8 year Olds
---
Lots of zones in classic have weird quest hubs where you might be able to do 5 or so at one level and then then the next quests are all 3-6 levels higher than you. 
---
Ashenvale has one quest hub on the west coast by the beach that is lower level, early 20s. Then splinter tree post I wouldn’t go until late 20s
---
What is your intent? Blizzard themselves have said that it's the intent that's important. Do you want to switch layers to farm mobs? you get 0 hops because that's not what layering is for. Do you want to switch layers to be with your friends? Switch as much as you want.
---
I could care less if those crybaby ignored me. He missed my point by listing a few other bugs. Point is, there are very few bugs, that bugs exist in every game, and that it's probably impossible to eliminate them all before the player base finds new and exciting ways to break your game.
---
WoW is a dream compared to something like a Bethesda game, and most players have had ano entirely bug free experience so far, which is damned impressive.
---
Yes this has just been nerfed after the new Tuesday reset. See https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5jj56/blizzard_just_stealth_nerfed_xp_gain_with_a_high/  
---
It's not just dungeons, it's everything in the world too.
---
Yes, we are almost entirely girls and women. : )
---
You realize this goes both ways right?
---
&gt; ill just lie about not having skill to open then go back after the run next time.
---
Lol you act like rogues don't already do this all the time. That's why in my groups at the end, if the rogue "didn't have the skill" as soon as the last boss is cleared, and loot is rolled for, I kick them so they can't do this. I've actually had my suspicions confirmed twice, when as soon as I remove them from group and they realize it, they sprint back to try and beat the 60 sec hearth timer to unlock the chest. Pretty hilarious.
---
Most likely. I bet no more than a handful will do it past the first time....but in the end who knows if might reach a few more people where they will do something active atleast during flights
---
aoe mages get mobs trained on them. every time.
---
Saved this thanks seems like a good way to not melt into myself
---
Your UD character looks weird
---
Blizzard has not banned a single person for hopping layers outside of dungeons for more mobs or mats.
---
I wand until the sunders are up... then I whip my big frosty dick out and slap it all over everybody!
---
For Joanas 4 day 20 hour 1-60 back in classic, level 43 was the halfway point on his leveling time. Combined with ~44 being halfway on xp, its accepted that somewhere in the low 40s is halfway to 60.
---
Maybe a plank for the duration of the flight instead?
---
I’m kind of two minds about this. 
---
Yes, I rolled on a PVP server because I do enjoy PVP (even though I’m bad at it) and it can add a lot of flavor to the game. 
---
But the downside for me is when I get ganked continuously by ?? level Alliance when I’m minding my own and trying to quest. I work two jobs so I don’t have a lot of time to play. And tbh, the last few times I did, I ended up having to call it quits because I was getting killed endlessly and not able to progress. 
---
I guess in an ideal world, we’d have an unspoken accord about not griefing lowbies but our world is far from ideal. Maybe a system like, you can’t target people 5 or more levels below you or somesuch. So it preserves the feel but levels the playing field in a way.
---
You should take him for a walk
---
Well you're horde so it's not going to be half as bad, but let me tell you this: it's a slaughterhouse.
---
This. Anything else the rogue is without a party, maybe without the chat
---
......................
---
Not sure if youre trolling or not.....
---
Do you think Im talking about 2019 Hobbs videos? You do know he made videos in classic right? He "invented" the 1 pull SM runs as a pally and was famous for doing it everywhere.
---
there really is no right way, or rather the right way is situational. Sometimes you gotta burst heal, effective or not, but with no danger of course conserving is key and that's about it.
---
Oof level 44.
---
I'm fine with rolling for the chest and in the event that I win, doling out the chest's contents to whoever would like them most if I don't need anything.
---
Thanks, appreciate the work you're putting into this!
---
As someone that told multiple friends and this subreddit that people like this exist, I'm really enjoying playing on a PvE server and listening to my friends cry about getting camped for hours.
---
Like dudes, you signed up for this.
---
Then stop crying and play something else.
---
I find wayyyyy more alliance traveling in groups than horde.
---
Had my first experience with some stupid dps complaining about dying.  I was even trying to heal but it was an ele sham that'd open with chain lightning and died in 2 seconds.  Started complaining about not getting heals.  Healing really sucks when you are with a bunch of idiots.
---
A classic Jake and Amir reference right there.
---
I played warrior and tanked in vanilla MC and now I’m starting feral druids in vanilla, druids are good single target as they say, harder than warriors for group agro but I still manage to pull them off dps because no one knows how to focus target. My healer complimented how it was easier to heal me than their previous warrior tank.
---
I also main priest for raids in BC and pvp in wotlk and now I heal in low to mid dungeons and it was fine, no wipes. As a raid healer, I appreciate all the HoTs that is stacked towards my MT and OT to keep them up before a big heal is thrown in after a crushing blow, which druids excel on. It’s all about how well you play a class,  not how well a class plays.
---
Personally i would have deleted all their stuff and reset their characters back to level 1 instead with the promise of a ban in case they did something simular in the next year. Let them crawl through the grind once more is probably better.
---
I use ctrl+alt+printscreen to get screenshots on different monitors.
---
Should I expect a pretty bare-bones rotation for my rogue? I made an impulse call to play it based on enjoying it in WOTLK onwards, but never tried in it Classic/TBC days. Level 46 rn and compared to other classes, skills are looking pretty scarce (probably partially a result of 'em being allocated to stealth). Any experienced classic rogues got an opinion on this - am I in for a dull time?
---
That disgusting beard looks like a broom
---
Yup. The biggest thing that slows one down for dungeon runs is finding the group, but SM is always hoppin. I just parked myself in front of the instance to spam general and LFG, kept my heart at UC so I could quickly vendor and return (brill might be better, but I like having my hearth next to a FP). I only wish the other dungeons were as easy to find groups for on the way to 60.
---
I’m just happy I soloed RFK trash at 26 to get armored boar..
---
Yeah, unless you have a dedicated high lvl or grp that will help you finish this quest quickly, Ravager is the way to go.
---
Yea.. I had couple of runs where i had to switch from dpsing to healing/tanking because one of them died. And Brez if healer dies. 
---
Bruh if I wasn't there, you guys would've been wiped.
---
As a warrior, I am scared I will die IRL if I attempt this.
---
You gonna complete any of those quests or...???
---
I was 53 already and only still went there for the ring. Everyone else was below 50, and I would be really pissed if i didn't get it. I was a tank too, so i felt like i deserved it the most. So i closed my eyes before the roll, said something  like "come on, you know I should get it" aaaaand.... bam. 100/100
---
&gt; does anybody sunder when the mob's gonna die in a few swings, any how? 
---
Boy, do I have a reddit post for you...
---
Also fun.Same as multiple mobs with heals.
---
I once ran rfc with 2 dps 2 healers and our tank was a hunters pet
---
It was a great time
---
I think one of the biggest mistakes I see people making is grouping up to handle red or orange quests, when in reality they should be holding off on those quests until they appear yellow.  Otherwise there’s the very real chance you “run out of quests” somewhere along your journey to 60, leaving you stuck with a long grind.
---
Im talking about the Vanilla Beta. The Hobbs video of him running thru SM is from the original Beta.
---
wat
---
When Honorable Kills are released, is there a level  limit above own where opposing players stop getting honor for killing you?
---
Yeeeaaah, that might not be 100%a joke.  There's a splash screen in tales of androgeny with a harpy that's a spitting image if the screen you posted.  Just in the other one the harpy has a dick.
---
😈😈
---
If its a standard BOE, like say...wildheart gloves, whatever, just greed. If someone wants to out themselves as a ninja for needing on them without actually "needing" them, so be it.
---
When something like Dwarven Hand Cannon or Orb of Deception drops, I encourage my groups/raids to all roll NEED. Solves the ninja problem pretty effectively.
---
The only thing that has made the few pugs that I've done "slow and dumb" is these awful mages that watched Joker and think "I'm just as good as him, let me pull these 2 packs and AoE." They die, the aggro splits to the entire group and we wipe. Then the icing on the cake, the mage complains about pulling too slow and not getting heals.
---
had my pre bis boots drop had no Option to roll now i know why
---
Actually log off and dont DC/Exit game/Alt f4/close the program.
---
Pretty sure there will be additional free transfers before/after they remove layering
---
Inventorian

May the hammer fall swift and just
---
Leveling druid has been slow for me solo. 
---
Waiting until 32 for ferocious bite is kinda painful. Most mobs in groups or dungeons die before I can use combo points. Bleeds are slow and again, mobs die before their duration is realised. 
---
So until I got 32 I was leveling pretty much solo. Topping dps in single target situations now though. 
---
37 now and SM is fun, can also pop out of cat and do some healing or cast tranquility in an "oh shit" moment. Or if the healer is oom I'll heal until they drink. 
---
Don't expect to be any good AOE, but enjoy the speed boost with talented cat form and travel form. 😁
---
Play what you enjoy there is always room for every class if the player is good and friendly.
---
http://classicrealminfo.com/
---
i never said always need, just on valuable boes. its the only logical conclusion. a flask recipe translates into lionheart helm and devilsaur set, of course you need on that.
---
Yeah I have realized... you can't just do laps in a single zone on classic. You gotta do a route, then fly somewhere else, do a route... kind of a bummer not gonna lie.
---
Opening the box is free for the rogue, not the blacksmith
---
7pm till 6:45am here. It’s great, touch wood
---
It's funny because most arms warriors will pull aggro as soon as they hit whirlwind anyways. May as well just tank.
---
If you are ambushing or immediately dump your energy bar, yeah you're gonna pull.  If you dps slow and just avoid capping out on energy you'll be fine.  Feint is 20 energy and rogues shouldn't be GCD bound anyway (ours is 1.0 seconds).  Letting SnD drop for two seconds (the cost of feint) is what, 15% less dps for two seconds?  Two seconds of not fighting is 100% less.
---
 Gonna be that one guy in all of these threads that wonders how people are hitting 60 when I’m only level 33! Well done!
---
There's a repeatable turn in, I think for runecloth
---
Queues on Herod move at about 2600/h during the prime 5pm-10pm time so while yes a 2hr queue sucks, it's nowhere near the 6 hours it was last week or the 10 hours it was the week before. While I wish queues would be sorted, using chrome remote to jump into queue right as I leave work gets me logged in a few minutes after I get home. Completely workable.
---
Yeah, it seems surreal to me, after a quick calculation I realized these guys who have 10d /played had to play for like 10-12 hours every day since release, almost a month ago. My brain would just melt.
---
i see what u did there ;-)
---
When it scans it only updates the prices once, if prices change and you haven't scanned recently then an items price may not reflect what it's current rate is. I usually do a full scan whenever I get back to the city to post things, but do note that when you use the buy/sell tabs for the add-on it automatically scans and updates whichever items you're looking at.
---
Who are you in game? I am Partial [A] 42 Warrior.  Let us strike an accord and vanquish our mutual foes for ganking knows no faction.
---
100% for sure. And hopefully, this time people will take them.
---
Next time don't embarrass yourself with a thread in reddit , go directly to mommy twisting the facts around your most heroic deeds while fishing for that pat of approval.
---
Ravager is awful at 1v1,
---
Plus literally every group is warriors rolling for it.
---
WW isn't bad.
---
The stats on WW outweigh ravager tbh, but if you're just powering through get Ravager I guess.
---
It still seems unnecessary, but to each their own  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It’s the opposite faction, you’re supposed to fight for resources. I don’t understand the problem here?
---
I assume you mean when you are gathering all the materials yourself. It will probably take 10-20 hours if you have a 60% mount.
---
haHAA
---
Welcome to vanilla. Competition
---
Go into interface options and enable the Bottom Left Action bar. It will appear right above the main action bar.
---
Then go to Key Bindings -&gt; MultiActionBar and bind keys to the bar. My system is my top action bar is to just bind shift- to whatever my main action bar is. So my main bar goes ` Q 1 2 3 4 5 E R T and my bottom left bar goes Shift-`, Shift-Q, Shift-1, etc. 
---
The additional action bars don't shift when you change stances, so I recommend putting your abilities that are not stance specific on there. E.g. Heroic Strike can be used in any stance so I have it on Shift-2, but Charge is Battle Stance only so I have it on 3.
---
I shoot for 60% and let you manage you're mana/hp with a renew on. I also get locks who lifetap to 42 hp. Legit less than 1%
---
Oh, yea Archadeas fucked our group, and we had a decent tank... just the dps wasn't high enough to down him and he kept resisting a LOT of casts. Healer went oom and we all just died from there.
---
DPS. Some people say you'll want a fast offhand for poison procs, but DPS should really be your main concern, not speed.
---
You’re a sad person
---
I don't remember what it is now that I don't have a Mac anymore, but it absolutely does.
---
Damn dude I can practically taste the sodium.
---
Pally if you wanna raid and PvP. Priest on alliance isn't quite as stronk/wanted as on horde. Druid is great of you wanna FC in PvP and heal in pve. 
---
Honestly they are all viable. Pick what you like.
---
May have missed. Hard to tell. Looks like he performed some sort of action right after the charge that took rage but did no damage to the shaman.
---
Heh. Awesome.  
---
Blizzard is an onion!
---
They make people cry.
---
i'm sorry, the vanilla water looks awful
---
Alright, I just did it. Thanks for the vid man, great work!
---
Winterspring and Un'goro are very easy, made it in the first try. 
---
Burning Steppes is a bit harder, couldn't do it like you did in the vid. I kited the mob up and down the road leading to the altar. All the time. Took like 20 minutes and 3 mana pots, but did it.
---
And then my Friend the little Gnome in Silithus.... Took me like 8 hours because it was buggy as hell. Until I figured out the solution: Don't skill improved concussive shot, don't use scatter shot if Solenar despawns or resets the fight for no reason. Oh, and don't kill the little bugs, then you won't get feared and can kite him all the time. 
---
Good luck Hunters!
---
Rogue opens and takes a peak, if anything is really worth it he ninjas it and gets kicked. If not highest roller gets it.
---
Western Plaguelands is a place that exists.
---
Nice! I'm in a guild with Hopelessone! crazy
---
He should of reset after you popped mortal coil. 
---
I don’t think there’s anyway to win as a rogue without trinket if mortal coil is off CD.
---
Warlocks super strong by 1.12
---
i used 16gb of data since the 1st of sept. but i might use it more than you. idk the exact rate but if youre on a data budget, i dont recommend this method. the throttling is specific to your individual data plan, mine is not throttled.
---
My main is a rogue. I just unlock it for whomever wins and step away. Why? I’m not an asshole. If you think your kit entitles you to special treatment you are just a dickhead looking for an excuse for your dickheadedness.
---
Yup. Saw devil's tower in real life 2 years ago and couldn't stop hearing the TB theme in my head :)
---
Low/Medium pop makes sense. Asking lvl 60 players to transfer to a completely fresh realm is not right. Anyone new rolling there will be lvl 1. Server will be dead for months.
---
It's called a jam session.
---
This... we were breezing through most of it wondering why the level range... then Archadeas...
---
He's asking if it is a bug fix, or if they decided to nerf it.
---
everyone needing and everyone greeding is the exact same thing, but greeding gives an opportunity to ninjas, so why bother? the last part what you wrote is actually correct.
---
You gotta put them down as they are falling asleep and tired. If you hold them till they sleep and then put them in, you’re gunna have a crying baby.
---
Of course, teething is a bitch so you’re probably going to be dealing with crying one way or the other. 
---
Imagine being asleep in a nice recliner that’s heated, then winding up on a park bench. That’s basically what it’s like if they are put down when already asleep.
---
I think you're not wrong but you're not quite right either.
---
Druids are a pick that makes sense when you think of each subject with more nuance than that.
---
Warriors are the strongest main tanks in a raid due to their combination of shield block and ability to taunt, but they aren't the most flexible tanks. 
---
Need a tank that isn't expected to be tanking the entirety of some fights? Warrior is a good tank, Druid is better.
---
Need to gear up more than one tank at a time? Warrior is a good tank, Druid doesn't need to wait for you to kit out your raid's main tank before they can start getting in-raid gear.
---
Don't need a tank that fight but a debuff bot? Warrior can't, Druid can.
---
It's like "PVP Healer" isn't fine enough a definition. Flag carrier and carrier protector are two very different roles but both are healers.
---
That being said yeah I think the 15-20+ stretch puts a lot of people off. I think it can be used to build good "shift and use everything your class can do" habits early as you'll want to dump your mana in to 2-3 mob pulls in then bear form order to get through that range but if you come in to it expecting a single task you'll be really disappointed.
---
&gt; Probably because the tanks you've seen just suck.
---
&gt; 
---
That's pretty much what I was thinking, lol.  It wasn't lower levels though, it was ulda and ZF and mara.  The first was dual wielding warrior, the latter two was 2hander.  I've had some good tanks, interestingly in most cases they've been druids who manage to do better with aggro, despite my hazy memory that they were worse with it.
---
I wasn't really worried about the damage they were taking, and I felt they should be able to hold aggro pumping out damage with 2hander/dual wielder, but ive pulled aggro with one tick of corruption on the main target on some pulls, and that just baffled me.  I had to severely restrict myself more than usual just to not pull aggro.
---
Who said I wasn't prepared? Do you know who you're responding to? I think you're confused. I said I'm not obligated to answer the call every time I see someone fighting the opposing faction.
---
This is so awesome thank you so much for posting this!
---
GOing 3/3 in ishield block is actually considered useless if you have a weapon swing timer and time your blocks with the enemy, that way you get the 2 blocks it provide. the last 2 points in the skill only increases duration, not charges.
---
Then you drink
---
I polymorph them, mine the node and then kill them
---
Lol you’re the one with the problem man. When layering gets removed I won’t be sad about it, I know it needs to happen. I’m currently just using a part of the game to continue enjoying it instead of spending time waiting, which I don’t enjoy. 
---
Now, you said using layering is not the answer but you did not clarify why that is. See, it currently is the answer to quest respawn wait times for me and theres no harm done this way. To anyone. At all! Quit whining, and have fun waiting!
---
... what?
---
Tbh ive had more problems with mages than locks as a healer. If i need to heal only tank and lock and can get my mindblast off for spirit tap then usualy i can stay above 80% of mana. 
---
With las encounters with mages ? They go nuts for 5 seconds , then are oom and beeing hit by every mob in instance and over the one pull their overall damage don is below tanks . . .
---
I ran 15 SM instances in two nights.
---
&gt; Plus literally every group is warriors rolling for it.
---
Tank and don’t pick up any other warriors. Or only pickup ones who already have it. It’s also a fast enough instance that’s its less of a big deal.
---
Just go in with the assumption that the party is playing safe and go AoE only when asked to go AoE just be safe.
---
Actually it was super simple (and I was 15 at the time, funny to think about now..)
---
Since the NPC didn't actually do any actions, you just did an SQL query and attached the ID of your item to a quest.. it's all a bit blurry to me.
---
The server I played in wasn't popular enough to have to police world chat. Most of my time was spent assisting with quests that didn't function properly, helping people that were stuck, and banning botters/speed hackers.
---
On the other hand don't freak out if someone genuinely doesn't realize you're a miner or herbalist. I had a guy flip out on me to the point where he wouldn't even let me give him a tap on the node the other day. Just calling me a no life loser when I was ready to let him hit the node and give him a bunch of food to clear the cave out. You'd think it'd get through his thick skull when I say "Not everyone is out to get you in this game", but some people are ridiculously petty.
---
I can't wait to watch asmongold cry on his stream.
---
Exactly!  Full disclosure:  The "He ganked me posts" are annoying to me too.  But with that said...
---
While getting ganked is absolutely 100% part of the risks of playing on a PvP server...posting it about it to "shame" the ganker seems like completely fair play.  Why?  Because "reputation" is a huge part of why so many of us wanted to play Classic WoW.  It's part of the charm.  Knowing who the "gankers" are, etc.  And dovetailing from that, what does a PvPer and/or ganker enjoy more than notoriety? 
---
Are the posts annoying?  Yeah.  Is getting ganked repeatedly annoying?  Yes.  They're both annoying.  And they also both come with the territory.  They're the Yin and Yang of playing on a PvP server.  "Community" is a critical component of what makes Classic WoW, and whine posts are part of that.
---
Do not move inside flamewreath?
---
As a feral druid, i agree on this statement. My only points not in feral are for furor and improved mark of the wild
---
Just bring few stuff to change role with and you are set. Prefereable necklaces, rings and other unbreakable parts so it does not increase repair bill in case of spirit rez.
---
That said, at level 44 i am starting to find it harder and harder, probably due to my not up to date gear mostly and not by my spec.
---
Classic Wowhead?
---
Warriors are going to have legs of steel by the time they hit level 60
---
Rule 7: Low Effort Memes:
---
&gt; Low Effort Memes: Low effort memes are defined as memes that would not clearly be related to Classic World of Warcraft if text overlay or overlaid game logos/game elements were removed from the image. Most advice animal memes and label memes are considered to be low effort memes.
---
My biggest issue is the sheer amount of gear they need, otherwise I'd for sure play one.
---
I will add my .02 and say the best investment I've made is a 12 button mouse. It takes a little while to adjust, but between shift, and ctrl I have 36 buttons all without moving my hand from wasd and clicking freely.
---
Red dragon makes one that's around 35 bucks and has lasted me forever, or the razr naga is a more expensive choice if you like name brand.
---
Chair dips on a desk chair sounds like a lead in to long term back exercises as well!
---
So is it better to cast heal often or less often? I'm curious because since mana doesn't start healing after 5 seconds of last cast right?
---
I'm trying to manage my mana more efficiently
---
Layering is a change from vanilla. A small quality of life change isnt going to open the flood gates for all changes to make it retail.
---
Lots of ppl would be happy with these small changes with it still being classic.
---
There are qol changes that came out in tbc and wrath that were added bc devs were like "why cant we just allow players to auto dismount when clicking on an ability that requires to dismount, that would save some annoyances and still keep true to the game." Head dev: " o thats a smart idea, why didnt we think of that in vanilla"
---
Screw all of you with your hardon of #nochanges lol 😝
---
By female dwarf being bugged you mean not getting loot from princess?
---
There was a way to make everything in a dungeon respawn without physically leaving the instance, meaning you could just kill a boss, use the "dungeon layering" trick, and in seconds be killing it again.
---
Over and over.
---
Agreed... couldn't finish it. I thought youtube was screwing up at first.
---
oh no, I didn't even talk about PVP either... I am talking about how much closer the mobs get to the road on STV vs Dustwallow.
---
nice auctions, but why is your screen plastered with Free Action Potions (FAPs)
---
I ranked a RFC and refuses to tank WC so I waited to dps for a long time. But you get more skills and it feels more manageable
---
female orcs exist, and are lovely. Also, I DO LOVE some of the older models. Especially the really janky lookin' ones like the Belf model, or the old pre-1.2 Ogre models. I ALSO like how Live looks. I want to have my cake and eat it too
---
Lol I’m a rogue and hell no this shouldn’t happen. A real rogue lies says his lockpicking isn’t high enough then after the runs over goes back and open it himself. Jk though every rogue should let the party roll for it still. That should be standard.
---
There is a pack when you Dl the mod called tiny threat that adds it.
---
In game click the cogwheel and select Solo Plugin then Tiny Threat should show up there.
---
you're*
---
Appreciate your point of view! And can’t deny, better damage and better for lower level mobs! 
---
But that’s the beauty of a Warlock, you can do higher level content earlier and therefore be getting better compared rates from quests and the kill, PLUS great you dropped a few mobs quickly, but you have a low sustainability and will have pot up or bandage, Voidwalker offers much less downtime, again, imo, it’s just out of one mob and into the other! 
---
But that being said! I would imagine your a better player than me and can probably manage your resources better! So fair enough suc is better for you
---
"Hey guys can you wait a moment before applying dps to allow me to build aggro thx"
---
Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
---
Not included are roots. If there's a problem under a root, you have to solve that entire problem and then take the root of the answer. Same goes for fractions - if the problem is displayed as a fraction, it acts like a parenthesis (you solve the numerator and denominator first, then divide the answers: numerator by the denominator). Where does all that fit in PEMDAS, Idk, you just have to use common sense :P
---
GET OUT OF MAH SPAWN CAMP, DUNKEY
---
Superior numbers is a legitimate strategy.
---
If you're on a pvp server then it's fair game. If I see alliance scum mining a node I always go after them.
---
Correct, but literally everyone should know about the button on their keyboard... it's RIGHT THERE. There's no excuse for someone taking a picture with their phone when there's a dedicated button for it.
---
I can buy someone not knowing about/remembering a shortcut combo. But our public schools are failing our kids if they leave school not knowing about the print screen button...
---
I feel you bro
---
You sound like you're not enjoying the game, so why play it?
---
You talk to the guild leadership and ask questions that will be revealing. I'd make sure they have a discord for one. The next pertinent thing is probably questions about raid times / loot rules.
---
My guild on stalagg just merged with another guild to make it easier to fill raids and they still have to pug 55+ players in for MC.
---
The last question I'd have is what the guild expects from the player in terms of commitment. In my guild the expectation of core raiders is to be present for 75% of raids. If you fail to do so then you're at risk of losing your spot in the raid to someone who can be counted on to be there.
---
As far as the near future goes though most guilds are barely able to fill raids up, let alone be picky about gear or if players are even level 60.
---
So if you are a high level for your server I'd recommend volunteering to join raids as a pug, and if you like it inquire about membership
---
How are you so hurt
---
Layering is multiple versions of your server or instance.
---
Aka there is 1000 people in sw.
---
You only see 500 because half are on another layer.
---
There was a glitch allowing layering to work in dungeons.
---
People would abuse this in raids and dungeons by clearing to the last boss, change layers, the boss respawns in front of them.
---
Rinse, repeat, banned.
---
Glad I could help, this would also enable you to sort macros by number of "pins" and therefore show the most popular macros
---
yes it's ban evasion but you can't prevent him in a reliable way. They could implement hardware id but even that could be bypassed.
---
The players receiving bans were exploiting a layering bug that allowed them to reset instances / bosses to farm rare patterns, loot, etc.
---
I believe like phase 5 lol
---
if i am right this is dark iron dwarf
---
all good things happen in time, we'll wait :)
---
You might not quite be there yet, but my tip would be don't skip out on Swamp of Sorrows and Duskwood, there is some nice XP and grinding to be had there but  it tends to be much less frequented than STV.
---
Are you trying to kill me? Real talk though I'm gonna try to do this. I probably won't be able to consistently do 35 push-ups every 15 minutes, but I'll try.
---
If you have questie, quite often it shows quests that you aren't able to take yet, such as quests released in later phases, that requires certain professions, faction only, etc..
---
I literally started working out by doing similar body exercises during flights in WoW about 10 years ago, and it ignited a passion for exercise I've held ever since. They at least got me in good enough shape to walk confidently into a gym as a young teenager.
---
Totemic Recall isn’t a thing in Classic.
---
Grats on your 1/4 of a level.
---
Heh.  Lots of them but didn't give me great exp.  It's understandable, clearly there are a shitload of them.
---
From my experience leveling a warrior so far in Classic :
---
At early levels your abilities are all rage dependant. Yet generating rage is incredibly slow. People poke fun at Paladin for auto-attack combat yet that's 90% of warrior gameplay. Charge in, hit Rend, refresh Commanding Shout if needed then use either Sunder or Heroic strike if/when they light up.
---
Then you don't have a self heal and even if you did carry over some rage it'll be gone before you can get to the next mob.
---
God forbid you're forced to take on a same level mob without being able to charge first.
---
Yea Oki but my overpower is currently weak. I guess it will be stronger once I get some talent points into it etc
---
To do it decently after 40 you really need to spec in to the tank talents(improved block, extra armor, etc to get enough mitigation that the shadow priest healer won't be going oom nonstop - gl getting a heal spec healer) which isn't as good for solo leveling(ie, same reason healer isn't going heal spec), and it still falls off hard after a short while.  
---
But yeah, before Ulda nearly every shammy should be down for tanking.
---
lol wtf did they make for you. That was no hot pocket...and the pepperoni pizza is the best.
---
So now we are going to audit every single player every time they hop layers a couple times? Time to quadruple blizzards GM team.
---
While we are at it lets audit every single trade to look for gold sellers.
---
It doesn't matter
---
I needed on the staff because I was rocking some level 13 +1 stat stick. It was an absolute upgrade. I know it's a better priest staff...but like i said, maybe he should click Need if he needs in a pug.
---
You can certainly do whatever you want really, but it wont be optimal, which isnt a big deal to some.
---
I know, but I think you are missing what the others have been saying.  Prot can be fine, but it's still at a severe efficiency disadvantage compared to other specs.  Maybe you guys are talking past each other.
---
I don't do engineer because of how annoying it can be. It's essentially about gathering a ton of metal, then crafting them into useless ingredients, then finally crafting some final product that sells for 1s.
---
Make sure you get a good amount of sleep every night. You’ll likely be awake for maybe a full 24 hours once the birth happens
---
i would be careful with that. thats  skirting the line of harassment imo and if someone did that to me i would probably report them.  fighting over nodes is part of the game. a player preventing you from playing the game is harassment. learn the difference.
---
Yes! This version pretty much works on retail, but some buttons turn invisible because retail doesn't have some textures that classic does. If I manage to change those to retail versions it should be good to go!
---
I haven't dedicated 15 years of my life to speed leveling.  Its taken me 7 days played to get to this far.
---
you are quite possibly the worst cartoon i've ever seen what
---
I always open with a cheap shot into slice and dice. Is that bad? (level 58+ dungeons)
---
Whats worse, they will complain if you roll for a dps upgrade because you are the tank, so you should only roll for tank items.
---
I can somewhat understand this mentality for bis gear, but through the leveling process?
---
Sometimes I go after them. Recently i was poking some mobs in Alliance dominated contested zone and got beat down pretty much immediately. Then pursued a 20 min period of me getting back up and attacking this group of 4/5. 
---
I killed a few of them a few times before I fell (I pretty much count that as a win) , but eventually gave up when my Resurrection timer went above 2 mins. lol
---
In Star Wars Galaxies if a player had a skill you could train it from them. (Pre NGE)
---
Wish my dog would chill w/me while i played.
---
The trade window did open though, does that happen if the other person block trades?

I've been almost entirely leveling through tanking dungeons since like WC with some questing; almost all of my groups have been really cool and enjoyable. I just hit 40 and have tanked god knows how many SM groups with only one that left a bad taste in my mouth. 
---
DPS can be annoying, especially AoE, DPS but it's just a thing you kind of have to accept as a tank when you're not grouping with people you know are competent. Dying a lot and pushing through a dungeon is how you learn it, and then you're able to prevent it from happening in the future. It can be rough but after one or two runs you generally get it down.
---
shouldnt be taking you 30 mins as a tank dude, sounds like you are getting on a lot of blacklists if its taking you any time at all as a tank
---
Nothing in particular, only the obvious things. I try to die as less as possible so i don't waste money on repair bills. I only learn spells i need. I greed on everything and vendor everything i don't need. That's basically it!
---
Shiiiit 
---
So at what point is blizzard going to take notes on the popularity of classic and rolls back the horrifying homogenization present in retail?
---
I really want to see BC now.
---
The horde equivalent exists in TBC content.
---
And you know what? That's okay. #myclassic
---
Yep - mob justice.  It's why here and in the real world you don't let hordes of angry people pass judgment and place it in the hands of neutral arbiters.  Blizzard is not exactly 1:1 comparison to judges in the real world, but it's the same idea.

---
pode crer vc também é
---
I dont think that the server cap will be the cap 1 layer has atm. I think that they just remove the layers and the queues stay the same
---
I'd wager this surge of retardation in the mage population is due to the people flowing in from modern WoW. They are used to just AoEing down half the instance with no effort and only the mage has so much AoE that it can even get away with in solo leveling in Classic.
---
Howl adds a buff. Melees are already right-clicking every buff that doesn’t directly benefit them because of the buffcap and how careful they need to be with buffs, since they don’t want to push off an important buff with a proc when they’re full consumed up. 
---
It’s especially true right now with passive enchants and other things counting towards the buff cap. 
---
Oh and wolves are pretty much equal to cats in a raid setting anyways. Regardless of you using trueshot or not.
---
This early on im seeing a lot of people selling iron ore/bars and heavy stones for cheap and turning a profit on making Iron Grenades in bulk - you could try that to stock up some gold and buy the mats you need to level
---
Also- 2 finger taps are right click. 
---
Check the "guestures list" in the steam link options under the mouse type for more.
---
Pff we fly Bats or Wyverns, get wrecked Gyrphons.
---
In early vanilla It used to be at the start of a cast, now the heal isnt "cast" until the end.

Take phone out of pocket, unlock, take picture, send picture to imgur, type in the link manually to your browser to post on Reddit?
---
I honestly don't see how mobile is in any way more convenient.
---
Stopped 15 minutes after you never have to worry about taking damage or the dead zone rofl
---
Oh thats a good addition.
---
Another good guide is Joana’s guide but there is no add on. It’s just a website. But it’s much MUCH more polished than Zygor.
---
Thank you! Any feedbacks are welcome
---
Elk buff bars does this better. 
---
Get the beta version off the curse client. 
---
Also really helpful for adding bars to track target buffs and debuffs.
---
I have the staff of westfall so not really good. And I don’t have improved overpower either as I took 5 cruelty first. I planned on respecting at 40 for MS
---
Usually bind my most used abilies to the easiest buttons to hit. So 1-5, e q r t z x c, mouse buttons (scroll wheel and side buttons)
---
Or same buttons with shift/Ctrl modifiers
---
Stuff that I don't use often usually gets clicked or has keybinds that aren't very convenient to hit.
---
Atlas loot
---
It's not that they are unpopular but in Today's age of meta builds/classes, druids are excluded since they are a jack of all trades but a master of none in vanilla. 
---
This isn't to say that people don't enjoy playing them.
---
works for warriors. Diving right in will take 1-2 levels to adjust, since you might have done quests already that shouldnt have been done yet. playing with another person will just have you grind more, other than that it should be fine.
---
It's not intended and it's been patched in the version we're on. It was patched in 1.10, the patch after AQ was released.

It's really just the frustration of the players they attack that they crave. I've been corpse camped by gnomes before +10 my level. Then again I was in the wetlands, kinda asking for it at that point xD. 
---
It might just he your server ratio, you can look up the percentage of horde vs alliance for each server classic and retail. 
---
Higher percentage of horde is going to cause more type of this behavior all around
---
You are correct.  Any casting in stealth should break the character out of stealth.  This applies to everything with stealth.
---
Oh no, but that's a good suggestion! For now it needs to be added from within the window's text box
---
Yeah, I agree completely, I’m just talking from a pure DPS standpoint. I’m all for ret raiding for their insane utility, ability to instantly jump in throw up RF and grab a pat, improve raidwide healing and dps, even if they resort to going nightfall, extra LoH, BoP, Freedom, etc. make for a great addition, I just wouldn’t expect much from their dps
---
This made my day and satisfies my OCD.
---
Many thanks, kind stranger.
---
I think chac models look better now then bfa
---
dunno what to tell you man, but when I got bear at 10 my dps went way up. sure it leveled out by the late teens, but it's still good when coupled with spells.
---
&gt; power button + home screen button, YW
---
Lol do you think he’s playing WoW on his phone
---
Let me know what time ur doing this at. I'm a warlock on herod as well, I'd like to go through the barrens with you. 
---
I may be horde, and I may cannabalize your corpse a couple times, but itll be fun!
---
Again that is false, you cant equate different knowledge to knowing less, you said yourself that you have no clue what mythic+ is (which is fine) but does that mean you know less than a retail player? No.
---
The mechanical knowledge alone required to raid or do high keys dwarfs what is even needed to CC and LOS in classic.
---
Just because the people trying it out suck doesn't mean everyone in retail sucks, the ones you are talking about are bad players, whether its classic or retail.

Managed 101g by level 40 Just bought my mount
---
Literally nothing your level or below should be able to kill you as a druid. Your mana regen should be high enough for you to pop a downranked healing touch for more than a mob can damage you in the time it takes you to regen back to another healing touch. Even if you're literally sitting in caster form hitting the mob with your staff and just healing yourself occasionally, that mobs is eventually going down, even if you're oom. If you're not a cow (Warstomp), you can stay in Bear and Bash on cooldown for a break to heal yourself, or Root/Hibernate the target to heal.
---
I appreciate the generosity and I try to help others as I can, too, but I feel like certain gifts are just wasteful. If you are level 13 and playing a new class, completely new to the game, or with little knowledge of classic, there is a good possibility you won't appreciate the gift of a wand and it ruins your discovery of how awesome a wand is later on when you normally would finally stumble into one on your own. 
---
If I were to be giving out gifts like that, I'd be having conversations with people first and make sure they actually want it. When you just hand people awesome armor/weapons, I get it's a nice gesture, but you are kind of making it so they can't earn that gear on their own or learn the actual value of said gear, and that takes away some excitement from the game longterm. 
---
Personally, I typically stick to armor kits (which just improve the armor they already have), food/water, hp/mana potions, and profession materials (after finding out what professions they are trying to level). Gestures like "free bags with mats or something of around equal value" are also nice, because it allows them to learn the value of the bag through acquiring needed materials. It also gives them some agency in the situation, which is always respectful.
---
The idea isn't to make someone feel lesser than or coddled, the idea is to interact with them in a small way that hopefully increases their enjoyment of the game.
---
B is normal.
---
Your idea is not bad at all, though.
---
Oftentimes that does nothing cuz no one shows up to help
---
Don't  forget the druid talent that lets your regen continue while casting...
---
Neat, still scummy though :)
---
no niin
---
I don't see nothing wrooooong.
---
Cool, thanks for the info. I am definitely still learning. I read about downranking the other day but haven't really experimented with it yet. I just use my strongest spells and chug a lot of mana potions.
---
Play a hybrid class and you learn that very quickly. Really wanting to DPS in a dungeon? Sorry you get to heal. You should have known that when you rolled Druid though. Eventually you get used to it. I’m still a piss poor tank though.
---
Dude get to your first dungeon then decide. Dungeons are where its at. Its technical punishing and very fun. Where your skill and class shines.
---
Fuck, I won't hit 60 until probably Friday or the weekend, which is is about when most other people playing no lifing after work will hit it too. Swiftthistle has already shot up 2g a stack to 15-20, super regret not stocking up last week. Guess I should start buying hella thorium, copper, mithril while I still can. I'm doing engineering for PvP purposes, so I suppose this process is all but required.
---
Man, I wish someone would make this addon irl
---
What do you mean by "the top", the minimap? Or reorder the list?
---
At a certain attack speed frenzy will be up 100% of the time. I think it's 1.6s or quicker.
---
Your problem isn’t necessarily classic but some of the players who haven’t shaken the retail mindset of aoe everything to death. We had a warrior charging and cleaving in our SFK run couple days ago and we wiped 3 times. Kicked him and we 4 manned it no problem. and it was really enjoyable. Try and get a guild and go with some of them, if not make sure anyone you invite knows how you want to run the dungeon and mark targets etc. Eventually people will get it.

Give it a shot I never played back in the hey day and only played for like 2 weeks 4 years ago im totally obsesses with it rn
---
I also played a rogue in vanilla. Thanks for the conversation.
---
Problem is, I was completely new to healing. I played lots of WoW from 2004 to 2008, but only ever as a DPS. So when people tell me the wrong thing about healing/tanking... My first thought was "am I the dumb one here?"
---
Thankfully I know now.
---
I didn’t either til it appeared in all its glory 😂😂

Still searching also, tried playing with RA2 but nothing is as simple as inline was :(

The biggest thing I've noticed is ElvUI is ready to go out of the box, but TukUI requires more setup. I could be wrong, since I haven't used TukUI since WoD

There are a hell of alot of level 60's on on Mograine, i know wowpop isnt 100% accurate, even when you walk around org most 60's i see have FULL pre bis already, and now we know why from looking at blizzards latest bluepost about layering in instances to farm it easier.
---
Pro tip: make 4 separate macros containing /join and /leave for lfg and world. It is so helpful being able to jump in and out when necessary.
---
hey buddy, i have no problem with what you were doing and i think it's funny EVEN THOUGH i've never done anything like that myself
---
I want to add the ability to track the amount of a certain item(if it is linked) to help with that!
---
I have been on and off teaching myself how to make addons just to make a checklist addon exactly like this. This is awesome and has saved me a bunch of time, thanks!
---
Nice, thanks for the tip! Just hit 40 and got mount so I’ll try to aoe with ice barrier and mount and see how it goes. Good to know I can respec and be fine though :)
---
Don’t go AFK in a PVP zone boys
---
This is especially true on my server lol Thunderfury  also should have used original skin
---
If you are in a hurry to level, it's the best way.
---
When someone says that leveling is too slow, the only thing you can do is tell them to grind dungeons, or quest better.
---
I'm taking my time leveling, I've been playing since launch and I'm only 32 on my Paladin main. I actually like questing and only like to run dungeons for gear and quests.
---
blizzard isnt dumb man. they have logs of everything you do.
---
Just change layer...
---
its more the animations then anything idk just bugs me
---
Based on your comments I really want to say that you might in fact be the problem. You seem very angry. Maybe take a break for a couple days my dude.
---
Got to admit as much as I love the weather effects 24/7 it kinda gives me a headache.
---

(For anyone that might as well too lol)

it's one of the things I did in the first 5 minutes of logging in on the 26th.

If u steal anything

I tanked and solod with an Undead Warrior in Vanilla, my warrior this time around is an Orc.  Why?  +5 weapon skill with axes.  Missing less is all it took to feel the difference.  I'm not worried about end game as I have no desire to raid, but both races have their upsides in pvp on a pvp server, stun resist or fear break are both rad racials.
---
As far as spec goes I'm going fury/prot hybrid this time around with a shield instead of two 1 handers for leveling, this gives me way less downtime but the consideration is always always keeping my 1h and shield upgraded every two levels to the best I can get my hands on and funneling all my resources into my warriors gear so it doesn't feel as painful.  Not for everyone but I already did the warrior grind to max level way back when and I can't say I want to do it exactly that way again it was brutal.

Come join us for leveling and then dominating all aspects of PVP content. We will be THE leading horde pvp guild on the server. Open world PVP, ganking, camping, and steam rolling battlegrounds with premades are all in the plans. Occasional pve for gearing as well will take place. Participate in all of this while laughing, and having a blast from the past with friends.
---
-Not zerg recruiting, be part of a small tightknit community and make a meaningful impact rather than being just another number
---
-Leadership and core group have extensive high level pvp experience from vanilla through BC as well as other MMOs
---
-ALL levels, and experience are welcome as we are leveling, we will reassess our needs and requirements as we reach 60
---
-ALL classes are currently welcome
---
Please DM me if interested
---
in lieu of this addon i always found whispering myself an effective way of remembering everything.
---
hell yeah
---
Anyone that can open the chest rolls for it. Rogues blacksmiths with keys or engineers with charges. 
---
Only herbalists roll for herbs/rotate and only miners get nodes. Same applies to locked chests.
---
Once you get into BRD its nice to have at least pure tank, or pure healer spec, otherwise from what I've noticed the dungeons are a lot harder.
---
Angwe bro. Angwe is the patron saint of griefers.
---
It's mind-boggling that people on PVP servers can't grasp the simple concept people
---
You're not a dick for killing people of the opposite faction. That's part of the game. 
---
What makes someone an asshole is *going out of your way to prolong the suffering of someone else by targeting them specifically for no gain of your own*
---
Like the people telling you that you should camp those players you killed
---
Thanks, will check it out.
---
I'm on stalag and I used to be peaceful. Left ally alone. Until they started corpse camping me in groups.
---
The level 60 shadow priest camping me last night in arathi highlands didnt help either.
---
I kill all alliance I see. And if you all are too pussy ro handle it then roll pve.
---
I fully expected to die plenty. Still do. You should do the same.
---
Your point still stands though, blood DKs were borderline immortal lol.
---
I'm seeing a lot of complaints on reddit but fingers crossed most of my runs have been fine. Maybe people just remember the bad runs more. 
---
Yes BRD is kinda buggy. And it's long. 2 hours is not even unusual. 
---
Also you can't get 'left behind' if you're already doing BRD. You're far ahead of the curve.
---
A loser that will bathe in alliance boomer tears
---
I grossly underestimated how much everyone uses the AH....I think a special AH version might be good
---
Just stack that nature / generic SP and get to murdering.
---
Even with just Phase 1 dungeon gear, elemental can get 316 total spellpower with the +30 weapon enchant. Which is kinda insane.
---
Much higher with MC and Ony drops and a mix of T1 legs and helm.
---
I really dislike this and similar addons. I feel like half the experience in classic was finding the quests to do and figuring out where the objectives were.
---
It's always a fucking cat form druid.
---
Getting ganked while leveling peacefully alongside several members of the opposite faction- undead rogue.
---
Fighting a mob near an ore I'm trying to get to and it's gone- cat form druid. 
---
Every time.
---
I think you missed his point entirely.
---
Maybe I can uninstall MQ, now. One less addons is always good.
---
He's the only druid in their raid group lol
---
I thought you were talking about the warrior video not the tbc paladin
---
If the pull hasn't happened yet? Sure. Otherwise follow the order. You'll get through them a lot faster if you kill them one at a time instead of attacking three different targets until the healer goes oom and you all die.
---
Not that I expect you to listen. Hopefully you do though.
---
Making the game way more convenient/casual is something you think you want, but you don't.
---
If your all about 40-42 he feels like a raid boss. We kept getting him to 20% before getting overrun.
---
Get the Azshara flight path
---
I have no hate towards streamers.... They make cool shit happen in wow
---
More than just lvl 60's were doing this. I saw many messages in LookingForGroup on Whitemane advertising Princess runs where they would "Skip all trash, fast princess kills". The only way I know to skip all the trash to Princess is using this explain, and they weren't level 60.
---
Basically you're saying you're triggered by the words "retail tourists"? Casual players who play on retail that joined after a certain point have a different set of knowledge than other players that might have played since release. They thought they'd give WoW Classic a try and their knowledge no longer matches the requirements of the mechanics. That doesn't mean they're stupid, that just means they're just lost and not meeting the expectations of the locals (players that played vanilla at/soon-after release). This is no different than someone traveling from America to Japan and not realizing that they should take off their shoes when they enter a home, walking and eating, and not knowing what to do an empty soda bottle after leaving a vending machine. The *average* american might be lost in those situations, but there are definitely other Americans that are familiar with the customs of Japan that would have no trouble with it. They are both tourists, but when people complain about tourists doing crazy things when they visit, they're not complaining about the cultured one that knew how to do everything right, they're complaining about the loud belligerent ones that they noticed. I'm saying "these damn tourists don't know how to play" and I'm not referring to you, I'm referring to the casuals from Retail that don't know what's going on.

those people won't be banned and it's adorable you think they will be. Only the dungeon farmers will be
---
This is true rogue. Keep you abilities stealthed.
---
They should unlock it but cancel opening it, then initiate the roll check
---
P V E servers exist. Move.
---
Great idea though! I have been incorporating this kind of thing since I came.back for Classic, but I really like your set numbers. I have been doing a bunch of dumbbell work also as I like the variety and the way my arms look after. (Tehe glamour muscles)

Oh i took it as 30 mins to find a group, idk if its quite 30 mins but yes the clear into sunken temple is a bitch

I was really hoping he would be in the Barrens when the “I bless the rains down in Africa” hit.
---
Too many trees.

Today I learned women are pets
---
I mean, ground clutter makes herb hunting more difficult, but...I'm not going back to the sprig of fern every 40 feet on AstroTurf look. Strongly agree, the water looks so much better. (Also as a druid, I spot fishing pools from underwater...)
---
It does but if you're trying to speed a run its the only way.if anything ask for a few extra seconds to generate aggro otherwise you're waiting 20 or more seconds for your healers to finish drinking. Especially when you're level ends with 7, 8 or 9 since mages get new water at 30 40 50 so you're using the slow water.
---
Normally I'd agree but in this case I literally cannot read the chat box, which I assume is the point of the post.
---
Right but in the same way that it's only the fault of old people when old people are scammed. Not everyone has the experience and savvy to protect themselves, certainly not the first time around. 
---
Plus a ridiculous number of people are living with mild-to-moderate sleep deprivation in the US, which is (I think) the game's largest market. Lots of those people are going to be sufficiently impaired by lack of sleep to fail to properly read the prompt they're clicking through. 
---
I'm not saying Blizz needs to jump on this or make it a priority, just saying that I have great sympathy for anyone who falls for it.
---
I care
---
If you steal a quest item or chest when I pulled all the mobs in front of it, I hope you step on a rusty nail.
---
hell ya, 2h warrior geared is big dick energy and helps if silence/oom gets too nasty
---
Alliance paladin looking for a guild to play with on the server benediction. Pretty casual 31 year old looking for a few friends to level and do dungeons and maybe raid on day! I like pvp too! NA live on the east coast can play a few hours most nights.
---
I wonder if it has something to do with the weapon buffs shaman get. Maybe windfury/etc.... effect this
---
The stupid, it hurts
---
Blizzard said it doesnt.
---
So lol it doesnt.
---
Also, Shaman can 100% tank anything until raids.
---
They and Locks were crazy. MoP and legion it felt like you could clear a raid with locks, dks and like 1-2 disc priests.
---
Yup! People have been doing this since day 1 and it wasn't till dungeon farming that they acted. Blizz doesn't care about you layer aoe farming trolls sadly
---
Yes there are a few raid mechanics that you can completely ignore if you can have 30+ sappers go off at the right place and time. Nef phase 3 is a joke with a raid full of engineers, the adds just pop.
---
And yeah battle chickens for now and arcanite dragonlings when mages go fire are both strong buffs
---
Who puts low CD spells on the numbers?
---
?????? Now you’re really trolling dude. 
---
I said Hobbs and you think warrior video?????? Are you serious???
---
“Yea you said swifty and I thought you were talking about the warlock video not the warrior”
---
And yet I've seen 7 pairs of legs.  Feelsbadman
---
What is "regular play"? Respawning a world mob bypasses a respawn timer and requires a very similar process.
---
Its MAAMMM
---
We ran with 3 prio lists in tbc+
---
Need/Greed/Offspec 
---
Highest on highest list who bid win item and is moved to bottom of list.   List persist between runs.  And only ppl in raid can advance.  
---
Only 1 need win /raid. 
---
We had addon for loot handling you just typed need/Greed/Offspec in raid chat. 
---
Worked very well.  Once I get to 60 and start to raid I’m going to propose this. As I don’t like putting all eggs I one basket.
---
So I will never be able to level a character past level 1, thanks.
---
Getting ganked is part of being on a PvP server, yes. Calling out the pansy-ass who has nothing better to do than ruin people's fun is also part of being on a PvP server. They're both part of the grand tradition.
---
I hate it
---
I might be ahead of your average joe, but people already killed rag in the 1st week.   I am 3 weeks behind.
---
My downstairs neighbors are going to love it too. I can hear them now: “STOP ROLLING ON GODDAMN LOOT! IT’S 2A.M JACKASS!”
---
Ditto, would also be curious of your setup if you don't mind DMing me
---
Yeah I looked at guides and they were all "AoE frost is the only way to level". Fuck that I'm leveling as fire because I run with a group pretty regularly and even solo I can melt faces just fine.
---
Should just life tap, then it's someone else's problem...
---
Yes. Lifetap exchanges health for mana. So when grouped with a Warlock just remember they have 3-mana bars. Their HP bar, Mana bar and your mana bar.
---
He was doing mage aoe farming, but yeah he used layer swapping. I'm not sure if what he did was against the rules though...
---
Have you checked if it lacks some dependencies? On the main game screen, go to addons and see if it's name is red
---
“Just whispering so I can report”
---
Amen.
---
The best thing you can do for your sanity is to find people who enjoy playing the same way you do.  There are some little things you can do to help yourself out.  Set up a couple of macros to explain to the party how you're gonna tank, what you're gonna mark, what the kill priority is, etc.  
---
At the end of the day, a little bit of communication goes a long way.  I've found most players will just default to playing like the arcade version the modern game has pushed for so long, but often don't have a problem making adjustments to complete whatever dungeon they are doing.  Even as a hunter (not an optimal dungeon class) I've found some like-minded folks to dungeon and quest with.  The old fashioned friend list still works!
---
The classic experience is shared suffering.  Leverage that into a network of people who you don't mind grouping with.
---
Thank you for telling us how to play a video game the way you want us to play
---
I thought poison procs are normalized to procs per minute anyways so a fast offhand doesn't matter for poisons.
---
Hold my Beers. CHAIN LIGHTNING BITCHES, wait we wipe oh...... not sorry
---
45 minute fight between two blood knights? Absolutely sounds right. Id walk away from those kinds of fights because id get bored after the first 10 minutes
---
I tamed Deathmaw the other day. Hes a 1.2 atk speed wolf rare. I perfer the furious howl and the slight health increase.   When i saw him I dimissed my owl that took me from 10-55.  RIP Flappyturd
---
It’s the changes like flying mounts that were the real “You think you do, but you don’t.”
---
No no, water giver. 1/10 times I get something back, most of the times, its free water it seems.
---
because that's literally the point of layering you fucking retard
---
That would be fine also but removing the rewards they gained and a month off is good enough.  They're pretty much going to have to make a new character anyways when you consider we are only 3 weeks in.  In a month gone on a new character they'll be further ahead than their banned character when the month is up.
---
I was so sad last night on my crap laptop running to a quest before I was gonna switch to my real computer.  Was watching TV in background and two lower levels killed me and couldn't even fight back.  No mouse was hooked up and I kinda just watched them kill me.  Dumb me.
---
Yea people would say I'm literally the worst because I'm loling at your throwing money away. Keep thinking I'm the worst while your broke
---
I'm sure they'll consider this free advertising
---
The sooner you stop clicking, the better you'll get.  Find he buttons that feel most natural on your keyboard to use, and go in and bind abilities to them.  I play a lot of warrior, and rogue, and although they have different abilities, I'll do keybindings similarly so it's natural.  my V key is always interrupt (pummel for warrior, and kick for rogue).  C is always the speed buff (sprint for rogue, aspect of the cheetah for hunter) etc...   Also get used to using your number keys above AWSD for spammable abilities.  The quicker your fingers get used to using 123456, you will become an exponentially better player over night.  Also, look at investing $30 in a gaming mouse like the logitek g600 - that is another quantum leap in ease of play.
---
Yeah, they must've taken it out of a free-range freezer before they tossed it on the bonfire.
---
Spending too much on training/professions
---
I love his dialogue.
---
As others stated, this doesn’t solve the problem if your gaming for extended periods of time - the goal isn’t to get huge muscles, it’s to make sure you’re periodically keeping your body moving and active.
---
Wait, they won’t help you if you get ripped off but they will ban you if you scam people? 
---
But about the practice, you are definitely running the risk of getting ripped off. The only way to protect yourself would be to get the trade upfront and make sure you follow through on your end. Trade safely.
---
Playing on an EST server as PST = EZ Late nights. 10pm for me is 1am for most of the server. Midnight for me is 3 am lol.
---
I have no idea , but when a dude whispers you that hes a hard dps and tanks overall dmg in sm lib is 17% and mage has 14% i start to wonder does the mage bring any benefit to the group?
---
If you're on a PvP server.  Not many safe zones pass the first 2-3 for each race.  Beyond that most shit is straight up contested or opposite faction.
---
It shouldnt.
---
Let me give you a hint though. It's from a blue post in the WoW fourms. Goodluck locating the source. Like you said Shouldnt be to hars to find.
---
REMEMBER TO SET MASTER LOOTER IF YOU WANT SOMETHING RESERVED
---
The best time to quest in peace.
---
In fact, this new exploit was such a rare occurence in the course of regular play, it took 100,000 players 3 weeks to discover it.
---
Had an hour queue last night on Incendius
---
Roll need if you need it for your main spec, ask if you can roll if you need it for an offspec.
---
Simple.
---
Nipple not condom you noob! /jk
---
but she aint bald
---
Perfectly valid I agree! I just think it only appeals to a certain subset of individuals. I tried being in one and hated every minute of it. despite the rewards being good it didn’t feel rewarding.
---
No but they are both things that can easily be miss calculated by some weird glitch from converting vanilla data into legion and it never being tested if working correctly.
---
I thought all of the outhouses in game looked like that?
---
Ya but rend goes up before hamstring... Id be spamming it until I hit.
---
this is a pretty good implementation of a checklist! i could see myself using it as a generic notepad with the added functionality of a checklist too, since it's so easy to add notes. does it do multiple lines (due to length of the note) for a single checkmark well?
---
Yeah, this anecdote just serves as inspiration for further testing, at best, since I neither have proof for the xp numbers, nor know myself if what I was told by my party members is true. Maybe some of them were 'rested'. But the general consensus was that they were levelling super fast.
---
But what rule? No offense but I'd rather have better evidence than u/Kreuzi4 told me on reddit when I inform people that their layer abuse is against the rules.
---
This is exactly what I have been talking with many of my RL friends about. How all these tiny little changes to improve quality of life in the game actually made it worse. It's really changed how I look at games now.
---
Since hunters make great solo play I think a lot bring that solo "I can do it all" mentality to groups.
---
having fun by killing greys
---
/spit
---
Threat is damage. The more threat you do, the more your spa can go ham.
---
&gt; And another cool thing, you can put that shield back on any time. Arms is the way to go for leveling my friend.
---
When I have a gold to spare, I might respec then.
---
They can also get an instance group instantly.  Instances are the new leveling meta.
---
And then it is modified by the coefficient of the spell. All +damage regardless of wording gets summed and then multiplied by the spell’s coefficient. That video says the same thing.
---
F bro.. :(  You will be remembered.
---
Please report back with your findings.  Good luck.
---
I wonder what horde areas i can grief as alliance...
---
Innocent: 1, Elevator Boss: 0
---
You have an AoE damage totem, earthshock, rockbiter, taunt totem, the aoe slow totem - worst comes to worst you can send the speedy burst heal their way, if it doesn't pull aggro back then you either try to burst it down or toss down stoneskin totem and keep healing :P.
---
In the end, dps need to moderate themselves.  Ideally they should be trying for 0 downtime(ie, little to no drinking) rather than dumping all their mana in to burst.
---
Yeah but the gizzards will getcha as they're quest items, and that's a quest that you need as a pre-req for an Ulda quest.
---
You're supposed to feint before you pull aggro. I'd recommend getting a threat meter so you can maximize your damage by managing your threat properly.
---
there are like 4 talents that even effect flash heal, shadow priests can heal absolutely fine in 5-mans
---
Can you send me a msg in game? Rhomulus
---
Lol imagine projecting this hard. No wonder you keep seeing "defensive guys". You do you I guess
---
Swap that for me. Pacific playing on EST. 10pm for me is 1am server time. Midnight is 3 am lol.
---
A rogue is fine to play at 60. I'm not surprised. Never said I was.
---
Pretty sure I did this one better when flying from Theramore to Nijel's Point (Desolace).  It took so long I was able to watch a half hour TV show I had on my DVR while skipping commercials.
---
Frenzy lasts 8 seconds 
---
Your pet has a 1/5 chance of landing a critical strike
---
As long as your pet lands &gt;5 attacks in 8 seconds it has a good chance of extending frenzy
---
Not guaranteed but incredibly reliable. My cat always has it up.
---
Tell your rogues to pickpocket all the mobs before engaging.  I doubt they'll mind.
---
Or, hear me out: Doing home excercise is healthy, and doing things like this can help instill a love of excercise into people. Also, gyms are expensive memberships, and if you don't live reasonably close to one, it's harder to get the motivation to go to the gym.
---
Well they just nerfed or fixed the xp with a high level in a group, so your experience may differ now (Pun not intended)
---
Thanks friend
---
Your post made me feel double old knowing you were the kids age when you first started playing. I was already 2 years into college when WoW came out.
---
Wailing cancer is more like it
---
I get it, but someone obviously doesn't remember server forums. There were literally daily posts and some people had reputations and would find these posts and talk shit to the posters, the advantage here is that generally the offenders wont find it.
---
Healcomm
---
All your healers need it though. 
---
If they don’t have it.,, it gets the boot.
---
Not enough context. Sounds like someone whining
---
PvP in a PvP realm is not griefing .
---
Been healing things underleveled in full ret spec/gear. Sometimes even without a tank and just 4 dps and most of the time tank wearing 2h. Like Cath at 32 and Uldaman at 38 and now ZF at 39. Not to brag but things are way to easy making it boring as hell. I use multi monitor and watch a movie on one screen and have the hp bars on the edge of the other screen.
---
My favorite is letting the mob get the last hit for durability damage.
---
You really gotta pay attention to guild names of higher level players. Notice trends; what name keeps popping up? Do a /who of that guild and see how many online players at a high level are online simultaneously.
---
Once you target a few of these, whisper some members and ask what they're all about. Who are the guild leaders? Have they started raiding? What times do they raid? What are raid expectations? What are they recruiting? How does their looting work?
---
Upvote for actually answering the question, downvote for being unnecessarily snarky about it (I didn't know what to look for in the EULA) so I'll just not vote.
---
Agreed. I was with OP until he mentioned the "thief" was a part of the opposite faction. 
---
It's bad manners to steal a node from an allied player, but you're being a carebear if you think just standing next to the node entitles you to it against enemies.
---
&gt;I am beginning to think I am bugged somehow, anyone else have any ideas on what is happening?
---
It is not bugged, working as intended.  Just a side effect of playing the game on hard mode with enhancement.
---
Yes I hardly see overpower pop at all. Those mobs don’t dodge much:( maybe they dodge more later levels or maybe overpower pop out of other things when specced into? In retail I think I remember overpower proccing left and right and I loved it.
---
It doesn't send it to a folder. I can copy/paste it if where it goes allows me to, or save it to any folder relatively easy. Most my snag-its get emailed or pasted rather than attached, so it is more efficient for me. I also can grab what I want and not the full screen.
---
Why should I leave? Pvp was 80% of what I used to do in WoW.
---
Don't die. ;)
---
You obviously care that people care, so you’re in no position to judge their caring.
---
Yeah this sounds much closer to me.
---
She’s handsome.
---
Right but noobs generally don't tank.
---
Don't be insulted, they're jerks - they probably had a friend lined up and did the unethical thing by removing you.   Even if your numbers do suck, as long as you're not wiping they should have kept you on since they did invite you.  Don't take it personally, and look for ways to improve your DPS for next time.  It is possible that no matter how well you did, they were going to remove you for their friend in the first place.
---
Druid v Druid, don't even shift. Just auto attack and rejuv. Whoever spends the least Mana will win.
---
Source?
---
You can make one.
---
LookingForGroup isn't an official channel, it's just a community adopted thing.
---
You could /join ILoveFreeTacos if you wanted to.
---
I sat down to do Helcular's Revenge.  This is penance enough. 60 kills so far, no quest item.
---
No, I want to engage in PVP on a reasonably level playing field. Not to be camped and griefed for several hours on end. As I said, I think it adds a lot of flavor, I find it enjoyable to try and defend against being attacked while out in the world, even if I lose. It adds excitement to the game. I always played PVE in retail, but was able to engage in a lot of WPVP in my earliest days of starting the game But when it’s ?? levels that roll up on me 5 to one and kill me in two blows, that ceases to be fun.
---
I don’t think it’s unreasonable to hope for some parity in gameplay. And engaging in PVP in a way that actively prevents others from their enjoyment of the game is kind of shitty IMO. It is what it is though, and I’ll continue to grind away to the best of my ability.
---
Yeah that's one thing I expected out of classic. The retard elitism. Take it with a grain of salt.
---
Hmmm let me try to gank this warlock with no Free Action Potion, Trinket, or Undead racial WCGW?
---
{whisper} I'm sorry nobody told you until now, but reroll on a PVE server. Nobody can fuck with you then.
---
People who focus on world PvP don't care for or seek out XP. All that matters is ganking players. You level by killing the mobs that get in the way of your ganking...this is why I take so long to get to 60 lol. 
---
I detest most instances and only do them for quests / some gear. As soon as I hit a contested area all thoughts of lvling go out the window lol. Our fun comes from killing other players, not leveling hah! Some say this is a waste of time but I find it way more fun than facing the same boss over and over again.
---
There's a small valley, just north of the Vale. There's usually 6-10 mobs there, with just about 3-4 of them being fire elementals; they respawn fairly quickly and they are low lvl/low health. 
---
I've done that quest twice and each time I've eithet camped that spot, or ran back and forth to kill harpies and give the elementals time to respawn, then run back and collect my annoying quest shards.
---

Can someone tell me what the [blue section at the end of your cast](https://i.imgur.com/8JvHkpZ.png) bar in dominos signifies? Sometimes it's longer or shorter and idk what it's purpose is.
---
Wouldnt the time saved doing this be completely lost when you have to make 100 stacks of water so you are able to do it?
---
Most people who are 60 at this point can't be asked to waste their time helping with gankers. They're pretty hardcore and content with grinding what they got to 60 for already in the first place. The only time I've seen a ?? get dealt with is when a bunch of people created a raid group to kill a hunter because he was continuously camping every single one of them. 
---
To me, it's all part of the experience. If people are roughly the same level then it's game on, especially if that person and I are both competing for the same mobs. But if someone's just being an asshole then I'll go find somewhere else to level.
---
And what I'm telling you is those same people don't know how to play retail either, so it has nothing to do with them coming from retail.
---
Using your analogy the tourists in question would be trailer trash to start with
---
Isnt there only 1 skill point per node though?  Or can 2 people skill up from the same one?
---
I don't think you understand the joke
---
Been getting the guaranteed Q reward BiS items i can. Been to MC and Onyxia once. Primarily been farming devilsaurs but also helping my buddies with difficult areas and quests.
---
/laugh These are retarded and no one cares
---
As a hunter, no one banks me. Because I'm a hunter. 
---
If I was a warrior, I'd be ganked a lot. 
---
Also beastial wrath is my favorite spell to use against mages.
---
Also, don't go on the discords at all because most are a cesspool.
---
Just because you don't understand the mechanics of an encounter doesn't mean it is bugged.
---
I roll around as a holy priest because I just don't like shadow. I would love to see a shammy tank in a dungeon. It feels like the skill floor is much higher for that, though.
---
It's funny though. If you don't like it play on pve servers

 I am playing shaman but I told all my friends playing warriors to only use HS for a rage dump. I had never thought about it until I read the first post.
---
When I first started I had the hardest time typing in the correct chat.  I said thanks in trade, looking for group, and then whispered it to someone completely different (in other games if you want to talk in general, you type /general, not /2.  Took me a good while to figure that out (I have never played wow before)).  By the time I figured it out they were gone.  
---
I have also had a lot of trouble remembering to type /party and not /group.  it is defiantly different....
---
idk y u got downvoted but ill help 🔼
---
Might as well be.
---
How is it stealing fun away?  We totally get it. It's fun for any party member to win a freezing band right?  It's not fun to watch it drop.... the only one you will ever see drop personally and have no chance to get it.  I don't care if you want to sell it, want to use it on an alt, want to use it right now.... everyone has a chance at it and that is fair.
---
The 1.12 client private servers used and the classic 1.13 client are very different.
---
The classic client graphic preset for 1.12 settings is 3. You can crank that up to 10 to make it look a lot like retail graphics.
---
So yes you can use cvars to change settings but it'll be different than private servers.
---
Haha, I'd like to see them try. 
---
And I maintain a up to date feral and healing set, and I bought mounts for both my friends. Git gud scrub.
---
Ah, you seem to think that PvP only applies to equal levels, like a battleground. Luckily phase 2 will introduce battlegrounds so you can engage in proper PvP, as world PVP&amp;G is a bit out of your league (have to separate gray from player since players who are gray aren’t real players)
---
I’ve been using a Razer Hex for the last 7 or so years, it’s got 6 side buttons in a nice hexagon shape for your thumb.
---
So what server are you on?
---
The community is worse for you being in it.
---
Over the head again.
---
Both work. As long as you’re using a 2h weapon
---
Like I said I'm a rogue, but I don't believe the skill makes me entitled to it because the skill is a joke to level early on, acting like lockpicking entitles you to something is the problem here. They get to take rare lockboxes too if we stick by your argument
---
Deadmines of all things is the funniest anyways, basically no tank will at that level will hold aggro on everything; i did it yesterday on my 19 warrior with 2 mages and a rogue and they constantly pulled agro on me (they all had 3+ levels on me) and i felt like i was doing a shit job, but apparently it was the easiest run they've done.
---
Non-aoe frost is a ton of fun too, especially for pvp purposes, I just wish there were any groups looking for classes other than warrior priest mage
---
having never used mac, that sounds about like what my mac expectations were for how it worked lol
---
You're spamming.
---
This makes such a huge difference. Completely underrated comment here.
---
Based on another person’s comment, it seems only to work if they cancel the trade.
---
Only if you placed that restriction on other players.
---
Utter nonsense. Anyone camping low levels should be as ashamed in game as they are of their micropenis irl.
---
I get plenty of accomplishment feeling without the need to kill people 20lv lower than me and without being camped by them. I enjoy pvp.
---
Ganking is a fact of being on pvp servers but by no means is it required to feel accomplished for leveling... lol
---
I was playing a mage on my server but ran into the STV problem myself. Horde is just wildly popular. So I made a rogue and leveled that. I figure eventually the average level will go up and there will be less of an issue but for now I just stealth everywhere. It slows leveling but it does add some spice to your questing when you are always sneaking around horde and trying to get your quest kills as fast as you can so you can get back into stealth before one of the 5 red names nearby decide you look like lunch.
---
Hold. Any gold you might get off it could easily be made another way at the moment. Twink items sell for hundreds, sometimes thousands of gold down the line.
---
skinning and leatherworking, if not maybe engineering
---
Rejuv continues to heal while you regenerate mana though. If you anticipate the tank will continue to take damage after youe big heal It's very useful throw out a rejuv at the end of the cast so you can sit there and regen mana for longer. That slight loss in mana efficiency is made up for by getting an extra tick of mana regen because you chose to rejuv at the end of healing touch instead of casting another healing touch.
---
Even following a guide will be a unique journey is good to know. I mean i wonder about things too but at the same time i realize they are what make the game interesting and unique and different from the well paved streets of modern mmo's.
---
Like how a zone would literally leap to content i could not even dream of doing at my current level which sets me off to explore, i'll returning there some day, how while hunting certain target a wandering boss literally comes across my path and one shots me, keeping me aware and ofc seek revenge one day.
---
Imperfection is what makes things beautiful, unique.
---
Your arguments are valid if you think miners and herbalists must share their nodes, and blacksmiths share their keys. It falls apart when you try to distinguish between one and the other.
---
What a great idea.
---
Yeah, im a p*ssy and I quit Sulfuras. Left behind my 32 hunter and went to a Normal server. I can’t spend my whole life running back to my body.
---
Oh no, what a nightmare.

Capitalism and free markets are not the same thing. They usually co-exist sure, but if the government says "you need to follow rule A and B", but things are still controlled by private owners for profit. Capitalism results in the cheapest possible goods, because it's all about the profit margin.

JFC, the game came out 22 days ago.  That's 12 hrs per day average.

Yeah, I'd switch. Both are good really but Fury just needs a lot of +hit to make it better than arms.

Absolutely ridiculous.

I'd say that's a pretty fair punishment. Slap on the wrist for casuals who just wanted to do it to get gear faster, they'll probably just wait it out and learn from it. Death sentence to min-maxers and will probably force them to reroll a new account.
---
They stopped letting you transfer yesterday :/
---
Yeah they won't ban you for using an add-on. They will just take the functionality out of the API if they don't want people doing a specific thing.
---
Part of being a tank is managing and chatting with you group. Why don’t you try telling them not to do that and waiting to pull until they understand? Why not mark targets and go over what each mark means? 
---
As a tank you need to call the shots and tell people what to do and not to do. 90% of the time this solves the problem you are talking about.
---
Apparently it is on Youtube.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbUE0uahrBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbUE0uahrBE)
---
As a tank, I beg you: please focus the targets. I know you want to be a big hot shot and take the mob down by yourself, but you're only making this take twice as long as it should. I'm looking at you, rogues.
---
You could also put all 3 on the same button with modifier keys. For example stance 1 could be G, stance 2 is shift G, and stance 3 could be alt G
---
People don't say "ffs" if they aren't fed up with something.
---
That was a serious answer. You use frostbolt.
---
I can’t find that dang folder. I’ve searched everywhere and few like I’ve opened up every single folder on my computer. I have some great screenshots from over the years, will be funny going through them all when I eventually find this folder.
---
Quick let me multidot before any of the mobs even reach the tank.
---
Google makes a Remote Desktop app too. I’d use that over big picture a 100 times over.
---
Is it crazy of me to think that making server queues consider faction as well as server would help alleviate this problem?
---
I mean, they gave everyone on that server ample warning so I dont feel bad for them
---
I don't have one in front of me, but its pretty simple I think.

This is precisely the way to do it. Replace healing touch with regrowth if you have the talent though of course.

I'll have you know I sat in stealth by that chest for eight minutes before you showed up to clear it for me.

I just find it funny that the same people in this clip will complain about server queues on the forums.

So it’s been a while since I played, I know the 40-60 level curve slowed down, but this wasn’t EQ hell level bad, was it??

Nope. Mana cost and the 5 second rule apply when the cast finishes.

Nice I felt like hitting the jackpot last night looting a travelers backpack from a normal 53 lvl bloodelf.. the best part is 3 hours later I unlock a mithril lockbox and i get a second 16 slots travelers backpack.. I think my luck in classic is depleted for another couple months
---
That mentally is part of the problem. The game will be here for YEARS. Enjoy it. Take a day and just walk from one side to the other. 
---
Really, what's the point of rushing? Just so you can stand in Org or IF wearing tier gear &amp; strut around with nothing left to do!?
---
I'm only level 30 &amp; I'm having the best time in WoW I've had in almost a decade. I'm remembering where small tidbits of lore and quirky items or quests were tucked out of the beaten path. Stuff that makes people ask "what is that &amp; where does it come from?" Everyone knows raid gear and without transmog everyone will look the same. Do something unique, don't follow the cookie-cutter builds &amp; find the small stuff. It's worth way more than rushing to raids.
---
Unfortunately no, I remember doing it in vanilla and TBC but haven't done it recently. From what I know it was never removed but I have no real proof. I apologize.
---
I haven't had to use it in classic (not maining a priest), but back in vanilla I'd pretty much only use it reactively.
---
Ah, gotcha! You are correct!
---
There's an abuser wow discord?

Quests are for the weak. I grind all my levels.

Well, the first time he brings 6-10 extra mobs this way I can challenging shout but that has a ten minute refresh. The second time I'll be able to get about half of them under control but the rest will be beating on the healer.

Thank you!!! Just downloaded this!

I am healing dungeons just fine with 31 points in shadow.
---
Priests, you do not need to sepc holy/disc until much later, maybe for level 60 dungeons.  Probably for raids, sure...
---
But, in the meantime, go shadow, melt faces, have fun!!  Just use the right spells in dungeons, don't over-heal, fade if you pull healing agro.  You'll be fine.
---
Lol when it's a fair fight you run?
---
Can't stand the constant scrolling with all those messages popping up? Me neither.  You can right click on a /4 post and "pop out" (I can't remember if that's the term or not) the chat window, then you can move that next to your combat log.  Voila! You'll have constant access to the /4 chat without needing t o /join lookingforgroup /leave 4!
---
In my original post I said the main difference is in the degree of profitability. That's the point you're making here. But Blizzard has said the intent is the main deciding factor on what's an exploit and what's not. The intent in both cases is to bypass game mechanics (respawn timers, rarity of spawns, time consuming dungeon runs) to profit. IMO the intent is the same so both cases are exploits and not proper use of an in game mechanic. 
---
Just because it went public recently doesnt mean people haven't been exploiting it for weeks. It's barely an extra step from the layer swapping exploits that have existed for weeks.
---
You're talking like questing elites are raid bosses. A heal or two and the mob is down, there's no science to it.
---
Hybrids who refuse to utilize their abilities to the max are completely useless. That dude is gonna hit the ground hard when he realizes what Paladin's specialty is and why he won't be Ret forever.
---
Not knowing your level right now, I would say keep that combo all the way to 60. Simply bank all the herbs you collect. Continue skinning mobs and selling the loot for money. When 60, drop skinning and then get alchemy. Your banked herbs will then carry you through alchemy power leveling
---
&gt; But if someone's just being an asshole 
---
Are they really being an asshole though? Or are you just frustrated that they are disrupting your questing? If you're on a pvp server, I see absolutely nothing wrong with this, and I say that as someone who's only ever been on the receiving end of ganking.
---
Then play a different game.
---
It's not sad at all. It's really just part of the game. Work with your faction to put an end to it.
---
You literally get nothing out of it besides ruining someone else's time. Besides, standing in one area and repeatedly killing low levels for *hours* isn't ganking. You're just farming them and being a dick.
---
You should always have engineering, so you will have to drop one of your professions.
---
&gt;Nobody likes me in this game
---
&gt;Proceeds to call strangers fucking stupid
---
You reap what you sow. Your general attitude towards strangers is poisonous so that's the attitude you're going to get back.
---
Someone else being a different gender than the character they play has no mechanical impact on your game experience so why are you allowing yourself to become angry about things like this?
---
The reason why a lot of people like classic wow is because it *forces* them to be nice to each other and work together. It gives players an incentive to be tolerant and patient towards each other - something that retail wow and a lot of modern games spoil you by allowing you to drop out and in of games immediately. They allow you to act like an abrasive asshole and leave without worrying about any repercussion. Harassing a lot of people on your server on classic wow will earn you a reputation as a shitty player and it's mirrored in real life in the sense that being abrasive will earn you a reputation as a shitty person. So yea, the problem you're having with people not wanting to talk to you is almost entirely your own fault.
---
There are a lot of lessons to learn from games like classic wow and one of the most obvious and important ones is patience. If you don't have the patience to level from 1 to 60 in a video game, you're in for a rude awakening later in life when you decide to save up for major purchases like a house.
---
You take enchanting for max  level DE's on solo boss kills  If you arn't doing end game content then enchanting servers you no purpose.
---
Getting invited to get new layer is an intentional mechanic. The intend of using it to farm mobs faster is not intended.
---
Being able to get a new layer inside a dungeon is NOT an intentional mechanic, and the intend to use it to farm bosses is not intended either.
---
Basically 1/2 intentions on normal layerhopping, and 2/2 for doing it in dungeons.
---
Name does NOT check out. Good on you!

I thought threat was like " oh I see a char that's 2 levels below me I bet I can kill him or oh that char is 2 levels ahead if me I better be cautious and only attack if he comes closer. " (as if this is the ai or npc talking)

There's an addon that polls the characters online via /who.  It's called [CensusPlusClassic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/censusplusclassic).  By uploading those census data to an external site a player can have a reasonably good picture of server population.
---
Just don’t group with mages or ravager-warriors in ZF. That dungeon farm has warped their mind into something that I don’t think can even be considered human anymore.
---
Mä tuon taiat
---
Oh I know. Still, I try to be flexible, even when the tank thinks he is One Punch Man or Goku or something.
---
Anyway, I just made myself a panic macro that Fades, Bubbles, Renews, and Heals. If the macro makes it all the way to Heals, it starts yelling "HEALER HAS AGGRO!".  All I have to do is jam that button and run toward some DPS or tank.  I'll see how that works.
---
He can spawn on the field and the barn you know?
---
What's your point? I never said I was expecting it to stay the same. It makes perfect sense from a business perspective, sure. But it sucks as a consumer. I'm not sitting here going WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS!? I'm just upset that it happened.
---
Then it has everything to so with the player and nothing to do with the spec.
---
It can be done smooth as butter without even trying very hard as any spec. You've probably had a lot of good experiences with an arms tank and not have even realized.

More durable, not exactly. They have a super inflated health pool in bear form, and lots of armor. I say they’re not more durable because they can only dodge, but not parry or block
---
I mean at not max level you'll kinda shit on anyone by just trying harder.  like if you're running dungeons to get the best gear for your level you'll kinda shit on a lot of people just by default.

"To the fact that no one in the game fuckin likes me. To the fact that dwarf females look so fucking stupid. To the fact that there are actually men with children that play a female character with a female name. But still I just want to get lvl 60 so fucking bad. Even if I hate this game, I just want to play this game and nothing else. I rage quit, but then 20 mins later im reopening the game. and then I am playing for a few more hours, not progresing at all in game, and then finally rage quitting again. rinse and repeat."

I want updated textures for vanilla items. Make it toggleable.
---
Consider the Onyxia fight from Wrath. A bunch of t1 weapons were reskinned for the Wrath Ony fight. IMO they look better than their 2004 counterparts.

I'd also like updated texture for surfaces and doodads and pretty much everything. I prefer the old models and old animations. But I am really in support making all those graphical changes toggleable.

When I finally met another Femorc warlock in the original Classic, this is pretty much what happened. 
---
She turned out to be kind of a whack job later, but was still fun for a time.
---
I completely avoid the "where to quest?" problems because I do a lot of min-grinding while I'm questing.
---
Example: You get a quest to kill 10 wolfs.
---
Most players: Run to where the wolfs are. Avoid other mobs. Kill 10 wolfs. Run back and turn in.
---
Me: Work my way towards wolfs while killing anything that isn't too far off-track. Kill 10 wolfs and anything else around them. Clear that camp of gnolls nearby. Work my way back to the quest turn-in the same way, killing anything that isn't too far away.
---
Fair enough, it might be time to man up and sport that plate-kini
---
Mulgore has red rocks in it tho so if that aint colorado, youre wrong
---
Outside chests fair game. In the time you guys were rolling someone else would of prob run in and grabbed. You roll in instances though
---
I think spell damage works funny with channelled  spells, like it adds the bonus over the whole duration. Test it with arcane blast instead.
---
1 month is a good time. 1 week would have been too long and any time past 1 month the person would have just made a new account.

Really? I find just an autoattack/wand will pull aggro over a mob with just demoshout applied at the start of a pull. It appears to not generate anything lol

Maybe its why I am bad at pvp and most shooters, but i'm also bad at min/maxing my characters.  I also only play on a pvp server because I like the extra challenge of a possible fight when im out in the world questing.  I probably will care more about it once honor and stuff is added in, I do want my (not at all) fancy Sergeant rank back.
---
Yeah I'd rather have all melee because they can handle having aggro and the mobs won't go anywhere. With casters they tend to just blind nuke, pull aggro on multiple separate targets and make me chase them.
---
Yes, if your sunder is dodged, you proc overpower.

The issue I have is most of the /roll people are pretending to act like they want to share when all they actually want is a change at the tiny sum of silver. Greedy as they say the rogues are.

You're wrong. In my guild most everyone wants #nochanges. Anywhere I ask, most people agree that no new additions should be made. Sorry to say it but you're just wrong.
---
Oh yes I did. 
---
I leveled in stv with people my own level and died multiple times. I died 3 times running into brd last night. I didnt cry about or switch layers. I just kept making the run.
---
Sometimes you hunt well and still don't win. It happens to everyone. You learn that one big score doesn't mean much if you don't have a backup. I guess every rookie learns that as time goes by. I took some big lessons from my losses.
---
Have y'all even played retail lately? Doesn't really work like that. There's so much variance in gear that most specs have different  priorities of what to use based on what RNG nonsense you happen to have. 
---
Vanilla raiding is extremely cookie cutter, people have pre-bis and bis lists and extremely thorough guides  to every talent combo you can think of. That's literally impossible in retail because you can never  guarantee a piece of loot at the right ilvl to give you what you need for a build due to titanforging.
---
Yes, we had someone running to check those spawns too. We found him in the barn ultimately but enjoyed our time camped out in his house.
---
No AA for that classic experience...just kidding I didn't realize it was turned off.
---
I can confess I wanted a lot of things in 05 that it turned out I hated. I used to want transmog, until I go it. I wanted dungeon finder, until I got it. I wanted raid finder, until I got it. I wanted Arena, until I got it. I wanted pretty much everything I hate about retail before I got it. Other then Flyers, I never wanted and always despised flying mounts. I now see I was wrong about everything. Other then flying mounts may they rot.
---
I don’t get it either, it’s not a hard concept to understand but somehow this “blizz said layering doesn’t affect queues” thing, which they NEVER said, keeps getting parroted around here
---
I'd be happy for the warrior that won the roll on freezing band.  Sick loot bro, congrats!  How is this different?  Everyone gets a shot at it.  Pity me all you want its not about greed it's about fairness, I'm happy for anyone that wins something.  Start throwing insults all you want I won't return fire, rolling on boe's is fair to all.

That's like buying a bus pass instead of a car because you wanted a new bad ass computer
---
Yeah. Deviant recipes, different pets etc - stuff that's easy to get for one faction but hard for the other.
---
Welfare epics worked really well for a catch up mechanic though.
---
If i remember right, they would allow you to get the previous tier than what was the current raid. Basically, perfect for gearing an alt when you were forced to switch role mid tier raid, or to catch up to your team when you haven't played the last tier...
---
But I believe that at some point you could be getting 2 pieces of your the current tier set from them. That wasn't so great.
---
The trick is to hold it in for so long that you are prairie-dogging by the time you sit down.  
---
My poops generally take about as long as it takes to piss.  
---
The only downside to this strategy is that chronically holding it in can end up leading to severe constipation and then I spend like an hour in there.
---
hope you get banned bro
---
yes, it does
---
They’re not desired as dedicated healers because they only have brez and not a regular one.
---
They’re not desired as DPS because they’re one of the worst DPS.
---
They’re pretty solid tanks though.
---
As a single role druids generally aren’t great but their whole package is awesome and they’re tons of fun to play. If a Druid whispers me for group I’ll invite them for any role unless it’s a harder dungeon to where I think people will die a lot. In that case I wouldn’t invite Druid as healer unless I also had someone else in the group that can res out of combat.
---
Druids are unpopular because number wise they aren’t good, but as a whole package they’re very nice to have and they are fun as hell to play.
---
This works for many abilities - it will prevent you from shifting back into caster form for example on a druid, or you can chain Eagle Eye/Far Sight with it without cancelling the previous one etc.
---
Any chance your guild is recruiting? Can't find an active Incendius Horde guild.
---
Some of us were complaining and scorned by the changes as they were happening, for the record.
---
your attacks are separate, so missing a lot with your offhand has nothing to do with your mainhand.
---
Lmfao okay, no you’re wrong. Just google it, I’ve found 3 surveys that concur what the first did. Also, I’ll make sure to take screenshots of every future survey I see and send them to you! Since you know, this is something we need to be mindful of.
---
Tip - use blood rage between pulls to keep rage up. One of the best tips I got was to use blood rage + a bandage basically on cooldown every few pulls. Then be conservative with your abilities. Try to save some rage for when you accidentally pull too much.
---
Another college student who doesn't know how to process his feelings and doesn't have the slightest clue how to plan his time and activities so he stays online when he doesn't feel like it because "there's nothing else I feel like doing" and he gets burnt out. 
---
To top it all off he of course feels mostly superior to others but doesn't have the backbone to do anything by himself or socialize with people so he's stuck on a faction he doesn't like because his "friends" decided that for him and he doesn't know anybody outside of that group because he's an asshole.
---
For the first time I had someone ask my priest spec when going into a SM run at like 40 the other day. Fortunately everyone laughed at him expecting a priest to have a healing spec for levelling. I have absolutely no intention to respec before UBRS, level 58 minimum. Some talents like Mind Flay and Spirit Tap are just essential for levelling.
---
Sorry, my lunch is almost over but I’ll try to answer your question better, because I think you’re asking in good faith. 
---
When I’ve played PVE in retail, I had a hard time finding spontaneous WPVP. Although I had some great experiences when people would organize raids on the Alliance cities, they were few are far in between. Occasionally I would be able to get little skirmishes going just by flying to outside of SW and things like that, but a lot of people in those areas were low level and there wouldn’t always be the desired effect. 
---
I think PVP servers also force people to get organized and work together, in a way I don’t often see on PVE servers. Granted, I’ve not played on a classic PVE server yet, so it could be different. On retail PVE servers (at least ones I was on), calls for WPVP or help with PVP were often ignored.
---
What's a fair price to pay an enchanter to put this enchant on your boots?
---
Looks awesome. Does it trigger quest completed/accepted sounds? That’d be neat.

Wasting hours of your life to create hardships for others at no personal challenge or gain? Sorry bro going to go with pretty sad.

Good point! I’ll have to look up the bloodsail discord
---
&gt;I'm a huge fan of passive gold via transmutes/mooncloth
---
Selling mooncloth is a mistake right now, it will be many times more valuable when AQ is out and every caster in the game needs bloodvine, which also always be very profitable to craft due to the rep requirement.
---
Selling naked mooncloths is a desperate measure

Some mage charged me 25s per stack. Gotta make that mount money.

world PvP is ruined when the horde to alliance ratios are gigantic. At that point its time to re-roll on a different server that's more balanced. You won't be able to quest, you keep getting ranked/camped and no one wants to help because they already know they won't win because of the huge  discrepancy in the open world PvP. This is what makes it not fun. Usually speaking there is a lot more horde purely based on the imbalanced racial that horde get compared to alliance, the difference is massive just by being a Orc or undead in open world PvP that its just straight up BORING, you don't stand a chance.
---
I try to stay green/yellow. I found sunder to be a worthwhile replacement for HS because 1. It improved damage subsequent to application, 2. In the event of a Dodge, allowed for OP, and 3. Allowed white hits to continue building rage, whereas HS would replace them, leaving a net loss of rage.
---
Have you played a warrior?
---
Ur a legend dude, awesome!

Looks nothing like Mulgore lol

*Embarrassing*

Make sure you kill civilians.

This looks exactly like something I've wanted. I use Google tasks and Google keep constantly in RL and at work so I dont forget things. This will be an awesome intuitive way to do the same thing in wow! Thank you sir.
---
Make the "minus" to get rid of an item on the list to an "x" Just looks better imo.
---
Personally if I only had 30 minutes to play I would have to find something different to play 30 minutes is just getting warmed up on here but more power to ya if you want to do that.

I think it cancels their mining if you open trade during.

Dude the games been out for weeks. My experience on faerlina isnt much different than Herod or Stalagg or Skeram.  In fact, we got ddosed for a week on faerlina and the insane queyes have caused less ppl to be at cap than herod/stalagg. Youre just making that shit up. 
---
All of the major servers with queue issues also have healthy populations at 60. The options to transfer do not. Your made up bullshit arguments are really tiring.
---
lol these fucking guys
---
Yeah you will see way more misses. Typically your off hand weapon is like 50% faster but it's still a dps increase lol. Plzplzplz DW your rogue lol
---
The only thing I used machines for was whatever those reverse leg curls are called....because, how the F do you do that without a machine?
---
Yeah but "optimized builds" were always a thing. 
---
Do I want an extra Eyes of the Beast for 60 seconds or do I want my pet to have an extra 6% health? 
---
One is clearly useful and the other is so situational it's irrelevant.
---
I agree with that, I'm not sure if I can see myself joining a group where they want to greed everything. I'd hate to have something really valuable ninja looted.
---
Thats a weird comparison seeing as how these are different games.
---
This would be amazing but I do not think enough people will be around still by the time they get around to considering BC servers
---
I have both rank 1 and max rank on my bar so I can interrupt without pulling, or pull if tank needs help.

Oh hey, I just installed this last night. Way better than another todo list addon I had downloaded.

One thing that did bug me was that hitting enter when entering text cleared the box (or maybe made a newline?) when I expected it to add the entry. Would be useful for it to do that.
---
No, it will say some shit like "XXX does some weird gestures towards you. Who know?"
---
When the HoT ticks it's going to pull heal agro on any mobs that haven't been touched. Classic doesn't have much risk of the tank dieing on a pull so it's easy to wait a few seconds before healing.
---
Yeah died only twice coming it, got my pet to pull guards and AoC the hell in there as quick as possible :p
---
that's a hilarious oversight, if correct.

I see a lot of people recommend leatherworker for rogue/druid, tailor for cloth classes, blacksmith for plate classes etc. but I think its really important to note that all of the good items from any of these armor crafting professions are BoE. 
---
In other words taking leatherworking just so that you can craft your own devilsaur is at BEST a very minor convenience reward, given you could have just farmed gold with the time you were farming devilsaur and buy the gear from someone else (Or take skinning without leatherworking, get the hides yourself and find a leatherworker to tip a few gold).
---
So if you consider opportunity cost there's very little advantage to having an armor making profession unless you manage to get your hands on a rare recipe early or something but its probably already too late for that. Basically you just need to have one trusted crafter you know (in your guild, or just someone you find you can trust out in the world) and you have access to everything from that profession without wasting one of your two profession slots.
---
TL;DR: if you want to make money while leveling, take gathering professions like mining/skinning or herb/skinning. If you want special items that make your character stronger than a character without the same professions, go for engineering or enchanting. They are money sinks but they have some unique items that are very strong for end game and/or pvp (that you cannot get otherwise). Alternatively what a lot of people do is take gathering professions till 60 to make extra money then switch to their "true" endgame professions.
---
Who?
---
I love this! Create your own tasks and quests in game! I'm constantly writing things on paper. I'm not at home but when I go home I'm going to download this!
---
It's not pointless.  It's a PvP server.  Fucking with the other faction is *literally* the only reason to make a character there as opposed to a PvE server.
---
&gt; People genery use the neutral ah to transfer between factions on their own toons
---
that really only works on PVE servers as on PVP ones you cant have both factions on the same server (unless you run 2 accounts)
---
Been using ElvUI and it's been working well. Total conversion though so if that's not your cup of tea.
---
I came in this thread to spray Wyoming all over it so I'm glad you already had that handled
---
Swap to arms. I've been running arms since level 10. It's the spec you'll want to run for pvp, it's great for soloing and tanking. Fury isn't hard to learn but it requires a decent amount of hit gear to be viable.
---
Have you had it dropped from Emperor or seen it from Emperor? Because nobody saw it drop from Emperor. I know he used to drop it more back in the day (according to patch 1.x comments) but it doesn't seem to be the case anymore..
---
Also tbh if you're in that level range it might be worth seeking out the Hydrocane. Enough quests happen in or around water that it's probably worth keeping as a utility item.
---
I agree with above. Did it in vanilla and doing it again  in classic as an arms warrior. Honestly, even dungeons with ubrs, scholo, etc. can be tanked effectively by an arms warrior.
---
Open world was hotfixed several days ago by adding on a X minute cooldown every time you switch. So no, bans are going out for instance-based boss-resets only.
---
Any /emote for the opposite faction will show as something like "X makes strange gestures."
---
1. What time do you believe is peak in number of players online? Saturday through Sunday? I am looking to save my items and only post them at the AH on the weekends.
---
1. Also auctioneer has an option to allow 48 hours auction duration, but vanilla only shows 24h. Can auctioneer post at 48h?
---
Yeah no worries.  I don't get upset that people have different opinions this topic just points out the need for me to make a macro so I don't have to type this out to start every group.  It's all good though.  Good luck on your adventures and happy hunting.
---
Fair enough! i will use both swords just because it looks cooler.
---
But i still wonder if it is always better to use the higher dps weapon in the main hand. Just for future reference
---
Someone did this to me yesterday, and I called them out while fighting a mob ON the node. Person stared at me, and then clicked on the node again and ran away without a word.

The information we have is messed up rather, but yeah. Thanks for the info.

Healthy populations at 60? Sure.
---
Exactly
---
I got the Alliance treatment :( Killed many 15 - 20s on the way though, i didnt die in vein
---
It's not relevant for the rogue quest.
---
I always keep a close eye on any warriors questing/farming near me (hunter, used to play warrior in vanilla). If they have that sort of trouble, they'll see a few quick hits coming in, possibly a distracting shot if they're really close to death.
---
Always back up your fellow faction members
---
probably, dude loves to spend ~$10 at frkn mcds
---
Well, you can do all of this anyway? You don't need a queue to do your things?
---
So you’re saying you can’t heal. Gotcha.
---
Yeah, took 2/3 deaths from the entrance, thank god for having a pet to pull guards :p
---
I agree, thanks for the clarification. I will definitely be pugging often so I wanted to check how the usual system goes
---
this AOE cleave meta has ruined the game.
---
Dude refers to himself as a "zoomer" cringe is off the fucking charts
---
To the left all along the edge of the flats mixed with other mobs.
---
I had a rogue tell me not to use that totem because it would screw with his poison. Is this true?
---
Weapon enchants? Probably firey, but cheap? Nope.
---
There's no point in paying for enchants until you are getting endgame gear. You'll replace gear far too quickly.
---
They are the most versatile class in the whole game, but master of nothing. Other classes have better escape mechanisms, or better heals, or better damage output. Still the most fun class in the game in my opinion though!

There are typically discords for each server. I haven't gone to any yet so cant tell you much about them. Heres from the wow classic forums

cleave doesn't even need to be on your bar as a tank as it generates wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy less threat than a single sunder and is extremely rage inefficient.

INTRO:
---
This is the classic guild for the 2004 Boulderfist alliance guild The Incredibles. We are a strong community of gamers that still clear heroic raids in BFA. We also had a large SWTOR guild, a LOTRO guild, clans in Starcraft, Diablo, Steam, League of Legends, etc.
---
GOAL:
---
Make new friends.
---
Clear classic raids (just like we did in Vanilla)
---
Currently everyone is enjoying leveling, several of us are approaching 60, but all levels are welcome, over 60 people on during peak hours and 300+ accounts active in the guild.
---
EXPECTATIONS:
---
If we grow enough multiple raid teams might be a thing to allow those who wish to aim for server firsts to do so. That being said we aim for low drama with mature players. Websites:
---

but which class were you?
---
I'd hit it...
---
Demonology warlocks are like land mines. I can't count the number of times Horde warriors and rogues have tried to gank me, but they're never able to get through my double void sac shields. I remember vividly being jumped in STV by a pair of Horde warriors while I was fishing and killed them both.
---
I think it's a matter of throwing the baby out with the bath water. The major complaints about retail come down to
---
1) The world feels empty. There's little reason to ever actually talk to people or work with people. Most of the content is super easy and even when you do have to group up all you do is click a button to form a group with some randos, breeze through the content, then never see or speak to them again. Everything is spelled out for you so there's no sense of discovery.
---
2) There's no sense of challenge. The content while leveling (and a lot of it after hitting cap) is so easy a monkey could do it. If you're decked out in heirlooms nothing will be able to touch you. Even if you're not you likely won't ever die unless you do something *really* stupid. The early game dungeons are a joke, partly thanks to heirlooms because even if you're not wearing them odds are most of your party will be so you can just sit back while like two or three players just face rolls the whole damn thing. There's no struggle, you never really feel like you over came any sort of challenge, so there's no feeling of accomplishment.
---
3) Gear crafting professions are completely pointless. Any gear you make while leveling barely will be replaced quickly and even if its not the content is so easy that making sure you've got good, level appropriate gear is hardly necessary. Once you reach the end game you get epics so easily that you don't need to ever craft gear or buy crafted gear.
---
Basically I think of a lot of the complaints about Vanilla, BC, and WotLK era WoW are valid but Blizzard went way too far with the streamlining process and as a result the game lost a lot of what it's fan base used to love.
---
Sure,  there's also always people that will take the 3 or 6 cause it's a better deal and they think they'll last.
---
Combat daggers &gt; any spec for raid. You're not going to get PvP goodies and still do as well in raids. Just how it goes. That changes some once gear levels get back to AQ/Naxx levels 
---
, but for now thems the choices.
---
Keep aggro off the healer and let the dps die. It's the only way they will learn.. or they won't.. I stopped trying
---
Last jerk who did this to me got a gift wrapped bear carcass and a snide letter.
---
Sounds like he has I'm a massive crybaby syndrome
---
Just be prepared for the floodgate to open if you do lol
---
Yeah but what do you get out of it? I don't mean rewards, I mean...... what even motivates you to do it? Its not a challenge, if you're trying to bait higher level guys to come take you on then you usually don't have to wait long.
---
You're implying that that's how you like to play the game, but why? Do you enjoy standing above 5 year olds because you're taller than they are?
---
I'm really asking.
---
Meh, I get what you are saying however asking in chat for others on your faction to help you fight back is also part of the PvP experience. 
---
Nothing wrong with getting ganked and then asking for help from your faction to get that sweet revenge.
---
Very true
---
That is a really cool addon! Maybe I will try to make this one to me. Looks it will be fun.
---
Stop questing. Quests are not intended as the main way to level, and you're not meant to beeline them from one hub to the next like you did in retail (after the post-Cata overhaul).
---
If you want to level up efficiently, you scout out optimal grind spots (mobs at +0 or -1 to your level), then check to see if there may be any quest hubs nearby where you can grab some kill or drop quests on the way. If you get one that is for higher level mobs, ignore it until you're ready to grind them. I don't know you, but from reading this rant I feel like open world mob grinding is right up your alley and might help you de-stress a bit.
---
While you're doing this, group randomly with people you are around. You'll meet more folks out in the open world who are not the dad set / vanilla vets / gate keeping private server min/maxers, and you're more likely to meet people your own age because they never played vanilla either, so they don't know wtf to do except run around questing blindly like you were doing up to now. And then you can share your secret ways with them and they'll be all like "OMG you're the best thanks so much I wanna be your friend now."
---
Eventually you may find someone to invite you to a decent guild. Or not. In which case, start a zoomer guild. Limit your recruiting to only people who never played vanilla. I'd bet there are plenty who would want to join a guild that has no veteran players by design to not spoiler everything in the game or gripe about every little detail they see that is slightly off from back in the day or constantly lecture zoomies about the right way to play.
---
Or just quit for a while. You'll be back.
---
How so? They hit need.
---
Then you see them learn the recipe or equip the item.  Problem solved
---
You must be new to this game...
---
Thanks, this helped with my macros being deleted - but it still resets my frames and puts them back into the default spot.. Any ideas?
---
yeah not even in dungeons really unless the tank has a big pull or if someone fucks up
---
That's a lot of words, geez. Hope it turned out alright, I didn't read them all.
---
I'm a 28 priest. If the bulk of my damage comes from my wand, why go deep into shadow? I put 5/5 Spirit Tap, 5/5 Improved Wands, then I went 5/5 Holy Specialization and 4/5 Divine Fury.

I Smite, Mind Blast, SWP, then wand. I want to keep going into Holy. I like healing and I like the heal-enhancing talents.
---

---
There is some evidence that suggests the best time to post stuff to the AH is actually Tues/ Wed, as it lines up with raid resets and that's when high level people are buying consumables for raids. Also, more people playing mean more sellers as well as more buyers. There will be more volume on the AH during the weekends, which will saturate the market.
---
This could be different on your server. Scan the AH regularly with Auctioneer and see how prices fluctuate.
---
If you're arguing that new games are designed to subtly give rewards to encourage playing, that's the exact design of WoW.  Do we not recall all the complaining of how WoW ruined their lives because it was so addictive?  Well why's it addictive?

oh i see, i tought it was 2.8 atks per second LUL thanks for the answer

It's funny this layer exploit was fully similar to something you could do in vanilla.

I litersally have a Notepad on my desktop screen named "WoW To Do List". Definitely gonna use this.

Haven't seen BW yet. Will keep that in mind.

16-18 sucked for me. I went to Loch Modan at 18 and wish I would have gone at 16.
---
It's really not. You get easy groups sure, but unless you're doing lame dungeon spam, you aren't doing dungeons that often. Warriors are like half a player until 40, where we become decent.
---
And realistically, if that was an option where I live I probably would have done it. As long as I make it from point A to point B on time I don’t care how I get there. But in my free time I want to be on the best computer I can be because I want to. As shown, just because it is your logic doesn’t mean it’s right.

Enhancement: Fishing for WF procs 
---
Elemental: Fishing for Clearcasting procs
---
Great thing about the game is that you can try out both. Play them and decide which one you have more fun playing. Randos on the internet, god love em, have different tastes than you and may like one more than the other. Take it from a vanilla shaman that has played all the the specs through the years, play what you have fun doing.
---
I do this if I'm bored and have to kill 30 minutes before doing something else. Quit being a wank and just get your guild or your friends to come kill them instead of whining about it.
---
Blizzard can also collect metadata in screenshots that they can't in a cellphone pic, just FYI.
---
Why not? You're not doing anything else with your life.
---
Ok, cya back in the game loser.
---
I liked the way it was before!
---
Less pretty,  but also less clutter on my screen...
---
The quests only showed when I was actively completing them.  Any way of reverting to this??
---
&gt;I really like the idea of being an ele shaman, throwing lightning and shocking enemies, chain lightning groups of mobs now and then and feeling like a storm lord. I also like the idea of imbuing my weapon with the power of the elements, but I know it will eventually turn into fishing for windfury procs.
---
So if this is what you really want to do, I'd recommend enhancement.  You'll still have access to chain lightning,  lightning bolt, and all the shock spells.  You can use them to pull and or kill runners.  Enhancement is widely accepted and viable while leveling so you shouldn't encounter much grief while playing it if you're trying to do dungeons. 
---
Push through until you get windfury weapon.  Then get the biggest slowest 2h weapon you can find and enjoy the ride!
---
If you really don’t give a fuck then why would you use asterisks
---
Two cents are cool, so here are mine:
---
I'm so tired of this being repeated ad nauseum. Need/greed are words with actual meaning. What you are describing falls into the greed category. 
---
Actually, taking a BiS upgrade from someone just because you can, so you can sell it for gold is quite close to the very definition of greed. How is this any different that needing on dal rend MH, so you can vendor it? One step closer to that epic mount by doing that, guys. Definite need!
---
If the priest doesn't need it, he too should greed, and voila - everyone participating gets a chance at reaping the fruits of their labour. If the priest needs it, however, can't everyone be happy for him, when he finally gets the pattern to rule them all? 
---
We need more bonus pater familias in the world, and less me, myself and I. It's an MMO, where friendships and being a cool guy gives you benefits in the long run - not a dog eat dog world.
---
There are all different
---
What I am sick of is everybody believing the "wisdom of crowds" and flat refusing any dps other than a mage. My groups usually go just as smooth without one than they do with one so why can't people just accept everyone and play the game how classic is supposed to be played. They may be relevant for AoE, but just prioritizing targets with marks can be just as easy and less exhaustive on the healer.
---
Yup, weapon is just a stats stick. I strive for mostly agi but str is great too.
---
Why would any shaman knowingly cast Earth Shock unless it is rank 1 being used as an interrupt. If a proc ends up pulling aggro I swap targets so the tank can get it back. 
---
If it’s a single target and WF is going off every other swing, then I’m sorry but that RNG rarely happens and I’m gonna go all out.
---
Imo enhance is a ton more fun that ele in vanilla. Getting lucky windfury procs and beating the life out of people with a giant 2h mallet seems like a blast to me. Not to mention you can still use your “ele” spells since this is classic and your class gets pretty much free use of every specs abilities. Just go through the talents and see which tree you like more and go with it.
---
Preach!
---
Yup same can be said about shamans and fury warriors, BIS is sometimes times leather gear.
---
Sound like you’ll be only playing with mages then with that mentality.

https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/faerlina/50

both have 3000 ish level 50+ hordes.

and the server we could transfer to:
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/earthfury/50
---
250 people.
---
How about you look at WoWPop?
---
There is no special case for Faerlina having tons of 60s. It is exactly as I described it.
---
oh becareful youre going to get bombarded with envious rage of comments saying youre playing too fast
---
Mining/skinning.  Drop skinning later for engineering.  You can buy everything else from other crafters.
---
Even if you see people offering free enchants the low level ones aren't even worth the time it takes to travel back to town.
---
If you're worried about farming then you have to take into account howe all the time you spend looking for incremental gear upgrades is time you could have been actively gaining exp/gold.
---
Often the only important upgrades are when you can get a significantly better weapon or learn new skills you actually will use for dps.
---
same, never stepped foot in a lvl 60 dungeon after playing a ton of vanilla. Never got an epic mount.
---
This time around, already cleared Ony and most of MC. Ready to go haha
---
Hunter with Jumper Cables is the only way to go.
---
Dungeon grinding SM as a healer was a nightmare because of these mages. Every single mage thinks they understand their class enough to AoE clear every dungeon. It either takes longer than a normal clear because now we all need to drink for 3 minutes between every pull, the mage pulls way too many and can’t damage them enough before he’s OOM and sprinting away from a crowd of enraged myrmidons, or a melee gets too close to the group and gets insta-killed.
---
TLDR: People (mages) need to accept that they might not understand the basics of their class as much as whatever mage YouTube video creator does.
---
Rogues have no more entitlement than those who helped them get to the chest, you can disagree all you want but it's group content that has those chests and the group is needed to access it in the same way the rogue is, the group has the same entitlement to it the rogue does. I will continue to share and those who refuse to will slowly be eradicated like any other pest like a roach or termite.
---
Go for the blunderbuss. The higher damage range means your abilities like Aimed Shot will do more damage. 
---
But also the blunderbuss has a slower attack speed than the bow. The bow has a 2.2 attack speed, meaning it auto-attacks once every 2.2 seconds. The blunderbuss has a 2.8 attack speed, meaning it auto-attacks once every 2.8 seconds. The bow will attack faster, the gun will hit harder and slower.
---
If you could stop the opposite faction from killing low level NPCs, if you could make that change in the game, across the board, would you?

Would be cool if you could change the order of them.

Spam blizzard in dungeons, just let me get everything to 60% health first.... I need a head start on that blizzard otherwise I'm not going to maintain agro until they're all dead. Also, you'll only have to blizzard once, and AE  few times to finish off the group, then you can sit and drink while I pull the next group... by the time your mana is back it'll be time for the AOE again, and the cycle completes. 
---
Very little CC is required, and we finish the instance in record time.

(not responding AT you, but more WITH you.)

Carry on.

That asshole who sees someone casting at a mob and attempts to charge it while the spell is mid-air is the worst.

---
Could you ask your guildies? Because I saw it drop literally 1h30 ago from Angerforge. But I'd like to know if it drops from Emperor because it'd be a better boss for me to farm (also the drop rate seems higher as he drop 2 items I believe).

So it shall be after all we mele classes are a civilised bunch... well we shan't invite the paladins... i am certain you understand m reasoning. Conference is to be held at the Ravenhodlt Manor tomorrow at noon. *pops back into stealth*

do I install both? https://i.imgur.com/70bLwYp.png

Or alternatively you don't see them learn the recipe and instead they just sell it. I'm in fact a very old player and have had my fair share of ninjas who seem to appear when a valuable drops.

I never gank unless it's a mage AOE farming in the wild

C'mon now, you can do better. I had such faith on this dance.

I raid healed with a druid from MoP to Legion and it was the most fun I've ever had in WoW besides my mage
---
Yeah, mulgore is much more like [this](https://previews.123rf.com/images/allison14/allison141305/allison14130500005/19560915-desert-landscape-of-parriott-mesa-near-castle-valley-utah.jpg) except greener.
---
That kinda defeats the purpose of classic...
---
It’s the toxic/racist/homophobic guild chat that turns me away.
---
Is it really that hard to kick these degens?
---
What’s the mouse over technique?
---
i mean I learnt that shit from this sub. this sub implemented that shit in my brain. this game did that. i've heard of those terms before classic but when classic was announced thats when these terms started getting flown about in the sub reddits the discords and ingame. i mean everyones talking about generational divide and shit in my guild and on my server. fuckin big streamers are doing that shit now. i remember in one of punkrats videos he literally said something like bois were geezers now, or some shit like were not the youngest generation playing the game anymore. i mean its all a bunch of bullshit at the end of the day lets face it. being born into a generation doesnt really mean shit, you are free to adapt and change as you please and not hold on to your generations majority view. you get assholes in every generation, im the example of an asshole in my generation. let it be
---
True, you can use it to spot if all dps joins in but thats it, classes, different levels all make e-peening about high or low dps completely stupi.
---
The final few levels I will be just running dungeons almost exclusively. I’m going to be farming them for pre raid gear so why not? 
---
But yes - coming from OSRS I love to grind mobs!
---
1:08 - This is why you have 2 other openers.  Either one of those kill you.
---
Has worked for me every single time :) I purposely leave channel invites on just to see the pop up so I can report them.
---
Problem is totems don't transfer threat to the shaman.  Let's say you have a 4 mob pull.  ES one to pull, start meleeing a 2nd, how do you keep mobs 3 and 4 off your healer?
---
Ninja last hits in dungeon with your wand, unlimited mana!! I've yelled at my dps buddies over Discord to let me get last hits, it's like a mini innervate, you're unstoppable :)
---
Yep everybody should play in a way that it's fun for them. I'm lvl 52 with 300 herb, 270 alchemy, 200 fishing/cooking and like 6 days and a half /played but less gold, around 180g.        
---
Having tons of my fun with my priest, a few guildies are already at 60 but I'll get there eventually, no need to rush unless you have fun rushing (and some people really do like it).
---
They're just not that good at anything. Whether people say they're "enjoying" it or not the fact of the matter is they suffer heavily from hybrid tax.
---
Yes I have both of those in my classic folder
---
Same.  Hot pockets go right through me to become poop pockets.
---
Paladin reporting in. I have had the exact opposite experience. I have leveled exclusively in STV through the 30s on a full server (Thalnos).
---
I vidi? I vici.
---
Most people think twice about ganking a paladin already anyway. Most people don't expect a paladin to gank them first.
---
And most people don't know about SoC.
---
But it's ok. I'll teach them.
---
Colonizer on Thalnos for anyone who wants to come at me. Good luck though.
---
Right, but as a dps, I'm going to do everything in my power to make it easier for the tank to see my name above all others. If a tank types /1 LF1M DPS WC then gtg, s/he's gonna get flooded with whispers.
---
If you want to mark and set kill priority, discuss if with your group before the dungeon or roll a tank.
---
Man these posts are the equivalent to a reply all telling everyone to please stop replying to all
---
Thank you so much for the writeup, this will probably keep me busy quite a while. Really good point on the class quest for the robe, forgot about that one. I'm alliance, gonna check if there is a quest for that orb. Gonna do SM as soon as I wrap up my current quests, mostly I postponed it because it's such a long walk. I have a wand for 31 dps iirc so not sure if I need gy. I agree stranglethorn isnt worth it with how overrun it is and how trigger happy everyone is there.
---
The free version goes to level 13 or something, the paid has everything plus it’s updated fairly frequently
---
you are literally superior to that guy because he cares about stupid minmaxing and you on the other hand are actually the one who's having fun!! Congratulations and I really hope some of your superior ways rubs off on him and he can just learn to take a chill pill and start having fun!!! :) :) :)
---
He's the invincible not invisible.
---
I have to use the controller hooked up to the steam link to minimize big picture and launch WoW. After that I have to use the controller hooked up specifically to my computer. It's wireless so not a huge deal for my needs.
---
Jack of all trades, master of fun.
---
People were misinformed in vanilla as there wasn’t as much information available and it’s still carries over today.
---
It’s only boomkin spec that sucks until BC. Feral and Resto are incredibly good, especially in PvP.
---
What I would do is loot it first and then have everyone roll for the items.
---
You get a message in scrolling combat text when it procs don't you? Big text scrolls up from your character.
---
It's correct. There was an exploit (now hotfixed) that allowed you to respawn instances, including raids, by leaving the group and having someone outside the instance on a different layer invite you to their group. This was used to kill instance bosses without having to re-clear, and to acquire extra loot from raids.
---
Luckily it looks like they've got a lot of tracking software under the hood for this iteration of Vanilla, allowing them to track loot, mats, and boss kills (if their world layer resetting analysis post was any indication). They might be able to auto-target, which would actually be less biased towards streamers. Give it 24 hours and you might see something happen.
---
Class balance? What? Ummmmm how about rock/paper/scissors balance?? It's way better, trust me. I don't want to be all-powerful, but I want to have a distinct advantage against another class, regardless of how good their gear may be. In that way, they will always need assistance beating me. In the same way, I always want to have a disadvantage against another class. In that way, I always require assistance beating them. 
---
This IS balance. And it forces teamwork and rewards cohesion. If "tweaks" need to be made, maybe for PvE, ok w/e. Maybe. Mayyyyybe.
---
Only half are. The regular level ones are all dead from everyone else farming them too
---
I like this :) now do affliction warlock please ;)
---
Good, while im not sure the exact ban I feel on regular people, streamers need a perma. Theyre abusing their position to exploit as glitch moreso than everyome else.
---
And guess what they use? A profession.
---
How can you have been beat by ninja looters in the past who pretended they needed the item but sold it if everyone is supposed to roll need on items?
---
You just killed your own argument when you said this.  You just confirmed the rules and explained why you disagree with them
---
Twink items? Like what are we talking here ? Blizzard made specific items just for young gay men?
---
Professions and start looking for a raid group/guild you like that has the same mindset as you.
---
Oh. You were arguing in bad faith the whole time. Sorry for taking your feigned ignorance seriously. Cheerio.
---
Me but with ammo *and* water
---
Use the blizzard built in raid frames, should be a tick box in there to convert party frames to raid frames and that shows pets for me at least.
---
What lvl are u currently and how should i spec it out? Is there one known way to spec out arms
---
Hell yeah. Now we’re getting married, never having kids, and have infinite time to do whatever we want because we’re a bunch of hedonistic beautiful bitches. 
---
I’ve been working full time yet playing for many hours a day with my SO. Classic WoW is exactly what I’ve wanted for so many years.
---
His face isn't on his channel?
---
In vanilla one of my favorite things to do was tame a cat in darkshore on my horde hunter. Use eye of the beast and just randomly walk and get low levels to attack and then just kill them with my pet.
---
Why does it say that my game isn't supported?
---
Well you're clearly missing the point of an rpg then.
---
I have them bound to side buttons in mouse
---
Unless it's different in classic coming from the private server I was on, all you get is a little bit of feint shadowy bullshit around you. It's not anywhere near noticeable enough for such an important proc, get an addon.
---
I will look on how I can add that!
---
do you only speak in twitch terms?
---
Just buy them in the AH
---
"I find someone I think oh I might actually add you after so we can do more. And then he says something like "oh my babies crying let me go give it some milk" "
---
What? are you mad they didn't turn out to be a hot girl in the apartment next door? 
---
There's no reason you can't make in game friends and get along with people who aren't in a tiny 2 year age bubble around you. Do you think out in the real world everyone's friends are the same age as them? That's a phenomenon unique to school because the system gathers you with with like-aged people. You're going to have to learn to get along with someone who's not in your grade level.
---
And if you want a girlfriend take lgb6's advice in the post above and go get involved in something at college it does not get easier afterward. You are in the easiest environment in the world to make friends and date people but you won't accomplish that sitting in your room being depressed and wining to reddit.
---
Respeccing is so expensive :( I don’t want to spend a gold to reallocate 8 points lol
---
Cross-faction Collusion is a bannable offense.
---
yep that is correct possibly
---
Which threat meter have you found to be the best?
---
You know that just isn't as devastating as it is for the grp if you just leave.  They'll be outstandingly lucky to get another tank, and by about 20 the attrition becomes very hard on quality tanks, and to a some smaller degree healers.
---
If it weren't so, there would be more people willing to do the job, but this thread is a great example of the state of tanking.
---
It's not good! For DPS at least.  So if you are DPS, then be nice to your tank.  Learn how things work, and try not to be 'that' guy.  You don't really need to do much beyond:
---
1. Attack my target.
---
2. If you pull aggro. Stop. Move to me, use your threat reduction abilities, if you have them.  Wait for me to get aggro back, switch to wanding for a bit, or keep a closer eye on your threat.
---
3. AoE intelligently if the situation calls for it.  This rarely means "Before I have even aggroed spam aoes!" If it doesn't pass the common sense test, don't  do it.
---
4. Don't be a dick.  Do things right but be an asshole? I don't feel like putting up with you anyways.  I'm not going to be an asshole unless you are, and it's more devastating if I am.
---
Several, but for specifics: Leatrix Plus and ElvUI off the top of my head.
---
I am indeed planning to add tabs or two levels or items, so you can categorize it better :)
---
PvP servers have always been about ganking. It's never an even fight. The person attacks first wins almost every time, no skill involved. Ganking is still fun for a lot of people, but these delusional ideas of fair fights are so uncommon it's not worth mentioning.
---
This seems like a post directly out of r/wowcirclejerk
---
Well for some reason i read you rant.  Unfortunately I don't really know what the takeaway here is.  I always thought leveling was the worst part of WoW.  The lvl 40 area may be the worst because at 50 you can start your endgame gear grind and 1-30 is a lot easier.
---
I'm not sure though if WoW classic is for you.  Running around the world and bustin your tail to get to 60 are kinda the hallmarks of old WoW.  So if you don't enjoy it maybe classic isn't for you.
---
My bigger question is to your guilds.  I don't know what you're expecting of them, but if you haven't found one maybe your expectations of what a guild will offer you are overambitious.
---
Yeah, and all those people who complained of time sink probably didn't actually enjoy the game they were playing anymore. Its only a time sink if you're not enjoying it. 
---
For me in BfA the island expeditions felt like a time sink because I hated that grind, only doing them because it was required to power up my heart of azeroth. Whereas traveling overland in classic doesn't feel like a time sink because it immerses me in the world and sets me up for random encounters with other players.
---
My experience in Classic so far has been that same-faction players are incredibly courteous when it comes to nodes. If I see someone fighting a mob and a node is nearby, I ask them if they're a miner before I go and tap it.
---
But for opposite faction players, yeah sorry I'm going to snatch that node right out from under you when you're fighting another mob. Did so last night in the Badlands, after a rogue unstealthed and snatched a node right out from under me 10 levels ago.
---
Dont listen to people saying pally isnt great until you try it for yourself. There's no reason you couldnt ever go back to your druid if you ended up hating paladin. Play what you wanna play--plus if you want to heal, paladins can be some of if not the best tank healer in the game.
---
very true actually J Allen brack predicted my future. he was right, i dont want this shit
---
It’s 2004, we take pictures with our motoralla
---
That mob you had at 100hp when you are on 100hp? That's my reward, joink.
---
Earth Shock shamans.
---
Thanks mate! Something doesn’t work there for me, but I’ll live with it
---
isnt it gtfo
---
)) smiley faces. they use them alot) and never add eyes)
---
No one asked for 3 to 1 population skews and servers with 70k populations. There is serious overpop and faction imbalance on some servers that hasnt existed before to this level. I realize you are too up your own ass to realize this but people are complaining because playing the game like this in certain zones simply isnt doable. You literally cannot quest.
---
They're rocks Hank.
---
Of course GRIZZLY got banned..
---
Nah Rattlegore. Just saying it is kinda the same sort of thing on both sides of the street. World of WARcraft, after all. It does get discouraging sometimes, but it also fuels that fire in a very real way, not just some artificial "we are at war, you guys are supposed to not like each other" and not really feeling that. It actually puts you in a mindset that you really do not like them.
---
I will add a function that tracks how many of an item you have farmed, if you link that item to the note
---
Im a rogue and I always collect mana drinks and potions that I get from chests and drops then when I quest and I see a Priest, Lock drink I just run up to them and give em my water and mana pots.
---
Idiot.
---
As a person who started playing like 1 week ago
---
How long does it take to complete a dungeon?
---
Correct, think I explained poorly. The extra damage that my white hits did due to sunder being applied was far less than the extra damage that Heroic Strike added. Only once I had 3-4 sunders was it noticeable, and only on certain mobs. However, I rarely got more than 1 or 2 sunders on a mob before it was dead, so there wasnt much point.
---
I'm on a server that's like 3:1 horde favored if not more.  I'm alliance.  I kill any horde I see.  I don't care if I'm 40 levels higher than them.
---
Deal with it.
---
I'm not going to/I can't even try it out.
---
Just a heads up. The term is "intents and purposes". Not important, but I wanted to be pedantic
---
If she was wearing a skirt and deliberately walked down the street at 3am labeled "if you walk down this street you will be raped" then yea it's her fault if she gets raped.
---
Walk down a non-specifically rape street if you don't want rape (pvp)
---
Call Tore på sporet.
---
Blizzard apologists favorite line to say haha
---
Seems to be a druid thing.
---
Only class that has thus far stolen nodes from me. Everyone always waits until I'm done killing the mob next to it to see if I'm going to mine (which I almost always do).
---
In Vanilla I played a Priest on Ally - often I let a Gnome tank die just to hear that death emote - I still giggle thinking about it 😎😵
---
Nah wotf fuckin sucks dude. Not much you can do but try and drain tank em. Go afflic down into siphon life. And the drain life interuption thing, You'll be fine.
---
There's just no mmo that rivals classic atm. I would play something else if there was something good out there. Meanwhile I'll play classic and have a lot of fun doing it.
---
You're a star!
---
tbf they're already arbitrarily locking people out of a server which has room for them. The servers have near infinite capacity due to layering, blizzard is just putting in arbitrary population caps to prepare for phase 2 and layering going away.
---
So this really wouldn't be that different, just using queues to fix a different problem than they are right now. 
---
Not a bad idea tbh
---
;)
---
Maybe It should say congratulations and not oh no, when there are no items in the list.
---
There is no etiquette, we get it and that's it!
---
Ohh, only show window in certain situations, that is a cool feature I can add
---
Most people leave it on the default of Group Loot.
---
Classic doesn't need that now though.  A decently informed raid can faceroll MC and Ony easy af to gear up for the next phase.
---
I'm not a subreddit!
---
How will that help them keep better track of their CC timers?
---
39? probably not. 35, why not?
---
Do you only speak in hate terms?
---
Kind of the same thing happened to me as I was the 4th dps invited. Since I am an Arms warrior I said I'd tank. Healer insisted I stayed with my 2 hander and we cleared RFD clean. Was my first time tanking with a 2 hander and it was a blast, WW axe and SS/WW held aggro and top dps.
---
Looking this up on wowhead, it looks like the quest isn't in the game (may have been in beta), and Questie is erroneously showing it.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2358/horns-of-nezra
---
&gt; Questie shows this as a follow up. But that seems to be wrong info from Questie.  
---
&gt; I asked around random rogues via /who and in trade chat. No one was able to get this quest. Which leads me to the conclusion that it's actually not in the game.
---
&gt; I remember it being broken for some time in Vanilla and be available again in Wrath of the Lich King later on. It's probably broken in the current Patch 1.13 client and thus noone can get it.
---
Buff cap is supposed to be 32, but there's clips of Songflower Serenade being pushed off by Flurry at 22 buffs, and now there's a pretty solid theory that passive auras also contribute to the buffcap. Imagine a warrior getting a Flurry proc and that pushes off the 2% hit he gains from the devilsaur set bonus, or imagine one of your melees getting one of their consumables or world buff get pushed off because they got wolf howl for a split second and it put them over 32 buffs.
---
Melees are obviously not right-clicking howl, but they would right-click stuff like Intellect, Spirit, etc.
---
Depends on your definition of raid in WoW terms or in general. It shouldn’t have been too difficult to infer what he meant based on it being common knowledge that quests do not complete in raids as you said.
---
Netherwind is the same way. More casual population with a few of us crazies that are close or at 60. It’s fun the economy sucks but it’s still better than thalnos.
---
Use it and give feedback!
---
*I pay money I demand to see all content*
---
And that's how you got LFG and LFR.
---
But no, how about you put in the time and effort to see the raids you want to see. This is why Sunwell and Naxx were so mystical. You had to have a really good guild to even see a little bit of the raid. It creates wonder and excitement. LFR ruined that.
---
You presume to know a lot about another individual's situation.
---
People being 60 before you ruins the game for you, didn’t you know this already??
---
Also BFD. I think you're close to RFK level too.
---
Ah yes, I used to fall for that one. Good fun!
---
Generally speaking.  If it's an upgrade for you and your class can equip it you should be able to freely need on it.  
---
Some people are going to get their feelings hurt when it's an upgrade for them, too.  You can avoid some of that by talking to them before the item even drops.  Honestly, though?  While leveling just roll if you actually need it.
---
I like it.  It's simple but effective.  I forget everything so this would be perfect for me.  What's it called?
---
Yeah can’t help you with that bud. I got all my add on though the “twitch tv” program, it’s from the steaming website. It’s a really simple interface and just have to hit download on apps, no messing with folders.
---
As a Ret Paladin who tanks dungeons, I usually bring those dps Warriors and let them pull aggro on one mob and offtank. I'm personally not worried about leveling gear so they can help with my repair cost.
---
Is there any resources to see the ratio of horde and alliance for the PVP servers?
---
Not... normally. They have to kill and plague
---
My pleasure! You’ll really enjoy SM when you get there, worth the trek! :) dw if you die as well, the spawn is righteous it’s so 20 second walk! :) 
---
op robes! Aha 
---
The quest is neutral, potentially Ironforge by the look of this link: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=4965
---
Might want to still do GY for this, the final bosses 56% drop rate; that being said, I’ve done GY 10-12 times and 8 of those was the orb and the rest the shoulders! So I think the drop rate is higher haha https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7685/orb-of-the-forgotten-seer
---
Good Luck!!

100% of world pvp is unfair fights. This aught to be common knowledge by now. Even if you find yourself in a 1v1 with the same class, same level, same professions, same gear -- a person or a mob will come up and smack somebody, turning the tides. 
---
Some people call that trash, other people call that variety.
---
Regardless, its been common knowledge for years. And yet here we are still, with situations such as hordies in hilsbrad complaining that the level 30s alliance are killing them.
---
No shit, sherlock.
---
Alright, I will after work. Don’t want to google that at work
---
No it’s not.
---
And he was elting
---
I think it's more that is has been a long time since good things happened for me in a game this way. I've played a ton of games since vanilla, but I never recall having the chance to be nice and/or helpful, then end up being rewarded by the game - it was especially kinda cool because it was completely outside of anything the other players chose to do.
---
Isn't that the only "proof" though?  What Esfand says happened with his group is they clear UP TO rag the night before, don't kill him, and walk into MC the next day to find respawns.  
---
That's drastically different than using layering to have a boss respawn directly in your face, isn't it?
---
I would still be level 10 if I killed every alliance I saw close to my level range or lower.
---
Is there a good  aggro/threat add-on in classic?
---
I was jacked for BFA, I pre-ordered. I was grinding away in legion, got all the class mounts. Then allied races and leveling changes released. I was leveling the 4 races, when I realized I hated how the leveling process felt. it wasn't fun. I had done it 12 other times. I quit in april before BFA and didn't resubbed until the day before classic.
---
Now I am just slowly leveling up and trying not to burn myself out. I had played a private server rogue to almost BiS preMC gear, I am having just as much fun on my shaman.
---
It sounds like you are lowkey depressed.  Maybe you should make some changes in the day to day routine
---
If you spent time to level up your class ability, you feel entitled to the rewards said ability provides. Okay.
---
So if there's no mage in your group, you chip in for vendor water for your healer, right? Like they give you fort and start drinking, you give them a couple silver? And at the end of the run you maybe toss em 25 silver? 
---
Your priest farmed gold to buy water. They spent their time out of the dungeon to be able to heal you in a timely manner. The least you could do is compensate them for that time, and if you don't then you're a hypocrite. 
---
And you chip in for your tank's repair bill, because they're paying more for repairs, right? 
---
They pay more in repairs then you do, especially with you vanishing. They spent time to farm that gold to repair their gear to tank for you. 
---
A warlock has to go and farm soulshards before going to dungeon or raid. If you're entitled to compensation for having spent time to level your lockpicking, you better be compensating that warlock for each soulshard they spend to help you complete the dungeon. 
---
If you run through a dungeon where the hunter shows up with bags well-stocked with arrows, the priest shows up with bags well-stocked with water, the warlock summons you to the instance and distributes healthstones, the tank doesn't bitch about repairs, and you claim the locked chest for yourself, you're being a dick. Everyone else is doing something for you and paying their class tax. They've spread the love without complaint. Opening a chest is something that *you* can do for them.
---
Why don’t people understand what a pvp server is? Expect the worst, or fight back.
---
yea actually im going to delete that considering i posted it @ work lol
---
No you have incorrect information. The exploit was only working in instances. The one that esfand hit was a really old bug even present in vanilla.
---
This was all stated by Blizzard.
---
oh true!!! good point lmaooo
---
it is just a grab bag of sentences that sound like idiots on twitch say because they think it is funny.
---
Thx!
---
I mean I never said anything about selling. Cured rugged get better with time as well but yes I agree.
---
I got over 30 lotus as well but no reason to sell on stallag when they're 35g atm. 
---
My main goal now is just leveling alts to 35 for xmutes and what not
---
Just shows that everyone is greedy. Worst part is that is people complaining about it in the SM range, when people are preparing to need money for their mount but chests yield loot with crap value. At least there’s greens at that range though.
---
It would be nice for the town's to slightly develop over time.
---
As a shadow priest seeing a warrior is like seeing fresh meat. I can be nice and walk by... But I'm not going to.   I'm going to make your life extra miserable
---
if it makes you feel better, almost 2000 people agree.
---
I dont know where all the Elitist  Jerks guys are.  They should come post their theory crafting stuff here.  Its fun to figure stuff out like that.
---
I’ll look into that. Thanks for sharing all of this!
---
missing out on resets, so I am falling behind on getting gear.
---
if you are fighting your not mining its mine.
---
Not even close. Given you cant transfer to a pvp server once you want to have fair-use world pvp. They are victims of assholes. Plain and simple. I signed up for it and dont personally care, but to say they arent viticms of assholes is ignorant to say the least.
---
"911? Yes I just witnessed a murder."
---
Yeah, it's not hard. Sorry.
---
Omg I need to make an alliance again that place gave me so much headache!!
---
Forgot about this until I saw his. Thank you for reminding me of name
---
Should be renamed: Shadow Word: Taunt
---
&gt; Such as why the US creates laws to fix loopholes
---
Blizzard also has terms of service that all players agree to which specifically prohibit this type of behavior.
---
Subreddit, no, not that I've seen. You're probably better off going to the blizz forums, or the comment sections/threads of sites like wowhead and classic live.
---
[Well, there is SWGEmu,](https://www.swgemu.com/forums/index.php) which is coming close to launching their "finished" product (without Jump to Lightspeed, unfortunately). I've been playing on the SWGEmu servers for the better part of 8 years and it's been wonderful. If you're dying for SWG, the Emulator is your best (and only) source.
---
Of course, I'd rather see a good developer make a deep MMO in the spirit of SWG. I really enjoy WoW, but SWG was a genuinely unique experience that I've yet to experience since.
---
Mulgore is Wyoming/Dakotas dude. Beautiful pic but look up the Devils Tower in WY!
---
I view it the other way around.
---
I'm paying for classic and get this "free retail" option. =P
---
Im usually against stealing chests but yesterday i did it twice back to back and im not sorry.
---
You’ll probably have more luck finding a specialized discord channel for the aspects of the game you want to discuss.
---
this is the right way to handle it. usually will just resurrect, /afk and go do productive things. if they wait there staring at my corpse for 10 minutes, who's really winning?
---
Of course NA, why would I even ask in the first place...
---
I'm assuming that heavy leather?
---
You get boxes from pickpocketing. Lol
---
i dont have a consistent brain dude
---
Affliction or Demonology work well for leveling.
---
Raid DPS is typically Destruction.
---
New level of stupid achieved in that statement.
---
Woah, chill out m'dude.
---
You really are digging into it so deeply that you already dug long passed the answer. It doesn't take a genius for someone to figure out that they're literally just simply playing the game. You're on some bullshit about chemical responses and bringing up evolution and neuroscience.
---
Hillsbrad is always nuts. Not sure who started it, but this weekend on Herod, hillsbrad was essentially a battleground for two straight days
---
alot of ppl think warriors are the best tanks and the best dps class. rage as a resource is also infinite, so they can never oom like other classes can
---
warriors can use both of the vanilla legendaries
---
every race can go warrior
---
warriors have the entire plate armor type reserved for them (on horde side)
---
If someone asked me to put mine away before even starting the instance I would laugh in their face. Why would I gimp myself because a handful of hunter players are bad
---
That is a big downside. As much as I hate having to camp goblin spawns for an hour to get my tumbled crystals, I wouldn’t want the population to deteriorate.
---
Blizzard is fantastic at giving players what they want.
---
Players are absolutely trash at knowing what they want.
---
As a mage, most of my experiences were actually the tank just pushing the tempo with dps and heals barely hanging on. My mana breaks have been just enough to get back to half my mana as the tank will already be pulling the next group.
---
If you're in a *good* guild, you expect your guild members to act in an upstanding manner. Every member represents the guild so their actions are important.
---
You are right I don't but you are also wrong, you do control it.
---
That's funny to me, because my best friend ended up marrying a female Orc Warlock he met during Classic. (Well, not the Warlock...the player behind the Warlock.) They're doing great together.
---
\#notallfemaleorcwarlocks
---
Sounds like psychosis. Googles always right.
---
&gt; Odd you say that, I consider it a game I *can't* put down at a moment's notice. You need to find somewhere safe or you'll be dead, even logging out outside a city/inn takes 10 (20?) seconds. You can hearth, but it takes 10s and is limited to once an hour. 
---
But you can stop anywhere you want and do what you need. Unlike other multiplayer games where other people mostly depend on you. The joy of WoW is it's single player, yet multiplayer at the same time. It's extremely easy to put down and run an errand. You don't have to log out, you can just go afk. If you don't wanna run back to the city/inn the way to instant log out is alt+f4.
---
I have Spirit Tap/Wand Specialization, went down to Divine Fury in Holy to shorten the heals, and then straight down Disc tree. Great for healing groups which I'm doing a lot of and still have good solo questing capabilities. I think next I'm going to go 5/5 Force of Will for more damage and also takes me to PI, otherwise I'd have to waste 3 points to get down to Searing Light for the other real dps increase and I don't want to waste 3 points.
---
Triggered 😭
---
Because it does damage, and that's all that matters.
---
Personally I prefer if you stay on target after drawing aggro. Taunting one target back and styling a bit on it is easy. If you switch and draw another one that I just offtanked before, and then it gets annoying.
---
I prefer him looking like this
---
Hehe I spent 10 gold yesterday leveling my engineering and days mining the mithril. I thought I would get rich so I could buy my mount. Now I'm 10 gold short:)
---
It’s almost like when we hit 40 we don’t magically get a full set of level 40 blue plate items
---
anyways, dude I am out. Good luck.
---
If it was my opinion why did you admit the rules are from a long time ago?
---
I handle getting ganked the real way:
---
 &gt;Open General and Guild chat
---
 &gt; Tell them my situation
---
 &gt; Recruit an entire group/raid 
---
 &gt; Camp the person until all their gear is broken, they take rez sickness, or lose their will to continue playing the game
---
Nothing is better than meeting that ganker again 2-3 days later and they just turn the opposite direction of you because they don't want the smoke.
---
A good ol’ 1,5g wasted
---
&gt;You literally get nothing out of it besides ruining someone else's time.
---
They get fun out of it. They have fun doing it. It's absurd to think they're sad and they get nothing out of it. Different people have fun different ways. 
---
As far as "ruining someone else's time" I disagree. Getting ganked and the fear of getting ganked is an adrenaline rush. The first time it happens you have to decide are you going to continue trying to do the thing you were doing hoping they left, or are you going to switch gears and go somewhere else? It's a wrench in the game you have to deal with, and problem solving around getting ganked is a fun part of the game for me. 
---
Does it suck when I REALLY wanna get one specific thing done? Ya. Does it suck when you REALLY wanna run MC again today cause you're out of town all next week for the raid? Ya. But that's part of the game. Getting ganked is part of the game on a PvP server. Some parts of games suck, so that other parts feel SO much better. 
---
Getting ganked sucks, so that when you get revenge on that ganker or are able to reverse a gank and survive, or you get guildies to come help you get revenge... all of that is FUN to do. 
---
Complaining and whining and saying "it's not fair" is not fun and if that's what you're going to do then roll PvE. 
---
Not everyone plays this game with a moral code and it's absurd to assume that's how everyone would have fun.
---
So you're saying they have to change it up to help keep it fresh?
---
Which is my literal point?
---
This is accurate as combat (sword spec, mace spec, or general combat, doesnt matter). 
---
as Hemo  though, rupture (evisc if the target will die before rupture runs out) is your priority.
---
I mean, I made a pretty solid social guild during Cataclysm this way. The idea is to get enough people that there is always someone online in the guild, because the fastest way to a gquit is having no one online.
---
To prevent it from being a cesspool, guild leadership just has to kick the people who are dipshits as they reveal themselves.
---
Mind you, my officers and I but a stupid amount of effort into running fun events for our members. Most popular was hide and seek, where the first person to find each of us got a reward. We also had a gift exchange at Christmas and prize draws occasionally. We dumped pretty much all the gold the guild generated into fun stuff for the members, and worked hard to ensure everyone could participate.
---
I'm not saying that all the mass inviting guilds are like that, just that the whisper campaign alone does not equal a cesspool. If you don't want to join one, that's fine, but it's no reason to paint them with such a broad brush.
---
This is my number one inspiration yeah.
---
Very simple.
---
Open World: you can layer hop to skip around respawn times, as there's far too many players for the zones to realistically handle right now.
---
Instances: layering should NEVER be touching these. It has led to issues with instance locking as you can't see your party as you're on a DIFFERENT LAYER. And yes mass exploit.
---
Layering will (thankfully) be gone before world bosses come about, so there will be no exploiting world bosses and killing them repeatedly across multiple layers.
---
Hello fellow resto druid! So i have been healing for 15 years and i have found that all healers are versatile to a point depending how you want to play the class and build ur spec around that. So i was reading a guide on us druids the other day talking about how this dude heals mainly with different ranks of healing touch and that hots arent "mana efficient". I dont like this and i dont agree. So from my experience so far in classic in dungeons, which is a lot, i like to instance, you do take advantage of the 5 second rule. So tank healing, highest rank regrowth at about 50-60% health and thats it. If the damage taken is more than what the hot can handle chuck on a rejuv to, then just sit there as ur mana regens. 
---
Dont heal ur dps for no reason. If they have agrod a mob and need healing then fair enough, but try to only use rejuv or a lower rank healing touch. If a dps needs to be topped up but it isnt urgent, wait till ur tank needs another rejuv or regrowth and chuck a rejuv on ur dps at this point. It means ur using the 5 second rule for 2 friends and not just 1. Hots are important because they are healing ur party while ur mana is rejuvenating. Dont get me wrong, as soon as ur party fucks up ur mana is gonna be gone in no time and u will be drinking, but for smooth pulls of 3-4 or less mobs at a time u wont be drinking very often. 
---
If you dont have healbot i suggest you get it. Its great as it gives you mouse over healer with mouse button binded heals. It also gives you info on whos currently got threat, who needs buffing, who needs debuffing, how far up the bar your heal will heal for and lots more. This addon will make healing a shit tonne more fun and add more movability to ur toon to avoid mechanics. 
---
My main word of advice. Build ur spec around rejuv and regrowth and you wont go wrong.
---
LOLOLOL 
---
I wonder why my account hasn't been banned then, since I've been doing this since TBC - Now on retail on the same Blizz account.
---
I have a daily quota of 50 Horde ganked per day since Whitemane is in Horde favor ;)
---
Always wondered if they heard /flirt and /silly
---
TBH I'm with you on this one. I'm now lvl 51 after the mindless ZF GY grind. I'm fucking sick of waiting after ppl. Getting a group together and waiting 15 min so everyone group up, then waiting on god knows what to finally wipe after 2 pulls and realizing the group wont work is fucking horrible. I now only build group with people who want to play, not wait 30 minutes to kill 5 mobs. 
---
Gonna have to find a zoomer guild soon cause pugs after 50 seem painful.
---
Yeah I remember getting involved in people's drama in gchat/wchat back in vanilla. Now that I'm older, it's more like free TV to watch while I'm raiding.
---
So just tried it again and it seems like the first time you attempt to enter an item with the enter key it doesn't work. Every time after that it does.
---
Then do that. You can also go to trade chat and go " opening lockboxes below lvl x for free"
---
thats a new one, ive never been told to have psychosis. care to share your discoverings fellow psychologist?
---
What is the outline of the keybindings in the bottom right corner of your UI?
---
Also, how did you get the spell icon for Blink to sit above your nameplate? (Keybinding is 6)
---
Yep CC is king, in classic pvp but then when every rogue warrior has optimized gear it'll only take 2 hits to evaporate any cloth.

My SO walked me through that quest chain back in Classic so we could both rock the pet. Love it so much. Still my favorite after all these years.
---
All 'firsts' are accomplished this way. It's foolish to think the people making 'firsts' aren't abusing everything they can to do so.
---
It's time to stop celebrating these people, and investigating instead. Remove them all from the game.
---
All these years later and we return to Classic to confirm:  it’s a job not a game lol
---
Better be a permanent ban.  Make those fuckers start over or leave.
---
1. Go start your selected quest
---
2. Stop talking in Barrens chat
---
3. STOP TALKING IN BARRENS CHAT
---
4. Go start your selected quest
---
Does it no longer exist? You don’t love it anymore?
---
Google said it, gotta ask Google.
---
It’s a “15 year old game” that you could only play for the first 6 years of its existence, presuming you didn’t want to play on often janky private servers.   I played on private servers, but I know a lot of people who did not (or didn’t for long) who are now playing classic.
---
Putting that aside and assuming what you’re saying is true, though: okay, it’s a “speedrun”, it’s still one that 90% of the player base is going to take months to complete.
---
In many instances, a rogue can use cooldowns and take the group down in 1 or 2 pulls (using vanish to not die between them). So they’ll still be fine.
---
Ya, thats how Incendius has been also.
---
 Haven’t actually done it, but when I’m being ganked by higher level people I constantly say how excited I am to come back and shit on them at a higher level
---
Crunches are bad for you, there's alternative exercises that are safer.
---
Ouch, that's just unlucky since Corpsemaker has a 33% drop chance. The other option around level 30 is Thermaplugg's Left Arm from Gnomer, which is even worse: drops from the final boss with only a 20% chance. 
---
That's life leveling as a warrior though, I could not get a decent weapon drop from levels 18 to 28. Now that I have Bonebiter I'm already worried about where the next upgrade will come from. If I don't get a good drop from Uldaman or Mauradon I'll probably have to just buy an epic.
---
Sure, they shouldn't complain about being ganked on a PvP server, but you also probably shouldn't be that upset for being called out. If you're camping level 12s at level 40 then I just assume you're actually terrible at the game and couldn't beat anyone near your level.
---
I totally get that's it's annoying, but holy shit is water expensive man.
---
If I heal a dungeon and there's no mage it's literally several gold.
---
Very clear now: finished MC, layer, kill Raga again without clearing - WIN 
---
How did they do it? Literally. did they have to invite some % of the raid as “new players” or what?
---
Did you have fun playing in Vanilla?
---
If you're full pre-raid BiS you will be good enough to run any dungeon and be an asset. Will you top the DPS charts? Maybe not, but you provide value in being another massive plate (or mail) wearer with a large health pool.
---
Also, don't give up on a raid loot. Stay active in a guild that raids and you will be next up once the tanks are geared.
---
This guy's recent post history is him posting "what year is it" and "cringe" over and over basically on different threads.

im alliance on a pvp server that is locked about 8 hours a day.  
---
when the server is locked, there are roughly 3000 more horde than alliance online. layering helps, still sucks. there is no help, though. it is pretty rough, i just hit 54 and i have been killed a little over 120 times at this point -- actually keeping track.
---
Actually I'm pretty sure if you disagree with his comment YOU'RE the one that needs to return to retail.
---
Vanilla would have eaten you alive.
---
Never did insult you personally, just pointed out your attitude. Spend another 4 hours in a thread that you have no investment in, because after all, you say you aren't even a rogue.
---
Thank you, I wanted to download one myself but they all seemed over the top. If you have any questions feel free to reply to this and I'll do what I can to help :)
---
I mean, the versatility typically means they can have an easier time getting in to groups by filling the role that is in need.  It just turns out that the role most in need at end game is always healer.(since you only need one mt)
---
This was a lot of really trivial conjecture. Everyone has to buy food and water if there is no mage... The priest is doing their role by healing and the buffs actually help make the healers job easier. The hunter chose the class he/she did - if they dont want to buy arrows then they should have rolled another class. As a warlock myself - i never ask for compensation for using a soul shard. its silly. All of these things have one major difference to LP ... HOURS OF INVESTMENT TO LEVEL IT. Try using this logic with skinners who are skinning mobs in the instance, or the miner that just cleared a node. They do not owe it to you. They took the time to level their profession.
---
We pay for reagents too. We level our lockpicking just like a profession whether or not YOU consider it one.

I was excited for BFA because of the marketing of them saying the war was "back on" and what not..but jesus did I doge a bullet.. I quit once they said the new races were locked behind a rep wall, not to mention how long it took before the legitmiate "release" of them

So I can be a Resto Druid Level 52 and tank BRD??? sweet thanks, i'll refer people to this post when they get extremely mad at me.
---
Yep - I work for a studio developing another MMO and even with our janky logging, something like this would get the community and technical directors' attention immediately.
---
Haha I’ve got this same mentality. 
---
I won’t ever be the aggressor in PVP situations, usually I just wave and walk by. But as soon as I wave at you and you try to kill me, you’ve earned me ruin your questing for the next half hour. I don’t start shit, but ill sure as shit try to finish it

[Guide on how to efficiently quest in Shimmering Flats](https://youtu.be/tMVGLxBvEoc?t=2)
---
Something everyone in this post missed. You shouldn't be downranking anything before 20 because there is a penalty on +healing to any spell rank before level 20. So even if you do have some bonus to healing which is needed for downranking to even be a thing, it would be horribly inefficient because the low level ranks gain basically nothing. 
---
I am not too familiar with how druids would handle this, but as a priest I wand the hell out of everything and drop only choice large heals on the tank. I also get spirit tap which is a huge main regeneration when I land a killing hit, so I try to push more dps to get those, which results in faster kills which results in less damage to the tank which... results in less mana needed. 
---
I try to get through dungeons needing to drink as little as possible.
---
Level 52 resto shaman on Horde Westfall looking for end game raiding guild. I should be level 60 in the next 7-10 days. Former guild officer and healing lead for an end game guild in BC/WotLK, so I know my class, know my strengths and weaknesses, know the fights, and will always come prepared with consumables, buffs, etc. I'm just happy to be a dedicated raider and not seeking the sort of leadership position I used to be in (unless the guild really needs someone to step up). I'm not one to get upset or dramatic over loot. I'm there for the experience of raiding and overcoming a challenge with some friends. Better gear certainly helps me do my job better towards that end, but if I'm last in line to get a common upgrade among those I share gear with, then I'll happily give them a "grats" when it's their turn and look forward to us all getting better as a group.
---
It seems like a cliche to say, but I've got a hardcore mindset with a casual schedule due to demanding job and family obligations. But for those 2-3 nights of raiding I will be prepared and dialed in. Any other game time I will be farming pre-raid BiS pieces, farming consumable mats, and helping guildmates with whatever. 300/300 Alchemy (with a transmute arcanite cool down that I would happily use for the guild) and 300/300 herbalism to farm mats for raid consumables for me and guildmates. Currently filling out points in my resto spec to be a melee group's best friend, with improved strength and agility totems in the enhancement tree, but willing to respec for the raid's needs. I know how to totem twist (windfury and agility totem swapping for constant benefit) if needed in fights where mana and healing attention are less necessary than maximizing melee group damage.
---
It feels weird posting here looking for a guild, but I'm not sure the best way to go about it. Westfall Horde feels a bit dead when it comes to potential raiding guilds (and the population stats said it was basically 75/25 Alliance to Horde on this server). Lots of guilds say the cliche "looking for raids, pvp, groups, leveling, etc." but it's not clear who is realistically preparing for MC or Onyxia in the near future. I've found some terrific and competent people to quest and instance with during my leveling experience and I've received multiple guild invites, but it's not clear if they or their guild are going to be end game raiding any time soon (and I don't want to be that guy who bails on a guild as soon as I get 60, so I've chosen to remain guildless this far). But it feels like it's time to see what's out there so I can start contributing to a guild's cause with some instance/gear grinding and raid consumable stockpiling. And meet some fun people. This whole post makes me sound super serious about raiding, but I really just like hanging out with some cool folks and achieving a common goal. That's rewarding to me.
---
Feel free to reply or message if you'd like any more info. Sorry this post is so long. Thanks for reading!
---
That's the first thing I thought. Sounds similar to "and then everyone clapped"
---
&gt;Truth is while leveling and doing dungeons you absolutely don't need it. It's a beauty of classic, that you still have your abilities for each role. 
---
Also the beauty of classic that majority of classes who have such ability are dogshit at every other role except healing :)

But they didn't get rid of attunements until the end of BC. I clearly remember having to run a bunch of heroics to get into T5 content after you do the long quest chain in Shadowmoon valley. Not to mention you had to complete the quest chain, including the 3-4 dungeon runs for keys to get into Kara. And you had to complete a different quest chain in I think Netherstorm to be able to spawn Nightbane (I think it was nightbane) in Kara. 
---
Lack of attunements and free epic loot from Heroics was more of a late BC thing, around 2.4 iirc (so right before Wrath.) BC still had attunements, and to be honest they were more difficult than attunements for Vanilla. Only issue with BC was resilience and Flying imo.
---
Oh god, last night was terrifying. Wrapping up the thousand needles one, about 2 yards from the finish killing the last mob, when a 40+ alliance comes towards us on his mount.
---
Thankfully he just passed us by but I was gonna be pissed if we ended up losing it that close.
---
If you know how to play the market, sell it now and reinvest.
---
If you don't, hold onto it for gold.
---
If you need gold now, but to spend; then that's up to you but it is not the most gold-beneficial thing you could do.
---
I JUST learned of this recently (being a horde retail main), and I LOVE my pointy little hat!
---
Level 36, don't have any friends or guildies kind enough to help, and i'm so stoked to get this axe in a level or 2.  Been using some 2-handed sword, since I didn't want to dosh out 2g and change on the bullova at 30.
---
I play a lock and I had this priest that kept shielding me after I life tap. I eventually told him that I wasn’t pulling aggro
---
Ahhh I see, you're confused what the word trivial means because it does not mean easy compared to hard, it means unimportant or insignificant which could absolutely apply to PvP if that's how you felt.
---
&lt;Riposte&gt;. Then whatever else you want.
---
It's true taunt is medium range but its also a ten second cooldown so the best way to get aggro as a warrior generally is to use sunder armor which is melee range only. Bring all of your problems straight to the tank.
---
i just ask "roll for the chest?" and then everyone rolls or passes. Never had a single problem
---
&gt;So back to your mage portal example, would you not consider it a dick move to refuse to make a portal for the group if you could do it for nothing? I see lockpicking as the same thing. If you won't unlock a door or a chest for your group, you're being a dick.
---
&gt;Everyone in your group is paying some form of class tax for you. There's something they've done where they spend gold or time to make your experience with them easier. Opening a chest is one of the ways that you can do something for them.
---
I wanted a shaman but my 3 friends wanted alliance, so I rolled hunter, got it to 41, then changed my mind and am now working on a 30 warrior. Luckily they are all low 40s now, so super easy WW axe.
---
*you're. 
---
You have complained on this thread far more than I have. You're literally complaining about people complaining. Your lack of self awareness is mind boggling. Also judging by the way you type you are likely under 18 (at least I hope you are) and don't have a job so maybe work on fixing your life before coming on here talking about shit you aren't even literate enough to inform yourself about. Census data isnt wrong. The imbalance on certain servers like Herod make questing an impossibility for one faction. I played in vanilla on various ultra populated servers (mal'ganis, TL) and it was never like this.
---
He said some cats and most pets. And if you look at the list the majority of pets are indeed 2.0.
---
i meant with single lines that are longer than the window is wide, sorry, haha. like, if i wrote "Go to Stormwind and buy 100x Mageweave Cloth from the Auction House to make bags," would it wrap back around and show it as two lines, overflow and allow you to scroll, or would you just have to resize the window's width to show it all?
---
Can we stop acting like there is one correct/perfect way to play the game? I've seen lots of mages be successful as the only AE in the group by properly kiting whatever they may aggro off the tank. I've also seen mages be successful just single targeting with the rest of their buddies. 
---
Everything differs by play style of the player/team as well as the many unique situations a group can find itself in. Clearly AoE will cause enemies to die faster but results in more downtime (and is inherently more risky) than killing everything one at a time. It's all about finding that correct balance of risk aversion/speed/ preferred game play style among your party members.
---
I like the old talent trees because *I can feel the improvement* of putting a point into a talent that increases my hit chance. I can feel the improvement when taking flat +% damage talents. It provides an actual sense of progress outside of spell ranks.
---
Vanilla is two games--leveling to 60 is one, and end-game is another. Somewhere along the way, around WotLK, leveling became more of an appetizer and the "real" game took place at level cap.
---
If I was horde I wouldn’t want people playing Ret Paladin either.
---
Put in github, for ppl help you in development, a nice addon btw
---
0 Honour, same as xp for grey mobs.
---
I really enjoy picking "fair" fights out in the wild but as a druid, I'm sorry, my best tool for engagement is ravage out of prowl. And if you're a mage blowing your entire mana pool every pull so you have to sit down to drink... well, that's on you for picking a class that is vulnerable to being 2-shotted for 30 seconds out of every minute.
---
Use the UI scale in the blizzard interface options
---
Nice, but you should be leveling and killing allies in the process, tho. For the horde!
---
yeah any day now itll wear off.
---
There’s one in the shadow tree, Shadow Affinity. 3 points for a total of 24% reduction on shadow spells only.
---
Then Silent Resolve in the disc tree. 5 points for a total of 20% reduction to all spells.
---
I’m not sure if they are additive or multiplicative, but it amounts to a massive reduction in threat gen.
---
Very simple but effective! :) I might suggest implementering some sort of grouping fo example by area, dungeon, etc, will give it a go :)
---
as a guy who works out regularly, id say to most of you DONT DO THIS, do only jumping jacks, because i am pretty sure u will fuck up yourself more than help yourself with this routine
---
also why would you do chair dips?? most of you dont need it at all, aswell as crunches
---
Last week I was in a group with 2 (arms) warriors and an (enhancer) shaman for SM and they were like "we need a tank". If only they realized that either of those those specs are more than fine for tanking if they just slapped on a shield and a one hander...
---
Having the ability to rearrange items would be awesome!
---
Right! 🥰
---
it is currently available. Can't speak on the drop rate, but i don't imagine its much different from any other world drop.
---
Yes, the Chinese guy that posted his 1000 person stormwind raid
---
I need this to keep a list of alliance to kill
---
More like where are the vultures. The turtles are everywhere!
---
I forget arrows all the time. Still not used to needing them again.
---
Mid-BC, shortly after Black Temple was released.
---
I played SWGemu for a while and then I lost my PC in a fire. I have a Macbook and could run Parallels or something but haven't been sussed to.
---
But I plan on getting a PC laptop later this year so I'm for sure gonna install and play some SWGemu!
---
...boomer?
---
It is available. I grouped with a warrior earlier who had it.
---
Is there a reference I'm missing here or do I just have a shitty sense of humor?
---
Obviously you don't know sarcasm when you see it. Responding to your "I will destroy" comment
---
Much intellect, many brain
---
I think the 4 peoples time is worth more than his, yeah. 
---
Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one. 
---
You can whinge about adventure all you want, but if you are incompetent then no thanks.
---
Back in vanilla I gave up around 44 on my warrior. Its tough and really doesn't get much better.
---
They aren’t there solely for the chest. The chest is just a bonus, just as an unlocked is a bonus for you to try and win.
---
You must be fun at parties. It's a hypothetical question for people to talk about changes they would like to see on a SEPARATE server from classic.
---
Anyways, I would like to see better balance between classes and specs to bring them in line for raiding. I think it would also be neat to have some raids beefed up and maybe have some mechanics added to certain tank and spank fights. Also if they added a raid after Nax that was truly difficult in the sense of every boss was equal to a BFA difficulty heroic fight that would be pretty sweet!
---
So insightful posts with good comments get removed because they don't have flairs, but this crap remains up.
---
Great job, mods.
---
Good good, let the hate flow through you.
---
Don’t act like you don’t know who this is
---
Pretty much. I'm not sure how they know when someone is on a different layer from them, but as you said: after boss dies, leave party, some outside guy reinvites everyone to a new party on a different layer (without leaving) and the boss respawns.
---
I need a to do list to remember downloading it before the next gaming session
---
LMAO at that general chat.
---
Grind beasts. Skin them. Sell their greys. 
---
You want 2 levels below you ideally but anything that isn’t red or grey is fine. For you, you can do badlands mobs/southern STV shit (gorillas are great, grind the ones not being killed for the sinew or giblets)/I’m sure some other stuff.
---
Yeah, Oklahoma or something is more like Mulgore, not PNW.

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | Thalnos | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing (For real though we have a lot of liberals/leftists. You for sure don't have to be. But if you get triggered by the existence of the left, that might be an issue).
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. Haven't fully decided between loot council and hybrid LC/DKP either way with focus on gearing tanks first.
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables, arrive on time, and aim for 80%+ attendance.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game.
---
Recruiting:
---
Hunters
---
Most things(DPS&gt;&gt;healers). We have hit 40 people but are shooting for ~50 people and aren't expecting everyone currently signed up to make to to raiding.
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit.
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb

**&lt;PoL Loves You&gt; \[H\] | NA-Benediction PvP | Friday / Sunday 6-10pm EST | Casual | Loot Council**
---
We're a social guild on Benediction currently recruiting players of all types: casual, hardcore and everything in  between. Lead by a Vanilla veteran with years of raiding experience through WotLK and some recent private server experience, this horde guild is looking to expand its roster significantly over the coming weeks in order to prepare for raids and upcoming Phase 2 PVP.
---
PoL (Playground of Love -- not associated with /pol/, sorry fellas) is a Discord channel that has existed for  years. Starting as a meme to deal with the hatred that exists from MOBA  communities like DOTA 2, a group of friends banded together to expel the  toxicity and formed unlikely friendships that have persisted across  games.
---
We’re bringing our signature brand of banter and carefree attitudes  to WoW: Classic, and we’re looking to recruit you. If you’re a person  with a life, that can’t dedicate 8 hours a day to a game because of  responsibilities and you’re just looking for a group of like-minded  people that want to have fun and shoot the sh\*t with while drinking beers and progressing through content and engaging in group PVP then you’ve found the right  place.
---
We have a small but growing community that participates in Discord regularly. We have chat channels aimed at sharing news, guides, and tips in an effort to help people of all types enjoy their experiences in Azeroth. Right now our main goal is getting everyone mounted up,  attuned, and raid-ready.
---
We are an adult community so expect 18+ language, but things like  racism and bigotry are not tolerated. We welcome people of all types  with open arms.
---
**If this interests you then please message one of the following officers:**
---
**Sturmsworth (Guild Leader)** \- Occulous#1117  
---
**Sethos (Officer)** \- Sethos#1157  
---
**Cackle (Officer)** \- eatbabieslol#1283
---
We hope to see you in our roster.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Raid times are Friday &amp; Sunday @ 6:00 PM – 10:00 PM EST. Monday will be our optional clean-up day when necessary.
---
**Member Expectations:** We expect you to get to know your guild mates, help them out with attunements, and support one another until we're ready to step into MC with a full group - hopefully by mid-October. We also hope that you'll always represent our guild in a positive light and avoid drama.
---
**Loot Distribution:** A Loot Council that will distribute gear to those that need it most in a way that benefits progression. This will be done with no emphasis on bias, but purely on necessity. All issues or concerns can be taken up with officers once decisions have been made or before raids begin.

Die, scum!
---
You need to chill out, just reading your comments made me angry.
---
Every time you stop to drink, drink some water. Stay hydrated!
---
What if ur a mage and make ur own food and water during the duel and use that?
---
Just want to reiterate this - use raid frames in parties and go to the Interface Options menu and all of this is customizable there. The default UI for healing is fantastic and many top healers use it in both Classic and Retail. I'm not sure why so many people are unaware of its capabilities.
---
Yeah I was  spamming  heroic  strike  i will try to save up more rage and see where it goes

Oh I totally get that you'll get killed a lot.  Happens all the time, but man those times where you mop them up, and leave them without a bucket is amazing.

Threat addons in classic depend on everyone else in your raid/party having the same addon. So ask your guild if you plan on raiding.

There was a naked Tauren fishing in Stormwind on Deviate Delight a week or so ago. I sat and fished with him for a couple minutes before a wandering NPC randomly one shot him.
---
Thousand Needles is 25-35. After that a lot of places open up at 30 like desolate, Arathi highlands or the alteric mountains. Unless you want to risk Stranglethorn
---
My trick is to just pick up an alt if I'm gonna be camped. If he's sitting there waiting for *me*  to come back, then how about I waste HIS time and just go do something else while he stands over an idle corpse.
---
When I played WoW for the first time, I quested in Darkshore. It was miserable. It nearly put me off the game altogether. In retrospect, I had very little idea what I was doing, which probably contributed to my dislike. But experience or not, the zone was depressing as hell.
---
Good to know I'm not missing out on anything special.
---
*with*
---
I thought this was telling me that the quest Chef gives is fixed. The last few days in Darkshore this quest has been bugged for me and won't show up.
---
You seem like a super cool person, choosing to take this person's comment constructively and responding with gratitude. Been loving your posts as someone who just returned to WoW after ~10 years.  Best of luck and can't wait to see more!
---
I also have a 1gbps internet connection (FiOS) and have my computer on Cat5E. So that could be the deal breaker as well.  
---
Works well on my Galaxy S10, even on cell connection.
---
That’s a great ADD addon.  I’ll forget to dL it in 5 seconds.
---
&gt; &gt; Seal Twisting
---
&gt; Considering the unreliable nature of Seal of Command this just sounds like a way to go OOM within 10 seconds and deal no damage at all. Even if you pull it off, you'd still go OOM really quickly and just stand there auto-attacking.
---
Not necessarily true. Seal of Command is designed to proc seven times per minute, meaning that slower weapons have a higher chance to proc. Weapon attack speed buffs actually increase this even further. [Full chances to proc based on weapon speed are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c24tq4/paladin_seal_of_command_proc_chance/erhoygi/)
---
Also, if this can be executed perfectly on every two weapon swings to maximise the amount of attack speed you gain, it won't drive Paladins OOM in 10 seconds. Far from it.
---
It will result in increased Mana consumption but downranked Seal of Command and Seal of the Crusader have similar effects. SoC still has a chance to deal 70% weapon damage and SotC still boosts your attack speed by 40%, albeit with a smaller attack power boost. Rank 1 SoC only uses 65 Mana while Rank 1 SotC only uses 25 Mana. Assuming you're using a 2 handed weapon with a 3.8 attack speed and using Seal of the Crusader/Seal of Command every two weapon swings to maximise the effectiveness of spell batching, that means you're using 90 mana roughly every 5.428 seconds, which is only a 16.58 mana per second consumption. The MP5 gained from Blessing of Wisdom alone offsets this by quite a bit.
---
The fact is that Ret Paladins simply don't use Seal of Command at Rank 2 or above for DPS. Upranking only boosts Judgement damage.
---
&gt; &gt; Weapon Swapping
---
&gt; Sounds like a huge hassle to pull off, even with macros/ItemRack. Swapping weapons also triggers a GCD.
---
Ret Paladins can happily expend a GCD or five. They have very little combat interactivity and rely heavily on autoattack damage. Crusader Strike wasn't even a thing until Burning Crusade.
---
Weapon swapping could be very useful to maximise Prot Paladin threat, since one handed weapons vary greatly in attack speed.
---
&gt; Sit-stand Reckoning - If you have a macro that makes you /sit and /stand, you can hit the macro while being attacked and guarantee the next attack that will hit you will trigger your Reckoning and give you a "free attack". In reality, this just speeds up your current swing to be "instant" and not result in that much extra damage.
---
Fuck Reckoning, I wonder if this could be used to freely proc Redoubt and actually make Prot Paladins capable of hitting the 102.4% Avoidance cap without sacrificing crit immunity. Redoubt is yet another talent that requires you to be the victim of a critical strike to proc, and if sit/stand macros could proc this on you, it would be very interesting to see this buff Prot to semi-viable levels.
---
Great bait
---
as a rogue main,this is the dumbest thing ive ever heard.  i typically just pass on the chest and let others reap the rewards. rogue already has enough problems getting into groups with the aoe cleave meta. not all us rogues are bad.
---
You’re horde I’m guessing? I’m still in the area if you’re trying to link up but I’m alliance
---
They added the cool down after people had been doing it for a week.  Then they changed it completely with the hot fix.  There was about a week where people were doing this.  And could have a huge impact of the game. Only because they would be BIS and able to down the raids fast. Now there is still the week cool down for raids, so I agree the impact is minimized.
---
You can drop Rend for sure. Especially once you get Sweeping Strikes, it's a waste of rage. Demo Shout is a choice for you but I don't think it has much impact on soloing. 
---
Doing sunder until 50% and then auto is a good approach. At this point, you can also use HS to finish off mobs, too. It will leave you with less rage for your next pull, but you might finish quicker.
---
1. More space
---
2. No need to travel back to main cities just to sell on the AH.
---
True, but i was also mostly implying arcane damage
---
Literally gave me cancer
---
Are rogues useful in group content besides DPS?
---
As an example of what I mean by usefulness: mages have polymorph/food/buff, warlocks have soulstone, DPS druids can offheal.
---
Are interrupts viewed as useful in group content (which rogues seem to have a lot of)? I'm concerned on whether or not people will take me into dungeon groups as a rogue.
---
Ah, yeah that’s not cool
---
Just got a msg that post was approved. This is the only thing ive found so far:  [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20750644918#post-2](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20750644918#post-2)

I was talking about the face part!
---
Yeah those bubble-Hearths are a menace...
---
Lmao seen it on a T-shirt with a fat bear "yah I'm into fitness - fitness whole pizza in my mouth"
---
Heroic strike is one of the worst abilities in the game, honestly you can even skip a few ranks to save some money. Sunder armor on the other hand might just be the best skill in the game. It's all you need for damage and gives you great aggro, it even works in all stances.
---
Yeah, as far as I can tell (at least pre raid), druids are no worse than any other healer on this issue.
---
I've been healing with a feral spec and some healing gear with no issues.
---
I've been speccing feral up to HotW and will put everything else in resto for the HotW/Swiftness healing hybrid build, at least pre-raid.
---
Mage has faster leveling than a hunter, Warlock is slower but close. Warlock is arguably better at PVP, mage is worse. Mage has highest ranged PVE DPS. Warlock's have very solid PVE DPS still. Mages are very squishy PVE and PVP, Warlock's are less squishy because of pet and life drain. Mages have awesome bonus stuff with portals and food/water. Warlocks have awesome bonus stuff with health stones, the power to summon people like a mobile summoning stone, and a FREE MOUNT!
---
For sure, some groups are just doomed. I guess I was more speaking towards 1 players performance, if I had a Warlock in my group that wasnt doing great DPS, I would typically just finish the run (if we arent wiping or being slowed down) then find someone else afterwards. 
---
I made a group for Uldaman and we were all waiting inside for this priest for 10-15 minutes, I looked at the map and this dude was in STV turning in quests. Needless to say he got the boot, so I'm 100% with you there.
---
You cannot say anything bad about Classic in this sub, truth or not.
---
Would you argue that griefers are the vinegar that balances the flavor of the game?
---
&gt; if you were literally, magically, fighting yourself, the winner still comes down to rolls
---
Thats where we disagree. I would kick that losers ass!
---
Whaat
---
It's so funny how the mindset goes from "hurr don't complain about being ganked while ur fighting a mob if u rolled on a pvp server!" To "wow how dare you take my node when I haven't even started mining it yet," like c'mon now you can't just choose what's convenient for you
---
What do you use to make this?
---
Back in Vanilla my realm had a priest that did nothing but camp players. The complaining gave said player a reputation alright, a reputation that earned him a following, and he ended up with a squad and personal healers.
---
Whining about it is exactly what a griefer wants to see.
---
No. Transmogs are so cheap. If you want a cool looking weapon, use it or earn it. Don’t have your weapon look different because you’re not good enough to get better ones.
---
SM Armory cleave question: How do you stop adds from spawning on Herod? I heard it has to do with a shaman totem.
---
Sounds like PvP server isn't for you, and that classic isn't for you as well
---
I do this and never get thanked or tipped. Even when people rip boe blues off my hard work. Fucking tip your rogues assholes!
---
I figure that ganks happen, and as long as you're not targeting the same person repeatedly, that's just how the dice roll. In vanilla I would randomly die to server lag. Now I randomly die to ganks. So it goes.
---
I don't fight back, and most people leave me alone after the first death.
---
Counterpoint: They shouldn't because it's simply not needed.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t do it, lol. ToS.
---
This i actually pretty useful
---
Seconded
---
No changes
---
Guess that’s trust but I like the faster questing I guess. Lol like STV
---
Best kind of quest, by the time your done killing enough to complete the quest you've gained way more xp than if you got 1 item per mob, plus turtle shells sell for decent money. 
---
Beats the hell out of "travel across the zone to hand in this letter and then come all the way back for 1200 xp"
---
Id bring paladins just so their gear doesnt have to be sharded.
---
This particular change would be quite upseting. Druid not having regular res is the trade off for having a battle res and is part of druid identity. 
---
But yeah, i wouldn't be against any balance change (like making the mobs in dungeons hit harder, buff spell/firestone of warlocks so they can see use...).

**\[CancelShapeshiftForm\] is protected.**  Protected functions can only be called from a secure execution path \[this means from Blizzard code, not addons\].

Shapeshifting cannot be cancelled through normal buff functions as that would allow insecure code to manipulate the \[form\] macro conditional.

You can use /cancelform in a macro instead.
---
No it does take a while. The process is manual. It took several weeks for me :(
---
Personally, I’m guilty of complaining of those things back in the day. For me what’s changed is my life day to day. Back then I didn’t wanna spend time leveling because I had school and homework. Now, I get off work and all I have is time.
---
If it's a chest the rogue could unlock without the groups help clearing to it, sure, he can have it. 
---
If it requires a group effort to get to it, the group should at least have the chance of getting the reward from inside. 
---
Don't be a dick about it. But the argument "Well the group couldn't open it without the rogue." Goes the other direction. "The rogue couldn't open it without the group."
---
Granted I've never run into a rogue that said this shit, so I think this problem is a lot smaller than this thread would lead you to believe. 
---
But if I had a rogue in my group pull this shit, I'd just kick them and 4 man the instance or replace them. It's a locked chest, not the Ark of the Covenant, GTFO here with that noise.
---
So you're the one tanking or healing then, right? Since again it'd be pretty ridiculous to expect a tank or healer to go a completely suboptimal spec for solo play. But if you wanna cripple yourself in that part of the game then that's completely your prerogative.
---
I'm pretty certain that "safe-spotting" was a bannable offence in Vanilla.
---
In 3 seconds I've got 3: a thunder clap, a demo shout after first global, and first sunder after second global.
---
Again, if your tank doesn't know what those first two do, I'm sorry.
---
But let's not act surprised when a old school tank who's been browbeaten by clueless spellcleave grinders whose instancing skills have rotten to shit raises an eyebrow when he hears a mage say "I'm the tank or I don't get to play the game".
---
I used to use wowglider to build accounts and sell them. A character in full end game gear was like $500+. Unfortunately I only got several months out of the wowglider lifetime license as blizzard eventually took wowglider down with their lawsuit. Botting is just as addicting as actually playing the game. I don't do it any more however, all those accounts are gone.
---
Just to be sure, I've had locked chests autoloot anyway for me half the time. Do you hold Shift and right-click on the chest to open it?
---
Don't worry mate, Spirit Tap is my magewater.
---
Unless you do.
---
I ran RFD at level 40 and got a couple of pieces of plate, and was able to craft a couple more.

Depends on how much the mats are worth. Compare the price of mats vs the item you’re looking to disenchant. If the item is worth more then sell it and buy the mats

I don't watch or post about streamers unless they break the rules and get away with it

you sound like you're projecting

Try messing with the UI scale

No. You look like shit and you like it.

That's the vanilla experience.

I usually do my 8 minute abs workout followed by a 2-5 minute planking sesh and then ab stretches.
---
Dude, I understand if your faction steals it, that's rude.
---
But it's Alliance vs. Horde. It's a war for resources. Sorry, but in my opinion stealing a nod from enemy faction is not wrong.

Unlike attacking fishing players. Never attack fishing players.

It's just how it is, your client only gets sent information on what's there out to a certain distance.

Whatever gives me WotLK.

There’s lots of mats coming into the game right now and you use copper/bronze to level to 150. I’ve found ways to make money. I’m alliance so I can’t sell blunderbusses for that quest but I did find breakpoints for vendoring them. 
---
When I had like 50s to my name and I wasn’t leveling as I had a buddy logged off who I’m leveling with, I literally checked the AH for tigerseyes to be 1s or less and the 6 light leather to be less than 2.5s in total. I would vendor the goggles for 4.08s lol and make like a 50c profit but the entire idea was leveling engineering while not losing money.
---
Definitely can be done is ultimately what I’m getting at hah.
---
For min max PvE raiding a total of 9% for yellow attacks, 22% for white hit dual wield (more important for fury dw).
---
Be sure to have at least +5 weapon skill (skill tree or racial) to reduce the damage penalty of glancing blows against lvl 63 mobs and bosses.
---
They aren't wrong. They have had a long standing negative opinion for a reason that goes beyond "dirty commies".
---
Could have used em to level enchanting SMH
---
Why would you want to? Gotta get that sweet sweet tabard.
---
I dunno what it is. Do zoomers just not know that button exists?
---
Yes, It always makes me look almost straight up.  It never does it going down or to the sides that I've noticed.  Just instant look up for no reason it seems.  Don't know of a fix.
---
Its first time playing wow for me besides private servers 2 yrs ago. Private made me try retail. Noped the fuck out real quick. Classic is the only retail I will ever play
---
Awww, sounds like you are interested in battlegrounds and a PvE server. You should switch now, other phases aren’t out yet with BGs.
---
I think you missed the point of the post, which to me seemed like it was to smug over people that were naysaying against how successful Classic was going to be.
---
High end crafting in ff14 is it's own endgame. Look into it.
---
I dunno about general etiquette, but say if I got polyd and they sat to eat I wouldn't think that is wrong. Can you use mage food in Arena in retail? I'm pretty sure you can.
---
I'm using many addons so you have to be more specific
---
Yes.  That is what happened.

Anybody have a working debuff timer? Non of the ones I’ve tried worked
---
We're gonna bring the one who is dependable and deals good damage. This drama about lockpicking is at the bottom of the list.
---
I has the exact opposite experience. Before that thread, I had read elsewhere to avoid HS, so I almost exclusively used SA. Then I read comments further down on that thread saying the opposite, so I tried using HS instead and shit started dying way faster. 
---
Maybe that's just at my level, idk, but I'm all about that HS now.
---
Nice, while you're at it, do /join lfg. It's not an official channel but a lot of people use that one too. I keep them both on separate tabs.
---
The damage you do is probably also 1/4 of an arms warrior so while you may take less damage, your pulls will take longer, and by virtue of them taking longer you may be taking just as much total damage anyways. Arms is just better for dungeons as well as leveling pre 50+
---
This is actually very helpful, ty!
---
I would put a Tauren Enhance Shaman below any of those.
---
In dungeons, sure. Nobody will argue warriors are bad in a group. But out questing? Shits rough before mortal strike, and especially rough before the axe (which takes time, possibly gold, and outside help to get at a lower level).
---
What server is this?
---
Nothing I hate more than transmog. People looking cool for doing nothing. The best times I remember in EQ is when you saw someone wearing something cool. You wanted to look that cool. Transmog makes everyone look like a clown.
---
WoW keeps resetting my target and player frame every time I log off and back on. Even if I reset UI. Anyone know of a fix?
---
21 night elf Druid here. Should I quest somewhere else other than ashenvale since there is a bunch of horde there killing people. If so where?
---
If you haven't found anything yet, I'd give this alliance leveling guide a go. Fenn's Vanilla Alliance Leveling guide.
---
Interrupts are super useful, especially in the later dungeons where kicking a spell means you end the encounter 2 minutes sooner, or you don't wipe.
---
I see you aren't asking for help with your Whirlwind Axe quest.
---
It’s both........
---
I found the talent was kinda worthless past 40 and respecing drain tank. Just stick your succubus on one min with a corruption, grab another with corruption and agony, fear and immediately drain life, let it run, go back to the SUCC, drain life, then let your minion run to another mob, etc. It's insanely sustainable.
---
I'm dungeons, corruption on everything, life tap a couple times, drain life endlessly. You'll be top DPS easily.
---
Below 40, improved Drain Soul was pretty decent. If anyone tells you that *you* must get the killing blow and not your minion, they're incorrect.
---
i like to keep one running so i can figure out which finisher rotations work best on each mob. Fuck using it for e-peen though.
---
Interesting. I like how there are so many different views when it comes to warrior threat generation and ideal opener sequence.
---
Rogues are absolutely useful. On top of great single-target DPS, a reliable CC (Sap) and interrupt (Kick) are always welcome
---
Pvp server you kill the guy first and then take his node. Dont want to give him the first shot while you are busy mining
---
I haven't posted a single screenshot, I'm just explaining to you why people do it. Because they're using their phones.
---
It's an epidemic on reddit that people endlessly miss the point and then talk down to people to feel smart. It's amazing.
---
Is that so? hmm. I don't know if it's some form of human nature or confirmation bias speaking from me(wow look at trying to be all psychobabble), but it *feels like* to me, that there's no shortage of fellow druids around my level.
---
Sure it's not as numerous as mages but druids aren't rare from what I've seen. But I say this now, and I **just know** a scientist-type among us will push his glasses in, and come in with extensive spreadsheets what the population breakdown, sorted by class and levels, looks like.
---
I've tanked every dungeon I've run so far and every one I've started with "I haven't run this in years so someone lead the way but I'll do the pulls. Just let me know about weird mechanics.".
---
Have had absolutely no negative response to that yet.
---
It's always the icon, name, and tooltip of the spell being cast. Give it a try and you'll see.
---
Yeah, lol. Tbh I only recall it because of the person I played against. I definitely regret purging my friendlist..
---
Luna / SUF might not look nice to you by default but they're fully customizable... size, color, location, etc.
---
Honestly, can't tell you, as i don't have a reference! I rolled a warlock because i wanted to roll a warlock :)

Remote desktop is your friend. Teamviewer or googles remote viewer. If you go grocery shopping what I've moved to is ordering online and picking up on my way home from work. It can save about an hour of time. When you get up don't log off your character it will buy you 10-20 extra minutes to be afk (I don't know exact time before it boots you to the character selection.

OP needs to make up his mind and play 1 character

Congrats on no-life'ing the game to 60 so you could feed your ego.  LOL!

Question....does WF totem not show a “buff” like healing stream for instance?
---
&gt;Somebody did it to me twice and I've chosen never to forgive and pass it on 100 fold.

That's the spirit?

Haven’t touched MWO since classic dropped, hope all my pilots are staying frosty out there.
---
The draw distance does seem awfully close some times. 
---
I was fishing a small pond last night and I couldn’t tell if there were any fish schools around the edges without physically running a lap every few casts.
---
My ‘find ore’ could locate a vein across the pond but my cursor couldn’t see the school of fish right next to it.
---
What a circle jerk... Where are all these posts? I check this subreddit every day and I've not seen any of these.
---
Only thing worse than complaining about pvp on a pvp server is whining about non existent posts on Reddit.
---
I was killing dark iron dwarves the ither day in searing gorge, and this 3 man ally group killed me 3 times. Later on the druid in the group, who was 4 levels higher than me, thought he could gank me while I was fighting shit. Ruined him and gloated all over his corpse. It was worth the few corpse runs I had to do earlier lol.
---
I have a couple of characters on pve servers to roll with friends that wanted the 'sane' route.  And while it is lower stress...man, it feels so good to toss out a ranged attack at a random person fighting a mob and igniting a half hour of guerilla warfare as we each try to be the one that gets the jump on the other(until 'friends' show up on either side).  
---
I could care less about raiding or end games, that kind of experience is what makes this game.
---
I’m saying it’s a lot worse for people now of X level than it was for you at the same level. If you can’t understand that, I’m sorry
---
Expecting a warrior to be specced prot is honestly just completely unreasonable. Protection tree has nothing in it to increase the player's damage until one-handed weapon specialization which is *25* points deep in the tree. And prior to one-handed dage increase the only real things they get in that tree for improving threat is defiance (which is big, but 5 points for 15% increased threat in only defensive stance) and improved sunder which really isn't that great. Everything else is centered around mitigation which really just isn't that big of a deal in dungeons while leveling. I'd much rather have a tank with Sweeping Strikes prior to level 55 or so. Expecting a warrior to be completely useless in the open world to be maybe marginally better in dungeons is ridiculous.
---
For healers it's another story, especially priests. 
---
I 100% think priests should level with a build similar to this:
---
 https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05-20505102032-5
---
This build simultaneously increases your damage and healing by reducing your heal and smite cast times. Same with the holy crit talent. You also hit your keys talents in shadow and discipline to make being out in the world alone more tolerable. 
---
Leveling shadow prior to 40 really doesn't offer a ton out in the world imo, mind flay isn't that great when you first get it and the hit talents, while nice, really only affect your mind blast and shadow word pain which you use once each per mob. The trade-off of going shadow is that your healing really is quite a bit worse in groups.
---
When it’s late game and you are just grinding for raid consumes:
---
Farm ores/herbs
---
Kill stuff for consumes
---
This is an awesome add on but in some sense it makes you feel like WoW is even more of a job. I have to bill hours IRL (which is basically grinding for XP) and use to do lists by the second. I like playing WoW in a non linear manner, feels less like a grind! Awesome add on though!!
---
If someone's standing right next to the node fighting you can ask them in /say if they're a miner.  Cross-faction they can get fucked, but if someone steals the node then try to say they didn't know, they're a douchebag.
---
Theres a huge difference between looking for absolute efficiency and getting annoyed with 4 manning a 5 man dungeon.
---
It was an attempt at humor.  And not a very good one.
---
Yep just to the right of the bank.
---
Alliance players are trying to protect the NPC.  Its as much PvP as Battleground objectives.
---
explain please :)
---
Ninja looting no, being an asshole absolutely.
---
And they're all completely better than running.
---
They're already doing that with the server caps, they've already been lowered in the past two weeks and will continue to be lowered.  
---
You've offered no solution for the faction imbalance though, because there isn't one. There is much more horde than alliance on pvp realms across the board, so no amount of transfers or shuffling will resolve the issue.
---
i wish people would stop outright saying griefing or being camped is not why they chose a pvp server and then using this as justification to criticize the experience. 
---
the risk of being camped adds excitement and danger to leveling, and increases the final satisfaction when you hit 60. it also changes your strategy of play. you’re always at risk of being ambushed, so you have to choose wisely when to use certain cooldown abilities against mobs. if you don’t have at least one emergency escape ability not currently on cooldown, you’re much more at danger from an ambusher than you would otherwise be. likewise if you use all your mana or health on a mob assuming you can drink after. you can’t make any of these assumptions. it makes a huge difference. 
---
and you can still get away from a ?? level. it’s hard, but possible. you might complain it’s unfair you have to run away in the first place, but they’re stronger than you. they can chase you out of territory if they want to. it’s part of the game.
---
Its a harsh world. You can make this comparison to alot of other things aswell. Waiting on that quest item or mob to spawn or whatever. You just gotta deal with it. It will never stop. No matter what.  
---
Do like your "i hope you stel into something wet with your sock" Cause thats just mean.
---
I'm just glad that you can't see another player's talents when inspecting them.
---
As a mage, free. I'm always thrilled to get any money at all, but never ask for it

The bare minimum fishing skill required to catch fish in Feralas is 205. The fishing skill required to never miss a fish is 300. I have been over 205 the entire time and have been using fishing skill increase items to get over 300 so that I never miss a fish. This was working until reset of September the 10th. I was able to fish up some Sunscale Salmon on Monday, September the 9th from the coast of Feralas.
---
Yeah - honestly can't remember the group makeup but whoever was in the group that wore Mail apparently was worried they wouldn't get all the loot.  LOL.
---
I heard it’s not free and from a video the quest for the mount is tough.
---
Flag carry sounds like it could be rewarding but I worry it'd just be boring to hold the flag while you wait for your group to get organized enough to return your own flag from the other team.
---
&gt;No it shouldn't. There's nothing that an auction scanning addon does that exploits the game. It keeps a local record of the AH DB to compare prices before list. You could do the same thing with Excel and enough patience.
---
The scan by itself isn't that big of a deal, but when you pair it with sortable lists, cleaner/more accessible UI when it comes to individual auctions, it's something completely different. Good luck sniping anything without an addon on the AH nowadays.
---
These addons don't really affect me much, but I'd say they do affect newbies quite a lot. Trying to play the economy game without an AH addon is pretty much impossible.
---
&gt;I think 3.3 is the best time in WoW history.
---
Now I'm really interested why you think so. WotlK had some of the best raids for sure, the dungeons were great too, and I really liked the class/spec viability in both PvE and PvP(though this depended a lot on patch so idk)
---
But aside from those two things there's just not really anything that I'd say makes it different from anything that came after it. TBC is similar in that manner.
---
Same here, my exact modus operandi.
---
I don’t know what this has to do with ego.
---
When did the 1 hr mail timer start? I could have sworn it used to be much shorter.
---
To be fair it's kinda meant as a low level tanking ability. It combined with rock biter is enough to hold threat in low level instances. I remember tanking up to RFD on my shaman in vanilla.
---
Does this also go for Skinners and freshly looted bodies?
---
That’s one beautiful map! Great job
---
Yup, I agree.
---
Likely would not happen, but would be nice if it did.
---
Basically we likely want something a bit slower and a tab bit harder mechanically like Classic is, but with the bells and whistles that BfA does actually provide.
---
Had a mage that complained for an entire dungeon yesterday. Started pulling mobs himself because I wasn't aggroing the next set of mobs down the hall before the current set was dead. I was running from one set to pull the next as soon as all mobs were dead, but this was "too slow". This was a normal group no mage cleave shit.
---
He ended up dying on a pull. Also left after the boss he needed didn't drop what he wanted. We were doing Mara and all we had to do was kill the Croc after princess (the only boss I needed in the entire dungeon, which he knew). He decided to leave after princess and not kill the Croc.
---
Either way, he lost a potential tank on a sever that is already low on tanks. IDK what it is about mages man, love the good ones but gd so many are toxic.
---
To be fair I mostly agree with you, but if ganking lowbies and gibbing people that are triple pulling mobs is okay surely body camping for hours is too right? By your own logic that’s part of the game, if you don’t like it leave or play pve. My main problem with this argument is that whether or not its part of the server type/game, it doesn’t mean you’re not a boner for doing it. You really either get to say that everything is cool or you can say that there’s nuance to it, but it doesn’t make sense to say that the nuances you believe exist are the only ones that make sense. This guy clearly fucks heavy with honorable even pvp, god knows that’s not what he’s gonna get, but that’s his prerogative.
---
You say these stealth tricks but all I can tell you right now is every time now that I try to do the sneaky cat druid trick nope, the alliance scum is of course at least 5-6 levels above me, on a mount, and dickishly prances all around me to make it damn obvious that he sees me, before dismounting and finishing me off.
---
It's to waste their time not to get the mob.
---
Lol the weekend after launch we did the same thing, same elite, 3 groups. Thought for a second you were a part of that but I dont recognize any of the names.
---
Good on you for working together!
---
Yeah but you shouldn’t be crying on Reddit about it.
---
you hear some player gathered census about a few 60/40 horde servers and you write out something like this. its almost psychotic.
---
Unfortunately Blizzard only bans the top 1% of egregious offenders when these exploits are found. Many people exploited this that didn't get punished at all and kept all of their gold/loot.
---
it's always a joke whenever you're called out isn't it? :')
---
Not that I don't think these things are fine for the game,
---
Where do you see that people complained about them heavily back then?  Seems like some arbitrary talking points you brought up :P
---
I gabled like 8 people yesterday cuz they were competing for quest mobs and I thought it’d be easier to just kill them.
---
How do you classify that?
---
I was already drinking before I started.
---
I gave up on the sigils questline because it kept making me walk across the map over and over.
---
Actually I did get Plate Armor at 40... Greens on the AH sell for cheap so I did as planned and replaced my Mail stuff and now have greatly increased armor in addition to better strength and stamina.
---
Probably spent 5G at most for everything I needed.  No need to min/max at level 40 with top of the line Blues - I can get those slowly while running dungeons.
---
This is why I wish I could turn on my own faction once every hour kill them and be happy every after. I have seen someone whose done this getting ganked, I laughed cuz I could have healed them and they would have countered the gank. Instead I watched from the sidelines, then moved in for the tbag.
---
as it was once explained to me, this is a smiley)
---
and this is big smiley))))))
---
It takes more time than it should for the distance but, on retail I took a horde Druid and took the flight to TB and oh my god. I feel so sorry for you poor bastards.
---
While it's true SL Locks are the truly unbeatable 1v1's, Hunters are nearly as good at 1v1's as them against virtually every class and playing one in PvP has a pretty decent skill ceiling.
---
Does anyone know if you can put your profession items in the vendor slots with this add-on? I'm at work so I have yet to install it, but I would LOVE to have my enchants show up in a store (since you can't link your profession in classic) to display what I'm currently offering and the price.
---
As of right now, I'm spam yelling/trade chat with enchants + prices but I just think this would be a really neat feature if it isn't already.
---
P.S. I love the concept of this add-on, so thank you, creator, if you read this
---
Man I want a true monster hunter mmorpg. I think that would legit kill wow
---
That seems wrong to me. They're one of the easiest IMO, especially after cat form - second only to hunters. Yes, your bear form will not be super powerful from 10-20, but you should have almost no downtime. After cat form you should be whooping everything.
---
Don't train your arms if you only do one thing. Train your back
---
Wow, as an outsider I just saw the whole thread as a joke... until you said this. Now you just look unnaturally insecure.
---
Majority of people whining are the ones who according to resent stats have ended up on a 60/40 horde favored realm or even more. It's a legitimate issue when Horde has enough majority to control every single zone making Alliance leave the server for a more balanced one.
---
Especially if you want some sort of WPvP when honor system comes.
---
Thanks! I'll give it a try
---
Miss you Bruce
---
man get over it
---
In dungeon. Wins loot in middle of fight. Stop playing. Star jumps
---
I generally kill every horde I see, regardless of level, but I don't spawn camp. The only time I'll spawn camp is if someone in my guild is getting camped for an egregious amount of time. In that case I'll generally just go take it out on everyone in that zone for a while. That being said, I agree with the earlier users sentiment that this should be viewed as an invitation to gather friends and guildies and try to drive whoever's ganking out.
---
Every comment you post is asking why I'm arguing. But I haven't been arguing dude. I have been saying you shouldn't see a hunter in Scarlett gear. It's like seeing a warrior with spell damage cloth gear, not that you never see it. Want me to repeat it again?
---
( fwowny
---
They are having fun on a pvping on a pvp server let them enjoy it.
---
There is an insane amount of theorycrafting on Vanilla warriors (by far more than any other class from what I can tell). Luckily, the threat numbers are all derived so it's pretty easy to tell. My link doesn't show the parent comment which shows the threat values. 
---
If you're not familiar with them, you can see here: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5gype/warrior_tank_lf_advice/f0lsikh/
---
Thunderclap is very much a dungeon skill only and not used at all during raiding. But it definitely has a niche for early threat generation against packs of mobs. Versus single target, don't use it.
---
How the hell do you still not agree with the ban to this day? You literally tricked a guy into giving you access to his account and stripped everything he had, then went on to take his second account, but you shouldn't have been banned because the victim was dumb?
---
The fuck is wrong with you.
---
&gt; why not just bring another mage in that case?
---
For pulling with shielded eye of kilrogg, probably pointless in ZF. And you *can* clear like that with 2mage/1warlock/bear/priest, the tank is just a waste of space.
---
i've had no problem fishing in feralas
---
Actually this is a good point. I saw nessingwary was being camped by horde so I went out into the boonies (still a quest area) and that was also holding around 10 horde all leveling. I went out of questing area and there were still 3-4 running around the area. So yeah huge population \* horde imbalance = no chance to quest = small percent of alliance will make level cap = more people quit PvP server or just roll horde to avoid the ganking.
---
I same party faction grief regularly as a pally father a bunch up with Rey aura and drag them into blizzard it’s rewarding. 
---
“If he died he dies”
---
Using thistle tea while leveling seems like an expensive habit. Save for your mount and sell the tea
---
Yeah I just five phase 1 a higher “difficulty” in that it requires 7 days of playing the game in order to get to max level or more for the average player. And I figured they’d want to let them at least get close to 60

Can I just supplement that gap with dungeons
---
So I am a Human Tank, chanty boi, and I have people remember me for stuff too. Half the time I don't even remember doing it. While I was leveling enchanting if I pug'd I'd enchant people's gear before runs just to level, and to pray to the gods we didn't wipe. Free of charge. Every so often I get PM's asking if I could do it again, since it made that gear so hard to replace. And they remembered my SN (admittedly it is pretty memorable, HateMyGFsCat). It reminds me of Vanilla, the community is amazing. Love this about WoW.
---
The Quilboars are allied with a single faction, the scourge. The scourge of course  represent those who succumbed to hateful ideologies eg Nazism, KKK, etc.
---
Duke Nukem’s pig men set a precedent for aggressive, cultish, bipedal pigs depicting the police.
---
In the America’s, police were used by plantation owners to capture and return slaves. In WoW, the quilboar are the first non-orc humanoids that you encounter as an orc. They are a group of Humanoids who, upon the arrival of the orcs and the trolls (itself a metaphor for the people forced to immigrate thru the slave trade triangle), attempted to destroy them and claim their territory back for themselves.

Lol god forbid mages are allowed to play a build they’re designed for. Go fuck yourself. As if you’re somehow entitled to it. Go play retail if you want to be vindictive towards people who don’t bend to your will. I’m not even playing a mage but that would instantly put you on a shit list.
---
Not to mention if you are on a PVP server, you practically need to go Eng anyway. Those bombs are OP as hell in PVP fights.
---
This is the dumbest insult I've seen so far on this sub
---
The really should be someone on voice that is assigned to call directions and give brief explanations of mechanics before pulls.  If you pay attention you should be fine.  If you don’t know what to do, ask.
---
Blizzard won’t.
---
They are about to release paid transmog through the “recruit yourself a second account” scheme.
---
Blizzard already makes more money from selling services to the game than subs.
---
You can’t get the social interaction of classic without the rules, inconveniences and limited loot of classic.
---
Blizzard can’t put the genie back in the bottle, they have built their core fan base around an oxymoron of single player mmo gamers. The type that play 30 hours a week but call themselves casual. These players will stay subbed as long as Blizzard provides very tiny, incremental character growth through WF/TF and three to four month loot catch up cycles. They stay subbed for the loot upgrades and make money for Blizz by buying in game services or cash shop items.
---
shit, ty is even shorter
---
I've been having an odd reverse situation. Im 100% specced resto druid, but with feral gear set too. I do whatever role gets me an invite, but let em know im healer specced. 4/5 times im asked to tank with zero feral talents haha. People I think are afraid of tanking :P I like tanking, and love the loss stress tanking practice, but man I wish my maul and swope cost 5 less rage...

If you keep telling everyone that PvP servers are the “only” way to play and that PvE or RP servers are “lame,” then you’re going to keep getting players on PvP servers who genuinely don’t belong there.
---
Me, I’m happy over here in Carealot where I can quest in peace. You guys have fun with your Mutually Assured Destruction preventing you from actually leveling. If that’s your thing, go nuts.
---
it's the swashbucklers that were tricky - they mostly spawn on that dock area near the two ships planked together, and it was painful as hell trying to tag a couple as a rogue before the blizzard started raining on them. Just enough time to get two daggers thrown before i lost my chance.
---
Dishonorable kills did nothing to help the issue, all it did was make sure city attacks never happened. People will be ganking exponentially more than now during ohase 2 when dishonorable kills are in the game.
---
that's cool, where I get it? :)
---
the auberdine/theramore via desolace flight path is bad too... can basicially prepare dinner in the time it takes to fly that.
---
Because he just wired himself money.
---
The problem with slow, small steps on server caps is that it further fractures friend groups. If it just keeps creating 2 hour queues to get a little more transfers going, it ends up splitting friends who have different queue lengths they're willing to sit in. This would be a hard snap that would make queues go up 10x. People will move when that happens.
---
For faction balance, the solution is to not let it get more than 5% away from the region-wide natural imbalance. A 57/43 is to be expected, because that is the natural break-down of characters created. There is no solution to enforce 50/50, but Blizz can at least not let it get too far away from 57/43. Just because it can't be 50/50, doesn't mean Blizz should let a server become 75/25.
---
!remindme 4 Hours
---
Two reasons. Leeway and to kite. You want to run just out of distance of attacks while also moving to get a bigger aoe.
---
How do I identify as 1 in game?
---
Welcome to Vanilla normie
---
dude i can play retail on my fucking shitty asus tablet I bought for $400 like two years ago it handles everything but internet like a champ.
---
Makes sense...
---
The first 4 weeks of raiding have proved this very much not to be true. Maybe later when everyone has good gear, but in greens/blues deep frost is much better with ice block/ice barrier - it takes a lot of burden off your healers.
---
Very helpful thanks.  I dont see rupture being used on any of these fights:

and lose all that precious time!?
---
My friends and I run circle around Arathi Highlands killing every alliance we see while spamming /spit on them, regardless of level. Maybe we are assholes, but ruining their questing experience is very fun. Our favorite thing to do is to root someone in place, place dots on them, then jump around them while spamming /spit while the dots slowly kill them. However, we are not a higher level then everyone else there, we are all mid 30's.
---
NEVAAAA
---
Funnily enough most of the higher level were horde. I got killed 2-3 times by ?? Hordies. Could’ve been that I’d gotten there after the reinforcements had already arrived though lmao
---
Your damage is almost completely reliant on your mainhand weapon. What's it look like? Are you following a guide for spec/rotation?
---
I actually had several pieces of level 2 gear still at 14. Maybe drop rates in the NE starting areas suck? My other alliance races all had at least one green by 10, several were almost fully geared. I'm not well versed in Alliance either, I used to play Horde.  
---
Maybe it was just bad luck, but either way the AH solved it for me pretty cheap.
---
Hi fellow Kirtonos player.
---
You want to go from Horde to Alliance?
---
You know the faction imbalance is like 60k to 30k right?
---
In my presumption I'm assuming you want easier questing ect. it's much harder when groups of 5 level 50's are mounted and ganking you repetitively I promise you.
---
I've never seen the issue with faction, race, or server transfers though tbh.
---
Uhh...upper 30s? Maybe low 40s? Its southern STV, outside of Booty Bay, and the quest takes you to various locations culminating in either Hinterlands or Swamp or Sorrows? Memory hazy, sorry.
---
Yes I totally love having to check my phone at work every 15 minutes to make sure I'm still logged in. I love distracted driving and tapping my phone because queue popped 35 minutes before I finish my commute home. My favorite is not logging off for an hour to get my real life obligations are, because if I logout for 10 minutes my entire night of WoW is over.
---
It's easy to say "just use remote access" (lol at those acting like this is some sort of secret), but Classic is a far more time demanding game than most. I'm not about to spend my every waking moment getting my anxiety up because I was afk for 30 seconds too long and lost my spot after waiting 4 hours to play.
---
Good riddance to Herod.
---
Not to mention that 70% of Ret's dps is from auto attack and seal. Literally the only other thing he can do is judge.
---
Oh yeah I do that too. I’m not going to incentivize bad positioning
---
You really should focus on one or the other. Going halfway is just going to make you halfway good at everything.
---
And you can heal everything up to UBRS just fine as shadow.
---
Yeah I haven't paid the sub for years, since cataclysm. And they got me back with classic :/
---
bring: bandages. health pots. buff pots. poisons. jumper cables (if you are an engineer). vanishing powder (for threat dumps). swift thistle tea.
---
get to hit cap. 
---
stand behind boss but not in fire or when you are the bomb.
---
 if you are in a raid group with a shaman using windfury totem, don't put a poison on your main hand.
---
if you are sword spec, look up mirah's song for a sword offhand.
---
I rarely complain, only when I get mad. One or two ganks doesn't really matter, but if I get camped, or die every 5 minutes because the zone is swarmed with horde, every one of them being 5 lvl above me, it's definitely infuriating. Yes, I'm gonna fucken complain, and nor you nor everyone can say what I can do or cannot. But don't worry, my grudge list is getting longer every day, and oh boy, my revenge will be so goddamn sweet.
---
Their culture is based on Natives but the continent of Kalimdor majorly based on Africa. 
---
Ungoro is the Congo. 
---
Barrens the Serengeti.
---
Uldum Egypt
---
Etc. 
---
Orcs, trolls, and Tauren all face things that mirror real life history.
---
Yeah people complaining will always reach the top.
---
In gorden on stalag. Just had a lvl 60 dwarf a priest corpse camp and not let any horde do the raptor heart quest in arathi highlands.
---
I didnt bitch. Tries to find a higher lvl to gank him back to no avail.
---
So you know what I did? I followed that fucked stealthed and skinned all those Raptors.
---
He caught me twice once I started doing this. Once I even got away (he thought his dot would kill me but jokes on you. My level 3 healing touch is the same speed as your tick for damage!)
---
I made a solid 3g or so in skins off this bastard and got to about 260 skinning.
---
I also laughed harder than I should've when I got away.
---
Even people being complete asshole ganking people 26 levels lower is part of pvp. And I enjoyed it
---
You thibj you loot but you don't.
---
Just remove his weapon lol.
---
Yeh see this doesn’t really work for classic though, the Australian servers are basically 2:1 favouring the horde so every fucking zone is filled with horde players, it’s almost impossible to get a fair fight.
---
I had to go help my friend kill trolls in STV for the whirlwind axe and there was quite literally 30 horde players and 3 alliance guys. I can’t remember the faction balance being that whack back in vanilla, maybe I played on lucky servers.
---
Funny... The last iteration of the largest vanilla pservers was Alliance dominated.
---
I just find it fun. I dont need honor points to kill an alliance. I'll fight full health, no health, whatever. I've always been into the PvP side of WoW and I play a rogue. I find it fun to sneak up on someone not expecting you and just ambush.
---
right now you're questing near town, right?
---
some high level areas are about half an hour's travel from major cities.
---
Damn
---
Does this really work ? I mean most groups are mage cleaves anyway, surely they have water xD
---
My fitness game is to go to the gym while you wait in queue.
---
If the quests are green still knock em out.  High density of quests clustered together there make it good still.  Most of the artists start out low 30's so if you didn't begin the chains you'll be doing a few that give no xp to get further in the chain.
---
Transfer your character off and re-roll alliance
---
As noted, the math is based on assumptions pulled from thousands of players via a census addon (not 'some player'). Blizz has the real numbers, and can adjust their faction balance line as needed. The logic remains the same, though. Just maintain 5% away from the natural break-down of horde and alliance accounts on each realm.
---
Yeah I usually don't start shit because I'm trying to quest but sometimes like you said, you see a clothie drinking and it's just too tempting not to ravage them.
---
Wait for dishonorable kills.
---
They are absolutely painful to fight as a rogue because they have a thorns-like buff on them that does like 10 damage each time you touch them. I'd be down to like 10% health after each one.
---
But you can understand why someone didn't believe you when you said you didn't want mail items from SM when the mail items in SM are extremely useful to you.
---
I think these are set-up auctions. You put something nobody would ever buy up for a huge price on one toon, to buy with another, to easily transfer money (cross faction especially, with the cross faction AH.) In this case it might be a friend helping him out.
---
You have no clue what you're talking about.
---
I am. Does that reset it? And if so, why on only one char when it's active on all chars?
---
I'm a rogue. The only rule for me is honor among thieves. To the rest of you, good luck. Hell, this is how I did most of my questing.
---
I'm pretty sure the cover is more popular than the original. I've never even heard the original but have heard the CC version a million times
---
Paladin
---
In the southern part near Booty Bay things should still be easily around that level range if you want to just grind.  As far as questing goes you should be able to breeze through and get some good exp.  Many of those quest chains finish in the early 40s range.
---
I have so many negative encounters with NA players, yet somehow I don't feel like saying shit like: "All NA players are retards". Because they are not. I know PLENTY of great NA players. It would be an absurd generalization. That's what im trying to get at. I'm not defending Russians. I'm just trying to show you how nonsensical that kind of reasoning is.
---
Definitely mage. Could make food and water whenever I want. Also imagine teleporting or making portals to places.
---
Didn't really make it past your 1st paragraph, but it's pretty clear that you don't enjoy this game and don't want to play. So: don't. gl;hf
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
Well boys, we did it. Having too many horde on a server is no more.
---
I'm a level 41 mage and I still have Staff of Westfall. Where do I get a new one ? :(
---
Logging out the traditional way. I know it doesn't save when ALT+F4ing or DCing, sadly that isnt it :( Thanks!
---
You probably wouldn’t know but just gonna ask anyways, why does frostbolt have a unique coefficient? (3/3.5 * 0.95) Where does the 0.95 come from?
---
Nice, I've been wanting to test mobile too. That combined with a controller and the Consoleport add-on sounds like a nice combo for on the go.
---
I’m suggesting that you may need to find a farming or questing buddy so you are not ganked. The server population and faction divide WILL NEVER be controlled. Just as you pointed out, your sarcastic argument makes no sense to switch factions. You’re on a slighted server. You won’t be able to solo. Adapt and stop complaining, there are already systems in place for you to overcome these. Sorry to say but you’re just going to have to accept the fact that it’s going to be harder for some people to achieve the same thing, welcome to life.
---
Yep me. Friends picked PvP server to be edgy (so they could gank/grief). Hate world PvP with a passion. Love battlegrounds though. I already just stopped leveling on an imbalanced server and switched over to PvE. Game became fun again.
---
No, blame autocorrect; he ended with a green gemstone. Peridot.
---
I'm cheating because I played for like 2 weeks on a free server about 5 years ago(Shout out to Nostralius) but other than that I have never touched WoW. I am absolutely loving it it's pretty much all I can think about right now and some of my friends have hopped on as well. The graphics are perfect for this type of game and the gameplay is engaging. Theres so much to do and learn that I feel like I can play for years and still come across new things. I love that you can hop off the boats that take you to different places and be stranded in the middle of the sea it makes the world feel huge. Some things that I'm not the biggest fan of are how long it takes to walk different places, how difficult it is to find some quest stuff some times(I don't want to spend 30+ minutes trying to track down a random dude in town- gonna look into downloading questly for sure), and how long it takes to hop onto the fairbanks server. Other than that the game is great:)
---
Jajaja
---
I am tanking instances fine buying almost none of the prot skills. Only got revenge really. When I start overlevering the dungeon a bit I swap to tanking with a 2h.
---
Do you think the server admins just lowered it for fun then?
---
I play early in the mornings and competition for mobs isn't not bad at all. also, less ganking going on.
---

---
I will stand by it, TBC was the BEST WoW ever was. They made mistakes which required adjustment (PVP weapons being too easy to obtain initially), and honestly some overtuning of some bosses (which is infinitely better than undertuning bosses).
---
However it addressed so many major issues extremely well.
---
* Travel is obnoxious: More flight paths, and eventual flying mounts.
---
* Max level content? Introduction of Arenas. Introduction of heroic dungeons. Generally solid raid design.
---
* Balance between factions: Alliance got shamans, horde got paladins.
---
Raids? So many solid ones:
---
* 10 man: Karahzan and Zul'Aman. Honestly I feel both of these are some of the strongest raids Blizzard has produced. Period. Karahzan addressed issues with running pretty well by being able to enter mid way through. Zul'Aman was just unique in general.
---
* Short raids: Gruul's Layer, Magtheridon. Plus the raid boss. The first two were not super trash heavy which was nice. Both were fairly accessible (Gruul himself was slightly overtuned initially), and with the change I think it had solid accessibility.
---
* Medium raids SSC and TK. Neat due to where they were, probably the weakest of the raids they produced. Both of these felt like they dragged on.
---
* Long raids: Hyjal I have both a love hate relationship with this one. I think they did a solid job of it reflecting what happened in WCIII, in a reasonable way...but it was rather annoying to farm, because there isn't a way to speed things up. I wish you could have a bell that you could make the waves come faster. Black Temple: A little more trash for my taste, but plenty of juicy rewards and money for doing it. Obviously good rewards. And then Sunwell, which I think was far better than people will give it credit for, but quite frankly 2 years was not enough time to chew through 5 major raids people were looking towards WotLK when Sunwell came out.
---
I think the biggest mistake of TBC was the pacing, Blizzard released Karahzan, Gruul's Layer, SSC, TK, and BT and Hyjal ALL within 5 months of TBC's release. That is way to fast to go through T4, T5, and T6 gear. There was never time to enjoy the gear you got. So it felt like a grind and it burned people out HARD, because the ONLY thing you felt like you could do during that time was to raid. Want to PVP? Well if you are online lets raid! Or you need to prepare for raids because you are going through consumables so fast because there is pressure to have an intense raid schedule. If you want to be more casual, then your more serious raiders move on to a guild that wants to raid more.
---
Pacing was REALLY problematic.
---
And finally I think TBC was the best, because it was drawing so heavily from the lore that people knew and that attracted people to WoW in the first place, but it was a new story.
---
I agree man. I cant stand all these baby's complaining about being ganked while questing and asking for different layers. Fucking deal with it. Go to a different zone, take a 10 minute break.
---
You joking? He's smug as fuck in Vanilla.
---
Haven't seen that attitude on EU servers thankfully.
---
I would argue that's what having pvp servers are about.
---
It's very tiring leveling through dungeons as Alliance. Seems your edginess of 10v1 just makes sure it will be 10v0 in a month. Basically just really bad PvE servers since there is no enemy faction to stop you from side raids like raids on SW/IF.
---
Blizzard going waaaay out of their way to ruin the game.
---
A bounty sure but I feel like excessive amounts of griefing and camping could be construed as targeted harassment. One and done ganks with screenshots would likely be no big deal I imagine
---
Yeah I think a lot of the complaining is a little overboard. Definitely it's not fun to have some high level dude camping your quest mob, which I understand, but if you are consistently dissatisfied with that gameplay experience why sign up for a PvP server? I absolutely hate getting ganked and having people kill my quest mobs, because I dont like having my enjoyment of the game be lessened so some other dude can get his kicks. You know what I did to stop that? Rolled on a PvE realm. I don't understand why so many people seem completely averse to the idea of rolling on a PvE realm but at the same time get very angry for PvP happening on the realm they decided to play on.
---
I remember being 14...
---
But you're only annoyed for the sake of not having a 15mb add-on.
---
&gt;	Some damage is more damage than no damage. Alternatively, write yourself a weapon swap macro or just put two MH weapons on your action bar and just ambush.
---
I’m gonna make this easy for you here and any rogues reading this. The combo points from cheap shot are more valuable. 
---
&gt;	Patrols, getting against a wall, getting all the mobs in front of me, moving through the mobs so their backs are to the DPS... any number of reasons, all of which are made harder by your stun that did no damage.
---
Cool story. I said I engage when the tank does so it’s already been positioned. Also combo points. 
---
&gt;	You can ambush if you carry a dagger.
---
Combo points are more valuable. 
---
&gt;	Let me manage my own resources, thank you very much.
---
Literally take your own advice lol I’m answering a rogue’s question as a rogue. 
---
&gt;	Sorry this upsets you so much.
---
Don’t do that dude, nobody is upset.
---
I figured it was but it sounded kinda fun to go make some gold horde/alliance hunting haha
---
This is ME on so many levels. I keep forgetting to do the thing I need to do when in town. I probably need this add-on...
---
Questie does this.
---
That’s ok, it is only for tougher bosses for quests, I can drop a target dummy then pop both pets to burn it down
---
I mean, Jhomthyk is obviously a girls name.
---
It has to do with OP needing that ego boost they apparently get from killing someone that isn't a challenge.  OP probably goes to the playground also to see if there are any 10 year olds they can challenge to a game of [insert sport here] so they can defeat them with little to no effort.
---
Days? Shit in UO you had like 7 minutes until people could dry loot your corpse in Trammel even.
---
SM library boss drops a good staff, but its a bit below your level range.
---
As the other commenter said, if you want to do any damage you'll need to respec. However, you can be useful in Alterac Valley where a good tank or two is needed for Drek'Thar.
---
Remindme! 18 hours
---
Get twitch client, download "Questie" and bring me sone conjured bread NAIVE!!!!
---
Jk, jk, we luv u
---
I'm making a few gold per level from skinning at 35.  And a lot of my heavy leather goes to my tailor alt to make silk 10 slot bags.
---
Stack vendors for like 30s I think but I can get 50 for it easy on the AH by undercutting everyone else.
---
I got told I couldn't join a Sunken Temple group because you have to be lvl 54+ for it....
---
I swear people that have come from playing retail need to chill with the "link mythic +++++ speed demon run and max GS only" mentality.
---
I remember back in Vanilla trying to do the dungeon a level or two under the "optimal" level and doing just fine, people need to chill tf out.
---
You ok fam? Getting kinda hostile. Everything alright at home?
---
His mount is a hyena. He uses it in the Battle for Lordareon event from the BfA pre-patch. I think that's the only reference to them in current content, but its not a blighted hyena or anything.
---
&gt; when they are 15min from the dungeon
---
many people find groups from cities.  also tanaris is huge. it takes a very long time to walk from the bottom to the top.
---
See, if you had no group, you wouldnt be able to open them.
---
On Rattlegore, there's only a handful of level 60s and it's one of the most populated realms....
---
Could you please send me as well? Looks great.
---
"You liar! You used an analogy and also made me think they had to play a game literally identical to the game they did have to play!"
---
ALWAYS use SnD with 1 CP, otherwise you are wasting CP (unless your target is dying, etc), do the math:
---
SnD with 5 CP = ~20sec
---
SnD with 1 CP = ~9sec
---
Raid wise: Instant Poison (don't use deadly), Open with garrote, @ SnD, Sinister x5, Evis &gt; SS x1 &gt; back to @ and that's it.
---
Warriors and Rogues in a nutshell
---
I definitely think all the people saying "if you play on a PvE server you're missing out on an important part of the game" gets people thinking that they're not going to have fun at all playing on a PvE servers
---
Prolly druid.
---
So I can shapeshift and play with my dog
---
There's a difference between Invincible and Invisible. Please look that up and delete the post lol.
---
Dot things (a bit, nothing extreme) and use rain of fire.  Afflic does the same RoF damage as destro tbh.  You are making excuses. The only advantage destro has is shadowburn and that isn't a big deal.
---
Clearly you never played on LH or ND during China peak hours. Have fun when literally EVERY mob worth killing in the world is contested by 10+ players. These servers were unplayable with a 10k cap and Herod is pushing well above that during peak hours.
---
I honestly feel like everyone is in for a rude awakening once layering is gone. if you think Herod is competitive now, wait until 5x the amount of people are contesting everything with no dynamic respawns.
---
It is just strange to me that they couldn't bring back a legacy game with at least some of the quality of life improvements... and ya'll paid HOW MUCH for this game?
---
I try to coach the others to stop going for the damn thirst/killing blow and they forget most of the time but the thiugh
---
I (a druid) don't get ganked nearly as often as most of my guildies on a server where our faction is outnumbered 2:1, everybody joked about it being because people take pity on me for playing a druid.
---
Did I even say I as on a PVP server?  But great assumption. 
---
I just don't understand that enjoyment in one-shotting someone that isn't a challenge.
---
Open the setting, click Toggle Anchor on any of the settings and it'll show you where everything is on the screen. Then just right click it and it'll show you the setting for that item.
---
Yeah, I was agreeing with you. I know that's rare with this sub lol.
---
It can still work. I always see rogues do it in my groups. Worst case they enter combat after and the tank just goes in.
---
It's still alright if you don't have any other classes in your group to cc with.
---
Thats kinda stupid, i understand doing it to enemy faction but to your own? Mage AOE grind is there since 2004, its not new thing.
---
Boss in SM library drops a staff.
---
A few levels up in zul'farak you can hope to get another staff.
---
Multimob pulling sucks on every leveling tank(except maybe 2H warrior with the AOE weapon).
---
The key is to remember that regular mobs aren't dangerous. The rogue or mage can handle one or two of those. The only thing you really need to hold threat on is the boss.
---
&gt; Make lists.
---
&gt; Treating wow as a job.
---
&gt; Remove all fun.
---
&gt; Uninstall game.
---
Jk
---
offtopic, but what are you using for quantity in tooltip? I use bagnon on live but it doesn’t seem to work on classic(the quantity count, not bagnon itself)
---
I'm alliance on Kirtonos. I swing at anything that damn moves. 
---
And then level at 4 am when the horde is asleep
---
Mining/herb nodes are rolled between miners/herbers - because a single herb/ore is more valuable to herbalist/miner than to someone who cant collect more.
---
Raid nodes are sent to guild vault.
---
Chests are rolled for all because their contents are useful for all.
---
Your view is so incredibly warped. In your mind the victim deserves the consequences of being dumb, but you, the thief, deserve no consequences for your actions. 
---
If I leave my keys in my car and it gets stolen I'm an idiot, but the dude who stole my car still goes to jail. In your world crimes of opportunity are totally fine and 100% the fault of the victim. 
---
You are definitely a bad person if you truly believe this.
---
So, how’d ya get out?
---
It’s the players fault, not blizzards. Delete and reroll if you feel compelled to be the underdog. 
---
Server transfers were stage 1 wow cancer.
---
Not bad
---
Shapeshifting. Probably biggest reason id take druid over hunter is Healing. one I wish we could do irl. Just will others wounds to mend with my own mana.
---
Reset as in no characters
---
And here my friends and I are 4-manning dungeons with 1-2 party members under-leveled. This game is too easy for this level of elitism.
---
I am not sure what you want me to take from that statement.
---
&gt; and there are roles like controllers, buffers and debuffers and we don't need to give every class a CC and be able to do the same damage per second with zero regard to their utility just so things are 'balanced'.
---
This is something that I liked about rift, on top of the usual tank/healer/dps they also had the "support" category.
---
An entire role completely centered around buffing, debuffing, and CCing.
---
They also had weird shit like the Defiler or the Chloromancer which did a fuckton for making it easier to transition from healing to DPSing and vice-versa
---
The chloromancer was a healer designed to play like a DPS and it bore a striking resemblance to shadow priests except it did fuck all for damage but vampiric embrace healed for a very substantial amount (and there were two versions, one for tank &amp; small group healing and another for raid-wide healing)
---
And the Defiler did DPS by healing people (so they'd heal for like 100 damage and it would be converted to like 300 damage per target surrounding its pylon) but its main role in groups was to transfer damage from the tank, healer, and melee DPS to itself and take a reduced amount, so you'd transfer like 40% of the damage done to the tank but then you'd only take 10% of that value)
---
that would be a ton of fun.  Shaman could do this too.
---
I also only remember there being one on Gadgetzan..weird
---
I think its borderline and wouldn't want to risk bliz coming down on me. A site like this could easily go too far.
---
I'm a returning player, just started and am around level 14 or 15 rogue on Horde/Firemaw. I used to raid in early WOTLK but haven't played for a few years. I don't plan to raid anymore, mostly interested in world PVP. Just lookin for some friends
---
Combat is good, what are your weapons
---
&gt;for all intensive purposes, it's a horde zone.
---
The phrase is "for all intents and purposes"
---
All 5 players fought to clear the area around that locked chest too. If the rogue can't get to it alone, the contents should be shared. 
---
Let the rogue take all the trash as his "fee" for opening it, sure. That random shit can sell for decent coin. 12+ slot bags and magical items should be rolled on (together or separately as determined by the group)
---
Be careful who you call ugly in middle school.
---
People care about fairness. This has always been true. Horde dominate almost all of the PvP servers. So fairness would be to show alliance some leeway in world PvP. But like history has shown, the masturbation of the horde today will leave them with very few people to actually fight in the long run.
---
Warlock, i would enjoy making people run in fear and I would do it often, also that succubus is your slave ;) 
---
o.O
---
I'd blame that guild name!  ;-)
---
Just cry babys that cant handle dieing to the opposite faction while leveling. We have all died to the opposite faction while leveling, it's part of the game but some people dont seem to understand it or they are jealous that they aren't level 60 yet.
---
I found I could only get SA to 2 or 3 before the mob died. At early levels, the difference between white damage and HS damage was about 20 or so. White damage with 2 or 3 SA's on it was about 10-12 more damage. I don't think the mob would die any faster going full HS than doing SA, at least not at early levels.
---
Yes, really. 
---
Part of the warrior identity in classic "heavily armored tough-guy that can take a hit and protects his allies from harm."
---
That eventually got watered down to the point where non-prot specs couldn't tank worth a damn, and it really got watered down when they normalized armor to the point where it was hardly any different. 
---
Now only the 1 spec has the "heavily armored tough guy who protects his friends" flavor. Honestly it's to the point where it feels weird that fury warriors wear plate; seems like the raging berserker class is usually unarmored in RPGs.
---
If you don’t like the content other people are upvoting you should just reroll to the blizzard forums instead of using Reddit. You signed up for viewing content other users have upvotes by joining Reddit and going to the classicwow subreddit. If you don’t like it just go somewhere else, don’t complain about it.
---
I’m not 100% serious here but that’s exactly what you sound like.
---
You can 3 man every dungeon in the game till ubrs with appropriate levels and gear for the dungeon and still win.
---
Hell you can 4 man onyxia in t1 quality gear.
---
That's just what PvP servers are. It wasn't any different in vanilla. The majority of world pvp is killing someone who is at a disadvantage (low level, low hp, Xv1).
---
If you decided to roll on a PvP server and didn't expect that, you fucked up.
---
Unless you're in a group you shouldn't need water as a priest message direct for help
---
Looks like a modded Mountain King. Don't remember any dark iron dwarves in WC3
---
Sorry I didn't heal you it was that or keep the tank alive. That was the one I gave yesterday.
---
He wants them to not tag the quest mob so he can GTFO faster and the mage can go back to doing their thing
---
Never. But blizzard had this autistic idea to open the small amount of total servers there were for "name reserves". A few weeks before official launch. 
---
A lack of understanding how many people would play the game, plus a low balled total servers, plus letting people just keep piling up in these full servers instead of making more resulted in every single server getting "full" before the game was actually even released. Not only are these servers full, but they are actually "double full" an entire servers population waiting in que while another one plays. 
---
It's dwindled a bit since adding new servers and offering free transfers, but it's an issue that never should have happened if they just kept all the servers closed untill actual launch day.
---
Ouch. That's certainly not a mob you use SnD on.
---
Fuck you man it was twice in a row with briarthorn I was fighting on top of to have a Druid swoop on through and take my damn thorn
---
God tell me about it. 
---
So my bosses family plays, and I'm super close to most all of them.
---
Bosses wife rolls a mage, has hit 30, I'm about 35. She starts off STV by getting ganked and saying "I can't do anything, I'm logging off" before anyone of us can contemplate even helping.
---
Then my boss says later "She'd rather just sit there and get killed so she can go on questing, rather than fight and pvp"
---
Shes only there for our group, but its dumb, if you didn't want to PvP when we were all deciding what server we wanted to roll on YOU SHOULD OF SAID SOMETHING or not played for 3 weeks knowing getting ganked is going to happen.
---
Everyone played retail in my group in a PvE server, except for me, who played more of vanilla WoW and came in later down the road.
---
Its dumb, learn to fight or learn to run. Don't whine or stand there and die. Deal with it.
---
... or is the bitch that one that probably sucks PVP'ing against players at level so instead has to go gank players so low that it's not even a challenge?  
---
What a way to flex imagined muscle in a video game.  Ha!
---
&gt;Its a dick thing to do but they are having fun doing it.
---
You said it right here.  Having fun doing dick things is sad.
---
A level 40 warlock could have all of the experience in the world, it still doesn’t change the fact that most of their abilities are going to be ineffective/miss/be resisted by a level 47 elite.
---
mate, i'm a rogue player. That means two things.
---
1. i have the worst tools for tagging mobs, especially when they're a level or two higher than me. Everyone else hitting the uncommon spawn points to avoid the mage spam means that completing the quest either means throwing a dagger, hoping it gets there before everyone else's attacks, and then having to eat/bandage between each mob because i didn't get an opener off from stealth.
---
2. i chose to play a rogue, i'm naturally inclined to fuck with people. If getting that mage killed means i get to complete the quest in 10 minutes instead of an hour, then being on their shitlist is a small price to pay.
---
I get nothing when i fish in the river but i got fish when i fished from the pond to the north.
---
Just move the fuck on and grind some mobs instead for the 3k exp youd have gotten for the escort
---
So fuckin whiny
---
I understand the issue so much that I provided a solution for you cause you will never fix 60/40...if you are so worried about solo xp and gold per hour and splitting loot with others over working with other people to survive and advance in game you would never make it anyway.
---
Varian is mia during classic. Anduin is king during this time. But he doesn't actually do anything.
---
Hello man, I also play on Stalagg Alliance with some friends and the lvl 30 is where it hits the most. Wherever you go, you will be in minority. Hillsbrad? Swarm. STV? Swarmed. Badlands? Swarmed.  I did my whole 30s in STV and other zones. It was... horrible. 10 horde jumping on you out of nowhere, walking to die again 30 seconds later. 1 jumps on you, you defend yourself to then have 30 horde jump on your ass (hardly kidding, it's really that disbalanced).  I feel like the meme with the innocent white girl with 10 big ass men behind her whenever I  play lol...
---
/roll for everyone.  Rogues aren't in some superior position because of it.  Engineering has seaforium charges.
---
oh man, that ass slap she does randomly ;)
---
All I want are some minor qol things left in from retail. I really mostly just miss my bag sorting tool. There's no good reason not to enable it. Dual Spec might be ok. Maybe put like a 1 day cooldown on it. Increasing the debuff limit to 32 would be interesting. All that said, I'm really enjoying classic so far.
---
Ah. And since PUGs are all twitchy finger groups, that can be a little tricky. Still, could be a fun change, especially during leveling.
---
Parry before you pop evasion so the 3.8 second warrior doesnt suddenly look like hes stacking windfury from your dodges lol
---
I 1v1 people all the time at 60
---
^^^^^^^notcountingthemobs
---
sap is only 90% reliable, even when specced 3/3 points in the sublety tree
---
That's really cool OP, good job.
---
we there just for the ring, we didn't even get the giant
---
Because it's Classic and having mobs at five different levels next to each other somehow makes sense.
---
I did the blasted lands quests, all the feralas quests, and only have the message in a bottle quests left in STV. 
---
I'll probably end up grinding out a level or two then heading to un'goro
---
I like to think of it more as in remembered the day I gave it to him and how it helped him and when he discarded it he saw my name and thanked me after not realizing it was something he used for 15 levels. You're right that he didn't actually remember my name, I'm sure.
---
I'm a Shadow Priest at lv 42 right now and I can still heal dungeons without issue. 5 points in wands and everything else in Shadow is good enough to heal as long as you watch your mana and regen effectively.
---
relax bro it's only phase one
---
I read somewhere, that if your cat starts doing this you should take it to a vet. Hope this helps.
---
Why?  You planning to play on every server?
---
Weapons also DE for better mats though, so it’s a trade off.
---
now kiss
---
Imagine being this mad about streamers
---
SM GY drops an off hand, and SM Lib drops a caster dagger.
---
Also same boss in SM Lib drops a staff.
---
You will pretty much never get an opportunity to use rupture due to debuff limit on raid bosses.
---
You *saw* ten or so there...
---
Ok, I'm a rogue but how do I play a druid?
---
Meh
---
1. I still think travel times like flight are long, it is fun to explore on the ground thiugh
---
2. They may have given an "illusion of choice" but in future WoW they just removed choice in regards to talents
---
3. See #2, they fixed itemization by again taking away any choice whatsoever
---
4.
---
i used to know ALL the super bounces. they were awesome. looks like the sheeple thumbed me down. theyre all goona flock together and shit all over each other.
---
Flippity floppity
---
:)
---
This is just going to be used as a hit list for people on PVP servers.
---
I'm sorry, you've leveled 2 characters to 60? Where did you find the time to clean your dump bucket?
---
MonkeyQuest seems promising! I'll check it out after work, thanks.
---
&gt; No. That would be cheating.
---
Ahh that explains it then.
---
Just because he chooses to use his time differently on a video game to you?
---
Link to original post?
---
I found my ducky keyboard had the keystroke rate suddenly increase and it spammed WOW and disconnected me. Try walking in wow using just your mouse 1 and 2 together, does it do the same?
---
My ducky keyboard i had to press FN+F5 i think to lower the keystroke rate and fix my issues in WOW
---
How is having to wait up to 3-4 seconds to drop combat in line with vanilla?
---
Pet is totally messed up and likes to sit on npc's faces for 3 seconds after killing them, it dances around mobs when they are fleeing, has a delay going into combat, all that messes up feign death, yeah you can spam 'enlightened' macros like this but you will be sitting on the ground for up to 4 seconds due to buggy stuff like this.
---
On vanilla you didn't even have to let the animation play out and could do it if you were running before etc, now due to spell batching the time it takes to drop combat is random as hell.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQvzEjePYlo
---
Oh true, it's NOT FREE! It's a couple gold right? Definitely a much better deal, and quests are good! They give XP and build character ;-)
---
Tipsout did a video about it and he clearly said he did it to test it under different circumstances.  
---
I have no idea if he kept the loot, looted at all or if he just kept everything.  In all case, he should be ban.  
---
Don't try this at home kids
---
Anyone here a member of &lt;Is Probably Stoned&gt; from Darrowshire/Light's Hope private server?
---
my life
---
Oh alright. Could you tell me why Varian is gone? Just curious for story
---
Where did blizzard say that the intended purpose of layering was to farm mobs?
---
You could do a tree structure with headlines that can be closed/opened.

Seems to be a sad amount of the sort of assholery going around but it's always existed and always will. It happens, stay positive and get another group.
---
No jealousy for some guy that probably is unemployed or took vacation to level in a video game quicker than everyone else so he could flex his video game muscles to make himself feel better by killing toons that are no challenge.
---
Pity is probably more appropriate... LOL
---

Fear got nerfed about 18 times during TBC.
---
Yeah but that doesn’t mean it’ll go smoothly, I usually just wait until I’m on the higher half of the dungeon recommendations
---
It's the Classic Experience
---
J
---
100% same.
---
How many topics of those "I 1-hit all low levels after I come home from school" do already exist? I don't care at all but reading all those questionable explanations start to get boring.
---
What would you guys recommend as an alt for a nice change of pace from a Tauren Shaman for an alt? I think I have it narrowed down to Warrior, Hunter or Warlock right now but am open to other suggestions.
---
I like having the meters running as a healer to see if I can out dps one of the dps players. You've gotta find some ways to have fun as a healer in low level Classic dungeons.
---
Holy crap! Congrats m8!
---
Ho boy, am I glad to see that mod getting supported!
---
The fact that just because there aren't alot of players at max level doesn't mean a server is dead. There are millions of people playing classic wow rn, literally no server is dead.
---
In Thralls horde we fight with honor...... most of the time... well we try to try.
---
Well I highly doubt you saw any alliance up to level 10, considering there’s no contested areas till around 20.
---
I was about to say that you are doing it at a much too high level... then I remembered I’m a hunter.
---
I got ganked soloing the furlong escort in ashenvale 10 feet from completing it. 
---
I then spent hours camping the corpse of the priest that did it until he took a Rez sickness. 
---
It felt amazing.
---
Your example is a first world problem. Alliance experience 4v1 or level skull ganking us. When we want fairness we are asking for those to not happen. Not some completely fair fight you had as horde.
---
I think World is as close as it could possibly get, with instanced monster encounters and quests. 
---
Being able to swarm monsters, or approach them initially when they've already been weakened, would really go against the spirit of the franchise.
---
And then the Paladin bubbles.
---
I picked up [The Green Tower](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1204/the-green-tower) yesterday. Is this a good shield for the level and do you think demand will go up for it in the future ? Or should I try to sell it now ?
---
Ultimately I think the downfall of those kinds of classes and roles was party size of 5. You sacrifice too much damage to take on utility, and that utility is now affecting too few players so it's either insignificant, or becomes too strong of a meta.
---
Back when party sizes were 6,7 or 8 in old school games there were all kinds of unique roles. Even Aion has a party size of 6 and it has some Bard style classes that sacrifice some damage for buff support.
---
However I still do think in Vanilla and TBC especially that WoW had struck a good balance with hybrid utility, CC and DPS, but at some point it lost sight that it was an RPG and switched to some action game where you play the spec instead of building the character. Everyone needed to CC, everyone needed equal damage, utility was no longer any kind of meaningful thing.
---
Maybe for you. I was running around farming everything, by the time I completed the vulture, scorpid, and basilisk quests I was still sitting pretty at zero turtle shells. 
---
Then I logged on today and got all the shells in less than half an hour. RNG is a fickle mistress.
---
It's a very personal thing but this along with your faction rolling in to tag a mob you clearly have been working your way to, alone, through narrow spacing and strategically killing countless of mobs. Runs in, no invite thrown to you, tags the mob as your resting, kills it and gets the fuck out like he didn't do anything wrong.
---
Fuck those people. Really though, I hate it.
---
Well put.
---
Sure, we'll give you an automated group finder. But it's cross-realm with people you'll never see again after the run is over.
---
Sure, we'll buff hybrids and make everyone do good DPS. But now classes are homogenized and nobody is special anymore.
---
Sure, we'll remove all of that garbage useless gear. But now all of the gear blurs together into one big forgettable mess because everything is just "main stat + stam + haste/crit/mastery/vers" and it doesn't even matter because higher ilvl = upgrade, most of the time.
---
Sure, we'll make raids more accessible to casual players. But it's also cross-realm and nerfed to shit but still compels hardcore players to do it because of the chance at extra loot / items.
---
etc.
---
The demographic for this game has to be the oldest in a game's release history. Playing classic I swear I've run into more people in their mid 40s than any other game out there. It's not a bad thing, it's just a thing.
---
No I didn't expect anything other than a /say "thanks" from people. I handed out about 30 around Goldshire out of boredom. No ulterior douche motive.
---
I'm a hunter and this is my life with arrows.
---
Life is hard for a Warlock without a static. I turned to questing mid-40s and am almost lvl 53. Slow steady progress is better than occasional bursts and LFG for hours can make it hard to do any real solo grinding.
---
Locks can slot in to any of the cleave comps but are seen as "suboptimal". We provide some utility in summons and wipe insurance but ideally you aren't wiping and no one making an exp farm group is going to make it with the thought in mind that the group is going to see wipes.
---
If you don't have a static dungeon group as a lock and aren't willing to Hawkeye the LFG chat to out a group together...get on that quest grind.
---
There has to be something to slow down their AoE xp farming. I'm just here to restore balance to the world.
---
Wholesome!
---
&gt; but does also mention 40% being the threshold for AoE
---
That's definely not what I said. I'm specifically talking about Arcane explosion spamming/Hellfire.
---
My heart aches for you haha
---
I use triangle for sap - the green/pointy tip of the triangle screams "rogue, cut this guy" to me.
---
chill bruder ist nur die erste phase..
---
Also, if you pull aggro... run away from your hunter... please ;)
---
I've always played as a kid but this is my first time playing with a serious relationship. My girl rages almost nightly. She can't respect the grind. 😢

You’re thinking of the 60 mount. The 40 mount is 1g at your trainer.
---
oh no. Sry, I should have specified. I got the orc warlock to lvl 37 but I decided I don't like the horde and then I made a human which is lvl 26 atm.
---
Dumb people complained about those things.  People who don't understand what makes an MMORPG work.  The same people who are now the retail community.
---
Yes I read his post, what do you think is the solution here exactly if not write down the names the guys he don't want to buy from?? an addon because some names burn his soft eyes, give me a break
---
So herbalists without alchemy should offer to do a /roll for the gathered herbs?
---
a true rogue would gladly open the chest and offer to open any of the parties lockboxes.  This dudes giving us a bad wrap.
---
No you're a no skill little pussy
---
But maybe it was us! Which realm?
---
i really dont like these comments because while 1-60 is fun there is still a lot more to it than that.
---
The Esfand video is the only one I've seen. I thought it was the same phenomenon but you're right that it could be something else.
---
I personally wont kill a Lowbie.. But I will curse them a few times with to hinder them.. If they fight back, they die.
---
Being ally on a horde pop server isnt bad. Learn to use your character or quest with someone as op stated. Its a social game.
---
I was DPS'ing for that instance because that is what the group was requesting.  I'm a warrior - our main purpose is to tank instances.  And I increased my strength and stamina as well with the switch to plate so honestly my DPS has improved, as has my down time between mobs and my leveling speed.  Wins all around by making the switch.
---
Killing enemy players that are killing the same mobs as you so there's less competition for spawns is a pretty good reason, especially in some crowded areas where respawns take forever.
---
People will get sick of all of these things again and more. Once the novelty wares off.
---
I think people  are starting to burn out already. I had over a dozen friends on bnet that came back to play classic, half of them dropped 2 weeks into it and as of yesterday only 1 was still playing daily. I'm on the fence about resubbing as well.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsqjbJ6hamc
---
&gt; Also, priests and warriors aren't allowed to dps, bc they're best at tanking and healing.
---
Warriors are also the highest DPS after everyone is in BWL/AQ40 gear.
---
When you average a layer out over the 3-4k people in it, I don't think you can avoid hotspots no matter what you try.
---
That's literally \*not\* the definition of insanity. That's an often attributed to Einstein quote (he never actually said this), and repeating the same thing over and over is actually the scientific method used to provide an aggregate of results to prove or substantiate a hypotheses, thus becoming scientific theory.
---
*insanity - the state of being seriously mentally ill; madness.*   
---
*scientific method -  a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.*  aka - doing the same thing over and over, observing the results.
---
The actual quote's origin would insist that the person repeating words would cause insanity in the listener/reader, not the other way around.

When George Bernard Shaw reviewed Nordau’s opus he turned the criticism of repetition back upon the author and suggested that Nordau might diagnose himself as mentally unsound: [5](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/03/23/same/#note-15768-5)
---
&gt;I have read Max Nordau’s “Degeneration” at your request,—two hundred and sixty thousand mortal words, **saying the same thing over and over again.** That, as you know, is the way to drive a thing into the mind of the world, though Nordau considers it a **symptom of insane “obsession”** on the part of writers who do not share his own opinions. His message to the world is that all our characteristically modern works of art are symptoms of disease in the artists, and that these diseased artists are themselves symptoms of the nervous exhaustion of the race by overwork.

Been there already, invite warrior dps that rolls on shields and one handers while being specced two handed mastery just on the off chance in the far future they gotta tank. I could understand it if they at least made the effort to tell me ahead of time but theu usually refuse to say anything till the item drops and suddenly theyre a new prot warrior.

&gt; There is no subreddit for classic guild recruitment.
---
There is. Find your realm's subreddit and there will be a guild recruitment channel for each faction. At least, my realm has one.
---
your title and what is in that screenshot aren't the same thing. you're saying that the screenshot shows an armor modification's effect falling off while you're making a bandage
---
basically, it doesn't matter but it's probably just a logging bug. you can't make a bandage and take damage (damage stops you from making a bandage which would mean spike is back active) but it's most likely just a bug with the logging
---
Yep
---
We had a boomkin in a Mara princess group yesterday and we were running a few times.  He was below the tank on every pull aside from princess boss.  We finished the first run and I told him we were gonna find another dps.  He got super defensive.  We pretty much 4 manned the dungeon and he gets salty with me.  I offered to summon him back if he wanted to respec or if he wanted to heal or even tank bc my friends could swap roles.  He declined and got booted.  
---
I didn't even think about kicking him mid run.  Sorry you got treated that way
---
The elite adds? I think it's to do with missing packs before the boss, but it didn't happen often enough to get a definitive answer in my groups
---
They're pure suffer to level until bear form, then only kinda painful until cat form. Paladins and warriors, though they might be the slowest to level, don't feel nearly as painful during that 1-20 stretch. At least that's been my experience and why a bunch of friends don't main druid.
---
Honest question. This game is 15 years old, what's with people having suggestions on how change its design? Every game forum has posts like this, but nothing seems more futile than suggesting how to improve World of Fucking Warcraft.
---
I was talking about the entire guild on voice chat lmao
---
you're so defensive yet you claim you don't care about streamers, go get a 2 year sub streak
---
Sitting around waiting for people to get their locks picked is probably the least efficient method for leveling up.
---
It's the standard MMO triad of tank / healer / dps.  
---
If most people are generally topped off and you're there to do as much damage as possible, you're hurting the group a bit by not performing the role you were brought to do.  
---
If someone is at low health and you heal them because the other healer is slacking and that causes someone to complain, they're just being a jackass.   
---
Being a hybrid class DPSing is a delicate balance of "oh shit... should I heal this guy!?" and trying to kill things.
---
Wow you’re so right. I change my answer to rogue, so I can stalk you and constantly sap you all day long and pickpocket you.
---
For me it's always been about saving materials for raising professions on Alts, and maybe a few BOE's to twink alts with.  
---
In classic wow, materials were also a hedge against inflation for when you didn't need the gold but found it just accumulating anyway.  What I mean is, you sell stuff today for less gold than it might be a month or several months from now.  Typically, as people farm there's more money in the economy (though not guaranteed for many reasons) which means those things in the future sell for more.  If you sell them then rather than now, you have more gold.
---
This guy's setup works really well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKQW7yHAJ20
---
So because it has more value, everyone is suddenly entitled to it? Get out of here with that shit. Why do you automatically have a "shit attitude" for not sharing your loot? I just don't see the reasoning in this point of view. If the rogue wants to open up rolls to the group, you should thank him and be grateful - not act/feel entitled to it.
---
The original release barely lasted for 2-3 years before they released an expansion do you really think the majority of players who are playing through content at a super optimal pace aren't going to get burned out much quicker?
---
I just think it's hilarious that you even care that people are chatting about what they hope happens with a game.
---
Go be a Debbie downer in some forum that cares.
---
dang, already over?
---
my guild was considering transferring -- about 50 people. our current server is rough as fuck, locked 8 hours out of the day and several thousand more horde on than alliance at any given time. makes for a rough time on a pvp server.
---
i made a character to transfer to our destination server on saturday and at 10 pm there were **5** level 60s online, and less than 900 people online in total. that is an impossible sell for anyone regardless of queue times.

I commented on streamer favoritism, so what? Is it not allowed to be discussed? Calling out someone for being shitty doesn't mean you are obsessed with them
---
up to a point i think
---
as a fury warrior without sunder talents, I find holding threat is very hard post lol 40ish without using a 2h, but then I become harder to heal.
---
rage income is a major issue, and I think unless I'm overlvled for the content I cant tank these more advanced instances (esp when I had not updated my shield since late 20s)
---
Reddit is anything that doesn’t violate the rules, bud.
---
Its worse when someone else body pulls and the other dps starts going ham on random ones while you sit there with practically zero rage to do anything to save them.
---
This just made me so happy!
---
First off, you are the one that has a problem with my mentality. My mentality itself is fine. Secondly, you don't get to decide what's in the spirit of the game.

This whole discussion just boils down to human nature and how normal it is to find new ways to make things easier. If you're having a problem with people using what is available to them, you need to think really hard if that actually makes sense or not.

An example: the mailbox is pretty much the best way to store lots of items, but it was certainly not designed with that in mind right? It was designed to send mail, otherwise it would be the bank. Now, is using this 'not in the spirit of the game?' Will people who use the mailbox like that all end up on BFA? I don't think so.
---
Sounds like your previous encounters were successful. They altered your mindset to KoS all horde, which is the correct mindset. You were in error before.
---
The way i do now , is i have 2 sets of gear. The good one i use with good pls, and the trash one when i run with this lazy ppls so i can fucking roll on something
---
I’m sorry I don’t know what you said. I only speak Orcish, gutterspeak, zandali, and taur-ahe.
---
Questie seems the popular option.
---
But personally I go with the ol tried and true "read the quest and if that fails use classicdb.ch"
---
It’s a good 39 twink healer shield for shammy and pally. I’d wait for the market and twinking to pick up and sell it
---
Yep that will happen.
---
Nothing to do with what I nor the person I was responding to was talking about.
---
Hey tell people to use this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKQW7yHAJ20
---
It's his updated video
---
Jokes aside. Why is it you only see Horde players doing shit like this?
---
You are right, but like its not a very meaningful increase in damage compared to the loss you get from glancing and increased hit because of hit suppression.
---
5 weapon skill is less than 1% reduced evasion total for the mob you are fighting. So in this case where you outlevel the mob, the top end dmg still adds alot more than &lt;1% damage from weap skill.
---
Noone is stacking weapon skill at 60 to reduce evasion. They do it for the insane glancing bonus and hit% change.
---
When you have the macro screen open, drag and drop the macro icon to the action bar spot with the keybind you want.
---
Not agreeing with retarded generalizations = whiteknighting. Okay lol. Look im obviously talking to the wrong people if yall been hurt so much by russians in videogames fine fucking hate them. Im just baffled that it has to come to encompassing an entire nation. Some people of those groups dont deserve the hate. Id be saying same shit if someone said "all american players are retarded". Fuck me right?
---
Honestly it's probably either a young kid or someone with a mental disability.
---
Flying from Feralas to Tanaris takes you through Darnassus lol, at least that's how it worked for me.

Use this resource - a lot of the gear you listed is not available in Phase 1:

---
That song wails.
---
Get a threat meter addon.
---
Open to interpretation
---
Any drawback? Like do I get worse mats? Or is it no different than high level enchant?
---
Progressive
---
Yeah, they started out as all the same human model, same/similar to the boat model they had used back in the day in warcraft 3. I honestly don't remember exactly when they swapped the Darkshore/Teldrassil route to an nelf boat, but it was very late vanilla at the earliest. When BC dropped, both that boat and the boat to Exodar were of nelf design.
---
Ill have to check it out, but I play Horde side.
---
Most arent that bad and very straight forward. The true except is Wailing Caverns, you could get lost for hours in there.
---
F) All classes stop doing stuff unique to them, mages don't give water/food/portals, locks don't give summons, no blessings, etc. This will solve the problem for rogues who only bring dps and this one things they just can't seem to be ok with.
---
Nope, it's wired.
---
&gt; good for nothing
---
If they steal the locked chest, this describes them entirely.
---
That humanoid sap is absolute garbage, we take rogues to fill extra dps slots and to pick chests. We would rather take warriors &gt; rogues in dps, so... steal the chest and you have no use to us. Now or in the future.
---
I’d love to see what solution you come up with- I’ve figured out chrome Remote Desktop but have no clue on solutions for input.
---
Well, Teldrassil *is* a giant tree, so woody sounds wouldn't be too surprising.
---
Was exploring Barrens and discovered 2 other oasis that spawns these with no one farming them.
---
You can tell because of how many eyes there are. So many!
---
Sometimes I have to feed my pet too.  He only eats meat!
---
Nice read! I always enjoy hearing about new players trying wow for the first time!
---
I don’t know if I hate this or love this.
---
This goes for the people who steal the eggs from the quest "Egg Hunt" in the barren. If I had a gun, with two bullets, and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and these egg-stealing low life scum, I would shoot egg-stealing thief twice.
---
vanilla didn't have 10k+ server caps.
---
It has been fantastic!  The only WoW I ever played was playing my brothers mage in the battlegrounds like 13 years ago and definitely less than 20 hours played.
---
DotA, overwatch, borderlands, souls, POE, D3, sc2, darkest dungeon.
---
Most recently was playing EverQuest on p99
---
Wowclassic has been an absolute joy.  41 gnome mage on Herod.  It has been sosososo much fun and can't wait to see how things develop.  
---
The best times I've had have been when some alliance and horde are questing in contested territories and getting along.  Helping each other, waving, finishing each other's mobs.
---
Until...
---
That one fight breaks out :)
---
Ohhhhhh OHHHH. Yeah I had noooooo idea.  I thought BG gave you like a different type of levelling that would further increase stats.
---
So you use zero addons?
---
Atleast the hunter can feign death so it isnt too bad.
---
Overtuned?  Compared to what?   It's exactly the same as it was about a year into vanilla.
---
So far I've only had 1 person post DPS numbers and it was to point out how insane mages are. I told him it doesn't count cause they are mages and we all had a good laugh.
---
Ew
---
Pretty sure Ony was 5 manned back in  Vanilla
---
I guess I empathize with the gamestop kid who thought he was talking to a man and then ended up getting screamed at and having his place of work trashed.
---
That is correct, rend is fixed dmg. otehr than leveling it (waste of gold early on) there is no way to increase the dmg with chants.
---
I'm using classic codex for that. I'm looking for when you want to show how many murloc eyeballs you have or how many turtle shells you have on the screen (not sure if questie does that; as far as I can tell, classiccodex is the default tracker).
---
Btw, this is a better source that is backed by testing in Classic not private servers.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss
---
I must have all the stingy people on my server. I get asked for water everywhere I go and I've gotten two tips all the way to level 36...
---
He doesn’t because nobody would be dumb enough to risk their livelihood exploiting in public view. I bet he thinks logout resetting dungeons is the exploit.
---
I believe MC and onyxia can be done with 20 people who have decent gear / are coordinated.
---
The hardest thing about classic raids was getting 40 people to coordinate / work together.
---
More importantly why is there always a post like this whenever asmon gold does anything?
---
What's next? Asmongold scratches his a$$, are pants undertuned or boxers overpowered?
---
Or when someone skins something you just looted or even just opens a chest you just fought for.
---
This helps!
---
Dude.
---
Goood, let the hate flow, make some content for us boys, i love it! WE LOVE IT!
---
I just sold a Band of Purification for 60s in the AH. How dumb am I?
---
Jesus fuck, it's a typo, not a life choice.
---
I don't think the quest is in phase 1
---
MonkeyQuest is the best actual quest tracker addon I've found. I love it.
---
Stick with leather armor.
---
LFR is most definitely easier than anything in classic, seeing as you can literally ignore mechanics and still 1shot everything.
---
Is there a bag addon that...works for Hunters? I've tried a couple, but they include my ammo bag in a way that's kind of awkward.
---
I'm sure one exists that only works on the Onyxia raid.
---
on the private server they had the alliance and horde working together to control the devilsaur market. Anyone outside the 2 faction guilds were killed
---
I'm with you on this. Anyone seeking only "honorable" fights should roll on a PvE server and wait for BGs.
---
Yes I've notice you get diminished returns for more combo points stacked up, for BOTH S&amp;D and Eviscerate.  
---
Is the way to do it to get up the minimum amount of CP points and use these abilities?
---
What about crits?  Any other variables that come into play that dont make this worth it?
---
Good one, that is just as big a requirement as the one previously mentioned.  My opinion is, you wouldn’t be a rogue if theses two were not done or at least a classic one.
---
CoH2 flashbacks. Oh god.
---
I grouped up for the tusks, bought the charms and got help for the elite. Easy
---
I didn’t expect anything to happen to the guy. So it was rather unexpected. And after a putting up with a slew of rape “jokes” and other immature bullshit from him I really didn’t mind.  Definitely was a sorry (not sorry) thing for me. 
---
Blizz support is kinda like carry out store pizza: It’s usually ok but sometimes it’s freakin’ amazing.
---
Well if you live by the beach why not.
---
Im on rattlegore alliance too! Great community i love that realm.
---
I run Adblock but still always get YouTube adds not adds on the side though. It was a setting I changed once. 
---
Also I almost never run YouTube on my PC. Mainly phone so trust me they get theirs lol.
---
Pretty sure it's just so the time matches the time it would take to mail it.  Mail has a timer to build a sense of distance/process in the world rather than any other reason.

---
Are you really trying to justify camping people lower than you with "PVP SERVER HURF DURF"?
---
You get NOTHING for killing people right now, unless you kill somebody to get a farm spot for yourself.
---
Its not like people attack you because they seek a challenge, its always the rogue when you are at 20% life.
---
Take your retail shit with you back to BFA kids, just because you are on a PVP server doesn't mean you have to kill everyone that runs past you.
---
Yes it does make a difference. Google the weapon normalization formula. Higher top end damage still leads to higher  normalized damage, the formula just doesn't multiply by your speed.
---
If you just did the math and stopped making hand wavy arguments. You would see that Axe is noticeably better.
---
I would categorize that as a bodybuilder movement, not something genpop should worry about. I think if youre rowing enough, and doing a bit of curls you are fine. And the benefits of standing and engaging outweigh the possible increase load to the bicep.
---
We arent wrong! Just a matter of opinion and goals. I stand by "If you can stand up and do it, stand up"

Get over it babies, a pvp problem has a pvp solution.

You can force crits om yourself by standing up from a sitting position at the point of swing.

If you said all American players are retarded I'd tell you the same thing, get a fucking life who the fuck cares.
---
Can I find someone’s wow ID by their name? Trying to locate old friends.
---
It didn’t occur to me that finishing that quest could be the culprit but now that you mention it that lines up with my experience. 
---
I stayed in Feralas fishing for a bit after I caught the fish I needed. Once I returned, after completing the quest, I got nothing. Seems rather counterintuitive that getting max fishing would disable your ability to fish!
---
Thank you for answering, this is starting to make a bit more sense.
---
Nice song, nice video. i love to see this kind of videos. Even better when it’s horde killing.
---
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
True. But I'll say that one leg of the tank-heal-dps stool has to be solid.
---
If tank+heals is sub-par, you need the dps group will check their aggro and CC more
---
If heals+dps is sub-par, you need a good tank to mitigate damage and keep threat
---
If tank+dps is sub-par, you need a good healer with a strong mana pool or regen to keep them going
---
Yeah its especially noticable at higher levels, hopping zones is common. I usually save those orange quests for later and tackle another level appropriate zone quests. Ive only done at most 5 dungeons and ive been fine to lvl 59.
---
They can still whack the mob for continued dps as their mana regens. Don’t underestimate staff damage. Literally zero downtime.
---
I just tanked the first two SM dungeons last night as lvl 30 using a two hander for 99% of the dungeons.
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
I was thinking it might be worth it if you get adds and want to burn them rather than reset.
---
Don’t play pvp then
---
I think you can speed up travel times without trivializing the feelnof the world and losing a connection to it. I do think making mounts much cheaper and acceptable at lower levels was a fine decision. 
---
The biggest mistake the made in this regard, not counting the cords server nonsense and turning everything into an instance, was adding flying into the game. You are no longer a part of the world when you can just fly over it.
---
They had character transfers in vanilla, was added in 2006
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Transfer
---
Again, not my screenshot and I haven't personally tested it. The implication here is that something temporarily pushed it off. I also don't think you see the aura fade like this when you unequip the item.
---
Yep. Was fighting murlocs in Dustwallow on my troll priest, a dwarf hunter comes along, pauses a second, then tries to muscle in and start killing them too.
---
Killed him once, then a second time just to drive the point home.
---
Maybe, but sometimes they do actually leave and you have the area to yourself. It's happened to me plenty of times recently. You only seem to be seeing the negative possibilities. To me, part of the entertainment of playing on a PvP server comes from seeing how people react to being put in this situation. Are they going to fight to contest the area or just leave? Are they going to bring friends and we can have a battle? It's all part of the game.
---
No, I use a laptop.  My wife, who also uses and laptop and is obviously on the same connection, has never had the issue.
---
Blacklist them and never run with them again.
---
They did you a favour, much better to find out in ZF than in an MC or Ony pug.
---
Yeah, the AC at the top stands for Alliance Crybaby, 99% sure
---
What up? We're a bunch of cool guys who are looking for other cool guys who want to hang out in our party guild. Nothing sexual.
---
Do poisons work on elementals?
---
No. They shouldn't change anything in game. Faction specific queues are all that is needed. That way a friend group can decide to transfer off the majorly imbalanced if they get sick of the queue.
---
Name 3. Bet you can’t.
---
&gt;Why? I'd do it if there was a reason to.
---
Farming salt is a great reason. Do you see this whole post? Its a fucking gold mine.
---
Also it provokes fights sometimes.
---
Loving it myself. The 5% damage on my pets helps me while leveling and the 25% stun resist is just so good for locks I think considering that stuns are our major weak point :D 
---
(I play to mainly PvP at 60 hence why I chose Orc)
---
I have a lot of information from vanilla days and recent times. I try to post it from time to time here, but it gets downvoted and no one even takes the time to read it. 
---
I just made [this post about prot pally data](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5no80/why_protection_paladin_cant_main_tank_end_game/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to help explain how prot paladins work on a technical level and what they are best for. You can see no one is taking it seriously and is blindly downvoting it thinking its a "prot pallys suxxxx lollzzz" thread
---
I still don’t blame her for that. If you got the power you might as well use it...

I know those two locations aren't really each other, but now I picture the Utah/Wyoming boarder to be exactly like Mulgore/Barrens

Looks like a moment's before disaster video.

Yeah that’s pretty retarded
---
Bagnon and AdiBags.
---
Thank you so much
---
I was one of the people complaining. I am sorry for the part I played in this - I didn’t know at the time what it would do to the rest of the game.
---
Ahh, whining about other people whining.
---
I love the internet.
---
Not a sir, not my basement~
---
You are fundamentally misunderstanding reddit.
---
Amen
---
this isn't true, this patch came out 8-22-06 which was 21 months after vanilla launched in november 2004 and by this point in time, every single class had been totally reworked, all gear had been buffed (more stats, stat budget for all gear was increased by about 15-25%) and all pre-naxx raid content was about 25-40% easier than when it came out, naxx saw around a 10-15% nerf since a lot of classes had already been reworked when it came out but the gear buff helped (10 guilds cleared naxx before 1.12 came out, 120ish cleared it in vanilla after this patch)
---
the patch classic is using is not a true vanilla experience at all. dps is higher, hps is higher, threat is higher for everyone so it's about the same (after they fixed demo shout which wasn't a vanilla bug), sustain is a lot higher, bosses can be debuffed TWICE as much, latency is lower, servers are far more stable and everything is known already (you didn't know this shit until you tried it in vanilla, there were no guides unless you were months late)
---
it's tuned how they wanted it to be tuned but this was vanilla's "alright you shitty players, now you can clear a few raids" patch
---
every expansion has gotten a "player power buff/nerf to PVE content" and this was the first one
---
TBF I haven’t played since WOD.
---
Instant disappointment when you try to go through the portals but they don't go anywhere because those cities don't exist.
---
It gets better at 30-ish, theres always 24/7 SM parties going around.
---
Truth fact lol my guiding principle was if you're doing something, it's better than nothing, and it's all a sliding scale.  If every WoW player stood and got water once an hour, that alone would probably have meaningful health impact.
---
Alls we're sayin' is nomasayin, nomasayin?
---
Yup!  I rolled on PVP because even if some ding dong alliance keeps me from doing my quest i know that was my choice and part of the deal if i want world PVP.  Its literally what i signed up for.  
---
Besides, i know i will be that douche a few times too!
---
In game sticky notes. Great job!
---
You're probably right. I doubt blizzard would ever have the balls to do this, but I really think this would solve the problem in a week.
---
I dont know eather to cry or to laugh...
---
Or when the mage whispers, "How are you not finished?  I'm trying to farm here."
---
This was a 200iq play by Quche
---
There is no way to determine if classic is more popular than retail. In fact, based on server stats, BFA actually received a boost in players. At the end of the day the two games cater to two completely different groups of people with very little overlap. Expect nothing to change.
---
I mean it's an orc. Who can the difference.
---
Mana bar
---
No Taunt
---
That's all you need to say lol
---
Reroll
---
It's OK to lose aggro with mages especially if there are two. There's not much point in us waiting because we are going to pull aggro regardless. Just let us do our thing as it's much faster. Good mages will keep rotate freezes next to you anyway so even though we have aggro the mobs still swing at you and you won't lose that precious rage.
---
The rule is everyone rolls, and rogue unlocks it
---
Anyone who says differently is a greedy shit.
---
(If i wanted that chest so bas id just say my LP wasnt high enough and open it after the run)
---
Test it and report it if you find something. Until then this screenshot from apparently a bunch of anti-blizzard folks doesn't really mean much.
---
The contributors to this conversation have had conspicuously corresponding correspondence.

Lifting a sofa isn't that hard, but it takes multiple people to do it if it's large and unwieldy. If 4 people are tasked with lifting a large sofa, and it's clear that one person is faking it while the other 3 are doing all of the lifting, wouldn't you be a bit pissed as well?
---
I will steal every node possible. Quest item? Taken. Quest npc? Killed. Mining node? Mined
---
Fair man, and I appreciate you not jumping on the hate train I know is coming. 
---
Your last point resonates with me the most. Guarantee I'd get along swell with a ton of players on the opposing faction. Won't stop our personal war though ;)
---
The argument we make for why killing lowbies or quest givers is ok is a simple one of supply line disruption. We usually hit a zone hard and fast enough to fuck up a lot of levelling, bring in the 50s, and then crash into another zone. Keep the horde dancing, on their toes, yelling in /world about us. All in the name of the game. You said "are we at war?" Well if we weren't before, we are now... At least on kromkrush lol. 
---
And we do have some small form of honor. When horde see our guild they've learned it's a fight no matter what. We don't bait by /waving and leading people around and shit. It's kill on sight. We don't camp. We rarely kill someone twice, actually, because we usually hit an area and bail immediately, or only stay long enough to spar with the 50s that show up (no idea why the 60s never do). We don't /spit and stuff. We usually /point or something so people know what's coming. When we were levelling, we'd attack ??s straight away, even in certain death. It's just expected of our guild.
---
[Formulas here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit). Figure out how much weapon skill you have from talents, racials, and equipment and plug it in. Remember to factor in if you're dual-wielding, as that adds 19% chance to miss.
---
So which is it Fatalstrik3x.
---
Are you for reporting fucked up names? Or against?
---
Your view is changing wildly.
---
And moral support
---
Because you are missing the flightpath in Thousand Needles/Feralas border.
---
Oh fuck yes
---
I wouldn’t get any agro cuz I could bubble. You’re bad chill
---
How big of a difference is there between BiS pieces and the tier set pieces? I'm a warrior wanting to do tanking and love the idea of working on an armor set that gets stronger as I get more pieces rather than getting individual BiS pieces. Is this going to really be a big handicap? What about when I'm raiding and working on tier 2? Does it become a big handicap at that point?
---
Ma'am we are going to need to have a look in your attic or...where ever you keep your women-pets
---
Dude read this thread? It is fucking hilarious how mad people are.
---
You're right, classes aren't overtuned, MC is *undertuned*, it's an objectively easy instance for the 40 guys it supports. Let's see how this pack of 20 guys does with Razorgore in a few months.
---
Furthermore...yeah, isn't it weird that some people turn to streamers for their game news?
---
and being prickly c***s while at it.
---
What was needed for real "feel" of the classic is something unknown. 
---
So ppl would stick together. 
---
Even tho I played both closed and open beta, I'd rush to help any world PVP situation and whatever else was needed.
---
Did quite a few runs there, isn't too bad as you will need the Southside flight path anyway. And it's only 10 mins from there.
---
Nice. Already made my first list thanks!!
---
My favorite memory from private servers was a 4 way kerfuffle over a black lotus.
---
&gt; Farming salt is a great reason. Do you see this whole post? Its a fucking gold mine.
---
You see what you're looking for. You're seeing salt because you want to. I'm just asking why, seeing if anyone can articulate. It can be a little annoying running for what 15-20 seconds to my body but other than that it doesn't bother me much. Just don't understand why someone would do it.
---
Run out of arguments, so you attack the opponent instead.  Genius.
---
I literally had to pull out my yellow legal pad to write down all my todos on the other night. I can use this addon.
---
It’s like the 14,327th OC iteration of the exact same thing...
---
I never understand people complaining about people substantially undercutting. If it's that much below market price, just buy it and relist high. This guy should be THANKING the seller for handing him 1.15g, if these are selling reliably for 1.5g.
---
There's a huge difference between whining and the faction ratio unbalance that some realms got, it's ok to get ganked by a party of 3 and die, it stops being ok when everywhere you go to quest there is 10+ enemies and just you on your faction.
---
I actually feel bad for everyone on this situation, I really like wpvp, fighting some skirmish fight on unusual places and helping your friends survive a gank
---
Is that for real? But there's still realms that are full...
---
Person doesnt agree with my logic, therefore he is a fork knife kid. - quche
---
Dps meters certainly are not something I care about much (other than competing for first as a mini game that I keep to myself) but it is a good way to gauge dead weight when you are looking to farm an instance efficiently. It is also a good way for players to challenge themselves to get better at the end of the day.
---
2 options for me 
---
1 Shadow priest so i could literally melt the face of morons i work with.
---
2 Mage for the same food water and ports
---
Absolutely
---
Alliance here... don't think there is a flight path.
---
+ hearthstone
---
Again, there was no theft.  He gave us access to the account.  You are stuck on your own moral mentality.  You're mixing physical world with virtual still.
---
Good vs. bad is a slippery slope and you've slipped.
---
That’s leveling as a warrior for you.
---
&gt; It is fucking hilarious how mad people are.
---
I haven't seen anyone mad. I think you're seeing what you want to see.
---
There's difference between griefing "casually" for chuckles (which it sounds like you do) and griefing for hours at a time against a lowbie(s).  The latter is basically bullying behavior that's mostly legitimized by being in a video game.  And a big reason bullies tend to do what they do is because they need to feel powerful or in control in some aspect of their life because they don't have it in others.
---
No one's saying it's not fun, or can't be fun to the bully.  The issue is that what he/she perceives as  "fun" in this case is really just a perversely cathartic experience.
---
TL;DR: hurt people hurt people.
---
Oh for sure, it's commercial as fuck. Its actually pretty ironic, because the song is pretty much about how people who want to make money off something that's beautiful will strip it of all its charm so that the greatest number of people will buy it, which is kinda what happened, lol.
---
Lol your whole argument is that warriors should be able to tank in any spec?
---
What kind of logic is that?
---
Like I said they didn't remove class identity. They just flushed out the DPS specs more and made them competitive so you could choose more identity within the class based on what you like to play. 
---
You're basically saying "I want to DPS and Tank and I shouldnt have to make any significant choice one way or another" 
---
In what world does that make for a good RPG if you didn't have to make meaningful choices that have certain strengths and weaknesses?
---
Well I haven’t seen them and I thought of this today at work.. I’m sorry :sad face:
---
Good to know!  I was thinking of doing this
---
Tuon vedet.
---
No my answer would be "They just can't" I don't need to know how everything works all I need to know is the outcome.

Your comments are an absolute waste of time. Paladin has prot spec and mage doesn't. Stop with your joke logic. I explained why paladins cant mt on a technical level. You dont like it, scroll past. Dont waste your own time posting uselsss comments
---
Rogue is one of the hardest classes to get a dungeon group with, because as you have noticed, class identity is essentially "looking out for number one".
---
The only group utility you provide is interrupts (unimportant in leveling dungeons), sap CC versus humanoids, and opening locked stuff.
---
My first toon was a Rogue and I'm pretty shellshocked from not being wanted in groups, now I only play classes that can heal or tank.

I don't think people ignore it because its painful they might straight up not know or care...

Bro ur like level 12 go enjoy the beach.

Lol I’m not actually a new player - I played retail from WotLK upto MoP, we just had maps in retail! Made it an easier navigation experience. Plus it’s been so long, my brain didn’t retain that info!
---
I'm not hand waving anything. I did examine it when I did the warrior quest, and I did take the axe, of course. There is a difference, but it's not huge. You're talking about 25 points of dmg difference at 400-500 AP, or less than 5% difference in average damage. The axe is best, I agree, but if youre a human and take the sword, you're not gimping yourself.
---
Shaman are great raiders, but they're a support class, and retail wisdom has all but crushed the idea of support characters. We will never top DPS meters, and we're really not even the best healers, but we're great at making the group better at everything they do.
---
That doesn't really get to shine in 5-mans, but a raid will defintely see the benefit of a Shaman dropping the right totems at the right place and time.
---
Plus, we're right up there with Druids for single-class utility. Healer goes down? No prob. I can stop DPSing and start slingin' chain heals, and then rez everybody after the fact. Tank having trouble? Hey, I've got a shield and a few points in damage reduction, I've got a stoneclaw totem that can help spread out some of those adds. Have a Stoneskin while you're at it. Is this group running great? Awesome, I'ma go HAM on DPS. I might need a drink in a minute, but this mob is about to be fuckin' deleted.

Apes split their two raids into 4 different 20 man onys last week. It has always been this easy. It can be done with less and it can be done with 40 priests too

Yeti Hides in Feralas. I had 2 when I started counting after 30+ kills, ended up with well over 120 total kills. Not terrible xp but took 40 minutes.
---
Well good to get that type of person out of your guild early!   People with those kind of attitudes are a drain on guild morale.
---
I was healing WC and it seemed like the dungeon was pretty hard, tank died once or twice, and I'm questioning my healing abilities/"am I too low level?" and then the tank "DC'd."  
---
We decided to keep clearing while searching for a replacement, and wow, the dungeon got a lot easier without the tank!  Once we got a replacement tank the whole dungeon was EZ mode. Amazing what waiting for mana and not breaking someone's crowd control can do!
---
On a related note, I wish there was a "shitty player" list in addition to Friends &amp; Ignore list.  I don't want to ignore a person for something they may grow out of, I just want to be cautious if I group with them again.  Right now they go on my Friends List w/ a note explaining the details.

Tried fishing in the cave. It told me there is no fish.

Your ignorance and hatred is astounding. You know why trans people kill themselves? People like you. Reevaluate your life and try meeting some trans people.

Thanks OP. I play a Horde Warrior, but Pally tanked from WOTLK through until the end of Cata. Completely different play style in every regard, but I’ve maintained interest in Pally tanking and this helps create an understanding of their role in Classic and what needs to be considered technically to do it successfully. It may be something I try in the future, so I’m saving this post.
---
Looking at the comments in this thread, your frustration is justifiable. Apparently this subreddit is more for WoW Classic memes than it is information. The people ITT are acting like a bunch of children.
---
As a Horde, I'll take it as a compliment.
---
Mage looking for an alt what do you recomend?
---
I like to audibly tell them in chat "that was a real dick move."

It doesn't do anything but let him know that I know he did a scum bag thing, but boy it feels good.

How you gonna fight back when you are a warrior and getting attacked by skull alliances? Sing for them? Get caught up by their mounts?
---
I don't know how much data they save and for how long as a game of this scale must generate shit tons of logs but i believe they can deploy Deep Learning and AI to automatically detect anomalies in behavior of any type.
---
Is that something they do ... I dono but I'm 100% sure they can detect anything if they wanted to do it.
---
People need conflict and drama and boldness. When a game has been designed to be easier and more friendly for over 15 years, you lose those things.
---
Why didn't it work? I can help you! Did you try typing \`/todo tg\` on chat ?
---
That's crazy man, im only level 31 so maybe it hasn't hit me but I hardly drink in dungeons, priest with 180 spirit though, so maybe not the same.

And handing out orange slices after the boss is dead.

That thing I'm not doing?

Both so much at the same time

Today i saw the 60 hunt that killed me 2 days ago when i was questing, he was at low life and without a pet.

You can bet i killed him :)

Do I? Or did you just miss the reference and decide to make yet another assumption and attack me personally yet again?

---
How they are meant to work: enemy players of a similar level in the same zone you're in being a threat you may have to deal with. How they actually work: people with micro penises feeling good about their leet pvp skills by killing defenseless players 20 levels below their own.

You create a db in the add on’s folder usually. I sometimes see add ons with the config/db stuff in it’s own folder, so it it loads as a separate add on.

You're trying to farm in one of the most densely populated questing spots in Tanaris and complaining that you don't get 100% of the mobs there?

---
everyone just throws that statement around without knowing why. They say because it has no taunt which is false. I wanted to give it a chance to share some useful knowledge ive had on hand for a while. Not gonna happen again i can assure you. Obviously this sub is full of children who are not even remotely intetested in the game but just blindly following the next trend
---
I killed someone at the end of the Tooga escort in Tanaris and felt bad about it.
---
100% recommend it I hope you enjoy it
---
I’m not sure what the AH has to do with anything, most of the best leveling gear comes from quests or dungeons. The 2 level 46s carried that entire instance. The fact that you did it with 2 worthless DPS says as much. I’ve done uldaman with lower levels. That last fight is extremely difficult for people in the 42-43 level range.

Is there a macro to open trade on mouse over?

I don't get the bitching about undercutting.
---
Do people honestly expect prices to stay the same? There's literally nothing you can do about people selling for way less than you than eat the cost and buy it to resell. 
---
Most of the time people are just trying to quick sell for pocket change and aren't looking to play the long game. You have to adjust to quick sellers if you want to make big bucks, otherwise bitching directly at them will do precisely jack shit.
---
How do people talking in voice chat have anything to do with the action they actually took, which was to not reclear until blizzard told them to go ahead? I never said I don't care about streamers either, I enjoy watching youtube or twitch while I play. Not that it matters, go ahead and keep making up stories for internet points by telling lies about people a subreddit hates. I just hope the mental gymnastics aren't too tiring for you.

You have Karma, I have Sod's Law. "Oh hey, bought your last 6 slot bag? Here, have a 6 slot bag as a drop", etc.

I do like helping others though. Especially if I know the place can be hard... I remember spending so much time helping at Skull Rock, as Warriors &amp; Rogues kept entering as I just finished with the last group, and I could heal them. Helped them grab the quest from the level 14 mob, too.
---
I didn't get the reference :'(

You’re right. I misremembered. I thought it was a reduction of X per hit, not attack power.

---
Im the lunatic that keeps a naughty and nice list of people to pay back later...good things to those that were awesome (even as simple as buffing me) and horrible things coming to those that did me wrong.
---
Sure sure, totally agree. Using it in a real PvP situation makes sense but the whole point of duels is to sharpen your class vs class toolset. Someone could probably argue that is part of it but I see it as more of an anomaly and waste of a pot lol.
---
As far as i can tell, magic damage doesn't break fear but physical damage does. Then there's always the chance it breaks before the full duration but that's hit or miss.
---
The servers are too populated in leveling zones, even with layering. I leveled on a alliance dominated server as horde in vanilla, and whilst I did get ganked often, I rarely if ever felt I couldn't complete a quest due to alliance.
---
Now I'm finding myself still fighting to tag mobs from other horde on some quests. This kind of population in low level zones didn't ever exist in vanilla.
---
This happens so often, it's crazy. If you see another mage of same faction why try to steal their farm they pulled first? This will only cause the issue of farming to become 100 times worse cause now you pissed another person off.
---
and thats why youre not quite as smart as other people. Its ok, just shut your mouth because you have nothing useful to say
---
Hunter is the least gear dependant class in the game while leveling, by a wide margin. Your stats don't affect your pet at all, and your pet is a huge chunk of your damage, a majority even if you are BM spec.
---
Don't worry about dungeon drops, hunters get screwed yes but you are still more powerful than the warrior in all blues.
---
Passive.
---
If you log off for 30 minutes you might not get ganked for 5 hours.
---
people are in queue anyways, why not use it for something good for the server health?
---
Find a group that you can raid with, and talk with them about it once you get to the point of raiding.
---
Every class has specs/abilities that don't work well in raids. Most ranged dps classes are spamming one button(their most mana efficient spell).  It's just a different environment.
---
That being said, you picked druid for flexibility - that means you *will* get in to raids more often than non hybrids because you can fill in for the most in demand role - it's just that healing is nearly always the most in demand role.  You still have it better than the dps specific classes who can only get in raid when dps slots aren't full - You'll probably only get to go feral a couple of times out of ten...but as a mage you would have only been getting in to raids a few times anyway.  This way gives you more chances at loot - even if sometimes you'll be lower prio(when going for feral leather or caster cloth), other times you won't have any competition(because caster leather is very niche).
---
Aight, thanks.
---
Pretty sure not, but I could always be wrong
---
1) Make friends with people during quests/instances, most players are usually in guilds and by interacting with them you can get a good feel for how their guild works, just reach out and ask for an invite.  
---
2) Check out the spam in most general channels, lots of guilds advertise and include their goals (e.g. raiding, leveling, PvP etc), it's a bit of a stab in the dark, but sometimes you can find good groups  
---
3) Find out what you're interested in, then search up guilds that cater to that. Typically the Blizzard forums will have people advertising their guilds and you can search around to see what you want in a guild then ask for membership. 
---
Finally, don't be afraid to join a guild, spend a bit of time getting to know people, and then leaving if it's not right for you.
---
Yup, fair move there honestly. Well played.
---
End game wpvp will be fun. Try to quest in a group in stv. It's called stvietnam. It's like that on every pvp server.
---
Every pvp server is also horde dominant so you can't really run away from it other than playing on a pve server.
---
Adapt and overcome. You got this
---
&gt; I figure there is no reason to camp a low-level player for 5 hours except to build a reputation.
---
Counter, I feel there's one solid good reason - they did it first.
---
Found an Alliance mage, level 42, who had been corpse camping level 35-37 Horde players in Thousand Needles. Multiple people were complaining about him in general chat, and I saw him chain-sheep a player just to fuck with them.
---
I camped his corpse as long as I could. I killed him every time I could, from the north part of the Salt Flats through to Tanaris, and when he left town in Tanaris I killed him again until he got an invite to layer swap.
---
It may not be justice, but vengeance-by-proxy is just as good.
---
Resto is the most common raid spec for druids, and they only really shine on the healing meters during progression or during hard content.  When people are facerolling thru easy raids whoring the meters, the other healers can “steal” healing from druids making them look weak on the healing meters by comparison.
---
This really looks like doing chores, but it depends on how you use. If I didn't have it I'd just forget everything every time. You don't write everything you have to do, only what you want to remember :)
---
US Eastern player looking for someone who can play around 11pm til 2-3 am or 7-8 am til 12:30pm. I also play all day on weekends.
---
I don't mind re rolling as long as its a pvp or rppvp server. I have a few 20s on skeram horde, and a 25 ally on grob.
---
You're both jerks.
---
I used to farm the Swamp Cougars for their whiskers back in the day, tons of gold, now 1 in every 12-15 drop loot, dunno if they nerfed it or it's bugged or what.
---
how is beastslayer enchant bis ? I guess its very good while leveling considering there is so many beasts ?
---
I don't think the OP is expecting anything.
---
Anybody is free to take the mobs and OP is free to punish them for it. As much as they can, at least.
---
In my own experience, giving people a inch seems to make them think they can take a mile.
---
That's different, people have definitely used those for a long time too though. I'm talking 100% completely unattended automation. No human control at all. Turn it on and it goes.
---
Youve commented on the same thread several times get a life. This is my post and im gonna defend my opinion against you idiots
---
In that case you don’t fight back, you accept your fate. If you are really going to complain about it, why didn’t you play on a pve server?
---
There is, it's right on the border of feralas and thousand needle
---
Oh thanks! I gave up and just installed Shadow Unit Frames.
---
Less than 5% is alot more than less than 1% from weapon skill. 5% is alot.
---
Like, my point was never that weapon skill was useless, it's just that the axe is still better. You saying that "Weapon normalization means the speed makes no difference" is just wrong. It makes a far larger difference than weapon skill.
---
Taking WW sword is unoptimal. Maybe you arent "gimped" but its not a good idea.
---
I ran into a similar-level horde mage while doing a Pally quest just outside Blackfathom. We stared at each other before I inched away, and started attacking a mob while keeping him in sight. He started attacking the mob, and I ended up tanking for him through the cavern.
---
Nothing in my post stated that i want to dodge queues, just that i think they could be used to further imporove server health by allowing somewhat fair pvp where it isnt 10v5
---

Either I have good luck or I'm distracted enough by my movies/shows I dont realize how much time passes while I do those types of quests lol

This is my leveling spec:  https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033250213025100031-55000131005
---
A lot of people will probably criticize the lack of 2h Weapon Spec for 5% more damage, but really I don't think it's worth it.  I'm currently level 55, and MS crits with a Gatorbite Axe hit for ~550.  5% of that is less than 30 damage  --  not going to make or break my fight against a mob.  Improved Hamstring, on the other hand, has saved my life more than once.  To say nothing of the fact that I'm on a PvP server.
---
Bandage them, that'll show em!

Imagine thinking that OC should be made selflessly and uncredited.

wowhead has plenty of guides

my guild circa 2010 was mostly housewives and retired military.  With Zoomers mostly not interested in games like WoW, I can only imagine what the median age is.

I dont play Rogue, but im sure this can be applicable to you guys somehow.

`#showtooltip`

`--/use [nostance] !Shadowform`
---
`/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][] Power Word: Shield(Rank 8)`
---
`/cast [nomounted, nocombat]White Ram`
---
`/dismount [mounted]`  
---
Im a healer rn, so the Shadowform is 'commented' out. But id assume is still valid for any class with a stance type.  
---
You can couple a instant cast on the GCD, a stance change, and mount all in one.  
---
So this macro will ensure that you're in shadowform, Cast bubble on MO-Target, or self, Mounts if eligible.  
---
Unfortunately the dismount, and the shield doesnt work together. IDK why.
---
The thing is, level 40s constantly ganking level 12s shows absolutely no skill, it takes no effort, it is literally somebody who has no intent other than being an asshole. 
---
Now that the layers are getting reduced, I would argue things are much more "Fair" but it was pretty bullshit for a little while when you had people swarming (on both factions) into territories that they were 10-15 levels higher than with the SOLE purpose of disrupting questing zones for HOURS. 
---
When I run up next to an alliance that's 20 levels below me I know I can 1shot them, but why would I? That's not fun. There's no effort in that.
---
In what fucking way is this related to classic WoW.
---
Post this shot on your social media account, not Reddit.
---
I did press "2" less, but it will still happen without even hitting a key.
---
why is your name blue in tanaris
---
How am I supposed to afford a mount if I buy both holy, disc, and shadow spells while leveling enchanting?
---
That's not the worst of it. Much worse is that this time round, nobody cares to help. Back in Vanilla we would start a small war over such a thing. I was getting quest items for Whirlwind axe  (Warrior Class quest) with another lvl 30, and 2 lvl 60 kept ganking us (and the 40 something hunter who've been helping us). 
---
When I asked for help in  Local Defense (did /who 60 arathi found 5-6 ppl) they told us to git good and ultimatively one lvl 60 said "It's not my fight"... 
---
If they just ignored calls for help I'd be fine with it. But "not my fight" made me ashamed of horde first time (not counting Belves)
---

Hahhah oops! Sorry. I meant mane*
---
There's no such thing. You kill what the tank wants to get killed. End of story. As a tank I dont care if you think your kill priority is better than mine. Strat living side is a good example here.
---
As a Paladin tank, I will mark the Inquisitors with Mana burn to get killed before the Battlemages. It overall leads to a smoother run. Yet DPS focus the Battlemages, and leaving me out of mana to deal with anything else that might happen.
---
Just kill the skull even if you disagree, or take it up with the tank. No dungeon is dangerous that a bad mark will wipe you. But every DPS doing their own thing might.

It's from a quest where you tame kodos.

Blizz introduced the functionality as a hidden toggle a while ago and someone built the AddOn to make it configurable, then everyone forgot about it and the AddOn didn't get any updates but for classic dernPerkins over at Github decided to give it a shot and here we are! Thanks blizz for not disabling it :)
---
dude i thought that was just me this whole time!
---
I hate getting ganked.
---
But it's so much more fun at the same time, because everything is so much more tense. Your not just zoning out and questing, you have to actively looking out, because God knows what could happen. 
---
I also think it sharpens your skills, I wouldn't suggest pve servers unless your just absolutely sure, because the PvP aspect really does a lot to enhance the experience IMHO.
---
Why downvote me? I upvoted you......
---
Sad face.
---
I have autism and this is awkward even to me
---
I really like the game, but I'm also not looking for the need to grind every day. Can you be able to play battlegrounds and be succesfull without having to grind for like 4 hours every day? Is there a a way to play the game more casually and still be able to perform well in PVP?
---
Nice try, but no cigar!
---
What I am saying is; killing low level players is unproductive for both parties. However, fighting players your level is productive and you would learn something new from each fight. Unless, you can’t fight players your own level due to a lack of skill and gear.
---
I figured. There are a huge number of of posts like this, not just you. I just dont think its helpful to spread misinformation. Don't like the game? Fine. Great. Strong opinion about a game you have never played? Why? BFA has issues but diversity has nothing to do with the number of points you have to put in a tree. Improves the leveling experience a lot though.
---
That's nice to know. I rolled a warrior and specced arms but been shying away from dungeons as i havent tanked since the game first came out.
---
On man :(
---
&gt;At that point it's easier and quicker to just go ahead and do what's most effective and hope the others catch on.
---
Which is what the tank decide. End of story. The tank is the leader of the group and you better do what the tank says.
---
You pull it, you tank it.
---
I don't get involved at all unless the healer pulls threat.
---
Good point. Personally, I enjoy freedom to be a psycho-maniac. Sometimes I can help an ally do a quest, sometimes I camp him for an hour, who knows.
---
I'm glad that it'll help you :)

omg thats sexist smh

Thank you!!

Heh. I'm neither that desperate nor rich :---D

danm why would people want to do things faster when they only have a certain amount of free time ? If you only have a few hours a week why would you not maximize that time? There are still plenty of groups willing to take off meta or slower groups, you can always make your own group as well.

That's one thing, I personally enjoy pvp and not griefing, but at least your consistent. What I hate is the guys who will run past you when you are 100% hp and not fighting, but attack you ass soon as a friend shows up or you're on a mob.
---
Hi there, still looking?
---
If you spec for Consecration and everyone plays knowing you have no hard taunt it's doable. We made the best of it and she did the best she could. We also have 2 level 23 DPS (she started 17 and dinged 18 by the end of the dungeon). She did the best she could and we all patted her on the back for having a rough job that she made the best out of.
---
Also interested!
---
Its still damage based, but its from each source, so since each dot does so low damage each tic, it almost never breaks from just dots + wand! thats why its so powerful.
---
Yeah, the ‘lean in to it’ troll is low effort/max yield.
---
Early ranks, absolutely. You can get up to decently high ranking without needing to grind every single day for hours a day.
---
But if you want to push past rank 9 or 10 (depending on the server) you may need to grind. And the higher the rank the more time investment is required.
---
Remind me of a NE hunter I fought at IC over a titanuim node at the end he freezed me with his trap and took the node xD

Well this is one half of him. The other one is in an orcish gladiator arena and forced to fight in constant live and death battles.

Because you killed them so hard the eyes were destroyed
---
Do you know is there a reset timer?
---
Group up.
---
This. Fire Nova totem.
---
Previously it worked the opposite way, but I thought it was a pain to add more than one item, will add a way of toggling this on or off
---
100-150 depending on server
---
One hit one aoe hit is all you need.
---
2 times with the ddos the server rolled back \~ 5 mins.
---
I know this because both times it happened I had just reorganized / cleaned out my bank and got to do it again...
---
Great question. *Sigh*
---
It's much better than what you guys have but not great.
---
This is what I said, lol
---
Tiny tooltip
---
For reals... I did some hinterlands quests a few days ago... there were 4 mob types on the kill list, needed 15 of each. 
---
When I got there, there were 4 other people fighting for mobs, with not a single mob in sight. So instead of fighting for 60 freakin mobs, I invite them all, 3 of the 4 accept. 
---
By the time the 4 of us are done, the solo player got 7 more kills...
---
At a higher level, I like to sweep though lower-level contested zones and help out any faction-mates getting ganked.  I generally will leave lower-level opposition alone aside from the occasional sheep- or sap-and-go.
---
When the hell did I complain about pvp? Do you even realize what happened in this video?
---
&gt; People love to level alts and experience the game from a different perspective.
---
Back in the day this was not true, and it's one of the reasons things turned out the way they did. "Everybody" used to hate leveling and just wanted to be the cool powerful max level character.
---
You can. They are RED to you so you CAN attack them.
---
See but everyone has this mentality and on pvp servers the balance is always in favor of the horde. It took me 45 minutes to kill 4 tigers last night in Stv, so I gave up and put a group together for RFK in barrens but there was 30 horde camping the entrance and body camping us so we inched towards the entrance. Took about an hour to get everyone in. I'll admit I didn't know exactly what I was signing up for on a pvp server and I'll probably be transferring soon but the fights are never fair and even when the horde out level you a little they come in large numbers so you have no chance
---
Or you can go hybrid as I am building my shammy. 15  points in enhancement to boost my melee attacks for questing and dungeon DPS and the rest for the resto tree. 
---
In addition, I'm also leveling my druid with a feral/resto build, excellent for leveling, wPvP and dungeons.
---
100%
---
I'm a Paladin and I've tanked for several dungeons despite not having a single point in Protection. I've also filled dps and holy spots.
---
That's the benefit of being a hybrid.
---
or just tell them how to make a 
---
/cast Pick Pocket  
---
/cast Ambush 
---
macro
---
Stop with the personal experience ,then treat it like its facts. It simply is NOT. STV will always be horde dominated, they have a main hub in the middle, this is the exact same complaint I see on my server which is showing "60/40" in favor of alliance yet its the end of the world because horde are dicks. it simply isn't true and people hive mind what they want to believe to make them feel better. or justify the outrage
---
I went through STV, on the weekend and had minimal issues, I did see lots but if they were solo they stayed away. Come back at 37 and 38 when you SHOULD be there and it will be vastly different.
---
Got a message that states additional drivers are needed to stream. Time to do some investigating
---
He is even using his laptop for the mouse because the cat is too fat 😂🤔
---
Depends of how many hours are you gonna play everyday.I think you'll need to play like 10 hours a day.
---
Looks like you participated as a victim.
---
Dude the guy in his underwear jumping off the bridge LOL
---
I remember 26 manning Ony in the ZG patch way back when. The 1.12 patch just makes it easier.
---
Shadow priest,  usually i try to mind control them into the giant wave of aoe they're tryna clear
---
When i take this flight, i actually have time to take a lunch break
---
Not something most people do
---
Ironic you named content that took multiple expansions as your favorite while maligning the need for expansions, and then a feature that is functionally similar to the much-hated layering as a cool effect.
---
also the main thing people make fun of in the "Maam" situation is the huge freakout and overreaction to what seems to be an honest mistake. To me at least it's the same thing as the short guy freaking out in the bagel shop.
---
I’m on a Pvp server and it is equal.
---
Dual wield fury does not suffer from this while leveling, you may miss more than a 2h, but I just run mob to mob getting through10-15 before needing to bandage
---
Well if yourbto give up over getting killed you rolled wrong type of server
---
Love it. To be fair, didn't really need too much editing :D
---
Can you explain to me what is happening? I see you trying to go in, and being feared and killed, but what's inside? What recipe? What friend? Sorry new to wow classic.
---
I would love it if this concept became popular. This kinda shit happening are amongst my best memories in this game. 
---
It might have more success as a discord server maybe though, although more limited with the logistic
---
Lol we’ve all been there man
---
Oh you right I’m dumb lol
---
Oh, this is cute! I actually have a wunderlist of my to do tasks, but having it in game would be easier. Does this save the list between sessions?
---
Can you give me some estimations what these pets are usually gonna go for? I wanna buy a few and save them to make them pay for my 1000g mount later :D
---
God you are too thick brained. My point was that giving players the option to transfer to servers that are more active, rather than completely new ones, may entice people to actually take the transfer. 
---
I didnt transfer because it means ill be on a dead server for a month.
---
Ohhh Lord He coming
---
What else are you realistically supposed to do though? It can take a long time to find a group. I’ve been that priest and felt bad but it could take even longer for me to hearth and buy water and come back unless we have a warlock.
---
No breaks on the demon bus!
---
It's called pathing. Learn about it + zoning to avoid these issues. Just blink into the house you noob.
---
I don’t mean literally on top of them. Just close enough by that they can save me, and I can save them. I try not to be too close because of things like spreading diseases, etc.
---
how is that worse? you didn't get to the instance in time.
---
I dont remember exactly how I worded it, but on the healing dagger I made some vague comment about not needing items you don't need and the lock called out the priest about needing a dagger that only provided +healing.... so that is when we are like... well we don't want him here to ruin our chance at cookies wand, but we also arent sure if we kick him if it will actually take him out of the instance, and we didn't want him tagging cookie.
---
You can join Channels while questing and keep an eye out for a group.  No need to stop one to do the other.  
---
Can try the "World" channel too.
---
Greater good of what in this case? The enemy? It is 'For the (H/A)!' Not 'For the (H/A) sometimes when I feel like it' ya know.
---
Right? At level 21 you've got all of 12 points invested. Congrats, at that level as a warrior, Arms or Fury are BETTER tanks because their first talents give more damage (more threat), which is the hardest part of tanking Wailing Caverns or Deadmines.
---
Prot doesn't get much to help with threat until that third row of talents and beyond.
---
Lol, I'm not even angry. You're reading into something and assuming another. 
---
I don't disagree that it's certainly one way to achieve something, but it's like buying Instagram followers, these people don't give a shit about what you're building. They'll just latch on to whatever. 
---
Also, LPT: don't tell people how to feel, it's a dick thing to do.
---
What's your guild, I want to make sure I don't join it.
---
Terrain can be  used in almost every neutral town to avoid guards. You either have to kill them or avoid them. That's just how it is.
---
Whoaaa didn't know he existed before BfA. Quite the glow-up. (I don't trust him one bit, can't wait to betray him and Sylvanas).
---
Fuck off asshole
---
Blizzard says trans rights
---
I love the wands in classic and their schools of magic. If you look closely, each one uses a scaled down graphic of an actual spell.
---
Nature is a little lightning bolt.
---
Shadow is shadow bolt.
---
Frost frostbolt.
---
Arcane is a tiny arcane missle.
---
Fire is a smol fireball.
---
Yeah, and sometimes you get denied because youre not a tank. Or because they have too many leather wearers. Or because they want magic damage. Or because they want someome to off heal. Or because they think youre too low level.
---
Its a drop in the bucket of denies, honestly.
---
All bars won't, just the main bar unfortunately. 
---
If you are needing more than the main bar, there are macros you can build for those.
---
The stances are: [stance:1] Dire Bear Form; [stance:2] Aquatic Form; [stance:3] Cat Form; [stance:4] Travel Form.
---
So for example if you wanted to cast regrowth in caster, and maul in bear, claw in cat:
---
(Someone please correct me, not at home so I can't actually test to confirm this works 100%)
---
/cast [nostance] Regrowth(Rank X)
---
/cast [stance:1] Maul
---
/cast [stance:3] Claw
---
The only time I get annoyed with ganking is when I'm doing an escort quest. Like c'mon man it's already a huge pain in the ass to do an escort quest.
---

Alex boys really hard up for content huh?
---
I play on a pvp sever how do you find this build in PVP and Dungeons
---
it looked pretty serious
---
Yesterday I was in STV doing the Kurzen quests. I went into the cave and ran into 2 guys, I asked if they wanted to group, they said nah we’re full (sure....). I go ahead alone and 2 mobs come at me (I’m a warrior so this is a no-no). They were right behind me and just stood and watched me die. They even typed “you got it” right before I died. 
---
I hope karma gets to them.
---
Mostly, Wpvp. I level as feral but if Im in a group that needs healing when we fight horde, im there. I queat in zones with dungeons tho, so im ready at all times to heal or tank.
---
Mid fight, as well. Lets say im fighting a sub lvl 40 fight against a neither a shaman nor hunter. I can escape if need be, stealth, switch gear with my macro, unstealth, slam heals, and either stick with the set or switch according to need. Generally, switch just before i attack so that the tons of spirit can do its magic while im in animal form
---
The recipe is the only way to skill up tailoring. This is Everlook in winterspring. Basically if you attack the enemy faction the guards will gain up on you like booty bay, ratchet or gadgetzan. This guy is abusing a bug to be able to kill people freely without the guards attacking him.
---
Keebler death squad assseeemmbblle!
---
Nah but you can grief people with fear if you do it properly, just mess up their pulls etc.
---
Report in game. You posted here to complain. What person with power to fix this is going to see it on Reddit?
---
Thats my entire point. You dont need the dps of the other people to win, and a competent healer can do great things. So why kick an under performing dps?
---
For those wondering, this is part of the Link's Sword quest chain.
---
I didnt know there was a flight path to Ratchett...

---
That's what I'm saying,  I'd rather heal a prot pally than a warrior any day after the shout nerf
---
...we dont need no stinking turtles...
---
Joined a Stockades group as a healer a few days ago. We consisted of a Paladin, a druid, and a warrior all on DPS.... and they were asking in chat for a tank :/  
---
I was about to leave when they found another warrior like 4 levels below everyone to tank T.T we ran it fine but like cmon...
---
(Same faction) if you are grinding your mining you will only ever get 1 skill-up, so if you have it done, be a bro and pass the node forward ;)
---
1: aoe threat is a struggle period. And if anything druids really shining moment is in 5 mans. I’d rather have a Druid tank baron runs than a warrior for instance.
---
2: restobear tanks 5 mans as well as full feral. It’s cat DPS (and pvp ability) that suffers as restobear since you don’t take improves shred or the cat crit talent etc. whether the spec works in raids is up to your raid comp. A bear is probably 3rd tank for when the raid needs it. For the many bosses that only need two does the guild need another DPS or another healer?
---
Curious as well. Really enjoying ElvUi now that I have played with it a bit.
---
Ill start grinding on a mages area when I see one trying to bogart an entire group of zones, I make sure you lose xp per hour, the salt is worth it.
---
This is why RP-PvP servers are the best servers. Much love from ZT.
---
yes you can tank 5 mans and off tank raids as prot paladin
---
Me thinks that EVERYONE got DC'd and you got in the back of the bus. 
---
otherwise get FUCKED for playing on an over capacity server.
---
That good OG shit. That was back when memes were still dreams
---
Absolute unit
---
The exp and the gold is better just running dungeons or its just more efficient since you don't have to compete and move around  for quests?
---
I've used both. Which ever weapon is an upgrade
---
That seems subjective. I rarely see people spamming lfg for spellcleave any more than any other group. Might just be my server, or the times i play at.
---
I think I have ran into like three druids total in classic so far.  I would be friend listing you just BECAUSE you are a druid.
---
Do nodes pull loot from the dungeon loot table?
---
Oh... no?
---
Gee I wonder why its different.
---
If you can’t understand why a chest =\= node, then I’m not sure what to tell you.
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
I'm thinking the numbers are off. I have like 5 aalts made Idont play. They count on the census.
---
I would imagine it's closer to 50 50. I see just as many large groups of ally as I do horde
---
WW is useless and definitely not worth the time it takes to get it.
---
Lol this is great
---
You do realize I didn’t path in order to capture this footage right? God some people are thick in the head...
---
What is an imp wand?
---
Admittedly not &lt; 2 seconds (I didn't factor in waiting for page loads :p) but ~4s is sufficiently fast. Could get faster if I was used to posting on reddit but oh well. Make sure to full screen. The chrome tool is called Vimium and the screenshot tool is Sharex. If I wanted I could also just have sharex upload directly to reddit which would take however long it takes to upload ~2s or 3s

---
Glad it's working!
---
I feel like at least 80% of my spells have macros on them as a druid, haha.
---
* All of my forms have this on them so I can swap from one form to another with one key.
---
* I have my travel form bound so that if I'm outside it casts Travel Form and if I'm swimming it casts Aquatic Form. So I only need one keybind for both forms.
---
* All of my human form spells (heals, buffs, cleanses) un-shapeshift me then cast.
---
* All my heals are bound to do mouseover &gt; friendly target &gt; self
---
* I've got my cat form dash bound on my human bar so I can immediately dash after shapeshifting
---
Life is so much easier when everything takes 1 click instead of 3 or 4 lol
---
I hope they step on lego.
---
Anytime is a good time to spill filthy Alliance blood. Keep up the good fight brother!
---
How do you know which server is the est timezone? I'm looking for a pve one without a huge queue, not sure yet horde/alliance.
---
Had this in thousand needles stumbling on so many mithril gold etc! While not being able to mine!So first thing i did is farm some more and now sitting on sweet sweet 20 mithril as lvl 30
---
If you have 4 stable people to run with, sure. If it is gonna be random group everytime, save yourself and others the pain.

---
I said I agree with that. You are the one who is telling people to switch servers
---
Lady Prestor is Onyxia. Follow the money.
---
Pre 40 I go disc heavy so my bubble never has downtime while soloing and my fort buff is stronk.
---
Wand spec is most important pre shadowform, everything else is gravy.
---
I just gave it a go, and it's not playing too well. Can't get both to work, even when disabling ElvUI minimap.
---
5/5 wand spec is better. You dont need much spirit that low level and the dps increase on wands is no joke.
---
So I always spec wands first then spirit tap
---
No idea. One server being full with a 5k queue is kinda of just that, it's not a good sign on a bad sign. It just shows that some people, against logic, want to wait to play this game, instead of not waiting.
---
Why would do the quest later? It will give just give less reward at lvl60 since you dont need the xp anymore..
---
known issue. icon is fixed after a reload or pressing the macro
---
Just like where is the turtle meat in south shore cooking quest.
---
You think you do but you don't.
---
Seriously, everything you listed was 'fixed' by Blizzard.  And everything that resulted from it was wholly unintentional but inevitable.
---
Portals and flying mounts made the world smaller and killed world pvp. 
---
No talents means true pigeonholes and no room for hybrid or unique specs.
---
Itemization was good but they went way too far with new stats for pvp and pve.  Gorging on stat increases with each expansion. 
---
The grind is more about working towards your rewards instead of being given purples and legendaries for minor efforts.  A world where a blue you worked your ass off for means more than epics that rain from the sky.
---
Layer. Group up. Quest in a different zone. Whatever you do, just don't be a little bitch. Do something instead of asking someone who is acting strictly within their means to stop, indirectly, to this one guy on the internet (me). That skull lvl horde isn't going anywhere, you're just one person in a sea of targets. Find a different ocean.
---
I don't think there really is a BiS pet, from what I understand pet damage was normalized so the only difference is attack rate
---
Well of course. But maintaining healthy motions while sitting is never a bad thing.
---
I take the time to judge people's UIs and shit like that when I see screen shots lol
---
Congrats on the 2 [saronite ore]
---
THIS IS EGREGIOUS
---
r/murderbysuicide
---
Nothing like druids and herbs in retail.
---
They can fly and not have to dismount and if a tauren justbbasivally instantly farm it. There is basically no hope against them.
---
It’s not shield block it’s cooldowns like last stand.
---
Druid armor more than beats shield block.
---
It was one of a lot of suggestions man. That’s your choice. They shouldn’t make game wide changes because you feel bad about the imbalance. Some people PREFER the imbalance.
---
This would definitely be handy as I've been dropping quests to pick up quests in the zone I'm currently in (because my quest log is full). Then I tell myself "I must remember to pick up this quest again later".   I can only imagine how many quests I've totally not gone back and completed, even though they would still be even level.
---
No it's me :)
---
blizzard just fucked up by having mega servers instead of the ~3000 player cap vanilla servers had. having 10k+ people online at once with a faction imbalance is way shittier than having a server with 200-3000 people online.

IMO just use whichever animal you like best. The Dps is negligible.
---
Lol dude, fuck off. You know god damned well you only made this post to karma whore. I know it makes you feel good about yourself to kill other players who are 20 levels below you...but it actually doesn't make you good at PvP.
---
I drove my fucking car into a lake because the computer told me to
---
I love running in and howl of terroring or just tab fearing
---
&gt;How do you cast the spells? I put direct mouse input but I cant move the camara, it goes everywhere.
---
A warrior is desolace tried the same shit, Soon as he saw the void sac he just turned and ran.
---
A small number of providers colluding to agree on prices and territories is an oligopoly, not a monopoly.
---
But yeah kill lady praestor
---
Couldn't agree more. It's a risk you assume playing pvp servers, and it adds another layer to the game. It's a trade off for some awesome pvp experiences when a bunch of your faction jumps in and is on a manhunt. 
---
If someone ganks me, I simply turn and /clap at them.
---
That’s what pve servers and BGs are for.
---
SFK is one of the best dungeons.
---
lol they don’t owe you the mobs at all. Y’all are the whiney bitches that honestly think they have ALL the quest mobs when most AoE spots are hyper specific and don’t take up all the mobs. If you think they’re taking all the quest mobs, you’re just both unobservant and a moron.
---
Well it sounds like the op’s group wasn’t looking for just a clear, but spamming ZF for exp. In that context, I understand why they’d replace a low DPS lock. However, if exp farming was their goal, they should have never invited a 43 into ZF.
---
hahah fuck that guy! nice kill my friend!

This is amazing

That's a retail mind set.

Id feel guilty as fuck if I was doing no damage in a dungeon at all and just being carried. You are effectively wasting 4 other peoples time. But I guess some people are OK with that
---
my setup here is trash compared to what is possible. check out your [desktop configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4Asyfaf7g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=147) and use what feels right.
---
2/3 of groups are aoe spam bullshit what game are you playing.
---
I mean it was opposite faction, pve or pvp. Why would they care about their enemy?
---
I have never had a BoE epic world drop and maybe 1-2 BoE blues in my whole vanilla career. So yeah, anecdotes aren’t all that reliable.
---
Where is the exhaustive list? You study computer science and can't grasp the simple idea of being precise. You will fail in your studies.
---
You being this frustrtated in the internet also peobably means you are lonely IRL. Your situation won't improve by being hateful online. Do something else.
---
I cant fish in tanaris either. Exactly what you explained
---
Thus his statement "by some." What did your comment contribute?
---
I used regular anti-venom to cure Touch of Zanzil, but I could still get the quest to make the cure (I didn't bother doing it though).
---
IT'S A TRAP!
---
The trees in retail are boring though. My classic warrior talents are far more fun than my BFA warrior’s. 
---
If they don’t want to go back to the old talents then they need to revamp the system to make it more involved than it is now.
---
Fly sentinel hill and follow the river between Westfall and duskwood. You will be in stv in 3min
---
Blizzard merges servers before they feel dead, nobody has anything to worry about. It's really funny how WoW's history is literally right in front of us, and people are un sure of whats going to happen. Cross-realm will happen again, everything will happen, again.
---
If it makes you feel better, remember that Armor is worthless to you as a stat, you shouldn't be getting hit in group play.  After that, its just a path to getting the stat you want.
---
After all, no cloth only classes want that Agility anyway.
---
ITS MA'AM!!!
---
Yeah. OP is mad that he killed a wolf for the node.
---
Should be happy the druid didnt just jump his butt and kill him before stealing the node. A bit shocked the druid didnt do this.
---
If no one is dying I wouldn't sweat it, just go with the flow and clear the dungeon faster while keeping an eye on your heals. You'll get to flex your tanking muscles plenty in raids and the max level dungeons.
---
I'd love some orange slices, right about meoow.
---
Players are excellent at identifying problems.
---
They are awful at coming up with the best solutions.
---
I remember requiring damage meters on my lock just to track my threat generation. Without real threat mitigation or dumps it was an issue. And no oh shit buttons for bosses like ice block.
---
Obviously you took the wrong feral if their DPS is that bad
---
There's no space on the title to that and you can't write posts if you post an image in them
---
Thank you for giving me this knowledge.
---
Next time you simply hit em with the "QQ"
---
That's classic.
---
&gt; After all, no cloth only classes want that Agility anyway.
---
BUT MUH WAND SPEC
---
Also people will just chill for hours just dueling over and over. It's relaxing, fun, and free! Adding consumables would make it really tedious.
---
I volunteer because no matter how much money I have this week or make this year, the most valuable thing I have is my time.
---
Ohhhh that's a fun one with a way lower cooldown
---
Unless you're a hunter.
---
and they have to keep trying to lockpick your chest.
---
1. When I complained about travel time I was a fat little kid. I now love travel time because I can do some pushups, plank, or some other sort of exercise while I wait.
---
2. I like TBC/WoTLK talent trees more than vanilla. Feels way more meaningful in later expansions which is what I miss.
---
3. Again, I like TBC/WoTLK for itemization more.
---
4. The grind which resulted in an end. WoW retail still has a grind, it just never ends.

Default totem range is 20yards 30 with totemic mastery talent from the resto tree, tier 3. I have not noticed any issue with my totems giving the correct buffs on time. But I have totemic mastery.
---
Someone watches critical role ;)
---
I'm playing rogue. I get absolutely infuriated when my attacks miss or are parried, but damn it feels good when they hit. Just keep at it :) There are talents to improve hit chance and offhand damage
---
I'm already 215 bs. I'm gonna ditch mining once I've gotten enough bs plans to make money like that. Then I'll be engi/BS
---
Yeah...but this isn’t 60
---
One of my buddies from vanilla always said if you play a druid you won't have much competition for loot.
---
None of this means anything unless you're also eating right.
---
Unless you like being skinny fat.
---
It's almost like shamans are allowed to roll on primary DPS mail just as much as tanks. Shocker, I know.
---
Xp converts to gold in some way is what the post has implied.
---
 Aren't the retards of this sub always saying they refuse to taunt off DPS who pull aggro because they need to "teach them a lesson"?
---
Why do you care what direction they kite the mob you won't taunt in?
---
So pretty well, then? Every group I'm in listens to marks
---
Don't worry about it and just keep aggro off the healer. Don't chase mobs all over the place; if they want to get the mob off them they can come to you. As long as the healer doesn't get aggro the group should be fine.
---
Ah kk
---
Exactly. 
---
Now you’re getting it, my guy
---
The Venn Diagram of "people who roll on a PvP server and then complain about 'faction imbalance' being a problem" and "people who disparage PvE players for not wanting to be forced into open world PvP" is basically a fucking circle. 
---
Extra bonus points if they "enjoy world PvP for the challenge!" but only if it's a "fair fight" (read: they got the jump on someone).
---
The problem isn't technology, it's ideas.
---
We've seen the *wrong* way. And unfortunately other companies followed Blizzard because they were following money. Now we need someone to make a game the *right* way.
---
What's the right way? I don't know. It's only by doing it wrong do we know what we want.
---
It is a weapon buff not a PC status buff. If you have any other buffs on your weapon at the time I.e. poisons or sharpening stones, it will not take effect.
---
But then I'm in melee range of the other mobs and suddenly my 120% threat means now I am tanking everything.
---
Yeah but I have 1 extra gold before 40. &gt;:))
---
Herbalism is an easy skill to farm. You can easily buy charms from just vendored skinning. I've never had issues farming the tusks, I just ask any other warriors there to group, and they almost always do because they know the pain.
---
Already have. Wanted to spread awareness about this but most people in this thread seem to think this is a part of the intended gameplay lol...
---
Look at all those salty ass non mages we have in here!
---
37-38... there is little point to me being there... as Dungeon rewards at SM will be far superior to anything I can farm at STV.
---
I understand... truly I do.... that STV can favor horde.... even on Alliance heavy servers. BUT.... imagine you having a Class related quest (Whirlwind).... that can only be farmed at STV.... on a server that is 80 / 20 Horde favored.....
---
It tents to corrupt morale....
---
One Aimed shot + Multi + Auto from a 60 should kill pretty much any low level as well as probably most unprepared high level cloth users.
---
You can throw your combo, and be running/swimming away before the guards even aggro. Or just FD, though the BB guards like to resist.
---
I'll just stick to questing for now then
---
He’ll be after them TPS reports
---
Apparently an entirely different game. "Maybe" 1/10 spamming lfg are aoe farms, and its only ever ZF or BRD.
---
Mocking Blow and Challenging Shout too.
---
But really, healer aggro? How? Your autoattacks should be beating that for threat.
---
Halloween masks looking super realistic this year...
---
Considering you can hold 25 quests max, how much do you think you'd earn?  Maybe 50g?
---
Huge potential Retail spoilers below if this is true but...
---
There was a leak on 4chan (?) a while ago that documented the end of Battle For Azeroth and the beginning of the next expansion, apparently titled Shadowlands.
---
The leak says that BFA ends in a huge fight over Stormwind where almost everyone is killed, including your character, and Nathanos is rumoured to be beheaded by Tyrande. 
---
I have no idea if it’s true - it sounds kinda bullshit to me but. Retail’s writers are unpredictable at this point. 
---
I found out about it from this video if you wanna watch that - https://youtu.be/PsLyk52ZXaI
---
I literally had an alliance warrior farming tusks with me. It's not difficult. Yes, sometimes the PvP can hinder you but it doesn't make it harder, it just make it take more time.
---
I feel that If I play like this is the same as playing Breath of the wild, for example. Where you have to explore things to find what you want. It makes the game fresh to me! And it's really not that hard!
---
I played a mage in Vanilla at 60 and raided Naxx, and I've rolled a mage in classic.
---
I've been getting tells like this since like 2005, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with them. I've never considered anyone to be 'that guy' when they send a simple tell like this, because I'm not a judgemental asshole. 
---
There's absolutely no need to tip either and I never expect one, but they are appreciated when someone does tip.
---
"go enjoy the beach" that is probably his back yard
---
Preach, brother.
---
For someone with a friend having the same issue, could you please tell us what they said?
---
Stop whining and take the fight to them.
---
Cool
---
same. how i've been avoiding queues.
---
That fire nova can assblast you, but with IMP overpower and learning to joust it really isn't that hard.
---
Nobody is making you join those groups though..

35 y/o looking for mature, organized, semi hardcore guild.

Experienced gamer but almost no WoW experience (DotA, POE, p99, overwatch, souls, darkest dungeon).
---
I don't have a lot of patience for Pepe meme style banter (absolutely no racism/sexism/homophobia). 
---
Main playtimes are M-F evenings 7-11 pst (except Tuesday). And weekend mornings (and some weekend evenings).
---
Looking to raid and am more than happy to rush some exp if I needed to "catch up". 
---
Don't play alts much but I did make a bank alt and a warlock I'm going to level to 35 using rest exp so he can alch to make consumables for guild benefit and might switch mains to warlock as locks get more access to spell hit gear in later phases.
---
Yeah, but also feels like wasted potential, because they made it seem like he was just the first to get the makeover but more would come later. Apparently he was the only one, because Sylvanas hasn't done it to anyone else since.
---
When I saw this that was the first thing I said
---
Why are only 1/5 Turtles made of meat?
---
This needs to be a world pvp feature
---
I'll focus on getting a few more levels then
---
You had a 3 sentence response, with only 1 of them being a suggestion (and it was this one)... how is that a lot of suggestions?
---
I totally agree that they shouldn’t make game wide changes on it I just don’t see the benefit in you promoting people to leave, I mean unless you are the person you are referencing that wants no faction opposition, which your previous reply said you see my point so maybe I wrongly assumed you weren’t that person?
---
That's in the next update!

You don't have to buy the guide, but use his zone levels as a guideline of where to be. It's what I did 1-60 and it worked fine for me :D
---
I would def save them for 60 i made around 400g from questing

Man that rings a bell. I played heavily during WotLK and I spent 90% of my time in Dalaran or Org. The other 10% in Northrend doing dailies. Pretty sad looking back at it
---
LOL, you're welcome
---
2hrs later...
---
Naw your blood coags before anything else
---
And by "doing something wrong" I don't mean "you\`re too lo level to tank as a bear". But we need some info to determine what exactly was wrong.
---
When you chose this religion did nobody tell you about of our great and hateful god?
---
You can try duskwood, it’s technically lvl 18-30 but you should be fine.
---
This will come with the next update!
---
Also if you see a mage killing elementals you can banish them as a warlock so they can't kill mobs they  tagged
---
Agree, do bloody annoying and not adding anything to the subreddit.
---
Killing someone is taking his game time from him. If he took the ability to engage a fight or not, it's not a reason to camp a low level or 5v1 someone. PvP doesn't mean ruin the experience for someone, that's a distinction you need to make... People pay and save their time to play, and they're on PvP to be able to pvp at equal lvl or other, not to be camped...
---
It's okay, just sell leather stuff and buy the shot - it's easier to skin than it is to search out nodes.
---
Alternatively, you can keep skinning and swap LW for engineering - LW isn't that great anyway.  Sell leather, buy ore/stone.
---
Download the addon call ItemRack
---
I’m trying to do the same which is why I need those last hits lol!!
---
I like when rogues do more damage than me (sw:p all the mobs and wand usually tops dps unless rogue/mage are good) but I have this one friend who literally sprints after the runners for a big evis instead of starting CP on highest health min and he drives me crazzzzy lol
---
They'd still have to win and place better and better to get the progression. All the chance would do would enable them to have a fair fight upon entering premade PVP.
---
If you really can't see the advantage a wider player base for an auto-generated activity offers I'm not going to be able to help you understand it.
---
the mass will NEVER understand this, no matter what happens.
---
Blizzards official stance on the Tienanmen square massacre; "Nothing of note happened on that day"
---
Hit lvl 24 and run Duskwood.  One of my favorites
---
&gt;dps starting 5 milliseconds after I pull. bonus point if it's an aoe ability.
---
There's something amazing about starting my DPS with a stun one second after the mob gets to the tank.
---
Perhaps because I've been on the other end of that so much I know how infuriating it is, but it's glorious regardless.
---
Actually, I'm a data scientist, but I studied applied mathematics -- and certainly didn't fail. Try again.
---
How did he get it?
---
What are you guys talking about? t pve player
---
&gt; I fucking hate mages
---
I'm a mage and I do too. Lvl 44 currently and haven't AOE farmed once. Usually if I see a same faction mage doing it I try to mess them up at least once. They make it such a pain in the ass to level normally.
---
&gt;"Looking for Tank OR healer"
---
Welcome to Paladin, where you're simultaneously the tank and healer! Really though, I'm leveling using the hybrid spec right now because I know I'm just going to fill whatever slot is available.
---
I definitely did that. Say invalid command.
---
Ok - didn’t think it would still be Auctioneer but good to know. Thanks!
---
Harambe's revenge.
---
Why are you using trade for groups?
---
wE sHoUlD aLl gEt tO rOlL on tHaT sIncE wE wERe oN tH3 RaiD.
---
The reason it's casting it is still the "!" It just makes sure it's always casted, and if clicked again instead of turning it off, it applies it again. Based on what you want to do though, you're best off just keeping both spells bound. Macros won't use a conditional like what you're trying to setup.
---
The aoe dungeon grind with groups saying exp/hour stats is mind numbingly boring.
---
It's a game, not a capitalistic mega-corp that you're racing up the ladder to executive vice president of guild raid wellness before 30. 
---
Chill the fuck out.
---
What does quest max have to do with anything? He can complete them and pick up more lmao
---
Yep. If you want nothing but organised, fair, and consensual PvP then roll on a PvE sever... there is actually quite a bit of PvP on them. Difference is that people who don’t want to PvP can just not do so.
---
But on a PvP server you sign up to let the other side kill you for whatever reason they feel like, and vice versa. If they want that herb or ore and you get there first then they have the option of trying to kill you for it, and it’s *not* a dick move. It’s PvP.
---
There’s a lot of shitty things people can do on a PvP server IMO, killing someone over a resource or ninjaing it from the other side isn’t on that list.
---
Absolutely this!
---
Hi. I'm your mage servant. Just open trade window and give me a spare mana potion. Thanks!
---
More like JhomTHICC.
---
I don't know how I never got that quest, I have no quests to pick up in Thousand Needles
---
To be honest I worked the opposite way, where the text box would NEVER be selected. But I changed it because with the way it is now, you can "fast add" multiple items. I think I'll display a checkbox so people can choose when they want that functionality!
---
I don't know what you're saying, but I like the way you say it!
---
No changes.
---
And if they weren’t my buds (see user name) I wouldn’t have brought them. No one is wasting anyone’s time in my example...the goal isn’t to blitz the instance, it was to hang out with your buds. 
---
But I’d feel even worse if I was being a needless elitist in leveling dungeons of all places!
---
But in real life organized sports, factors (largely) outside an individual's control contribute to the inequality. In a game like WoW, where everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute, asking people to put in the same amount of effort to a communal activity like raiding doesn't feel like an inappropriate thing to do.
---
I think the dickheaded thing to do here is intentionally gimping your own performance below your capabilities so you can "feel good" about the role that you play.
---
Also the bug they had was a completely different bug that existed in Vanilla and not related to layering according to that blue post. At least the way the blue post describes it, I remember a similar thing happening when I played Vanilla but it wasn't something we actually tried to reproduce we were just like wtf? And started over.. Ofc BWL and AQ40 were out at this point
---
You’re the entitled one lol who are you to say what people can do? Go fuck yourself
---
I got the shadoweave set on my warlock and I'm using it to see if theres a big difference in my dps.
---
More for me...
---
Why did I come here?  WHERE ARE THE DAMN BIRDS?! I WANT YOUR BONES!
---
That is not a 20 min adventure
---
Heads up, there is a known bug where power-shift drops LOTP.  I would recommend avoiding it unless absolutely required.
---
Do it, do it!
---
Don’t take it so literal. I was simply giving you one option. Did I say it was the only option?  I expected you to rationalize and think about the other ones. The only benefit in people leaving is hopefully that person got on a server they will actually enjoy.
---
The arguement you use is true but I dislike the mindset.
---
The "I'm just going to fuck off"mentality is something prevelant in todays society so you are notwrong or will probably occur.
---
But I like the fix it attitude instead of disregard for new.
---
I actually wish I was on the less faction. I get ganked plenty already. From groups and higher levels.
---
But I enjoy finding people to kill more than I hate dying. I'd rather have more targets.
---
If I was alliance on stalag I'd make it my goal to get some horde to quit or swap servers.
---
I dont blame the level 60 a priest fucking up a whole quest location for about 12 horde for roughly 2 hours. 
---
It was fun trying to get the mobs without him seeing me. Or skin his mobs after he kills them.
---
There was no trail in 2006
---
You can check out the weapon progression here https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-leveling-classic-wow#best-weapons-and-gear-for-leveling-a-hunter to see what weapons you should aim for in the coming levels.
---
Doubt that Blizzard will look the other way on this.  They seem to be out for exploiter blood these days.
---
A healer laying off healing dps in dungeons is generally gonna do more damage than good. If they are so much of a problem remove them but don't hamper the rest of the group.
---
Being a Rouge is fun as heck
---
If I'm minding my own business and you attack me I'm going out of my way to corpse camp you
---
There isn't really much information of what work with what version of WoW. You just gotta use it and test if it works
---
Couldn’t agree with the last sentence more.
---
It messes up the economy.
---
All I noticed was the backpedaling
---
Our first attempt took us 4 hours... 2 of us were level 26 and barely hit any of the later mobs, had to do very controlled pulls. And the boss.... all but 1 wiped, the boss was on 1% and the level 26 warrior got stupid luck and landed 1 hit and killed him
---
Fishing for noobs!
---
Not when you cycle the camera around every chance you get
---
Besides, you see cloak, helm, plus weapon and shoulders at all times. And let's be honest those 4 are the most important pieces of gear to look sexy, right?
---
\&gt; What is it about classic that makes so many players want to kill those who have no possible way of fighting back? 
---
This isn't unique to WoW, this isn't unique to classic either. Plenty of people go around and gank on retail and every game that has ever had a rating system that keeps the high tier players from the low tier players has smurfing (yes I know levels are different but it's effectively the same thing. Johnny nothumbs isn't going to beat the average Counter Strike pro player on his 5th ever game.)
---
I do this as a warrior. Or now it’s if I’m gonna dungeon go grab the tank gear repair then fly. Fuck brain defaulted to fly sorry guys got to fly to BB for armour and repair.
---
Have there been any updates from Blizzard on efforts to reduce queue time?  I know their strategy near launch was "do nothing and hope enough people stop playing," but we're now weeks after launch and queues are regularly over 2 hours long.  That's completely unacceptable.
---
Nite elf rouge ftw
---
My first character is a hunter so I have the opposite problem, I kind of played myself here.
---
Maybe my alt can be a warlock instead though
---
“I have nothing against nobles,” Mat said, straightening his coat. “I just don’t fancy being one myself.”
---
“Why is that, then?”
---
Mat sat for a moment. Why was it? Finally, he looked down at his foot then replaced his boot.
---
 “It’s boots.”
---
“Boots?” Setalle looked confused.
---
“Boots,” Mat said with a nod, tying his laces. “It’s all about the boots.”
---
“But—”
---
“You see,” Mat said, pulling the laces tight, “a lot of men don’t have to worry much about what boots to wear. They’re the poorest of folks. If you ask one of them ‘What boots are you going to wear today, Mop?’ their answer is easy. 'Well, Mat. I only have one pair, so I guess I’m gonna wear that pair.’”
---
Mat hesitated. “Or, I guess they wouldn’t say that to you, Setalle, since you’re not me and all. They wouldn’t call you Mat, you understand.”
---
“I understand,” she said, sounding amused.
---
“Anyway, for people that have a little coin, the question of which boots to wear is harder. You see, average men, men like me…” He eyed her. “And I’m an average man, mind you.”
---
“Of course you are.”
---
“Bloody right I am,” Mat said, finishing with his laces and sitting up. “An average man might have three pairs of boots. Your third best pair of boots, those are the boots you wear when you’re working at something unpleasant. They might rub after a few paces, and they might have a few holes, but they’re good enough to keep your footing. You don’t mind mucking them up in the fields or the barn.”
---
“All right,” Setalle said.
---
“Then you have your second best pair of boots,” Mat said. “Those are your day-to-day boots. You wear those if you are going over to dinner at the neighbors. Or, in my case, you wear those if you’re going to battle. They’re nice boots, give you good footing, and you don’t mind being seen in them or anything.”
---
“And your best pair of boots?” Setalle asked. “You wear those to social events, like a ball or dining with a local dignitary?”
---
“Balls? Dignitaries? Bloody ashes, woman. I thought you were an inn-keeper.”
---
Setalle blushed faintly.
---
“We’re not going to any balls,” Mat said. “But if we had to, I suspect we’d wear our second best pair of boots. If they’re good enough for visiting old lady Hembrew next door, then they’re bloody well good enough for stepping on the toes of any woman fool enough to dance with us.”
---
“Then what are the best boots for?”
---
“Walking,” Mat said. “Any farmer knows the value of good boots when you go walking a distance.”
---
Setalle looked thoughtful. “All right. But what does this have to do with being a nobleman?”
---
“Everything,” Mat said. “Don’t you see? If you’re an average fellow, you know exactly when to use your boots. A man can keep track of three pairs of boots. Life is simple when you have three pairs of boots. But noblemen… Talmanes claims he has forty different pairs of boots at home. Forty pairs, can you imagine that?”
---
She smiled in amusement.
---
“Forty pairs,” Mat repeated, shaking his head. “Forty bloody pairs. And, they aren’t all the same kind of boots either. There is a pair for each outfit, and a dozen pairs in different styles that will match any number of half your outfits. You have boots for kings, boots for high lords, and boots for normal people. You have boots for winter and boots for summer, boots for rainy days and boots for dry days. You have bloody shoes that you wear only when you’re walking to the bathing chamber. Lopin used to complain that I didn’t have a pair to wear to the privy at night!”
---
“I see… So you’re using boots as a metaphor for the onus of responsibility and decision placed upon the aristocracy as they assume leadership of complex political and social positions.”
---
“Metaphor for…” Mat scowled. “Bloody ashes, woman. This isn’t a metaphor for anything! It’s just boots!”
---
Setalle shook her head. “You’re an unconventionally wise man, Matrim Cauthon.”
---
Having trouble finding it on twitch. Do you have a twitch link?
---
Thanks for the response. Seeing other classes with mostly blues was worrying me.
---
I’ve never been on a pve server. Can you still flag yourself for pvp in contested zones? Are you auto flagged in enemy zones?
---
They ruined Azshara and I'll never forgive them. It was a pretty, relaxing place that was relatively out of the way and I always loved it for that. A few quests around, couple cool things you wouldn't notice  normally (I think there was a mage quest there or something)? Was always nice and peaceful and I liked to visit to just fish or whatever.
---
I don't even want to talk about what they turned it in to in Cata. It hurts to think about.
---
I leveled a Druid to 60 on a pserver, and my Druid in classic is currently lvl 29.
---
It's about exactly the same.

I did 22 armory runs, 14 cath runs, and never managed to get an Axe or a Mograines might to drop. During one of my last runs, a warlock, who literally has to do almost nothing to do DPS, bitched about my DPS, as I was dropping WF totem, mana spring, grounding totem against the sorc, tremor, purging when needed, offhealing with chainheal, and still doing 80-100dps vs his 120. I was kicked from the ground after the run then they invited a mage. It is not my fault I've not gotten a drop, I was doing plenty to help the ground, he was pressing 3 buttons. It's so frustrating that people don't understand exactly what shaman do.
---
Whenever I zone into a new area my aggression is reset. As soon as i get ganked, everyone of the opposing faction is KoS. You might just get caught in the crossfire. Sorry.

Ahh I see, was on a pvp server. I was at booty bay and usually when I go there everyone is blue but this time before I got to BB a horde priest tried to mind control me off the boat but that made me in combat with him so i sprintd out and everyones name is red

Any one who purposely fucks with some one else’s farming, automatically goes on ignore and is added to my KOS list for my alliance buddies to take care of. Already have 2 on same faction! Try and grief my farming? Cool, now my alliance friends will kill you and stand next to me as they do it. Laugh the entire time in discord, and go on our merry way. Maybe next time as they are passing by a farmer they won’t intervene.
---
Thank you so much for this in-depth response. I especially appreciate you pointing out those two dungeons have very good items; I will be prioritizing those moving forward.
---
You should add the ability to save custom lists. So for tasks like visiting town, where you have a set list of things you normally do, you can reload the specific list for what you are doing. 
---
1. Vendor Junk
---
2. Buy Water
---
3. Buy ammo
---
4. Repair
---
5. Train skills

6. Bank/Mail stuffs

7. /1 "Chuck Norris Vs. John Wick"
---
8. Fly to Rachet

The Defias escort in Westfall is part of the dungeon quest chain that you have to do get the blue rewards (some of which are incredibly important for leveling) *and* its needed as part of a chain for the Stockades later. This isn't some 1200xp escort with shit gear you can just skip.
---
Nope, I want an exhaustive list of possible letters. Generating the possible names out of it is easy.
---
So you admit your link didn't contain an accurate list of the letters. You contradicted yourself.
---
I don't expect anyone to spoon feed me. I just offered  small prize, if someone happened to have a ready-made list close by.
---
You can'g be a very good data scientist. And being thst big of an asshole, you probably don't have many friends either. But then again one could wonder, which is the cause and which the result.
---
Haha..HaHaHa....HAHAHHAHAHA
---
It was awful, because you really have to RP hard to change your RL week to a 5 day schedule.
---
Yes. They diluted the class identity. Like even if you agree with what they did, that is still the case.
---
Before: any spec could tank, therefore it's a warrior thing. After: not the case.

I was pro-travel time back in the day, because of the connection and sense of distance. Though Un'Goro to Winterspring gets excessive. At some point you're not able to make progress because you're just flying, and likely afk for it. At least ground travel you're watching your surroundings to stay on track and avoid trouble. So I'm in favor of faster flight paths or maybe express flights that cost more.
---
If you don’t buy or bring the equivalent of what you have in a quiver for that dungeon or WC you’ll probably run out it’s kinda crazy.
---
When Horde warriors do this to me I feel so dirty and used afterwards lmao
---
actualy those peoples who made vanilla replaced by quota retards long ago...
---
But how much does going shadowform *really* improve grind time over wands? I just don't want my healing efficiency to take a dip and the improved soloing not be substantial enough, you know? What's your take?
---
The paid version is well done but I couldn't muster the 37 bucks. 
---
Also if you find you need to mob grind, level up your pick pocketing while you're getting cloth
---
Reroll on a carebear server.  This is sad.
---
Thank you. It was seeing the warriors and mages with all blues that raised my concerns.
---
It's a stupid system. Play on pve and choose when you are available for pvp.
---
I did it a long time ago and have never looked back.  It's much better.
---
Agreed, people assuming you either 1) remember everything, 2) studied the whole game or 3) followed the whole news are some of the worst. Completely unhelpful, just tells you, its be done with no links or evidence of where it was done. Just ridiculous, to think everyone knows everything and don't need explanations or condensed information.

It’s a 15 year old quest dude. In case you didn’t know, Bruce Willis is dead in 6th sense too.
---
they dont really matter honestly, those ppl. lets just let their heads explode and hopefully quit soon.
---
I love the middle finger on Ashbringer.
---
Lol meanwhile I'm rerolling again today for the 7th time, and have been running across countless players and grouping up. It's never too late.
---
As a newb to anything wow I dont mind running everywhere but the flight path time sucks... thought I just read something.
---
I don't do it, but I resign to how people behave in general, which is to be rational. If this is true, then we could assume that people who do this have had their fair share of nodes taken while they thought it "belonged" to them and eventually got so fed up with it that they started behaving in this manner too.
---
I love the example from game theory where individuals chose to cooperate with others as much as possible until they encounter someone who chooses to be selfish. At this point the strategy changes to avoid loss. Perfectly normal and all it takes is to step back and see the bigger picture rather than posting about how rude some people are.
---
You do realize that moments like this is what feeds google right? Google isn't some repository holding all the worlds information. 
---
We as a human species hold it all, share it on the internet and google guides others towards it. If everyone asks Google and nobody asks another person, then google is useless. 
---
You need to learn this. It isn't vital but its certainly a much better world to live in when we connect with one another...instead of being an asshat that nobody appreciates.
---
That is so awesome.
---
Happy cake day
---
Serious question, how are you checking this so long after classic release? Is it just a case of "We haven't heard anyone else doing it before us"? Or did you guys actually go search to find if there are any other posts about it.
---
I don't know if that makes sense for that addOn but it can definitely happen.
---
SFK, BFD, Gnomeragan, RFK, Scarlet Monastery Graveyard.
---
SFK is a low 20s dungeon, BFD is low to mid.  SM GY is high 20's to low 30s.  Gnomeragan and RFK are 29 to low 30s.
---
They are not gonna remove layering from one day to the next. They are already doing it.
---
This happened to me that weekend the servers were getting DDOS attacks. The server crashed on the flight, game told the instance could not be found, and I luckily got dropped just outside the stormwind gate.
---
How is that even possible?  You can do waaaaaaaay more dps than that just wanding.  Guess he wanted to get kicked.
---
People are saying it works on retail as well
---
Changing weapons triggers a global cooldown.

Dead. 
---
I expect the same energy my way. If I get murdered then I was in the wrong neighborhood
---
Same! This druid tried to jump me 3 separate times while I was grinding mobs in Tanaris. Each time, he get melted. Idk what he was thinking but whatever he tried, he couldn't match Ele Shaman burst.
---
Yeah how about the one that formed the crater at the end of the track lol
---
Thanks for using it!!
---
Right click to ignore its even more fun as a tank because I know these same people will be whispering me to run dungeons to bad you acted dumb and won the prize of right click ignore.
---
You’re completely right. It’s just such a weird thing to hate on something you’re literally paying $$$ for on a monthly basis
---
I'm an English speaker. What is a good middle ground, then? Maybe a med-to-high pop server for horde side? I wanna be able to find people to level with, and raid groups with relative ease
---
Those /roll pics are so annoying.
---
Even cooler. If people relies less on addons they would've noticed thalanaar is visible on the entire map of kalimdor on your stock blizzard map represented by a house icon like other hubs.
---
I'm down for everything but the chair dips. IDK how to do those without flipping the chair over and smashing the back of my dome.
---
Who hurt you? Seriously though nothing in my post said I wouldn't do my damndest to save you but I can't do that at fireball range.
---
Why tho
---
That's it, no water for you.
---
It does, yes. People might just click accept because it looks exactly like all the other dislogs that pop up all the time.
---
ROYGG
---
Is "the office" at another location or a separate room in your house? It's been quite a few years since I used VNC, however, we mostly used it with on-premise situations.
---
For remote connections, I would recommend looking into this:  [http://remotedesktop.google.com](http://remotedesktop.google.com/)
---
Should’ve taken a picture with your phone xD
---
Happens to me couple times a day. I thought it was just my mouse tbh.
---
Wahhhhh
---
turn your render scale up pls this hurts my eyes
---
I got the offhand on my first run, since then i did like 20 more, and only saw the mainhand dropped once.
---
Here we go. Everyone remember this and remember it well. End Game WoW and being in a guild is like working at a corporate office for the most part.
---
Did you not read my comment properly or just wanted to use this opportunity to brag? :D   
---
" 2000g is a random number i dont know whats the normal ammount of gold right now but im sure blizzard knows this number."  
---
Blizzard knows exactly what is an abnormal ammount of gold, and even then, the banned people have a chance to make their case.
---
Why not use it though

I don't bother you if you don't bother me.
---
I’ve had success with the honor system.  If you are of that profession need it.  If not greed it.
---
Unless it’s just really bizarre (like a warrior needing a tailoring pattern) most people won’t say anything about you needing a pattern.
---
Okay I was worried that stances were a secured action. But when I switch weapons it doesn’t trigger the GCD on all my abilities. Is it a full 1.5 seconds or is this just to prevent fully automating these kinds of things.
---
Just don’t get charged lol
---
&gt;Arms or Fury are BETTER tanks because their first talents give more damage (more threat), which is the hardest part of tanking Wailing Caverns or Deadmines.
---
Ain't nothing in Arms that's gonna increase your damage at that level. Imp Rend? Haha.
---
Prot at least gives Toughness. But anyone playing without TM is just making their life worse than it needs to be.
---
They are bad on meters so people assume they are bad. Even low tier players want to compete on meters. It's a shame. Druid is one of the most fun classes to play imo!
---
Pretty much everything on my server Sulfuras is on the AH for “slightly” above vender value and after AH cut it makes them worth less than vender price. Most mats up to 225+ crafting are at vender price. Anything above that has a decent value on it, though not much to made.
---
Keep complaining then blitz will make them useless because you’ll be able to automatically learn spells when you level! Oh wait...
---
Seriously what the fuck is wrong with flight paths? Am I doing something wrong because sometimes it'll fly to bloody retail wow and back to get where I'm going.
---
Damn I got you. I never attack lower level, I would feel alful. But damn I love meeting an asshole who give me a reason to bring my heavily geared warlock.
---
Sweet revenge
---
"Let me have a look at you. Hm, pathetic. Why aren't there any dark rangers in your ranks? Well, you will have to do....... LITTER THE BEACH WITH THEIR CORPSES!!! MOVE!!!!!"
---
I do what I can, sorry it took like 3 tries
---
&gt; • AdvancedOptions (behaviour changes, such as 'click empty space to deselect')
---
There's an option in the built in settings to do that.
---
Nice UI though I'll probably implement some of this.
---
I had this, buttons 4 and 5 on my razor mouse were making my mouse speed slower and faster when I clicked them, redownloaded razer synapse and changed the buttons back to what they were.
---
Hope this helps at least someone
---
My rotation for almost every mob is Charge -&gt; Rend -&gt; Hamstring -&gt; Demo shout -&gt; Sunderssss. I like the Rend and Hamstring bc they are cheap and fish for an early Deep Wounds
---
How dare you be wrong and spread this lie.
---
Free server transfers have been given out to high population realms, there is something being done about it.
---
grob mob
---
/leave 1
---
Got to reboot the servers because reasons.
---
With the door closed?
---
Nobody is getting mad for being called out; in fact chances are someone who spends their time ganking lowbies is actually looking for it. People are annoyed that the forums are filled with people crying about getting ganked.
---
Shame, if you cannot kill 42 mage as level 35-37. As an alliance player i am so used to fight red enemies to see it is clearly possible to fight them off (i even made some skull levels sweat and pop cds aganist me). Oh boy most pvp serverd are horde dominant and some horde players end up not knowing how to survive in unfavorable situations.
---
You can use macros. 
---
You can have shadow form change your action bar or have every macro do one thing normally or another in shadow form.
---
If my dungeon groups are anything to go by, people are vastly underestimating the number of teenagers playing. I feel dumb for thinking that classic would be a bunch of people in their late 20s to early 30s who played vanilla and would know what they were doing. Instead it's a bunch of people who've never played wow and chat is filled with teenagers calling people boomers/zoomers.
---
It's going to happen. Change is coming. Get your head around it, or play on a private server.
---
Keep in mind about half of your gear will probably be leather if you're optimising for PvE. You don't tank hits in PvE and there's generally better dps 'rogue' gear than hunter gear. Even fury warriors typically end up wearing a lot of leather at 60. So if you're just limiting yourself to mail gear that will be a fairly short list of things.
---
Any plans to add profession items such as enchants in the future?
---
Dude....cmon now. I barely have time to play wow but if I could afford to go to the beach I’d sure as hell be playing it too. GG
---
Anybody who voluntarily signs up for a free moderator position for something like reddit has a very sad, unfulfilling life.
---
What are you talking about?
---
I've killed players 6-7 levels above me
---
Alliance guards are clearly pussies. FOR THE HORDE
---
Okay! Waiting on your report!
---
Language!
---
It’s really not that bad as long as your at the right lvl.
---
Could someone explain this meme about ninjas that I keep seeing referenced? I can't ever make sense of it from context, it just seems like calling people "ninjas" is a meme for bad players or something now.
---
i still dont get it
---
Unlucky, run the same number of times, 3 time it dropped,1time was that hat.
---
Whitemane is actually one of the most balanced servers and one of the best servers to play Alliance lol. A bunch of the other ones are majority Horde
---
What unironically triggers me is when people out bid me by 1 copper.
---
Sorry but Druid armor doesn’t beat shield block. Shield block makes warriors almost immune to crushing blows. That’s why almost every guild uses a warrior as main tank. Druids can actually die from getting crushed. Cooldowns are great and all but the secret sauce is shield block.
---
Looks like your GCD (global coolldown) timer, not a swing timer. I could be wrong though.
---
Yep. You can keep yourself flagged all day long if you want (and some people do).
---
Same
---
Hahahaaa! I'm sure they get it, 'cause we all do it :)
---
Is prot not a viable tanking spec for paladins?
---
They can do dungeons but not raids or something?
---
I've been looking for one of these!
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Yes, two mages in a group will own the entire area, dipshit. But ya, they should be allowed to compeltely control questmobs, that's TOTALLY fair. Fuck you, you're exactly why I tag the mobs and let them kill them. Maybe if they weren't pricks like you, I wouldn't have to, you fucking tool =) PS: You're not owed the quest mobs either, neither are the mages, you whiny bitch.

Dude, what realm? I swear that I was the other blood DK!
---
I used to do that as a Drood in Moonglade, when the wittle lvl10 elf druids would teleport in the moment they appeared I'd use some cat form bleed on them (typically pounce), it wouldn't kill them especially if they healed themself but they'd run around all panicked. I think drood honor prohibits actually ganking lowbies in moonglade.
---
I'd also mess with lvl60 players who were dueling outside Stormwind by moonfire ganking them at low health then pissing off at high speed and dashing away and prowling before they could catch me - which I must say was a uniquely druidic form of griefing being the only class with powerful ranged attacks and stealth - they'd all have a merry wild druid hunt trying to unstealth me, then once the hornet nest had died down and they got back to dueling and dash had cooled down, I'd prowl back and moonfire gank another one. I can imagine that the only thing more annoying than being moonfire ganked was that they almost never managed to catch me. It was intensely dishonorable, but like, if they were dueling they obviously had nothing better to do anyway.
---
Do them turtles drop some good vendor shit or what?
---
Well that sucks! I hope blizzard fixes that post haste!
---
&gt;Blizzard already makes more money from selling services to the game than subs.
---
Sources, please
---
Transfers to a single brand new realm, and there have been posts here about how it's a ghost town for the people who took a transfer.  So players go from an overpopulated server to the absolute opposite extreme of an empty one.
---
Yep aka I’ll be looking straight up randomly sometimes when I go to target a guy idk bit annoying.
---
You posted this a couple days ago my dude.
---
At 0:38 too. :D
---
The downside to that is also a classic-only issue in that more plate healing gear increases the chance of a big boss dropping enchanting materials for hordies.
---
#NotMyWoW /s lol
---
So do you get really good fps by doing this or just like the aesthetic?
---
Did you just assume my demonic gender?!
---
TBH I've timed it and it takes a similar amount of time to get from Darkshire to rebel camp as it does from Sentinel Hill
---
Still get destroyed in hillsbrad, but I wouldn’t want to get destroyed on any other realm
---
Neither is blindly following these morons :/
---
I already made reference to 'back in the day'; you have no 'news' for me at all.
---
I only powershift on bosses or priority targets in 5 mans. It's honestly just too much work and I can't be assed 90％ of the time. The best part of cat is getting a free hurricane where you can stand there AFK for 10s doing 500 AOE dps
---
Nah, i think both are in the wrong - it's a bad move to ruin the economy (especially when it's so new on Classic) by undercutting with ridiculous amounts because "i want to get rid of the stuff fast" - if someone needs it, they will buy it whether it's cheap or at the usual price. But it's also a bad move to whisper that person and start making fun and shit, that won't help anyone. I've done that too on retail a couple of times, and it only made those persons more determined to undercut, so that was fun.
---
I got on the futabus once. There was nowhere to sit.
---
LOL @ telling someone who complains about LFR to care about item level. LFR and item level are a part of the same group of additions that made people want Classic to begin with.
---
Tyvm (:
---
I think they should have faction specified loot tables in that case which ensures only horde raids get shaman gear and alliance only get paladin gear drop chances.
---
one in a million. pretty cool!
---
Got it first run.
---
Did you mean to reply to me?
---
You should make it so that I can tie a reminder to a zone. So for example I can tell it to remind me to buy water when I get to undercity.
---
r/IHaveSex
---
Considering that its a game of ones and zeroes, the only way you´re pulling aggro with just 1 auto is by shooting it before the tank can melee the target once.
---
And you think that you´re being slick with that multishot-feign trick but Im willing to bet most of the time it doesnt go like you think it does.
---
Either way, whatever. Be a nuisance to your groups and have no-one want to tank for you.
---
Rouge is French for red. 
---
&lt;B&gt;Rogue&lt;/B&gt; is the character class.
---
Imagine running a bot while you slept or worked so you could get past the shittiest parts of the game.
---
Also, what the hell, man? Do you seriously think he just sat there in his computer chair watching the bot run?????
---
This. I came here as a retail only player because I just discovered classic two days ago and fell in love with Old Orgrimmar and a lot of other aspects. 
---
But I still like retail, and I was kinda hoping not to find yet another random circlejerk about in in the third thread I clicked into in the sub. Sigh.
---
Solo! ;)
---
I wouldn’t mind it so much if my bars didn’t swap between changing stances. It forces me to either put certain buttons in certain places or suffer having the weirdest looking keybind placement. Like this is the epitome of a warrior specific problem and it’s really annoying. Why can’t I just play my class with access to all of my class without jumping 1000 hoops.  It’s bad enough I gotta accumulate all these different weapons.
---
Not trying to complain but like, damn this. lol
---
Oh man I wish I could help you. Did you try using twitch or added the addon manually?
---
as soon as you log in turn on all the optional action bars, turn on auto loot, instant quest text, bind your auto-run key to something convenient
---
Anyone hear of free server transfers coming back again? Missed the window for my server.
---
no its not wrong. thats what i said and thats what i meant to say
---
That aspect ratio. Are you playing on a classic monitor too? 👍
---
You "don't fully understand" why people dislike griefers who camp the end of escort quests for 5+ hours?
---
C'mon dude
---
I read this in Peter Griffin's voice, so unlike everyone else who downvoted you, I upvoted you in appreciation of the laugh.
---
So there's no addon for this? Is there an addon which makes the chat or the combat log any better and less intrusive?
---
To be fair if you can manage to not get your shit mixed by the mob you're kiting and not pull anything else, go for it.
---
&gt; Don't want stealth alerts, constant pinging of every ally near enough to be in my combat log
---
 /spy config has a bunch of different options. You can turn off chat announcements, turn off audio alerts, turn off stealth, only have audio alerts for KOS, warn for KOS, warn for KOS guild.  
---
There's a ton of customization, but Vanos or your sticky notes might just fit you better. I just don't want people to get the wrong impression of Spy, I've been using it since wotlk and I can't imagine playing without it anymore.
---
It is sane regardless of what you think the motivations are .. you are one of the few that made the sane choice. I don't get why more players that don't like wpvp don't go pve.
---
R*O*G*U*E
---
Thank me later...
---
He is not you can actually walk on water in Calssic WoW.
---
yeah i posted it a bad time and it didnt give much attention, figured id try reposting
---
&gt; spell power doesn't become good until you can stack a lot of it, which is typically only on pre-raid BIS/tier gear (at least from what i've researched).
---
As an SPriest you can stack like TEN METRIC TONS of spellpower if you craft or buy shadoweave items around lvls 35-40.
---
It looks like it was fine going in circles the once it hits winterspring, it's like "I guess it's time to land this puppy" (hints the straight line to the destination.)
---
3 months later we've got level 90 turtles roaming the shimmering flats
---
Thx! :D
---
Tanaris rocs are the most annoying quest mobs in pop behaviour. Pops around almost the whole area, lots of possible drop, implied in a profession quest, shares spawn timer with hyenas.
---
Fuck these mobs.
---
Laptops make me laugh
---
Nah. This is honorable lowbie ganking. No issues here at all.
---
Got the Stockafe Pauldrons to drop after thinking "man I really feel a boe for some reason "
---
This is what life feels like with ADHD.
---
Maybe you're putting them in the wrong folder? But other people are saying they have the same problem as you.
---
So they should never give people a chance ?
---
If you want groups to be exactly how you want them to, do what I do. Make your own.
---
Start saving for your mount right away.
---
Yes it does!!
---
Idiot
---
The "replacement" was someone they already knew and were looking for a reason to drop you. Hell they probably would have dropped you without a reason if they couldn't have thought one up.
---
Whatever pet you enjoy looking at the most is BIS for hunters at all levels.

DoTin warriors are hilarious yet cruel.
