After any second char as a dwarf I finally started using treasure finding. And I still click to target/heal.

---
So what, your point is that blizzard should fix their game instead of their server?
---
Private servers were wayyyyyyyy smaller and had their own set of issues. 
---

---
Anyone pretending Nostralius or similar didn’t have these issues is fooling themselves.
---
only over the top douche bag I've played with so far has been a mage. I kicked him from group just at the time for him to get booted and fail the RFK escort just as the final mobs were spawning. Great stuff.
---
Ohh ohh ohh ok, my bad
---
divide it by a million. he’s not getting shit. those method deals don’t include salary. it’s just a partnership for getting exposure and sponsorships.
---
DK have a huge negative impact on your rank, but because we have 0 rank currently, there is no impact. In one week that will not be the case and you will notice a decrease in your honor instantly.
---
What about DM north or west?
---
This is not neccesarily true.
---
It would appear that either the honor system is completley fucked OR the "estimated honor gained" is just wrong. Seeing as it's estimated, I would guess that's the part which isn't accurate. So even though it says you gain honor, you probably don't.

---
Lol what? I'm on a high pop eu server. No streamers. Alot of lag today in big wpvp.. how is that my fault?
---
Same, I do not tank anything with something on reserve, the only exception as the groups that I made to specifically get my RL friends their Reed and their dal rend swords.  But the runs weren't at the time so either casters or melee still joined based on which reserve .  But other that I won't run in a group with res
---
Idd it looked abit like he was dying inside in his eyes after he did it while he was commited to justify it
---
Ty for the advice
---
You get honor based on damage done.  Essentially you are screwed if you raid as melee.
---
Looks like Dominos and z-pearl unit frames. They have customized the unit frames a bit from stock.
---
Yes people will remember. But he could have built a massive career off of that and he didn’t. Then he put a nail in the coffin with this bullshit.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/smallindiecompany] [\[r\/classicwow\] Private servers could handle WPVP, but Blizzard is a small indie company. SAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallindiecompany/comments/dwi9o4/rclassicwow_private_servers_could_handle_wpvp_but/)

---
Honestly I've seen conflicting reports about this all over the sub in the last few hours and I don't think anyone knows. None of the online wikis really give definitive information so until someone can supply proof, people will need to wait until the reset to really determine their effects.
---
Oh shut up with this stupid lie, the largest private servers had more than 3x max capacity during peak hours than vanilla wow.
---
Tbh, I'm tempted to watch his next stream just to see his face right now.
---
*woooooow
---
He actually did respawn and instakill the first two lava hound packs to reset their spawn timer since they were about to respawn anyhow. 
---
GMs in their blue robes were the coolest...
---
A few of my favorite group comps as a paladin/priest player:
---
AOE: Pally tank, 3x mage, Priest healer
---
Utility: Druid tank, Hunter/rogue, Lock, Mage, Pally healer
---
Melee cleave: 3x warrior, rogue, Pally healer.. this works better on horde for windfury totem, but this group is still nice for chain pulls and non stop killing
---
While leveling I enjoyed tanking spellcleaves on my pally the most, but now that I’m 60 I like healing the utility comp.
---
Played rogue for over a year on private server and now playing one here. Experienced this issue plenty of times and have simply resorted to having a separate macro to /cancelaura stealth as per suggestion in a comment here.
---
You are correct, something not right with rogues.
---
This is kinda why I wish there had been a server specifically made for new players. My friends/guildies keep telling me to hurry up, hurry up to 60(I'm lvl 51). But I've never played before I don't want to rush, I want to see what it is that keeps people playing a game for 15 years. Turns out it's all about the destination and noone cares about the journey. I'll see a piece of gear and be like oh that looks cool. "It's trash vendor it" There's no excitement because everyone already knows everything. Playing with vets has taken most of the fun out this game for me, and now here comes phase 2 and I'm just like... Fuck me, I though I was getting rushed before.
---
Pretty much. Despite all the people shitting on Joana after this guy got to 60 faster (and in a way that’s not comparable) a lot more people remember Joana after 15 years than will remember this guy... and a lot more fondly as well.
---
Thanks for clarifying that!
---
Backstreet Russian private servers would also crash 5+ times per day and were flooded with chinese farm bots and had admins spawning rank14 characters and would take 5+ days to get a ticket response because of GMs working for free in their spare time
---
Well to heal in raid you definitely want the 5/5 crit gives your mana back talent. So I’m not sure if you can reach reckoning. If you can you can still do some big damage with spelladin and that heavy hitting mace with reckoning stacks.
---
In the event of a tie roll, it goes to who rolled first.
---
You pretty much hit the nail on the head when it comes to the paladin warrior synergy (and everything else, really). 
---
As a geared Arms warrior on private servers, my favorite thing was to run around with sweeping strikes and Blessing of Freedom active, destroying any clothy unfortunate enough to have stacked together with an ally. 
---
Now I'm playing a Holy paladin for the first time, and I'm noticing blessing of freedom granted to a skilled warrior in and of itself is probably worth more than having an extra dps class with you. The main thing that stops a warrior is sustained cc (mages with frost bolt, nova, CoC etc), and blessing of freedom will just completely empower the warrior to go on a killing spree.
---
Enable class colored frames you maniac.
---
They won't even spring a couple of grand for some servers.. and you think they will hire more people to play GM?  You must be joking.
---
No. I was responding to a particular comment from someone about their “high pop” server. I’m pointing out that Pagle is probably the same or higher pop.
---
There was no lag at all. People just weren't engaging, on either side, other than ranged DPS taking potshots.
---
Yeah - I can't see anyone earlier than us?
---
One of us.... one of us
---
No mount and having to go long distances. Hated 30-40
---
YA DONE GOOFED
---
The fight between the Horde &amp; Alliance players was real back then it really felt like a open world of WC3 because that was the only thing we had before WoW, it was great.
---
/script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1);
---
Put that in that chat, try restarting the game and see if that helps.
---
yeah enjoy your server where "things are happening" my fucking sides
---
Is his last name pronounced Gobby? If so his name would be held in high esteem in Australia
---
Getting a mount from your own faction, including both the mount and training, as long as you are at least honored with your faction (for discount), is 90g.
---
nost/lh had almost no lag.... 3 months out.  it was a lag shitshow when it had similar players/zone group ups during launch.  nost crashed constantly for literally months as well.  the only pserver i know who had constantly like 8k pops for months was a server that had a cash shop and prob lied about pop.
---
5Head
---
FoW kinda sucks tho
---
Already getting Desolace and STV PTSD flashbacks.
---
It was exactly like this when honor first launched....
---
yeah the high pop servers that arent overcrowded like gehennas will be completely empty in a week actually, ure right
---
You need to tame things that have the abilities you want. Then you need to use the abilities enough for you to be able to teach it.
---
You also need to keep taming because a pet will not automatically upgrade Claw 1 to Claw 2, for example.
---
for me it is 100 total, the price for the wolf is 80 and the training is 20
---
Where did this dumb phrase come from anyway? I mean, do people think it's clever?
---
I’ve played for 8 years and have no idea what love farm means. Please enlighten me
---
Boasting:  what he *thinks* he's doing.
---
Whining:  what he's actually doing.
---
Blizzard servers confirmed homophobic?
---
Complain all you want, that is a very normal way of forming groups for these runs. HOJ drops so infrequently that you're an idiot wasting your time running for it if you have to roll against someone. With even moderately bad RNG you could double or triple the amount of time it takes to get (and we're talking \~40 kills baseline, before rolling against anyone)
---
If anything  I'm more surprised that they managed to get a healer since almost zero healing gear drops from those two encounters.
---
&gt; /script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1)
---
I did as you instructed, no change.
---
Depends on the server, and how they were moderated.
---
I don't know for sure whether it's based on order applied or a priority system or hierarchy or a combination of both. The only thing I've definitely tested myself is bashguuder mace armor pen proc simply will not apply if annihilator proc is present; seemingly because annihilator is the same debuff name but with a 45s duration vs 30s duration. I was able to test this on an onyxia split 20man run.
---
i'm confused how you reached this conclusion? shitting all over blizzard and their choices insinuates my uncle is a GM?
---
They're still working on a keyring, give them a break
---
Ye was the same on my sever Amazing fun we had For The Alliance!!
---
Oce server arugal horde got both bosses lol
---
Then you are not honored with your faction yet.  10% discount for both of those.
---
So if we stop parroting a FACT we are left you anecdotally saying your server is dead and me anecdotally talking about how i can find groups no problem on my medium server. Who does that help?
---
I just dinged 49 a couple days ago, I’m just going to wait it out a couple months and catch up on other games instead
---
how do I get honored with my faction?
---
They had 2 months to fix it. Come on. That's plenty of time. This has been reported over and over since basically 2 weeks after launch.
---
I was in Hillsbrad today, and there were 5+ horde raids and maybe 3 raids of alliance, but I didn't experience any lag whatsoever. It was chaos but was also smooth as butter. Did they change something? Because all the videos I've seen of this amount of PvP makes the servers go to shit.
---
If by partner you mean my right hand then yes. Exclusively ;)
---
at level 34
---
Solid screenshot!
---
it’s not a job
---
This is exactly what happened to me too.  And I'm lvl 59 and really don't wanna roll on another server.
---
it doesnt matter if u r 48 or 40, whats red is dead is more serious now and it doesnt matter you dont earn HK, most transfer and questing hubs r being camped and if u play on the wrong side (blue on most realms) you r attached to another object by an incline plane wrapped helically around an axis :-D
---
It depends how much you've got. 
---
I used to do coke on and off when I was younger. I used to hot bongs of weed and do lines of coke and either play counter-strike or WoW, depends where my mind was at but I certainly enjoyed talking to people and since I'm global in csgo it didn't really effect my gameplay as much as one would think.
---
That's not how debuffs get pushed off. There is a priority system of what will be pushed off. Some debuffs are high priority some are low. It will not take off whatever was placed on first.
---
You and me both, brother... Can confirm taunts don't work so good when the target has at least a +7 level advantage.
---
We did. That's why retail was dying
---
Interesting,  iv heard annihilator is an important one if u can get it. I guess alot of meelee will equip it all just to get the debuff switxh to there regular wep and then back one to apply it again.
---
There is also an ingame tooltip and a bluepost. Both say different things..
---
It isn’t the first buff applied. There’s a priority order. I don’t remember the order but only the “unimportant” rebuffs fall off first.
---
Coming from someone who tried to use cheats on private servers - it worked on some. Usually those were small and less populated servers with a not so serious dev team and enforcement from server GMs. 
---
Plenty of the larger and more successful servers however had excellent detection and banned you within a matter of seconds if any cheat programs or exploits were used. So while it's probably true what your friends say, you shouldn't buy into the whole "pservers were just full of cheaters" stigma.
---
lol you guys gonna make them turn layering back on, no changes btw.
---
It's next to impossible to not be honored with your race by 40. Are you a NE that went straight to westfall or something?
---
On release I recall getting feared down under the SM building. It might have been some multiboxer getting feared with his characters and trying to make it to floor level again.
---
I won it last night for my lock. It's great. Like 1.5% crit chance and more hp/mana over what I had. Maybe not as good as mage blade, but it's still a pretty big upgrade
---
So obsessing over what other people are obsessing over is better?
---
Very imformative! it makes alot of sense that sunder would take prio.
---
Omg my two favorite sub-reddits have merged
---
It’s only be live for 5 hours
---
Yeah, did a lot of leveling in the barrens. my rep for org is at 5425/6000
---
Shut up bird
---
Shit talking on a throwaway account. Ant-man is envious of how small you are.
---
&gt;this is the place to be
---
wut?
---
It’s called bragging.
---
With massive servers, I'm wondering if bgs aren't the best honor farm.  Has anyone looked at the number of players wpvp needs to have to break even with bgs?
---
LOCAL IDIOT LOSES THE DOUBLE DOWN, MORTGAGES HOUSE FOR ANOTHER DOUBLE OR NOTHING.
---
Psh! I'm level 24. Come at me, chump! By the time I'm worth a point of honor they'll have gorged themselves on your blood!
---
My biggest confusion with LFG chat is that I don’t remember it being utilized back in actual classic. Is this something we created for the new version of vanilla?
---
It's fuckin me god damn it. I don't understand it. Just trying to get a group together to do dun gorak and all I get is war chat. Makes me want to migrate to a new server.
---
i've seen a few here claim it but i've seen a bunch of wild claims here
---
Upon researching we're both wrong, the game does a second hidden roll and determines winner from that.
---
new players, in fact most players, dont even know how to make channels, so what are you even talking about lol  
---
noticeable time? a level 1 takes 15 seconds, a level 10 grind is an hour, thats significant. Private servers have no investment to make an account, you need to buy a copy of WoW to spam people here, the investment is much more significant when you add an hour to it.  
---
you cant "track people" they can just VPN and prevent their IP from being banned even if blizzard went that far. You clearly dont know how the internet works
---
This is correct
---
Dude...your reply was (verbatim): 
---
&gt;Excuse you what? This is like the 100th post I've seen in 3 days? Lol
---
Your insinuation was OP didn't know how to look at all the other posts parroting the same "Blizzard servers bad" mantra &amp; then you had to "lol" at them - - **Your reply wasn't meant to make you look superior to OP though?**
---
Your own superiority reply backfired because YOU didn't understand the joke and now YOU'RE upset &amp; calling other people dinguses for getting "whooshed" - - **Pot calling the kettle black.**
---
**This all sounds like a YOU problem.**
---
Try accountability &amp; have some humility on the side...it does the body good.
---
Naw it's still fun
---
star wars battlefrond pvp battles)
---
Probably not the side to err on
---
Yea, we had a similar issue in a raid once, where we could see the loot, but couldn't loot it, GM sorted it out pretty quick though. Point is this bug has happened even when there was only a single tag.
---
Ditto, mine stopped at 30... that fuck head
---
Don’t give a fuck about your streamer drama shit mate. Open a new subreddit for that nonsense
---
Love “the boys” reference
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
What do you mean released on mograine? It was a world wide release
---
Your character is completely ruined. Honestly I'd just delete the entire game at that point.
---
Hey, now you're getting it :)
---
I was talking about the lock ;D I have shit gear compared to his. :)
---
Do you think the private russia. Server were logging everything, validating all packet and input received from the player?
---
Validating all collision? Cheat prevention?  And I’m forgetting a lot.
---
Pretty sure /u/pepsi_next had more karma, at least more karma sooner than gallowboob did. 
---
Still, nice meme!
---
Even in vanilla I remember getting shit on when i mentioned my server (which was a PvE backwater, Aerie Peak).  There's a negative connotation with rolling on non-PvP servers I think, that may play a part in people not doing it as much (not wanting someone to think they 'couldn't hack it' etc)
---
I got to level 34, rerolled. Then got to level 45, rerolled. Now on my level 17.
---
I agree, WoW's PvP wouldn't really work well with losing all your items.  In both AC and EQ though, you didn't drop everything, you dropped everything but No-Drop items.  You could do something like that but even still, WoW PvP is much more meant for their BG's which I actually enjoy.
---
I just think it's funny that many people talk about how the goal of WoW is PvP when it's obviously a PvE centric and themed MMO.  Just because a ladder system was added doesn't mean it's a PvP game.  
---
To me WoW is much more like a first person shooter game like CoD or Battlefield.  You die, you respawn immediately and can get back into the fight very quickly.  It's one of the reasons, after playing on FFA PvP and PvP servers since 1998, I chose this time to play on a PvE server.
---
I opened the post fully expecting some version of  
---
Narrator: because he is an asshat.  
---
I would never have imagined an actual attempt at explaining/justifying the situation.  
---
I am equal parts surprised, scared and speechless.
---
It's funny you say that because we have a nelf druid in our guild that is constantly ganking and recruiting pvp groups.. and this was pre-honor
---
Leveling via questing is a lot les bland than running the same dungeon 10 times a day imo
---
what's the deal with this guy and his wife? lol
---
it's because there are way, way, way more people on classic servers than there ever was on a pserver or og vanilla.
---
It’s not bullying. 
---
It’s playing the game you signed up for. You rolled pvp server. 
---
It happens. Sometimes you are the bug, sometimes you are the windshield. 
---
Get over it.
---
A handful of (mostly minor) differences in gameplay does not invalidate performance comparisons.
---
350 lol

Tl;dw for anyone

"I'm a cunt"

That isnt even remotely correct.

Grinded in Winterspring tonight without much trouble. Even managed to slightly increase timbermaw rep ! 
---
Un'Goro was hell. I'm never going back there.
---
Yeah I know that every mana class can use those, even a rogue could use them if he wanted.
---
it is at that point now. its just now 6pm central time here, 4 pm in cali.

im hoping they flip the switch and enable wsg/av &amp; save bwl for a later date at the very least.

Cries in 45

&gt; Go learn a thing or two about the topic you are arguing about yourself i

you're chatting  at least as much unsupported shit just as much as the guy you're responding to
---
youre playing video games all day
---
litcherally unplayable
---
It’s fucking diabolical!
---
Ahh, ok.. i wonder what the priority order is then.
---
When "pservers" is used on this subreddit, 90% of the time its referring to the popular servers that used Nostalrius core with a goal of being blizzlike.
---
Link? I want to see the stupid cringe drama
---
Where those 350,000 viewers now tho.
---
I didn’t say anything about unhealthy obsession with the game. I was more commenting with other stories I’ve heard in mind, like a guy who had to wait till his wife fell asleep and sneak on so he wouldn’t get shit on for playing at all. If my comment read as defending no life-ing to the detriment of other responsibilities, that wasn’t my intention.
---
That no changes shit ain't looking too good now eh?
---
This UI hurts to look at.
---
It literally just got released, relax.
---
Huh.. thats the issue with so much false ingo flying around all the time. I had read a fair few times that the way i mentioned was how it worked
---
Medium pop servers definitely work...now. who knows about the future?
---
That's the worry - the fact that I can find dungeons groups to any dungeon 24h a day means (to me) that come 6 months down the line ill still have people around in the wider community to pug and group with. I wouldn't be so sure on a medium pop server now. Yes they are bigger than original full servers, but the player drop-off is likely to be 10x more than back then
---
At some point (I don’t remember when) you will train Beast Lore that you can use to see a beasts natural abilities. It will tell you if it has bite, claw, dash etc. Petopedia also has a list of which pets you can learn these abilities from. What you do is stable your pet, go out and train a pet with an ability you want, kill some mobs with and eventually in your chat it will pop up and say something like You Have Learned Claw (rank 1). You can then abandon that pet and go back and teach it to your main pet. Cats have good dps so I’d stick with what you have and train it the abilities you want. I have claw &amp; dash and do just fine with those.
---
Not sure on exact amount. Wowhead says 70K+ health.
---
That's funny because Nost had 10k players on one realm
---
Glad to hear it’s still going on I racked up 202 kills in an hour before work, hopefully it’s still going strong when I get out
---
I now want to apply this to all facets of anyone's job. Could you imagine sitting in a meeting in a conference room and saying this? If someone said this, straight-faced, to my boss in a meeting on Monday I might applaud.
---
There is a queue priority. First on, first in. That’s the only fair way to do it.
---
lmao dude I just began wow so I had/have no idea what I'm doing for the most part. it was only until now that I even knew you could be honored with a faction
---
This is beautiful
---
Paid server boosts
---
Yeah, I just poked my head out to see if anything was going down, just a bunch of Alliance holding Horde in the building of Kargath in the Badlands and the Horde spamming AOE on the entrance. Both servers (Skeram and Heartseeker) are mirrors of each other, am hoping it improves, shit is boring.
---
Most leveling dungeons outside of SM you might get in 1-2 each night. It’s hard to run anything 10x a day on a low pop. Plus it’s hard to be properly geared to get your pre-BiS if you only quest.
---
Na, you are the one projecting emotions on internet comments and following me around. Sad.
---
How do you prioritize?  It would totally break the queue system and constantly push people higher in the queue on the majority faction.
---
Classic &gt; vanilla
---
&gt;They sustained 10k+ people concurrently during peak hours for months
---
No, they didn't. There were constant restarts and crashes. 
---
I'm not even defending Blizzard here. But the "muh private servers were literally perfect" mentality is so fucking stupid and disingenuous.
---
Real PvP lives in lowsec
---
queues were a problem in classic
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"gtfo blackrock's full"
---
problems of megaservers lol, heartseeker is having plenty of 150v150 battles and not getting any lag. Should of listened to the many warnings and xferred to a lower pop
---
Doesn’t matter until next week, apart from having to see 1 DHK on your honor interface for the rest of the game
---
Why do so many AH users list an item for 1c and then the buy out price they want to achieve?
---
Track humanoid with a macro for pet to attack whoever's you're camping. They arent getting away no matter what they try.
---
I kinda feel sick that I used to do this way back in 2006. Now I dont touch ally just cause I feel bad for them being out numbered on my server.
---
Lost the roll on a Staff of Dominance from Golemagg, looted it to himself anyway, then gloated about it.
---
Which dungeons? From what I read on other threads, the pet will have a very large aggro radius, so it's not suitable for some dungeons.
---
If I was a regular member of an online message board dedicated to finding examples of what people on Reddit talk about, then that would be equivalent, and no it would not be (much) better.
---
you have to look at it from different angle.... yeah it would be bad at first but it would lead to better and faster balance. some from the dominating faction would transfer away and others from another realm would transfer in (from the non domiminating side)... in a perfect world, balance would be much better...... in a perfect world :-D 
---
honestly i dont think there is any good solution for the issues we r having on almost all servers.... blizz fucked up with opening too few servers and opening more now wont help couse ppl will simply not leave their guilds, friends or just risk transfering to dead sever with no option to going back or somewhere else
---
server lag has nothing to do with ddos LMAO
---
They need to fix this ASAP this looks really bad on them as a company and is completely unacceptable.
---
Used to have a steady and (relatively considering it was very good stuff) cheap coke connect, and got myself to SMFC on csgo during that time. Haven't reached that peak since. I honestly think I wasn't any better (maybe was worse) mechanically, but I didn't get tilted ever.
---
Hunters are definitely worse cause they're just better gankers.
---
Fuxk man I don’t have a cocaine problem. I just do it because I love the smell
---
WELL IM NOT BASEMENT RUSSIANS.
---
ZA WARUDO!
---
The servers are getting DDoSed as it clearly mentions in the launcher. Learn to read.
---
Those are some bad questions.
---
Paladins are amazing dungeon tanks! They can totally work in raids as well, but cant MT all bosses that requires taunt because of threat reset. I've offtanked several times in MC already without any issues. 
---
There's a cool trick with greater blessing of kings where you generate 114 threat for each person you buff (Spell level(60) \* 1.9 (Righteous Fury)). So if there's 7 players of one class you generate 800 threat every 1,5 sec for 150 mana.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qv-Povncwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qv-Povncwo) 
---
Here's a cool video of a pally tanking Onyxia early in classic with GBoK spam:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTSzhJTHS5I&amp;t=37s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTSzhJTHS5I&amp;t=37s) 
---
So with things like innervate from a druid and major mana potions you literally can't loose aggro as long as there are no threat reset, like there is in Onyxia phase 2 for example.  
---
And ofc paladins are the best AOE tanks!
---
How would separating the queue be unfair for the horde? Fair is 50/50, right?
---
And you are laying the blame on the victim, rather than on the perpetrator.
---
You can almost hear the larry david curb your enthusiasm music getting ready to play.
---
that looks better than OP but I think that dude is still taking 3-5 seconds to cast his instant cast corruption
---
hard to tell tho
---
link to bluepost plz? just looked for it but couldn't find anything
---
Ok boomer
---
The fix is to introduce battlegrounds. Likely next week considering all the backlash they are getting right now.  I would almost say it’s guaranteed at this point.  If subs start dropping the money machine will force the devs to release its, whether it’s ready or not.
---
You can’t touch me.  Literally.  You would be impaled by my sweet shoulder and head blades.
---
Depends on the server but R10 is not that hard to get. 2-3 hours of pvp a day and you should get it in a few weeks.
---
DDoS, learn to read.
---
aint much fun as a Rogue lel

You still need the riding skill which is the more expensive part. So not exactly worth that much, I'm with many others in this thread though and any reserves outside of first orbs, I just avoid the group and I dont even need anything 99% of the time anymore.
---
And there was barely any lagg. I was afraid of a crash after hearing so many stories of blizz servers. But luckily this server can handle 700players in one zone pvping.
---
Kazzak was downed by &lt;Fury&gt; of Fairbanks at 12:01 PST!
---
Proof? That's literally how the loot works... that's literally how its' explained by the devs to work...
---
He will simply buy new account on ebay :)
---
but EVERYONE needs to know he ninja'd!
---
If you get another DPS you dont get any WF, so thats just silly.
---
I mean...this type of thing is fine for pro-gamers. But its hard to be really a pro gamer for WoW like it is for Dota, LoL or CSGO. Lack of necessary support, infrastructure and organisation.
---
Reddit's mostly kiberals.
---
I've been playing slowly since launch and I'm only level 38. You're doing great.
---
Is this that gnome dude? 
---
I mean, what kind of behavior do you expect from someone who speed runs?
---
North, Iron Edge, Return
---
The guild who got there first and was almost done killing him is Mandate of Heaven
---
This shill glows
---
Any solutions to emote sounds suddenly dropping off? No sound settings have been changed, they've just disappeared! I need the hilarity of /cheer /silly and /train back in my life!
---
The issue is the server architecture. The only way to fix it is to move back to physical machines for their servers which they won't do.
---
North, Iron Edge, Return 
---
Yeah the current Servers or the new Client are just not made for a Game with 1000 Players in the same Area.
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad. Even on a 50/50 server the horde is dominant because they’re more pvp oriented and just have more will to fight.
---
...yes it does...
---
Well, you gotta pair the off hand with a main hand sword or dagger. Then just use whichever combo gives more of the stats you want. 1h and offhand combos trend towards more raw spell power and staves towards more raw stats but there are exceptions each way.
---
Seriously? Is there a video? 
---
Sounds great
---
Imagine how much pussy it got him, too
---
Still 40 more than he will ever have IRL
---
BGS give points for doing stuff and you dont get end up killing the same person to many times.
---
you honestly belive that? just because they said that they had secutiry doesnt mean its actually true.
---
You really are boring. Try harder.
---
This is clearly not “working as intended”, hope u get it back
---
i love thunderfury both sides seem nice.  I'm new and get help from the horde with my questions.  ive been almost dead from mobs and twice alliance had saved me.
---
lol youre a blizzard sheep
---
Na
---
Dude literally same. Have a 60 hunter with 5/8 giant stalker and just got rogue to 60 with warrior and priest in 40’s. All of them quit but one, so annoying but I have made tons of new friends along the way. Would not be addicted to this game if it wasn’t for the original scummy “RL” friends lol.
---
Halfway to 60
---
It's automated. Extra couple bucks a month is worth it if it doesn't cost you anything.
---
Sorry, I meant riven spike. They share same name, different duration. I don't think we'd built annihilator yet at the time.
---
Panty Ninjas. 
---
A friend of mine raided with them once. He said it sounded like Darthjarjar was in a public place the noise from his headset was so loud. Children crying, adults yelling, random music, car horns. My friend said it wa ridiculous. 
---
I was not surprised to find out he was a ninja looter too.
---
The epidome of human intellectual conversation
---
Yeah, something like that
---
I noticed all kinds of nervous ticks after he did it. Although, that could simply be related to him being a complete weirdo and lacking social development, too.
---
either way paying customers will still have to wait in queue. We're outnumbered 4:1 on my server but asking for a faction based queue is asking for special treatment? rly?

It would encourage both online balance and total faction balance for transfers.  That's always a good thing.

You should've known that. With the honor system out, people are going to form raids steamrolling over 50+ zones every evening.
---
Screenshots are not needed of course, but next time he should provide a time frame, server and party lead/Guild host if possible. I can write a ticket saying someone ninja'd X item pretty easily, the more information provided the less the GMs have to dig and ultimately stacks the odds in your favour because you've already built a case against them.
---
Moving out of his parents basement, his actual situation, surely took a bit of a hit.
---
You're not really being exploited though? You're getting what you need, they get what they need. If you don't like it, don't join or god forbid, just leave the group.
---
it's because they reduced the distance at which you see players, although you can still have issues
---
Oof good luck ranking

that helm is so good that if you ninjaed it someone would make a 20k upvote reddit post about it. God dayum
---
I've seen plenty of people comment that they got back into retail because of Classic. Even the ones who are playing Classic only are subscribers now when they hadn't been before.
---
The team working on Classic probably cares about the game, but the higher ups 100% are just looking for the extra subscribers and the possibility of converting Classic players into also being retail players.
---
atleast athene was joking and doing it for views
---
We went there and found Alliance already totally overrun.
---
55 plus is really fun anyway - you can do end game content and work towards gear nicely. Heck out quest chains with decent gear or just good quests even like fordring in epl
---
Annnnnd left click!

Correct me if im wrong, but I dont think dishonorable kills matters anything in this week since there's no honor or rank to lose.

---
Meh, it's 5g or whatever to anyone regardless of class/spec. Realistically everyone should get fair roll on those.
---
Demonic Runes should 100% be given to healers though.
---
Warrior mount should just be running really fast tbh.
---
You're not exactly very bright, are you?
---
Yes they fucking did have 10k+ players playing concurrently on their servers during peak hours for months. The population data is literally still available. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
And there's countless large scale wpvp battles from private servers that you will NEVER see in Classic because of lag. Did it lag a bit on pservers when there were a lot of people? Yes. But not to the literally unplayable degree in Classic. Get Blizzard's balls out of your damn mouths you pathetic losers. People like you sucking on Blizzard's teet and defending everything they do saying they know better or how something won't be a problem or stop complaining is why we have the shit we have now.
---
By the fucking way, we are comparing BLIZZARD a multibillion dollar company to a bunch of basement dwelling NEETs. Just stfu, this is Blizzard's fault no matter what and it is INEXCUSABLE for how much resources they have. Just stfu.
---
Handsomest WoW personality ever
---
&gt; but I don't think that is true.
---
You're wrong.
---
Tbh I advise that you should play retail first, it’s nothing like classic
---
It's not griefing if they have a legit reason to kill him.
---
Hence why in OPs blizzard post they specifically mention level 1s. It's only griefing if you dont intend on downing boss/using gear.
---
Don't listen to that guy.
---
Yeah. When I hear that whoosh sound and my spy addon alerts to a hunter, I will take the time to find them. All because of you, stickybeard.
---
Mages are definitely my favorite class to gank as a nelf Druid.
---
Is Herod down?  I havent been able to get in for hours. Blizz claiming DDOS again...
---
Not sure as to what the conversion is but go out kill alliance/horde and you will find out next Tuesday.
---
&lt;screams in exactly level 48&gt;
---
I hope not because if so that guy just killed it for 39 people
---
Yep that's absolutely the classic experience there. Lagging out sucks but fighting everyone else for a raid boss is 100% part of the fun.
---
unless youre on a pvp server currently
---
&gt;seattle
---
kek, that's because they all eat trash off the street
---
Being a level 25 just watching this happen, wow. It's been utterly insane to see this. So much Horde, so much Alliance and so much lag...
---
Do Mages that aoe get more honor than a single target warrior or rogue?
---
Since they refuse to release BGs Wpvp is the ONLY content right now for pvpers.
---
No one will take a pug 55 to Scholo. 
---
Try for Lbrs groups - even that will be a stretch from trade chat at 55. Or BRD runs to 57.
---
After two hours farming in hillsbrad, I have 1000 HK. But that's worth maybe 2.5-3.5k honour since most kills were 1-5 honour estimated. Compare that to ganking randoms in a three man group that netted between 30 and 70 each.
---
Ok
---
World first 60 is great and all in the first couple months but do people even care any more?
---
How many players on backstreet Russian server ?
---
Just dinged 57 today, the last three are going to be a nightmare, if today was any indication.
---
They will count against your soul for now.
---
One more.
---
me too bro, 58.25 on whitemane. im fucked currently
---
Oh hell yeah, gonna grind that and brd until 60. Thanks!
---
Yah, call me in 2 weeks to see this.   Call me when BGs are around...
---
I was told hunter would be one of the most played just like in vanilla. I made it to 60 only ever grouping with 1 hunter. My guild runs 2 40 mana each week and has 1 hunter in each 40 man raid. They are nowhere
---
Honest;y no idea what you guys are talking about, and I'm playing on Farelina. Maybe get a better computer?
---
I really hope medium pop servers thrive and succeed and the community aspect is definitely better than a huge server...but the argument that they are bigger than full servers way back when doesn't account for how players can easily get bored of the game now, compared to it being a completely fresh and innovative change in the 2005 mmo scene.
---
yes it does lol
---
It's just that it is exponentially more expensive so not worth at all

Yeah world PvP is going to be a shitshow for a lot of reasons sadly. I'm hoping when BG's come out world PvP actually turns back to what it was in vanilla.. namely "fun".

Would rather earn triple that without having to be "on" for the audience, then play video games half the day if i want to. To each his own though.
---
petopia's abilities page will show which creatures know each ability. Key will be picking the family you want (say cat for example) then just looking at that list every 10 levels (or plan it ahead) to know at what level you can stable that current pet and go grab a new rank of claw/bite/prowl/dash whatever.

Recommend some better ones.

Hahaha

why dont you people just wont ignore and move on? why so you make more and more posts? can you STOP making such assholes more famous? dont you realize your attention gets them more and more exposure = money? ...rant over

Nah, he is killing his doppelganger.
---
Exactly, I found my reactions were on point as I usually was the main awper when in teams/scrims but when in MM I'd usually get myself an AK and just go ham. I used to love wingman when that first come out and I was still doing a bit on the side. I didn't even plug my mic in, I just smoked a shit load of weed and sniffed lines during time outs or in between games and still made it to global elite with no comms, MM is pretty easy when you've been playing competitively since 1.6
---
Reset your UI.
---
I like to watch/listen to the instance podcast
---
Who cares what the estimated problem size is? They 100% CAN fix it, and they aren't going to.
---
What are you on about. 15 vs 15 is 30. Any world boss has that and no lag. Also if no gm uncle your guesswork is just that.
---
Be told to migrate off, but can't migrate off. At least on stalagg
---
Maybe Athene took influences from Jokerd
---
It always comes back to the transphobia with these dickheads. Hope there’s an internet law about it.

Yes, they will take you from rank 0 down to rank 0

Left out the B.

Need more BOOM 💥
---
Fastest attack speed pet in the game. Good for pvp against casters.
---
Stop crying allí cry so much
---
I forget how shitty honor is and now and now i think i will stop playing until ppl stop playin or i will rerol to pve server
---
celebrate and pop some confetti
---
I honestly regret rolling on a mid pop server (Thunderfury). Got full prebis with some raid pieces warlock and a pre bis warrior, and feel like it was a ocmplete was of time. I re rolled on Farelina a couple weeks ago, almost got a mage to 60.
---
Go via the back door imo its never camped
---
Making a factual comparison to a political figure isn’t neccessarily making a political statement.

---
Shamans have AOE....

Sulfuras gang for life.
---
Same. I overestimated how much time I would be putting into this game. Phase 2 may have killed it for me :(
---
lol seriously, you won't do res runs, except the times you needed to get your mates gear. I have no idea what you mean with this sentence though
---
&gt;  But the runs weren't at the time
---
It happens on every server. You simply cannot have 100 vs 100 fights without some lag, also I'm not complaining, was just reading comments and replying. This kind of lag isn't client side.
---
Back in the day it took me a while to realize Athene was just a troll, and he actually seemed like a good guy when the veil dropped. 
---
Jokerd on the other hand... woof. This quote is like a bad copypasta.

ill type out the most best items if thats ok?
---
Warrior:
---
Deathbringer
---
Brutality Blade
---
Lionheart Helm
---
Hand of Justice
---
Flamcore Gauntlets
---
a few T0 pieces, Cadaverous Armor and Devilsaur Pants
---
Shaman:
---
Staff of Dominanz
---
T2 Helmet
---
Briarwood Reed
---
Skyshroud Leggins
---
Denwatchers Shoulders
---
Sublime Wristguards
---
Royal Seal of Eldre Thalas and some other random Spelldmg gear
---
they are positioning shadowlands as the hook to get classic players on retail
---
Gotta use that Teamviewer.
---
It depends on the moment.  A rogue said, "let's go fuck up alliance questing" in local.  I did not stop when I saw him getting jumped by multiple alliance.
---
I take the benefit of the doubt when I see fights.  But if I know enough about what is going on or suspect, I'm not going to be complicit in your gank or griefing.  I even the field.  I don't finish something you were dumb enough to start.
---
Making sure my single target talents are all taken, ice block and barrier, and the rest go arcane. Personally, I have 2 talents in the silence on counterspell for pvp but everything else is raid talents
---
Most of the time it's because Druids are such a nice matchup against mages, there were a lot of mages that seemed kinda broken after the sheep turned into a cat.
---
Oh no our discord is starting to follow me to reddit
---
I am abled to :D but had no time cause we were grinding straight for 6 hours now. Only logged in on phone ;)
---
Thanks, I really don't know anything about this honor system except you have to farm.
---
I did the rank 14 pvp grind. And when you’re at a high rank it can really kill your progression. I would not worry about it at the moment. Try not to get any more, avoid large groups you are u familiar with for that reason. If you find yourself wanting to push rankings in pvp that’s when you want to avoid dhks heavily. A few during this first week isn’t gonna end up causing yourself trouble. Once you’re into your ranks 
---
 you will see a decrease in your progression bar to the next rank if you do get dhks.
---
I remember when I dropped to warlord I went on a dhk spree and I went from rank 13 to 7 in one sitting in a main city.
---
In some cases it's greed, in other's it's just people wanted to create groups without competing for loot. Most people don't understand that and some people who are completely anti-reserve have no problems just forming groups and excluding classes who might compete with gear they want which is basically reserving loot but just not outright saying it.
---
At least if you state you're reserving loot you provide the option for competing classes that don't actually want said item which is better for all parties involved
---
Yup. I don’t know the details but I was online for two of them spawning.
---
Uncontested mobs, as in the only person farming them...?
---
i only care that he lost his sponsorship. i love it when things like that happens to spergs like that.
---
My guild is setting up 5 mans to do just that
---
Watch asmon or advertise lol, there is no "slideshow lag", nor have I experienced it in huge battles on the same server.
---
Well, for the battle of Hillsbrad I'd Say, Warrs/Pallys/Beefy melee peel for healers, get rouges trying to make picks. Then push with your allies when you got them on their heels. Rogues/ferals try to make pickson the healers and squishies.
---
Thank you!
---
we gathered
---
Fair point, most is preferences. However when you find a friendly alliance on a pvp server it makes it that much more satisfying.
---
People bid on low prices, then continue to bid since you get chat notifications, so it's a nice way to guarantee a sale though you risk selling low
---
I just wanna transfer my bis warlock from my dead server (thunderufry) to farelina
---
51 warrior here.. i feel you man :/.
---
Once you have a rank, it will derank you immediately.  I would imagine that dhks just apply a negative to your current rank, not your honor.  You have zero rank points right now.  Your honor won't be calculated until next week.
---
&gt; I can do whatever the fuck I want
---
Except be part of Method
---
Yes, decrease server population.
---
I think our guild has a Mage-powerfield. We had like...Way too many in all of our raids, and our socials are mostly mages, too.
---
Many of the people who don't get the "we're not recruiting" message attached to our forum post are also mages fwiw.
---
We're Magetown, essentially. At least we can drown Rag in Level 55 Magewater!
---
This has been a problem long before today
---
Thanks, I don't except to achieve rank 14, but even If I did achieve this rank, would I still be able to purchase ''honor'' items if I had to drop rank 14 to less ?
---
Agree. Today was not like any DDoS I’ve experienced before. I lagged out twice when no one else seemingly did. I can’t believe the two are related.
---
Classic is not as worthy. People tend to invest more time on classic because there are little to no timeout and it requires a lot of work on their infrastructure.
---
Retail has many incentives for players to play a little everyday, that's why there are so many daily quests and daily crafts.  That way people play 20mn a day, 2 or 3 hours on the week end to do a raid using the dungeon finder and pay as much as a Classic player.
---
Same goes with Hearthstone, Activision's second most successful game after Candy Crush, people play a little every day while paying a little time every day.
---
I still think it's a massive mistake to release the honor system without any battlegrounds.
---
I'm using StealYourCarbon, works fine for me.

You say "Many", I say "Some". The vast majority of celebrities either try to do their best to ignore the public attention and live their lives as normal, or take advantage of the eyes on them by taking as many brand deals as possible and spending all their time shilling stuff for extra money.

Then you have people like Gwyneth Paltrow who support anti-vaxxers and sell €50 eggs to shove into one's vagina to protect you from psychic vampires.

A celebrity who is a good role model is a one in a million.
---
Killing solo gives 199 honor at max right now. 99 in a duo.
---
but if people are talking NOW and saying TODAY they are empty then that fact is relevant.
---
long term i agree 100% but to the guy saying he can't find a group on a medium server today that conflicts with my experience and the fact that that server is technically larger than full vanillas is relevant.
---
I agree though being on a medium like i said before i'm worried the player base will drop down to low once the hype dies and people leave.
---
I dont know her.
---
No go anywhere where all.the players are congested into one spot, look at Esfand right now, there are maybe 30 people scattered around, now go the hut in Kargath on Heartseeker where there are 100 people spamming Blizzard and Rain of Fire. Lag.
---
A lot of healers are either helping friends or they include arglemach which drops a healer trinket and boots.
---
In this case absolutely not. Believe it or not stuff like this does not directly violate t.o.s. (only case blizz bans is map swapping, going to dev maps like gm island which no longer exist)  it's only really falls under I think the cheating section which basically states at the end of all of it "using it to gain unfair advantage of other players" and since this technically doesn't serve any purpose or grant me any advantage in any way it doesn't necessarily fall under the cheating guideline. Now if I did something like this with a mage and sniped hordies up here that would get me banned. it's all sort of a complex debatable thing really but this is my impression of the t.o.s. I'd pull up the actual t.o.s. text but to lazy right now 😂 and I know many explorers who have been doing it for 15 years and never even once been contacted by a gm let alone banned.
---
Way to move the goalposts, like the cromagnan you are.
---
Dude the world pvp on the way is great! Got my hunter to 60 and dont like it. Leveling rogue and just hit 32! Going to go be a dick and ruin everyone's lives in hillsbrad for the next 4 days. I plan on killing everyone on my server and I already got a 400+ kill count on this rogue alone. Bring the pain because I can handle it and I dish it out 100 fold more.
---
Godking Jokerd. What an absolute fucking tool lmao

Used to be at 17k consistently when I played.

Turned on esfands stream for 10 seconds, theres no lag lol. Are you esfanf trying to trick me into watching you? This is getting major sus theses random bot accounts complaining about lag that doesnt exist.
---
To be fair, hacking and cheating is constant on private servers. There are a shitload of backend processes to prevent these things from happening in Classic and those things all cost a lot of resources.
---
there’s PVE servers lil guy
---
aKcHuaLLy GuuuIZe!!!
---
Save it, neckbeard.
---
I agree that geared soul link locks are top tier 1v1 specialists however duels artificially limits the scope of pvp. And the thread is about regret of rolling on pvp server and world pvp. In world pvp, rogues don't need to worry about "losing" if they get too far from the duel flag. They can pretty much gouge and reset whenever they want. All they need to do is win attrition vs locks, and they can do so very well with all their cds. A rogue in wpvp can go far just by killing the lock's pet over and over again and either blinding/sapping/sprinting away whenever the lock tries to fight.
---
My pleasure thank you so much :3
---
*healers.
---
Celestial orb alone makes it worth it to use it and witchblade, and spirit of aquamentas or drakestone of frozen wrath just make it better. No staffs can quite match the equivalent 1h/OH combo for mages.
---
That said I am currently using the staff of the ogre magi when my celestial orb is on cooldown, because I haven't gotten witchblade or spirit of aquamentas yet and it's like 3dph more than what I have
---
It wasn't *perfect* but it worked quite well, to be honest. Much better than what Classic is.
---
Too much. Now that honor is out alliance are even more pussies.
---
Classic subscriptions costs the same, why do they want to hook us into retail?
---
You seem like an asshole. A ui reset isn't going to fix this.
---
Do the 8 dishonorable kills really affect the ranking that much? Compared to 2000+ honorable kills?
---
Noggenfogger did fine.
---
sure it was a lag fest around the boss, but the server didn't crash, and other zones worked like normal
---
We got the gold though.
---
Alliance are definitely more cowardly than horde (I say that as alliance), but its from always being the minority. 
---
If you turn up to grind satyrs and there's 2 horde there you just start grinding passively and hope they ignore you - because you arent winning that 2v1. If you start pvp any victory you get will be short lived, because the hard fact is there are more horde and whether its in 5 minutes or 50...you will be forced away from what you want to do. Repeat this for every quest/grind spot and you have a passive mentality where your first instinct is to not start a war because you'll lose.
---
Estimated honor points: 1 lol only 198 kills to go until you're at the same amount of honor for winning a 1v1.
---
I wish servers could handle these battles. It takes like 10 seconds for my server to recognize that you’ve died.
---
had to put the meme after
---
HealCommClassic 3 is dead, it was just temporary to get addons working, all unit frames addons are switching to the HealComm 4 which is being maintained. Someone made a wrapper addon that will intake data from 3 and 4. But really everyone should be switching to the now maintained 4.

sounds like a team version of devilsaur camping. Which I did love doing solo, but sounds a bit less fun in a group
---
the first timer is always correct, it seems to shift about 2 seconds each consecutive cast though
---
rogues should be stealthing behind the lines and taking out healers or the clothie aoers themselves.
---
warriors should be getting heals and charging through to break up the enemy and get to the healers
---
priests can be dotting or healing
---
shamans have aoe or are healing
---
Funny cuz loud
---
I finally hit level 60 today so now I get start playing the game.
---
im a gnome so alliance  :D
---
Earthfury is actually panning out to be a decent server as it appears most people choose to transfer here.
---
awesome man i appreciate that .
---
So other question, can the times just spawn nothing? Or does that mean something spawned but we can’t loot it?
---
It stacks in name, but the armor debuffs don't actually stack (you don't get the numerical benefit). I'm assuming with debuff limits puncture is very low priority if sunder is up. That's a bit of speculation on my party though.
---
Curse of recklessness I think. My biggest issue with fear juggling is that the feared mob almost always pulls another mob or 3
---
Other reservations aren't bad when done in moderation (It's just greedy when done excessively). Some people just get really hung up and angry over them for some reason even though in reality it's just more efficient for everyone involved to create groups that aren't competing for the same items.
---
It's harder due to how twitch works to go from 2 viewers to 20 than from 200 to 2000.
---
Iirc I was a video about 500 DK's were enough to drop you from rank 11 back to rank 1
---
Why cant they buddy?
---
I cant see any honor, only kills even restarted
---
Mannnn why you gotta blow my ears away?
---
It’s also too bad adderall doesn’t affect me like it affects people that don’t have ADHD and abuse adderall.  Always wanted to know what “looking smart by being intensely focused” was like, but all the people I see that take it just kinda twitch and act methy.
---
Ok boomkin
---
Why =(
---
To be fair we also use our assigned curse and keep corr up  :)
---
If i log out in MC will i get thrown out from there?
---
At least AV is limited to 40v40, not 300+v300+.
---
Thank FUCK Earthshaker EU is a mostly balanced server! Cant imagine what it's like on those with 95% horde pop.
---
You get reputation for completing quests for people of that faction. Complete one for someone with the Orgrimmar faction and you’ll probably see some blue text (using default settings, no addons) under the Quest Complete message in the chat box saying you gained some amount of reputation. You can check how close you are to honored in the reputation tab of your character menu
---
Yes arcane wrath leather/mail is a noob trap
---
If anyone knows how the honor points will work lmk
---
I know u can only get max rank of 3 or 4
---
Or so I think
---
That's not even grammar, it's a complete lack of understanding of what the word, "of" means
---
\^my noob night-elf hunter ass at level 27.
---
I’m not, if you read the last sentence of my comment :)
---
Do you really believe that they are at that point? Or do you think that they could improve on the servers. I think its the latter.
---
I’m not, if you read the last sentence of my post :)
---
And. The boss will aoe everyone near him
---
Zerg pvp had never been good
---
Absolute garbage
---
Depends on your realm and what other people do.
---
You're competing against other players on your faction on your realm. Rankings depends on where you place at the end of the week on your realm. 
---
As for dishonorable kills at low levels its hard to say. Since we're all starting at 0 honor and no ranks I dont know what impact dishonorable kills will have at that level compared to higher ranks.
---
"That size", as is shown in the screenshot isnt very big though. Try 3 times that size.
---
Benediction server here. I did not have the same experience today. Today we owned the horde in south shore and Blackrock mountain. It was amazing.
---
The way I figured was getting a dishonorable kill instantly lowered your rank(Not at weekly rank calculation). So you being level 0 you arent losing anything at the moment.
---
Holy fuck someone's a little grumpy
---
How can I get a threat meter working? I thought details added a threat meter but I can't figure out how to turn it on.
---
I live in VA too (lol) and got a personalized plate that says “DKPMNUS” and now my husband calls our Tahoe the dick penis mobile :(
---
On a side note, I saw a sedan with “6DMNBAG”  on its plate and almost drove off the road grinning like a huge fanboy.
---
Also, fuck Jokerd.
---
Yeah this is not worth it. I was doing it for a while by keeping my character logged in using teamviewer. Many times I would d/c when grabbing some food or just stepping away for 5 mins and end up back in the queue anyway. What an enormous waste of time and effort trying to keep myself logged in.
---
Short answer: pvp UD. Pve Troll. 
---
Better answer. Go wity the one you will enjoy playing, take a look at some videos. Look at how  they move, how their skill animations look, etc. I personally really love how trolls attack and switch stances. Thats honestly the biggest thing for me. Im going to be spending a lot of time looking at my character so I better like how my character moves. 
---
One last thing. I think trolls are easier to lvl. Nore regen, regen in combat and an attack speed steroid for 5 rage. Get some trolls blood pots and your lvling experience should be smooth
---
Was a fun kill
---
As a noob what does the ranks give you? 
---
Items? Or just a „rank“ like in competitive shooters or mobas
---
But that Lumbago guy kicked ass.
---
Narcissist are that distinct from Sociopaths/psychopaths that one could not mistake one from the other? Or is it some pseudoscience shit like you find in Fitness and Nutrition, and this is all really semantics
---
Wrath was a literal decade ago.
---
I watched Asmongold ragequit Sekiro in Hirata, not even getting to Lady Butterfly. The boy's soft.
---
Ok try that. When you can't get out of it go in keybind and put the same keybind on the second spot. Sometimes the key was acting like if i was on Shift so it was not "1" anymore but "!". Like this you'll have both key for stealth. I hope it helps and that this is your problem cause it happened to me and it was really frustrating.
---
BAHAHA!!!! get IT!
---
Highest rank you can get this week is 4. 
---
Curious how many of these kills don't count to your honour though lol. 10% less for each repeated kill on any individual player.
---
What. A. Fucking. Loser.
---
i like 21/8/22 daggers, but hemo is good too. however I'd say if you want to be able to kill things easily /easier in pve out in the world hemo wins out
---
Imagine you having to play a tank. A class which has most of the time no much (/sub bar) use except for dungeon and raid boss tanking. It definetly takes much longer to do world related stuff such as farming by killing pvping etc. Now also imagine you carrying literally bean brained 3-7 DPS apes all day and then letting them roll on the same shitty items as you are. I like tanking but I am not masochistic enough to let DPS roll on my items and sht talk me on reddit.
---
That awkward moment when Classic players torn between their love of vanilla and their hate for retail realize their subscription pays for both
---
Gesundheit
---
Because talking to someone who is talking out of his ass is enraging.
---
we dont have hotpockets in malta :(
---
It depends entirely on who's reserving what items. Sure if some DPS is reserving a bunch of tank gear then they will be looking forever to find a group, while on the flip side a tank can basically find a group instantly while reserving whatever he wants.
---
Just because they are squashing lvl limit to 60? 
---
Jokes aside, i personally couldnt give a damn about shadowlands, last retail version i played was Legion and it was already terrible (raids were cool tho). Whats shacowland's catch? How will it hook up classic players? Genuniely curious.
---
Hey that’s the enchanter guy
---
World bosses always lag.
---
Actually Gusy had first attempt and alliance guilds started griefing. This is just not on record yet
---
If you guys were just guildies and looking to raid in thr future he should definitely pass the drakestone to you as locks are much higher dps.
---
 As you guys are irl friends a roll would suffice, but as a lock i would be pissed if i lost a stone to a shadow priest lol
---
Are you me?
---
Then they ran down the canyon and killed you anyways lol
---
Yea ur right
---
Unlikely really. He abused layering to a massive scale, you can't replicate having 3+ layers of elites to AoE down.
---
Shadowmeld is for afk to lazy to log out, aka me.
---
Same with Kargath
---
I agree, but my man, anyone reading your post is almost immediately going to label you the asshole talking out of his ass. Just food for thought I dont really care I'm just high af having a good time lol
---
I never enjoyed giant world pvp battles. Roaming with a 3-5 man group was always more fun.

---
There shouldn’t be paid character transfers imo. 
---
Characters should live or die on the server they are born on. Allowing paid transfers removes the sunk cost to ruining your name on your server. I’m convinced it’s why generally people on classic are nicer than on the anti-social retail version. 
---
What I would accept is character boosts. But not insta ding you’re 60!... it should be $60 for 0-60 rested Xp... or $1 for 100% of a level of rested.
---
It’s between 3-22
---
Sometimes some big ones
---
Honestly that addon should be banned. It pretty much breaks Rogues.
---
I ask because I’ve had a couple empty times. Haven’t completed any of the quests tho.
---
They will make classic+. Why would cost/benefit not be there, when you got millions of people waiting to throw their wallets at you?
---
Everything you said is false and made up.
---
That shit drops every week
---
This sub is borderline garbage. Same low effort “small indie hurrrrrr” “content” every day. Your post is worse than his comment. You added nothing new to a well known issue and well discussed topic.
---
Yes they did all that and way more.
---
You're the one that deluded into assuming future outcomes based on... what, your ass?
---
source?
---
Mel...what did I just say about being an asshole
---
The other group didn’t wipe, they just had their MT die. That’s super weird about the gold though.
---
15k
---
You're smug cynicism is almost enough to make me vomit. Can you try presenting your thoughts in a way that's less whiny and  obnoxious?
---
to be fair nine times out of ten horde have the advantage and many alliance players want to avoid helping to only in turn be camped when 10 other horde arrive at the drop of a hat lol. but i enjoy when the odds are against me and always help ally players no matter what.
---
TYVM. Yeah I don't need the gold now. I might hold onto them, since the thing I want to buy is an epic mount. That has a flat price, so as long as the price goes up over time I'm good at the end.
---
Check out eve aether wars and Hadeon, if they can get that working with 10k players online participating in live pvp, then we may be onto having something like this happenings in wow
---
I’m watching a heartseeker streamer right now and there is a ton of lag in Hillsbrad.
---
Why are you lying?
---
This isn’t constructive at all. It’s the same bullshit post we see 4x a day here. What about this post was helpful, insightful, or new? Absolutely nothing. It’s the epitome of low content circle jerking, right down to small indie company
---
Take your time, enjoy it at your own pace and if you don't like your guild, find a new one. No reason to surround yourself with people you don't enjoy playing with.
---
That would have made it even worse. People who hit 60 in a week would have been camping you from day 1. There might even be a few players with rank 12/13 gear by now if PvP rewards were in the game at launch.
---
"Small Indie Company" Such a braindead overused joke. Shit was tired 5 years ago.

---
I've killed this rogue \~6 times (and died by him a few times) over the course of 1 hour. Every single time I got the same amount of honor.
---
I don't have anything else to say. Blizzard, please dont screw this up. This is extremely abusable
---
Is this horde side Kromcrush? On alliance side we have Kromcrush court to deal with ninjas. We’ve had 3 notable trials so far
---
when you have an opportunity to show yourself to 350k viewers and your personality is enough to retain 1.5k average after that.....  That's pretty lame bro.  That's worse than Batwoman.
---
Considering it works by searching combat log I'm not sure how they'd go about banning it
---
On gehennas there's 3-4k que starting from 4-5pm till 9ish every day, regardless of raid day or new phase or anything.
---
This is true, private servers never had this much issues with botting especially.
---
It’s sad.
---
This guy just makes me ashamed to say that im maltese. Fuck sakes

My dad and I joined a pvp server because some of his work friends are on it. We are very casual players, hes got a handful of level 20s and his highest is 41. I've just reached 30 today with one other level 20.. but we both absolutely hate pvp. We might end up switching servers because mostly we either play together or just do pugs
---
Yeah same.. I am 100% on board for retail if they bring back what made the game fun for me. I've nothing against retail.. I just don't enjoy it and haven't for a long time.
---
Herod here, the only laggy area is Hillsbrad, which has way more than this video shows
---
You've already said too much
---
So what you're saying is that you agree with reserve runs when it is for your IRL friends, but disagree with reserve runs when it doesn't personally benefit you or someone you know?  Hmmmm
---
Ahh it looks like both groups were eligible for the loot, wonder what would have happened if both groups were on need before greed?
---
ye because posting is here, is a sure way to keep your secret. lol
---
Im at 54, im about to unsub too, I cant go anywhere without dying

Why would you care? If he wants to preorder he can do it. Whether he regrets it or not, I'm not gonna judge.

Well ive been doing it and its been fast, and with teh aids of honor being added I need all the speed I cna get
---
Yup! I'm playing a feral druid and she's playing a destro lock in classic.
---
In retail, I'm maining a disc priest while she's an enh shaman.
---
WPvP involving more than 40 people will cause crazy lag regardless of total server population.
---
horde
---
Its been insane, every zone is roaming gank squads on both continents
---
Couple of  questions: Im deciding if I want to play wow classic or not. I have never played a wow game before.
---
Most of the time in MMOs I play a game for PVP (larger scale), Dungeons and Raids. Sounds like wow has the second two covered but Im worried that pvp outside of just ganking people isnt really in classic until you are 60. Is that true?
---
When can you start doing dungeons / can you level efficiently from running dungeons?
---
When can you start really getting into PVP / Do we have a date for Battlegrounds?
---
If I play a couple of hours a day, maybe more on sat or sunday, how long would it take my to get to lvl 60?
---
How hard is it to get in a dungeon group, I think I read there is no matchmaking. I do have a couple friends that play but sometimes I might be solo
---
Thanks!
---
F
---
Proof?
---
Ugh I wish I could even quest to get 60 at this point
---
The gift that keeps on giving
---
Those are listing zero bronze for literally every item i search for
---
It's hte opposite lol, character boosts would make 90% quit the game, and a new classic would be needed. We need paid transfers.
---
He complains about getting supposedly "stream snipped" when it's not the case while also having hordies collude by feeding him reck procs and bandaging him on MC.
---
I used to like Esfand but now he's no different to the rest, takes advantage of his streamer prio to the max.
---
I don't disagree. I encourage people to seek out mutually beneficial arrangements!
---
But how did the Uruk-hai know what a menu is?
---
Dude my brothers at 244 on fearlina

ive been bringing my pet in dungeons that are 20 levels higher then him and keep him on passive and he doesnt seem to aggro anything.

If it's blizzlike it just wont show the reduced honor in your combatlog or character sheet but it'll be reduced in the weekly calculations.

Yeah it's really a secret, you idiot

I love this!  /w asshat:  I have a dps on speed dial ready for his summon.  Think about that on the next pull... if you are still here :).

You get a rank and access to buy different items based on your rank.

I planned on skipping class to pvp in Tarren Mill, but it was such a lag fest I actually decided class would be better haha.

Farelina was double that, been waiting for 3 hours now, still 500 in the queue.
---
RRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
How did you do that anyway? Some specific program?
---
I dont think so. Blizzard said you can get maximum 4 honorable kills from the same person before getting to 0 honor. I got HKs for more than 4 kills.
---
im definitely enjoying grobb. it seems very balanced with a strong alliance that enjoys engaging in pvp and protecting lowbies.
---
I'll honk if I see the dick penis Tahoe
---
Yeah, unfortunately it's very tough especially when you miss multiple times in a row, it can be quite frustrating. I personally leveled the entire way to 60 with a healer, although my word of advice for a warrior questing is this:  
---
Level or grind mobs in zones that are roughly 2-4 levels below you. You won't miss nearly as much, can do more mobs without healing, overall just an easier experience.
---
If you think it’s gonna change anything you are a loon. Look as asmongold stream for god sake.
---
Yea I am not adding 2 more corpse runs to my 1 hour journey to BRD.
---
They did happen and the servers actaully handled it way better than now. Stop talking out of your ass mate.
---
not this week since we have no rank currently. so luckily for us the dishonorable kills we get this week will have 0 effect on us. in the future it will immediately reduce your rank.
---
Because you are saying that you want someone to spend their time running you through something without an equal chance at loot. It's offensive and entitled.
---
man if horde is dead on tfury as well im DEFINITELY glad i left it. i was alliance and the towns were just desolate lol
---
Looks like [PW:S has a 10% coefficient](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow#introduction), so yes, every 10 +healing lets the shield absorb 1 more point of damage.

what you can't get through your thick skull is that your actual fucking bank itself is full because of all the different gear sets. that's why I said mage end game is simple, you only need 1 or 2 gear sets max and you can do just about everything a mage can do optimally. I'm a prot paladin. I need a healing set for raids. I need another plate healing set for PVP. I need strength gear to not take 2 hours killing 1 mob when I farm. i need a spell damage set for more threat on fights that need it. this is not even including my resist sets and normal bank shit everyone else has
---
Large scale pvp realistically at max level. Raids are the same but you can take part in both slightly lower. With pvp you would be like a toddler trying to tackle an nfl running back. 
---
Dungeons horde around 13/14. Alliance 16/17. You can level in either. Tanks(warriors mainly though rigid and pally can sup in dungeon ). Will level faster due to fining groups quickly

1-2 months playing 2-4 hours a day. General rule is 7-10 days played to max.

*175% honor
---
Neckbeards mad.
---
You can still get HKs. They just give you 0 honor on the weekly reset.
---
bro, down vote and move on.  you're not helping any one.
---
i think the big thing is bringing difficulty back
---
Since Cata hit rating hasn’t been a thing in retail wow. This means in retail you have 100% chance for your “special” attacks to land, and in practise means you’ll never miss a mortal strike, or a bloodthirst, etc ... ever, at any level vs any opponent. Pretty sure you can still miss with your (dual wield) offhand.
---
Rewind.
---
In classic, hit chance (%), and later in BC/Wrath, hit rating, is a stat like any other that you need to acquire on your gear. Until you have this stat you’ll have 5% chance to miss your main hand attacks and i think 24% chance to miss your offhand attacks when fighting an enemy of the same level as you.
---
You can go read up about this on the wiki or wowhead etc ... but the tl;dr is, you need hit rating to not miss so much, and you can’t really get any until level 50+.
---
For raiding every melee wants 9% hit to not miss special attacks against boss (effectively level 63) mobs. You can reduce this requirement to 6% by having weapon skill for your equipped weapon (human, orc racial, edgemasters gloves, etc) or by having talents that grant hit (rogues precision, etc).
---
Dual wielders want a bit more hit to increase chance for offhand weapon. About 12% is “nice”.
---
So you're suggesting bliz should continue to change things that were "stupid" (in your opinion) from vanilla. Just because they're stupid?
---
Imagine you play a tank and get into dungeon groups instantly and don't have to wait 2 hrs like dps therefore inherently making more gold than dps in dungeons.
---
thanks for this
---
It literally hasn't even been one day and you're on here making posts complaining about it. Log off for a couple days.

See they are missing the point.

I use a non stealth pet on purpose and stay it on your corpse. Just so you know I'm still here, waiting for your ganking ass.

Even better the windy has a 20y range attack. No mount for you.

I play nrds but if spy says you are red, you better believe I'm gonna call you until you log or get friends to help.

WPVP killing more servers.

They will split phase 3 content like they did with phase 2. We will get battlegrounds soon and BWL sometime in the new year. Bank on it

I get you. I figure your bank situation illustrates my point even more just how limited bank space is for hybrids
---
Must be nice being on a balanced server.
---
Herod is like 75% Horde...
---
You help. You don’t pvp to the point you are messing up the brackets . In the guild I was in, and many others there were plenty of people in the rank 10-13 range where it was more beneficial for the rank 14 player to dramatically decrease their pvp. But I see what ya mean

Pretty sure that was a bug back in the day, and yes bugs like this should definately be fixed. It is really stupid, and just because you want an unfair advantage of not letting your opponents know which form you are is ridicilous.

I guess 500usd a month is a good living in malta.

More like you joined a group knowing the reserves, ninjaed somethig, then made a reddit post to try to get ahead of whatever issues you saw in your future.

Nah. It's 100% range control.

Hunter can kill anyone given a 40 yard opening range. Engi can complicate this though.
---
Hunter will lose to casters often with a short range start.

Yeah I didn't sub after the second month because there's no bgs and that's what I enjoy and I saw this coming because I saw YouTube videos of a 120v120 that was a shitfest

There's no way he was serious. I think he low key realized he fucked up but doubled down on it, just making it way worse.

Don't use free charactur migration, they only allow to migrate to dead servers. Just wait for the queues to die down, it sucks to have characters on mid/dead servfers, I have 2 60s on a server that I don't play on anymore.

The guild and I took over an Alliance FP in Felwood a little bit ago, wiped the place and sat on it.  Guild leader says “This isn’t going to last long.”

Minute he said that some guildy in Discord simply says “They are coming” in a very dark, matter of fact voice, Gandalf style.  So many Gryphons I couldn’t believe it, was damn near terrifying.

Lol, there are many "bugs" that never got changed until TBC that are currently still in the game. Again, bliz agrees it's a known issue right now that it doesn't work as intended.
---
You can still know the form, just have to look at Mana/rage/energy bar. 
---
It was an advantage, yes, but that's how it was in vanilla. We can go down the whole path of "let's change things we think are unfair", but it's been decided that we won't. Why should this be ant different? That's what would be ridiculous b
---
non tanks reserving shit is absolutely ridiculous. of course they'll never fill up a group. am I supposed to be surprised by this? in my story my guild had the opportunity to reserve something because they have a dedicated tank that's not even rolling on anything on hand
---
Kurinnaxx has that problem. Wailing Caverns, Mara, BRD, ETC. are just hirde camp zones, it's terribly unbalanced. My corpse has been stuck in Thorium Point for about 4 hours now and I just want to level. But a fuckton of level 60's just want to gang up on a 53 for the hell of it.
---
You can still do everything as a mage. Being able to AoE farm is just a bonus and it adds depth to the leveling experience. Leveling my druid killing mobs with auto attacks 1-on-1 is a gruelling experience compared to my mage leveling.
---
that's if you don't do anything
---
You get honor proportionate to your damage so sometimes I get 20

There was an add on being developed called GroupCalendar. It was abandoned, and supposedly picked up by another developer, but so far nothing has been posted update wise. I too would love some form of in game organizer for raid scheduling and roster, that doesn’t rely on discord.

The guild I ran MC with did BoE's at the end of the raid to incentivize people to stay for the whole thing and keep the raid moving at a decent pace.  They also did round robin.  I thought it was a good idea, and they made the rules clear, but I can't help but feel a little upset when the warlock who came into the raid 80% of the way through beat me out on a belt that dropped in the very beginning.
---
same, and we're getting no mage loot for weeks now haha

"LITTLE LESS"

Eyyy this is on Blaumeux
---
Yeah, good for... us..... sniff
---
It is allowed. There was only a brief period, nearly a decade ago, where they officially "banned" the practice in game (around 2010) but quickly gave up on that again because it was too much effort to enforce. In the live version of the game they have changed the loot system in such a way that it's no longer possible to do this. In classic it is possible and hence allowed.
---
Which ‚bugs’ were left on purpose? Well it is really stupid. It’s like being able to use mount without it displaying a mount. I hope blizz doesn’t change the way it is.
---
They won't be doing that. The whole point of allowing loot trading was so GMs weren't needed.
---
Stupid actions lead to stupid prizes? Whats that saying again?
---
Either way wow what an idiot lol.
---
I just got on. You weren't kidding. These are fucking awful.

Do people do Anger runs without doing the arena first?  I've never seen one.  Healers need stuff from the arena, right?

What's the biggest oceanic server for Horde on Oceanic PvP

That was it for me, thanks!
---
What's the addon people are using so when you whisper them a keyword you get invited to group?
---
Imagine you wearing all that platinum rare/epic armor and even if you do not die after 1 run of any dungeons you have to deal with -2g repair cost. We all know that no dungeon is flawless. So push the average up to -3g (which is pretty generous). Lets say u had a good run and u get like 2-3 blues. You vendor/sell them all for an avarege of 10g. You get 5g from collecting money (which again is also generous). Big congratulations! That's a net of \~12g/h ! There are way more effective better and more relaxed ways of making money than running dungeons.
---
Now stop @ing me mr. delusion.
---
Get it out of your head that everyone deserves everything equally.
---
If you're literally full pre raid BiS, and only need 1 item, I think you have every right to bring along some goober from trade chat that doesn't have half their gear yet, but is willing to pass on 1 item. In essence, the entirety of the group is reserving that item to them, just indirectly by already having it or not needing it.
---
The same applies for any group that reserves all items. If they're willing to give you whatever you need, they're pretty much giving you a free ride to come along and have reserves on everything you need. Trust me, no group that has all greens reserved for their tank gives a fuck if you need on a genuine upgrade of yours.
---
Exploitation isn't a thing in WoW. It's a game subject to it's own rules. You have the freedom to make any group you want, regardless of how egregious the rules are, and people are allowed to accept/decline those rules. If I make a MC PuG that charges 1k entry fee, am I exploiting these people? Surely you'd be an idiot to come and join and be exploited? Yet people on retail sell mythic carries every week, often for real money.

Nope, I think druids are the better overall class imo, unless raid dps is important to you, then youd pick warrior anyway.
---
Everyone and their mother on my server is at Hillsbrad right now. There's zero dungeon groups forming, I think you miscalculate how much people wanted this.

Being on a PVE server right now awesome, because there are planned optional PVP battles you can join if you want to itch that PVP itch, otherwise life is nice an comfy.

PVE server

Gameplay was much better on pservers, no batching artificial lag and smoother raid vs raid pvp.
---
How the hell is this even related?  We are talking about video games.
---
It's overkill as a warrior. Orc is the best option because you can get stack stun resist like crazy with passives and talents.
---
Wow pvp is the most sheltered version of Pvp. Like a sport. 
---
In Many other mmo, pvp feels like actual life and death. If u get killed , you could lose items/gold. If you accumulate pvp kills, you will look like a badass but could lose gears when killed. 
---
Also you can kill any players at any time (even your guild mates) so you are always on the edge when playing.

If you skimp on the validation of data coming from clients, then you get to turn the n -&gt; n^2 problem into n  -&gt; n^1.x problem.

What I'd do is leave your level 17 on Faerlina, and start some characters on other servers. Do some /who &lt;level ranges&gt; in the times you usually play, and try and find one that has about the right number of players for you.

As much as I want to like these huge battles, I hate how they turn into basically big mageballs.  Whoever has the most mage DPS tends to win.

It’s really sad how shit this version of Classic is that everybody is PAYING for.

What a fucking scam.

&gt;The fix is to introduce battlegrounds

No, that is called a band-aid. Quite literally in fact.

You're right, you can't compare pservers with classic. Pservers actually worked.

I feel like I'm forced to AFK or I wouldn't be able to raid. I work until 6pm and raids are at 7:30pm. If I don't log in early and AFK until raid times then when I actually get home at 6:30pm my server then has a 90+ minute queue and I will miss the raid.

What was the reason for removing the layers? Honest question because personally it was so much better being able to play whenever I felt like it and not having to deal with fucking remote login bullshit just so I can play in the evenings.

You join as a healer, you heal the Dungeon, you get the loot that’s for the healer and that’s How it goes. If you’re off spec tank, you tank the Dungeon and get your tank gear that Way, or being lucky the current tank doesn’t need it and therefor you Can Roll on it. It’s really common sense.

Man, I had so much fun. Noted I had a pocket priest and LIPs/Sappers, but whenever those are on cooldown, all the melee I coordinated with moved to the flank. Charging in there without any of the above is a certain death indeed ;)

Someone kept yelling “FOR NARNIA” ... had me rolling 😂😂😂

We need paid transfers about as much as we need 60 boosts. People just want and accept one of them more than the other. Id say lets at least have 1 microtransaction free game.

Apparently killing people in the capital is actually way to go for rogues already. For some other classes it ain't that easy. Best method would probably be something like 2-3 man groups farming zones that are hardly contested.

I don't really understand the logic here, hes out of commission because it make take him 5 days played to hit 60 instead of 4?

that's a really nice tabard :)

You can start making one tho it’s a good idea

On thunderfury us alliance were rolling horde even though we were out numbered.

Still feeling out ele/resto... not going well. I felt this so hard ;-;
---
Shamans don't have AoE? 1.5s chain lightning isn't blizzard, but it's not terrible at 36m range with talents. You can also earthbind totem and frost shock for aoe/single target CC respectively.
---
Or you can do what I was doing in hillsbrad. 5k hp is plenty to go charging into the enemy lines on a push to drop an earthbind totem in the line behind where the mages blink to. Big ass tauren made me a target, but it was also great at encouraging the mob forward when they saw me diving in.
---
literally unplayable even at lvl 55 guess im not gonna play for a few days i cant even get out of everlook without dying

Please go ahead and explain to me how private servers can run world pvp with no issues but Blizzard can’t? Cmon go ahead I’m waiting.

You can solo farm ZF from 44 to 53.

depending on the raid setup at the time we do round robin on tier with no round robin on offset pieces(to stop people from saving their 'rolls' and letting gear go to waste). Lots of fair ways to do things.

Nethergarde  was awesome tonight. Gg allies.

just tell the group when you start. feral tanking gear is quite a bit different that warr or pallylol gear.

Because they were on the discord acting tough doing the 3 mage gangbang to players - and now they camp winterspring and wait for people to be low hp before engaging. I make it an effort to kill every one of them when i see them. It was really satisfying to see that my kills last night were to officers and the "co-gm" rank mage ahahhaha

unless we work for blizz we cant say for sure. my guess is blizz spent the last 10 years making sure not too many people are in a single area at a time with things like phasing and layering. now with classic its the opposite of that and just 1 layer so its having problems, because blizz spent last 10 yr not optimizing for this case

I'm on Fairbanks, there were queue times during the event.

Sadly Narcissists are very rarely if ever capable of improvement even with therapy.

How long do the ques get? I'm on Herod and I had a 90 min que. I want a high pop server but a que time of under an hour would be nice lol

They only get 2-2.5$ per subs tho
---
Last coffer chest in BRD would de spawn if you left even if it had loot in it :(
---
You roll on BIS for mainspec (whatever that is) because you are playing the main spec in the instance. BIS is BIS, it doesn't matter if it's cloth or plate.
---
Whenever this comes up it's usually a rogue suffering the horrible fate that rogues do in endgame instance running. No loot because groups are hard to find and gear competition is fierce. So you end up trying to do mental gymnastics on why warriors shouldn't be allowed to roll on your gear.
---
eh 1k viewers is pretty average, maybe even below average at this point. Twitch is huge now.

Yup no lag on mine with couple hundred people but did have dc’s for a bit.

Live servers have been doing this since at least BFA, maybe slightly further back.
---
Damn so jealous. Was hoping my 120 hks would be decent haha. Was only on for a couple hrs tho

BGs will come sooner than you think. Blizzard servers cant handle 120 vs 120 WPVP. Their financial solution will be to release BGs to reduce server stress.

Idk, was pretty damn badass for combat pvp

Was DM release not first patch? Honor system not second?

don't think you should be banned for creatively taking advantage of game mechanics. blizzard can make adjustments to the encounter i.e. preventing kazzak from healing if a sub 50 gets killed near them for instance.

Need means need, doesn't matter what spec it's for.
---
Right? The absolute garbage people spew on here is a joke. The second you throw logic into the mix you're down-voted into oblivion because you're not conforming to the hive. When I played Vanilla, large scale PVP battles lagged all the time. welcome to the experience.
---
yeah sorry was confusing in context. I did read battlegrounds are not available but was wondering if we knew when it would be, basically any news on when phase 3 is?
---
Well it looks a lot better without all the black smudges blocking names :(
---
Depends on your specc, do you have improved sprint, or preparation? What about engineering? Theres a bunch of ways
---
Or an afk rogue or druid.
---
&gt; Not only that but picking a spell without factoring in +healing
---
Then pick a spell, accounting for +healing, that satisfies your desired HpS.... There are [simulators](https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/heal) that do this part for you. That calculation is pretty easy with crit chance `c` (set `c` to zero if you want to ignore it):
---
&gt; `(1+0.5*c)*(Sh/Sc + H)/3.5 = HpS`
---
The problem is that there aren't any constraints that I can use aside from your current stats. If you arbitrarily try to solve for the optimal build and spell profile, it's going to say "use rank 1 renew with a billion +healing and infinite mana". Clearly that is best, right? But that much stats aren't in the game.
---
There are only two equations (stat_weights(H,M,Sh/Sc), HpS(H,Sh/Sc)), and three variables (H, M, Sh/Sc). If you don't pick a spell profile to optimize against (or a maximum stat or something), there's no way to provide a gear profile. Your request isn't clear enough to describe mathematically. You want a set of actual optimal solutions, whereas I'm just using gradient ascent to gradually improve against the otherwise unknown gear pool.

Lol in my server both factions are equals we the horde went to IF and wipe, so the alliance went to UC and wipe too today was a good day.
---
Youre being irrational there. I have traps down when im grinding/questing. Of course if im riding to some point, I just ride.
---
Kinda personal question because I’m genuinely curious, can you tell any difference between back then and now when it comes to server lag from lots of players in one area? Just got done doing hillsbrad for 6 hours and it was lagging really bad at the battles peaks. Thanks!
---
Was this bigglesworth? But that's what it looked like on bigglesworth
---
You are not prepared
---
/s? I hope?
---
Agreed. No one really wants to get to the spiders then run all the way back to turn in a quest then run all the way to the mountain just to get ganked on the way back in. Next thing you know it's 30 minutes later and everyone wants to leave.
---
lol..
---
People do that shit? Huge red flag
---
Weird, I had the opposite experience. Spent hours playing the back and forth “push till we overextend, retreat, rinse repeat” game with an outnumbered alliance faction (Bigglesworth US)
---
Every time there is lag they say DDOS to shield their rep. We had the same lag Tuesday popping ony buff for half the server in SW. no DDOS message then.
---
[Another reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dw8du8/no_keyring_in_phase_2_because_phase_2_is_not_a/f7jltda/).

But then you're playing a balance druid.

I’ve realized the other day you can hs or assist a summon while still sitting drinking/eating

....what fucking northdale did you play on? Anytime something big happened on ND you couldn't see players further than 10 yards from you.
---
PvE servers still have PvP actions all the time, it's just consensual unlike PvP servers.
---
You see, we have the problem in reverse on my server. EVERY time I land at Lights hope, theres 10 -15 horde sitting there and camping our flight path. I'm dead before I can even turn around. Once or twice a day we have to have a raid start in wpl and walk to lights hope in order to clear them out.
---
luv it
---
Yup
---
Why would it be BS? Blizzard is a well known DDOS target.
---
Do we have any exact numbers what the server caps are for each server then?
---
Honestly amazing that people are so lazy that shitters get away with this.
---
It's as simple as starting a competing group without reserves, but no one ever does it.
---
A lot of players in the opposing faction were standing still due to lag 
---
 during my server's Southshore vs Tarren Mill battle, and were just free kills. It's kind of boring compared to small-scale skirmishes.
---
I just finished up a battle and compared to back then it's a huge difference. There was lag spikes but I never completely lost control for more than a few seconds. Back on vanilla there's no way the server wouldn't have crashed with the amount of people I saw tonight. All things considered I was very pleased with the performance.
---
Whats so serious about expecting a game that people bought and paid for (and pay a subscription for as well) to perform well?
---
I mean you do realise that just because someone cares about something you don’t does not mean they’re taking it too seriously.
---
No, not really. Maybe ban'thok if they're trying to put together a DPS set.
---
It doesn't do anything towards intelligence.  It made me irritable and paranoid but I could write a lab report all night until 5am.  
---
Someone else might call be an idiot for saying this but it's kind of overrated and gives you low grade anxiety
---
No you're misreading the entire thing. His comment was a response to the title, where OP says bliz doesn't give a shit
---
It's alright
---
The difference is the Private servers motivation was to bring a good experience. So they put everything they could in place to make it good. 
---
Blizzards motivation is profit so they will trim everything they can to tow the line as close as possible on an optimization model of expenditure vs sub retention  
---
Guess which one benefits the players more
---
ahhh ok. from the grievers perspective. thanks!
---
1,5/3,5*0,95 i think
---
Yea when I run with my Prot warrior friends as dps I just end up taking threat on half the mobs anyways, That’s actually a good thing though because the extra damage i take converts to rage and increases our damage and clear speed. It’s just faster if we tank ourselves and get another dps.
---
This could very well be the case. I played a mage in vanilla and can barely remember that let alone priest, druid, lock, hunter etc haha.
---
Keep your head up. Both of us that killed this guy and caused this were interested in the same way you are. Hes a software dev and I administrate servers, both jumped on discord after this happened because we thought we were the only ones impacted. Turns out the whole server was impacted and it was pretty neat to see. Not toooften you get to bring a whole server down.
---
Wasn't even that high pop :|

You mention they say this every time there's lag and then state that there was lag on Tuesday but no message,. contradicting yourself. It makes no sense that a for profit company that has a wildly successful game would put their credibility on the line and lie about performance issues.
---
Probably cancel my sub for a month and let it die down. No point in going anywhere out in the world as alliance.
---
my group for lbrs has now spent 30 minutes trying to get into the instance from the time they landed at the flightpath
---
i had a 2 minute rez timer by the time i made it through the brm door.
---
That's how I feel right now. Just want to farm DM E in piece. But no alliance have to get on my way.
---
i mean you think that servers lag because of DDOS, there's no reason to even argue with someone like you.. literally negative IQ
---
But if they don't want the loot that is reserved then its not treating anyone unfairly. 
---
Unfairly is the important word in your detention, if someone joins a group with something reserved then there's nothing unfair about them not getting that item. This is 100% some everyone deserves a trophy type attitude and I'm not sure it's healthy.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dwlgec/pvp_blue_set_question/). 
---
I reply to all these messages with "100g" and normally there is no followup whisper but sometimes there's rage.
---
So are fights like these organized on forums or just happen out of the blue? Either one is awesome, just wanna know.
---
so you are saying that it is just a coincidence that some servers have gone without a queue for over a month, all of a sudden have hour+++ long queues the day pvp comes out?
---
ah.
---
That's a name i have not heard of in a long time
---
The voice that says I rolled on a PvP server and can't handle it any more so I'm going to unsubscribe and complain like a child? That's your voice, not mine.
---
so in other words, you dont know any details.
---
Ahahah what career. It's basically a shit sponsorship. What kind of casual player knows who method is or cares. Bad publicity is still publicity.
---
Can you link it?:)
---
i thought we were paying for bobby kotick's christmas bonus
---
That's what happens when Blizzard just cares about money. Nost was bigger than most realms that people play on today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw
---
no paid transfers yet
---
Congratulations, you're a loser.
---
Ya, it was "drop our ego and learn from private servers" fix.
---
But they didn't, and now we're here.
---
Hey look, it me
---
Wow, you're just going to be purposely obtuse. Cool, you be you. I fell really bad for your kids and the perpetual world of ignorance you must raise them in
---
There's a guy on Faerlina with a mage named Lyft. Dude hit level 40 crazy fast, then just never seemed to leave Kargath. Pretty sure they had a second account to actually play. Prolly made several thousand gold giving ports for 1g a piece. Personally I spent at least 30g on ports in Kargath, tho not always from him.
---
I’m always sunny everyone refers to dee as a bird. I was referencing the Eric Andre show because he comment Bird Up which is a skit in Eric Andre. The initial comment was referencing always sunny tho which is honestly one of my fav shows ever I’ve seen every season except the most recent on fxx right now
---
What does the game engine have to do with the server?
---
Thanks
---
In* always sunny
---
Thanks for that
---
We are having 200-200 fights in BRM with minimal lag, I want to see these large scale fights causing servers to be absolutely unplayable. Whitemane server.
---
They also used a 15 year old client/architecture.
---
Wands are a ranged weapon so they gain damage from ranged attack power, which agility provides
---
On Stalagg every damn thing is a corpse run for alliance. The guild I'm in is already starting to fall apart as people quit or start toons in other servers.
---
You're dead wrong though. You can only be mana burned if it was applied while you were in humanoid form, shapeshifting after it was applied never removed it. If it is applied whilst you are in bear/cat it does nothing.
---
&gt;I play alts
---
&gt;I hate leveling
---
Geez man pick one
---
If the server can process your jump...
---
The irony of this statement.
---
Many words, bigs words, but no brain, I see.
---
Great, one less filthy alliance scum polluting my screen.
---
Ah you mean hes a piece of shit?
---
But it is?
---
\&gt;If you arbitrarily try to solve for the optimal build and spell profile, it's going to say "use rank 1 renew with a billion +healing and infinite mana". 
---
THIS IS MY WHOLE POINT. Your formula is obviously flawed if it leads to the conclusion that rank1 renew is the most "optimal" spell! the reason it's not the best is because even though it is the most efficient, even infinitely efficient with just a moderate amount of spirit, it isn't optimal because your HPS is too low! YOU CAN HAVE INFINITE EFFICIENCY AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE AN OPTIMAL BUILD.
---
Which is fine until you run out of mana.
---
Dm was part of a phase one patch. So just like dm you can probably expect the 1st phase two patch to come in the next month or so.
---
For a second i thought this was my server  (gandling, eu). But then i realised every pvp server probably looked like this today.
---
With the Horde kicking ass HEYYOOOOOOOOOO!!!
---
50 minutes in stocks shoot me right away
---
/who c-warrior 58-60

I've got a macro for it. What I wouldn't give to automate the whisper spam too.
---
Just because you can, doesn't mean buddy did.
---
lmao
---
Can you paste your git hub project that deploys an acceptable architecture for Classic? I'm curious how you solve Blizzard's issue.
---

---
1. Go to your class trainer
---
 2. Pay maxium of 50g for respec
---
3. ???
---
Its honor, not kills. It says "honorable kills" but sometimes you get more honor than 1 per kill.
---
&gt;This lack of clarity, lack of commitment strategy isn't a strategy, it's incompetence.
---
Were you somehow under a rock for the years that they attempted to provide more clear deadlines? If something happened and they missed it, they got extreme amounts of backlash and harassment. There's no good reason for them to ever put themselves through that, knowing how toxic the internet is.
---
The most warning they ever give for any patch or content is expansion launch dates and PvP season end (which usually indicates new patch date, but not always). That's it.
---
Huh, didn't know I could WPVP in BGs. 
---
&gt; the money machine
---
The money machine should be fixing the problem. Not forcing people out of that part of the game.
---
If your entertainment isn't entertaining you anymore, is it really entertainment?
---
Yup, just hit 59 and feeling the same
---
I’m happy to have witnessed some massive battles at SS. But it got old surprisingly fast
---
Why should the 20 side have a queue?
---
And this dipshit isn't even a celebrity in any way.
---
dw /u/ReadingTheTrails literally has aspergers lol
---
You're "glad" he hasn't gone felheart at the expense of raw stats?
---
Felheart is 80% raw stats, of all T1 sets it's the most PvP focused one out there, 5/8 felheart is PvP bis no matter the spec.
---
Definately some Ice there.
---
Grab, Incendius, Kromcrush, Benediction
---
I’m on Kromcrush so I am biased towards there. It’s a great server.
---
All the NEETs can kill each other while I chill at work.
---
What were your reasons to play WoW anyways,  what about p2 is stopping you, are you un able to play on a pve server? how is you getting to 60 going to change much? ie are you some how gonna be able to 1 vs 20 once you are 60?
---
Fairbanks alliance here, as soon as combat would start, there was around 5-8s input lag. But it's a large server, and a lot of people were in the area.
---
How P2 implementation is going shows me that blizzard thought classic would just be something that they could turn on, generate money, and never attend to again. Idk what else we can tell them but "Hey! We are still here! Paying for the game! Take care of us please!"
---
&gt; Honestly that's kinda embarrassing
---
I'd LOVE if you, and you specifically, elaborated on exactly how that fact is embarrassing.
---
It's a 200 v 120 because the horde have more will to go out there and fight. It's a vicious cycle.
---
Exorsus Raid Tools has this functionality, with the invite fully automated
---
Go play retail if its too hardcore for you
---
All my friends are that little guy
---
What does that have to do with anything? Just because something is not working as intended doesn't mean that it's not fixable.
---
He's made more than that in the last 3 days. You're so fucking dumb.
---
it does
---
So we have multiple reports from other players that empty tomes can happen.
---
The GM did *not* confirm that OP's tome had a Compendium in it, only that *if it did* then OP would not have been able to see it.
---
Nothing to see here. OP found an empty tome, jumped to the incorrect conclusion that this could only be because it had a Foror's in that he could not see, and thinks they have been ripped off when they have not.
---
Arcane shot scales with a  42.85% coefficient, Tier 2.5 for hunters even has +spellpower and -10% arcane shot CD.
---
Couldn’t even play today, totally unacceptable.
---
We got 2 DKs during this - some AoE caught 2 civs on the way in. In most situations though you could totally do TB without getting any DKs.
---
I don't know, I think I would have preferred everything either released at once instead of the slow drip which turned into a flow of water.  I thought I had the time to take it easy and enjoy it but I should have done the dungeon spam with everyone else since they are rushing it.
---
I literally never mentioned private servers. Learn how to read
---
What is the first GM even talking about saying “for warrior’s the compendium is the only thing they can contain”. Are they implying that only books associated with your class can be looted from the tomes? I mean, maybe that’s true I don’t know, but even if it was wouldn’t there be TWO books available to warriors? Foror’s and also the Codex of Defense? And then providing a wowhead link as the source of their information? This GM response is the equivalent of half-assing a research paper and citing Wikipedia as your only source.
---
I don't play retail and this isn't hardcore it's just poorly planned and implemented.
---
*recalls the many times I witnessed chinese farm/spambots teleporting to resource nodes or clipping through the ground* ah yes, good anticheat.
---
People with a functioning brain: If this continues, this isn't worth my time. I'm not a 13 year old playing WoW and jacking off all day anymore, and If I can't get what I pay for, I will stop paying for it.
---
Yeah it's sucked all the fun out of it.
---
Grats boys !
---
why do you need a balanced server? 
---
Why dont you try harder and get more players to join you on your server/faction of choice?
---
why dont you re-roll to a faction that has the population in their favor?
---
why dont you play on a pve server so it doesnt matter?
---
why dont you stop crying like a little bitch?
---
Hey man, just wanted to let you know I added the feature to change the healing bar color. You can find it under the addon options.
---
*see a full health enemy*
---
*cast corruption*    
---
*Your target is dead*           
---
"NANI?!"
---
Give up, like I did. If you can't do the grind to get to 60 in 3 months, you probably won't like the grind at 60 itself. 
---
I gave up on my 3rd 60 by the way. 2 is good enough
---
if you used the search function before posting maybe you would know how many have already explained that it is not fixable except with a very big blizz investment and with a rewrite of the code which will never happen.
---
While the words "Working as intended" hardly gives you enough information to work with, i can only imagine you are not the first person to encounter this issue since Dire Maul was released, and you are likely not the first person to write a ticket about it.
---
GM's are not omnipotent, if this subject has been declared "working as intended" from the higher ups, then there really is nothing they can do to give you the book.
---
There have been tons of videos posted in this very subreddit in the past few days. So if you want to see it, it's readily available to see.
---
When I reached level 58-60 I notices how incredibly toxic people are when running end-game dungeons. It completely ruined it for me, especially as a Warrior mostly ending up as a tank. I probably would've enjoyed it more as a healer but I can't be bothered leveling one up and maybe feeling the same. I might give Shadowlands a try though.
---
The quality of this post has been marked with an F for feces.
---
Alliance is extremely over populated on Heartseeker estimated to be like 65/35. As a Horde, I feel all of your pain today.
---
It won't, that's implied by his post. The 80% will have a queue.
---
They don't notice when you're "flyhacking" under the ground, which is what most of them do.
---
Yeah the cycle of there being more horde than alliance is relentless indeed. Snowballs certainly do grow bigger+faster when there's more snow to work with. Doesn't have anything to do with 'horde have willpower.' It's a numbers game, that's all it is.
---
She doesn't watch tv or use the internet much so let's alone play WoW. She doesn't even know what it is or that I play this game.  If she knew, she'd most likely think of me as a loser. I'm 29, she's 50.
---
That is a crock of complete bullshit, and also not how servers work at all
---
Hahah nice. What add-on is making that noise when enemy players are spotted?
---
How does that work for healers?
---
He Jokerd himself
---
Do you have proof of your 3,000 HK?
---
He's still trolling maybe, it's just the whole world now not just gamers :D
---
You don't get it.
---
*Why*, as a feral tank who can't get any useful feral tank gear out of that dungeon, do I tank that dungeon.
---
Kirtonos is apparently 55H/45A
---
Blizz hasn't had to make a product where performance really matters since sharding and cross server stuff was introduced and I'm sure the codebase has changed so much since then. Will require a lot of engineering to get a server where speed really matters.
---
That's the one I ended up getting and it's so good!
---
Very bad for pvp warlocks. Spell stones are important.
---
WSG and AB low level BG's are the reason I came back. It's a long wait.
---
If you know it's bait why are you taking it.
---
People were 100% sure that nobody would kill Kazzak on our server last evening since there was probably 300 horde and alliance combined trying to wipe eachother...... Yet the server was so laggy that Kazzak simply didnt do his heal+shadowbolt volley when people died. The raid that got the loot had like 10 people alive at the end.
---
Honestly with how difficult it was to get a group as a rogue even when I was with the pack (60 in 4 weeks) I cant imagine looking for a ST group now... I would advise making a pickpocket/macro and finding some humanoids to farm in a less popular area such as the naga in feralas or cultists in blasted lands. 
---
Its gonna be a bit dry but it's your best bet of getting to 54 and doing brd runs
---
God i hate that you all rather have Bgs then fixed servers.
---
If you can’t handle dying on the way to dungeons and questing is out of the picture what do you honestly expect to be able to do to level up?
---
I think that argument is just made up by blizzard fanboys who want to defend the shitty servers...
---
The lags started in legion. Even in their 40 v 40 Southshore vs Tarrens Mill BG people are constantly having lags. Also the other 40 vs 40 bgs lag sometimes quite bad.
---
Also look at the auction house performance. People always posted a lot of 1 stack auctions but you can clearly see that the performance goes down not by the amount of auctions but if you try to access the auction house during prime time.
---
They just try to save money where they can and one way is to save on server capacity.
---
but this sub hates advancements in technology, that's why we ended up with the atrocities that are spell batching and leeway
---
TRW you see you see the entire horde raid coming up behind him:
---

---
A couple weeks after release I was doing BRD trying to get the gloves from princess. I didn't know that her quest needed to be completed first and the groups I ran with just thought it was bugged. Sent it a ticket and was told to reset my UI. Seems like that is all the GMs know how to say now.
---
That would make Trade chat so borrrrrring.
---
Do you have a source of me complaining about PvP?
---
He stopped leading raids and quit LOL
---
You just have to /s "for frodo" and charge.  At least a few gnomes will follow.
---
Haven't seen it drop yet, but I think we're at 5 mageblades
---
Komcrush is pretty even, join us!
---
Just Incase he is clueless
---
Why not find a quiet spot and grind out mobs? You'll make a good amount of gold too.
---
What would be my best bet for solo-farming honor?
---
Cba going with a 40 man group
---
&gt;and also not how servers work at all
---
Okay then please tell us how servers work
---
44 druid. Fuck me.
---
True.
---
Stop ganking me in STV and level.
---
Or adderall
---
I was thinking of buying runs for experience when the grind is a big mind numbing, at what levels can I start entering SM and other instances for good xp gains?
---
Lmao you must be new to the gaming industry
---
So, you can drop princess til 2%, log on your alt and finish her, your main character will stay in game for minute or something. 
---
But you need to stay near on your when pulled. 
---
I didn't test it in dungeons, but done kurzen quest line on 30lvl Hunter(Almost bis gun on this lvl) with technique.
---
it went to a shaman
---
some say he's still getting corpse camped in the canyon to this day.
---
Yeah I quit retail and was pumped asf for classic to come out, but I havent played classic in nearly a month now and I've ended up back in retail and having a blast again. I just couldn't deal with the sheer lack of anything to do.
---
Im 60, Phase 2 is horrible, they need to get Battlegrounds out preferably yesterday
---
The shine is starting to wear off for me. I simply don't have time or patience to sit and spam LFG on end. Last dungeon I tried doing we had a healer and deeps and couldn't find a tank for about an hour before giving up. Then my few questing zones like Burning Steppes are nigh impossible because of endless 60 ganks. I just tried to do some wpvp and have fun but it was completely unplayable because of the lag. IDK guess I just don't feel there's anything worth playing for at the moment. I'll get over it once BGs are released I think.... main reason I wanted to play.
---
There was no lag at all bevause people didn't do shit lmao.
---
On Fairbanks. We'll see how this develops over the days and weeks to come, but right now I kind of enjoy it. The numerical disadvantage makes you strategize and fight in different ways.
---
BGs ASAP
---
As a Solo player I havn't encountered a single Alliance player thats not surrounded with atleast 10 other people
---
&gt;You're so fucking dumb
---
You sound like the type of guy who would enjoy watching Jokerd/other manchildren screw around, since they are so relatable for you.
---
I think the add-on they’re referring to is simply one that helps organize LFG channels into a more easily readable format. Unfortunately, it also sounds like the add-on picks up anybody in the LFG chat channel even if they’re not actively participating, leading to the unsolicited whisper spam.
---
Why is it that you're saying this battle was fine but other servers with less players or just Orgrimmar and people getting the Ony buff struggle to keep up.
---
p3 will be rushed out to help with lag.
---
Engine is a sorta nebulous term, it really just means the network of tools used to develop a game. I'm maybe miscategorizing by suggesting that "sharding" is part of the game's engine. However, the issue is likely sharding, and no amount of "server upgrades" or whatever is going to fix that. The game is built around shards now, and while shards are excellent for medium to large populations, they start to break down once you get to extra large populations, as has been demonstrated multiple times throughout WoW's lifespan, and as is being demonstrated right now.
---
All the same issues present in WPvP for Classic are equally present in Retail, people just don't usually care to test the limits by having 200 v 200 pvp on retail.
---
Bgs are cross realm. Horde will still have longer queues but it won’t be insane.
---
Shill harder pls
---
Even if the servers worked, this type of gameplay is trash.
---
can't quest at all right now without getting camped or ganked several times in an hour. its no fun being 48-59 right now. thinking of respecing to heals to grind dungeons or maybe unsubbing entirely.
---
This was about a 50/50 server.
---
Bbs are better...
---
same thing with coal. cause it drops from some mobs, people don't realize you can buy from vendor.
---
Ah yeah that's a great point actually. All the people piled up in major city's etc.
---
Asmon?
---
Again? Reported as spam.
---
Yeah.... I had a bunch of mates back in vanilla so it was a bit easier for groups. Now it's  'LFG LFG LFG LFG' 30 mins to get to BRD and then the healer DC's, the party leader is afk and slowly the group falls apart lol.
---
damn, like 5 minutes after honor tab showed up i asked people in my guild if azuregos or kazzak were up, and they said he wasn't and would probably be up in like 4-6 hours. rip
---
I told people there would be no more playing the game but no one listened. The servers were never meant for this many people there will be death squads everywhere. Being low level wont save you.
---
If a gray player attacks me first then I kill him after will that count as a dishonorable kill?
---
a range from frost mage to shadow priest
---
As i said, do you have any proof of me complaining about PvP?
---
All i see there is me complaining 10 man raids
---
This is my first run ever in WoW. My brother talked me into subbing and getting into this new world. First account I make.. wrong server. Make a new one and roll on Thunderfury. 
---
I can’t even tell you how many times I have completed a yellow quest with the help of someone on the horde. I asked my brother over discord the first time it happened if that was normal? 
---
Also my alliance friends have been incredibly helpful. Even made a good friend I chat with because he taught me how to farm devilsaur to get my set. (Even after losing probably 20 devilsaur skins cause I’m a dumb ass) 
---
Over I have loved this game and the community.
---
Yeah I was talking more about pvp. And the flair yeah my highest character is a rogue. I never played classic before and didn’t know what character to play.
---
Shazzrah is s joke.. ofc all the horde players think it’s great. Personally I don’t think 10 vs 1 pvp is that challenging.
---
While ill agree, they dont fix the real issues we have
---
Wat
---
these seem to be the pvp servers that always get mentioned, (i play alts on incendius and cant complain)
---
I took some a month ago to play wow but ended up painting my entire first floor of my house, replacing a screen door, installing a new shower head, and retiling the backsplash in my kitchen, I also ended up spending like 2 hours downloading and configuring addons but not actually playing lol
---
Horde put up some really good fights today at korgath snd thorium Point!
---
I mean, how much longer do you think this shit will last before everyone stops the zergs.  Maybe a week tops
---
I mean you don't have rp now, not next week its will be. So don't group with idiots.
---
From Kromcrush as well, agreed
---
Yeah chain lightning from a fucking mile away
---
What an awesome time! I’m in the back healing!
---
Only the wrists are useful. The shoulders last until you get valor from rend and the boots are ok, but easily replacable by better items.
---
Killed yesterday 9:14:49 pm CET by Frostfall.
---
/r/Cringetopia
---
Good luck summoning outside of brd on the minority faction.
---
You linked just a library. It doesn't do anything for you average Joe healer. It's Joe's unit frame addon needs to use the library. He doesn't need to download this at all since his unit frames addon will have this included.
---
as a rogue 60 combat sword, if i just got Viskag tonight, what should i use it with my offhand? i have dalrend set so should i just do viskag + mirah's song or viskag + dalrend offhand or just keep dalrend set until i get brutality blade?
---
Vanish also breaks all roots and slows, if you hadn’t realised yet
---
&gt;but all the people I see that take it just kinda twitch and act methy.
---
That's because adderall is an amphetamine.
---
An entire generation of college student fucknuts don't even realize they're on meth-lite
---
Guerrilla. Sorry somehow I’ve seen this misspelled three times today
---
Remember, no changes.
---
If I was anymore attacked somebody would’ve literally painted a target on me.
---
Sounds like the story of basically every WoW expansions.
---
A large large majority of the players actually do play like absolute fucking garbage.
---
yes. ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes.
---
You don't you entitled fuck.
---
Yeah if youre ranged, its probably better to solo. Gettings 100+ on kills and 30+ on contributed ones while I get a flurry of 1s and 2s in a raid with the same contribution.
---
Maybe it was who's going to make the first real move lol. I just logged off after 2 hours there, it was a rolling warzone. Neither side gaining a real advantage but the fur was definitely flying.
---
Var = code
---
Code = 2*code
---
Leopardskinrobe.create(code)
---
Error
---
Ahh, ok
---
The’re not. 
---
It’s like 10% and they end up starting when people who didn’t try and res are already done and back.
---
Only exceptions is something extra for the tank. Literally no one else isn’t just easily passed over.
---
Yeah exactly, and why can't the keyring be the same way.
---
Considering your shitty russian server wasn't close to the real thing, comparing it to Classic is like saying "WTF my drawing of an orange didn't get mold on it! fuck orange growers, what a shit product"
---
a fire blast on a 58 shaman being attacked by an argent rider, delicious
---
Wow, no i had not realised that yet. Not even sure why it would break roots but hey, i'm a fan!
---
Thank you
---
That’s not reserving items at all.
---
I mean, it's just that you spent 10 hours doing the same thing in the game, which was probably a laggy mess. You don't have to force huge fights. And you don't have to rank up if you don't have fun doing it. Just keep playing the way you were and PVP when you must/want to.
---
This is exactly the reason I joined a PvE server.
---
I like PVP but on a consensual basis. No point in getting ganked until I log off.
---
Started three days ago and I'm level 18 mage lol.
---
A raid kill gives as low as 1 honor. A solo kill gives as high as 200 honor. 
---
So if all were raid killls, that's 3000 honor. (Extreme at a rate of 1 honor each.)
---
If all those kills were solo that would be a whopping 600,000 honor.
---
It seems like your doing it wrong and getting yourself burned out in the process
---
Warlocks get lifetap which makes drinking less important
---
Soulshard farming is not bad at all
---
Warlocks get a raidspot, spriest will be tough pressed to get one
---
no shit you're bored you've been doing 100vs100 battles for like 10 hours
---
I forgot I wasn't an unemployed bum this time around lol. Shoulda gone PVE.
---
Shadow Priests have Mana issues.
---
Warlocks have Health issues.
---
Grind orges in deadwind pass. No tank team will be there.
---
Damn, didnt think any Bosses would spawn on the first day tbh
---
Shadowlands released early on classic I see!
---
Man the staff isn't even BiS lol
---
Yeah, will probably be similar to dire maul launching early.
---
Y’all wanted a true classic experience
---
make a warlock alt, solo dm east. mining and herbs. 100g per hour IF you grind couple hours per day(cuz arcanites increases the g/h)
---
thank me later
---
not that hard to provide an image, why so dodgy?
---
This was confirmed a bug and the GMs said literally “have you mr healer open it” if you’re trying to get them the hammer of grace
---
Pretty sure internet service providers have been getting DDOSed the past couple days. Thought I saw a message that blizzard was on their new page as well. More then likely you are dropping the queue because of that.
---
Oslo was actually going for a smithing record, but HLC represented anyways lol
---
I don't reserve unless it's the savage gladiator chest but when I was gearing I definitely tried to minimize inviting physical dps because of the loot overlap. I'm fairly sure this happens very commonly.
---
That's right.
---
Under his rules, I don't tank that dungeon.
---
This speaks to me.
---
So I should go for 69dhks this weekend?
---
Dungeon grind, bb
---
solo farm ZF at 44? care to elaborate?
---
Me too! I thought it was hyperbole. This man is actually a deranged lunatic, over a 15 year old video game. It's wild what "power" , in a damn video game, will do to people.
---
Hot pockets are good :D though
---
No about 15 of us where alive and continued to fight. The boss ran back to his original spot and they charged in.
---
I was looking for this setting but didn’t see it
---
This link shows dungeon set 1, tier 1 and tier 2 across each patch:

---
Incredible reference for how the sets slowly changed. I would love to find the stats that matched each those pictures including procs &amp; set bonuses.
---
I'm sorry. You made one of the classic mistakes in WoW - you let a friend talk you into playing on a server with compulsory ganking.
---
What you should do, if you like the game, is sigh and laugh about your level 52, and reroll on a PvE server.

Short version : « I was world first level 60. I had more viewers than anybody in this game. Fuck you I have the rights to take anything I want. »
---
I am pretty sure you can't get DKs by killing any players. Only npcs marked as civilians.
---
We have to retrain them. They've picked up a ton of bad habits from retail.
---
They will drop BGs early if they can't figure out server stability. I guarantee it.
---
You should keep important rank 1 spells, items, and trinkets on your bars. So most classes need all of their bars on screen. There is a max of 5 bars in Vanilla with 1 extra one you can scroll to.
---
Mage/priest. Have the priest do the solo kite method for dme runs and keep mind blasting for aggro while mage kills.
---
It's bop. Can't sell it.
---
Yeah, just shows that they have no idea what they're talking about. Pservers were not hosted in "basements", they were hosted in datacenters by actual hosting companies.
---
He’s an old soul (wisp) obviously. Duh.
---
In game mouse settings? I have Logitech and can control my dpi via the mouse. It changes the speed drastically when I accidently click the button lol. But in-game mouse settings for wow?
---
Oh lol that makes sense thanks!
---
&gt; What was the reason for removing the layers?
---
People whined and complained. (I was all for the layers.)
---
/equipslot 17 Bashguuder
---
/equipslot 17 Draconian Deflector
---
Thats my shield swap macro, if you want a 1 button version.
---
Don't forget life tapping!
---
Actually you can:
---
wPvP: the largest zergiest army wins, you don't need epics to join a large raid.
---
Battlegrounds: Never hit level 60. The battlegrounds are in brackets, for example my MAIN is level 49 and awaiting WSG, it stay 49 until maybe the day when I can level to 60 and deck out in all epics because I've accumulated so much honor (like i did back in TBC)
---
uh what
---
On Shazzrah alliance you’re pretty much dead on arrival if you fly to Thorium Point or Burning Steppes. Also getting into BRM is at least 3 corpse runs if you’re lucky. Lovely stuff lol
---
Peoples are mad about reserved items because it take them longer to find a group. Which is understandable. But I for exemple, have run countless strat UD and I never even saw the shadow damage neckless from the 1st boss. Be forced to finished this fucking instance knowing I'll get nothing made me stop the game until phase 2. I don't enjoy pve and i can't raid anyway so yeah I'm gonna reserve that even if you don't like it.
---
How would a mage or warrior ever be able to open on you lol. Mage I can understand but a warrior?
---
And you aren’t supposed to lose to rogues. Hunter’s are literally THE anti rogue class. Half their toolkit seems to be made just to fuck up rogues. 
---
The only reason you should lose to a rogue is if he’s a higher level or if he somehow stunlocks you.
---
Random enchants aren't supposed to make sense, OP.
---
It's beem boring as fuck so far. A cool spectacle, but it faded quickly for me. People have no fucking idea what they're dping and it's a mess.
---
I'm a warrior though so my role might require too much coorsination for the groups ive been in.
---
My wife and I noticed the same thing.
---
I have never played wow and didn't really plan on playing classic until my boyfriend and all his buddies started playing. One night I came home from work, he was playing and I decided to create an account and go with an undead mage because I loved sorceresses and necromancers in Diablo II. It seemed like the best of both worlds. I had no idea about the leveling guides or the huge influx of mages. I have never created an alt and I'm at lvl 36 with my mage. It's fun! I don't aoe grind or play by leveling guides. I feel like I'm actually getting the classic experience because I'm totally new, I'm seeing this world for the first time, I'm making mistakes and enjoying learning more about the game. I feel really lucky to have the experience with the game that I have had so far. My boyfriend and all his buddies have stopped playing, but I'm still hooked.
---
don't think it's a thing in vanilla, its whatever blizzard decides which can really fuck you over
---
On Zandalar Tribe we had to let Horde regroup like every 2 or 3 minutes because otherwise they were quickly pushed to TM where they couldn't be killed as efficiently and there was risk of DHKs.
---
It's pretty bad on my server and I'm pretty disgusted with Blizzard for not offering forced balanced servers. 
---
&gt;This isn't fun.
---
Generally how I feel after today. I gave it a long, long try all day long with my guild and 1200+HKs but everywhere we go we become overwhelmed by 2-5x our numbers within 15 minutes. A good 1/4th of the time spent was waiting to rez and another 1/4 was spent traveling to new places after the prior place became completely swamped. It's not really PvP.

If I knew that you can bet your boots I wouldn't tell this hive of scum and villany

too many bloody players ;-)
---
All in-game mouse settings have no effect, except to make it even slower. 
---
I could perhaps tune the DPI to something like 12,000 to compensate, but then my mouse would be unusable in Windows 7.
---
If I knew that you can bet your boots I wouldn't tell this hive of scum and villany!

“Lol I bet you’re a huge joker fanboy” “oh you don’t even watch him so you don’t know what you’re talking about” lol nice logic kid
---
And I said twitch talk not chat. You’re calling something an Andy which is cringy as fuck twitch /cx shit. 
---
Quit being salty over something happening in a video game that doesn’t even involve you.
---
Unfortunately it has nothing to do with servers.  The game engine wasn't built for this many people.
---
Lol no shit man. Doing just about anything for 10hrs straight is awful.

I see regular sellers and I buy from them all the time, usually cause I'm farming in BRD. I love em.
---
yeah i did the same quested from 55-60 over two days
---
There’s a bit missing: waiting for the clothy to go OOM and start drinking before starting the stabbing bit.
---
Ya Hunter can replace a lock and do it. As long you kite it properly you're good as most ranged classes.
---
Oof I felt this to my core. Half my quest log at 52 is B fuckin RD quests. Just about to start clearing those up
---
god i spent forever trying to get pathfinder and then i realized you cant fly in the game.
---
/s
---
BGs wind up giving a lot of 3v3, 5v5 type battles. Vastly different from mass wpvp.
---
&gt;I'm Cjdrax and I lied about the last bit because I thought it sounded better.
---
WOW Cjdrax. WOW.
---
15 year old problems aren't going to disappear away
---
Definitely not a literal band-aid.
---
Shit talking on an anonymous reddit account. Ant-man is envious of how small you are, Steve.
---
59. It's happening sometimes soon i guess!
---
My only complaint after switching is it’s much harder to sell things consistently on the AH
---
Batman is on the case.
---
So strange. Something is affecting it. Should not do that. Try deleting all wow cache items and retry? PS this will delete keybinds, etc
---
What part of 'OK. You can find another tank' did you miss ?
---
I'm not demanding to get paid fifty gold.
---
I'm not demanding all the greens.
---
I'm not demanding a specific bit of loot.
---
I'm just saying 'OK. If I can't roll on the gear I need, you can find another tank'.
---
Well.  Yeah.
---
Just run dungeons
---
&gt;So since this is the first week, everyone currently has 0 rank points. Therefore, there is no effect from DKs this week.
---
Flight Masters and guards aren't labeled Civilians. Hover over certain NPCs and it'll say "Civilian" somewhere below their name and level.
---
About 3 minutes. All pvp servers are horde populated and as an alliance I cannot move anywhere. I’m done with the game. I love classic but this is out of hand.
---
Why din’t ee just ignore that fool..... totally waste of pixels....
---
The higher int from the staff gives almost a 0.5% extra crit chance but that's probably not important enough to bring up. I do agree that mageblade and the +20 spell power offhand is better, but to say it's "far surpassing" and that the mageblade is "much better" seems like a bit of a stretch imo
---
That’s how all pvp games work....
---
&gt; So you believe that blizzard has reached the limit of how good their servers can get and theres literally nothing they are able to improve on. Yeah im sure thats the case.
---
Things can always be improved. But it comes down to cost and priorities. Blizzard isn't going to double or triple the server hosting costs for upgrades that might improve performance by 5-10%, as a basic example.
---
And anyone who has worked in a professional setting knows that most work doesn't go faster just because you throw more bodies at the problem.
---
I could be wrong and maybe Blizzard is just terrible and being stingy. But generally speaking "They have money therefore they can easily pay for better performance" is just oversimplifying the problem.
---
Yeah thats possibly part of the problem I'm sure. They were getting ddos'd even back then as well. Just looking for any advice/suggestions to resolve.
---
The way I understand this is that if you have 50 hks worth of honor points and then you get 10 dks, it will penalize the previous 50. Probably making the previous worth little. But if you farm after that you will just be reranking. This is because you’re rank one still. So don’t get dks the further you go.
---
NINJAS?- Han Solo
---
blizzard servers are made of bread confirmed
---
The fuck u puging at lvl 20-40 lmao
---
Ironically everyone begged for Vanilla but don't want Vanilla.  World PvP was a huge part of the game back in the day.  You wanted this...but now you don't.
---
It was closer to the real thing than this
---
I’ve been getting between 4-12 honor per kill in a raid
---
It says estimated honor
---
You are saying I still only get 1 honor point?
---
DDoS are likely to affect players ability to log in more than in game performance
---
Very common and normal that russians rubs servers in France - and every where else for that matter...
---
How are people missing this comment
---
According to classic.wow its supposed to be more alliance than horde. But very close to 50%
---
1. You can only get DKs by killing certain NPCs (they are marked, but I forget how). Killing players cannot be a DK.
---
2. Even if you did get a DK, it just lowers your rank. But since everyone is at rank 1 right now, you can't go lower, thus you can get as many DKs as you want until you get above rank 1.
---
Realese BGs. It's the only real solution!
---
They are literally releasing things as they did in Vanilla because you motherfuckers begged for it.
---
Now you complain.  Fuck off.
---
Yep blizzard just doesn’t wanna pay to fix it
---
I use Ctrl as a modifier for some macros and keybinds so if I press that keybind at the same time I press S to backpedal  * it will turn off the sound effects. Pressing Ctrl+S again will turn them back on
---
*(yes yes I still have backpedal bound - it's useful sometimes to walk backwards slowly alright?? ALLRIGHT???) ;p
---
Dunno me and an rsham farming it at 4 runs in an hour came out to 80g per hour. I'm not sure adding a 3rd to would make it jump to 120g to justify having said 3rd. Would have to test it out to try.
---
i mean i could solo stuff in retail that i couldnt solo in private servers ( as a healer ) cuz of path bugs lol
---
 Re-Post:
---
why do you need a balanced server?
---
why do you need to cry like a little female dog?    
---
ADDING, players can fix this issue themselves, but they wont and will go around expecting blizzard to fix their mistake
---
some are already fed up, many others will get tired in this WE
---
It has almost nothing to do with hardware.  Can you people not get it through your dense skulls?
---
:(
---
Don't let the door hit ya
---
i dunno.  As a fellow warrior, I get to shoot my bow and arrow at least.  But if I charge, I never get a heal and insta die.
---
We just want him to cut his wrists
---
Yeah it's a joke that prealms offered a more stable experience than Blizz. And there's people defending them saying realms are doing great lol
---
Why is this tagged as news?
---
I do agree situation is bad and should be fixed but could we just stop comparing private servers and Blizzard servers as they are two completely different thing.
---
Ah yes, give him more attention by making him immortal when you quote his BS over and over. Not at all his plan the whole time.
---
Career? LOL
---
Being part of IF and Menithil harbour defences we did great. Golemagg-EU is very horde dominated but we stood out ground and smushed em' 
---
Had a blast last night. Had more fun than I thought I would
---
Welcome to the party pal
---
It’s easy when they’re bottle necked and you just spam AOE.
---
It's also not as easy as everyone thinks. If you're not pullin 8-9 mobs then questing efficiently is better. Also if there is more than 3 people in the zone your exp plummets.
---
I was the opposite today. Respecced arms, realised everything is a zerg and id be better off fury.
---
Does he not realize he is not in fact first 60 ? Like dude vanilla was 15+ years ago.
---
Horde wont get as much honor kill for kill .
---
People on Grobb tend to whine less about balance.
---
But if all the Alliance frustrated at being ganked move to Grobb, then it'll be another Heartseeker.
---
You will feel sry when you get that power and armor reduction on you and you will be forced to fight faking bears in the wild :P
---
No
---
Lmao. I fucking played on Mal'Ganis. I REMEMBER THIS DUDE HAVING A BAD REP. That's exactly what I'm talking about.
---
With just a 5man group you cant really go to the hotspots when there are 100+ people raid groups running around. Smaller groups probably need to stay on the move and know when to attack and when to retreat
---
Same, just reached 40 in a hurry to avoid too much STV before P2. It won’t be any better in other zones, will it....
---
He said you tank you get tank gear you heal you get heal gear. And you basically said why would I tank it? Nobody would ask you to tank it. You're just presenting a hypothetical situation that nobody is even talking about.
---
Mage here. I just use my 6 second cast when the tank first pulls. Usually good by then
---
That’s the point man, it’s one thing to have a record to fastest to 60 but in his case it was a race because every other player was up against him. It’s kinda like time trials vs a race, the pressure is way different when it’s a race and more fame will come it
---
So what would be the best realm to join if I wanted to do world PVP, both horde and alliance?  Getting tired of my boring care-bear server.
---
Pure nonsense... Focus one Mob, bomb the rest. Don't Tank the focused one. 
---
Or i let them bomb from the start, mocking blow, taunt, concussion blow and tauren stun are more than enough to keep everything under control.
---
Hey corn corn, why are you actually using vendorstrike?
---
I'm teasing, and mostly being hyper critical of the all out wars going on right now with raids. I got to nearly 1000 honor kills as a holy priest and I had the same thing. Anywhere from 1 to 20 point estimates. That only took a couple hours, but I also felt burnt out and it's day one. The PvP is here to stay, and I think you and I need to find other things to do then spamming all out war mode for honor kills. It's boring and I definitely see it burning me out if I keep at it via the mega wars. Problem is that's gonna be happening for a week straight ESPECIALLY over the weekend. So I bought Xbox game pass for a dollar 😂
---
W're talking about WoW PvPers.
---
They'll keep charging in face of the lag for *months*, because "Theres a big battle happening in Southshore. That'll be a lag-infested shitshow. Lets go to Silithius for some gudfites" is *hard*.
---
You can also jump to lava near that "house" and keep jumping towards window from lava and it will get you teleported to raid.
---
Shitty behavior in groups isn't punished at all in retail, personal loot gets rid of the Ninja issue...
---
i have 13 so far
---
Scrubs everywhere plus lots of Entitled kids playing, that have no idea what happened in vanilla and how it happened
---
Sever populations are much higher on classic than vanilla. Low Med pop here was high on vanilla.
---
Faction balance also was generally better since people didn’t have metrics to pick servers where they have the number dvantage as easily.
---
So no, it wasn’t.
---
What raidplanner/Raidhelper thing?
---
I did this for someone too except I'm a mage and I'm not 60 yet so not you lol
---
Lol as a 60 droid I’m having a great time
---
So that's not right.
---
Blaumeax? Ragecandy looks familiar
---
Playing spriest currently:
---
- no damaging aoe unless you get nova later,  butttt..  why...
---
- shadow is great,  for shadow spells. I feel like certain situations demand different spells. Shadow hinders this. 
---
- [personal] - I'm gonna switch to holy soon. I love dungeons and raiding. I want to matter in those groups. Not saying shadow wouldn't matter, but who could argue the value of a holy priest?
---
- lock has a ton of value.  And I would suggest choosing that class. Spriest is definitely fun though. It's all about trying what you think will be fun and interesting!
---
There are 6 locks and 4 mages in line for this for my guild atm. Them all wanting to wait for mageblade helped me get the staff Wednesday :D Ill have Nefarian's staff before all those guys get the blade. I already have post-raid /w from some of the other casters about how they feel like they goofed for passing on it.
---
No they’re not. Most of what you read is overhyped stigma.
---
Balance is great in pvp and you can make it work in pve.
---
29/11/11 and 30/0/21 are very strong specs for pvp. 
---
I’m even levelling as balance currently and it’s fine.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/fSwVpfdqToY) is a video I uploaded for a guide who wanted some pointers.
---
God it's so boring.  Just AOE spam and more waiting around.
---
I have the same story...
---
I'm not even angr because of the Ninja item , his shitty behavior and what he said was the point where I was like "holy shit what an absolute asshole this guy is"
---
Aren't they giving faction specific transfer for free? Why are you whining?
---
Hahahaha REKT
---
I think we either have the same friend or there is a lot more people who are pretty gullable by the meta.
---
no such thing as 50/50 PvP and you're fully aware of it :)
---
Whiners, I see.
---
You also throw around a bunch of keywords and an arbitrary 5% to dominate while bringing no facts.
---
If you would checked other posts, people playing on small realms experience the same issue. Quit defending a phenomena which is unacceptable in a leading MMO.
---
Not even remotely true.
---
can we get some clarification on dishonorable kills? half saying it doesn't matter yet since ur rank 0 and have no rating so it doesn't affect u until next reset, which seems the most logic one and the other half says it does matter, which is it?
---
Yeah I think I pvp’d in almost every area of the map. I was in 5 man groups in 40 man grps. I ran with a 40 man raid into Blackrock mountain and it was eerie, not a single horde anywhere and then back to SS.  And  yeah it was prime time where both groups were barely able to push each other and every spell had a 2 sec delay. It was a lot of fun. Hopefully this hype lasts a bit.
---
Pic?
---
 is not only a server issue  ...what can't you understand?
---
Do you want to PvP, or do you want to win ?
---
If you want to win, then, well, do what most people do - gank, either by only taking fights when the enemy is outnumbered, outlevelled or both.
---
If you want to PvP, then even as a casual, you'll be fine because it's about the fight, and it's not like you lose xp or gear for dying.
---
Not all PvP servers are horde dominated you ape
---
This is one of the most important posts I've ever seen on this sub, but it won't get many upvotes, because it's not a stupid meme
---
Whispers all 3 druids on the realm: Hi would you like to tank [DUNGEON]?
---
Druid: I'm resto
---
Just kill one more, 422 is 420 too
---
Best part is people from your own faction can dispel the poison thinking they’re just helping you out.
---
We used to roll on that stuff. I'd just /roll for it and give it to the highest roll. If they don't want to roll, or don't win the roll, too bad. Screenshot it.
---
Keep looking. I bet you anything there is a guild that has less standard raid times. It took me a while to find a guild and a spot on a team with a time that worked for me.
---
In the beginning yea, when people are new to it raids can take a while. But even then so, the guild I picked only did 3 hours regardless of where we ended. Progress takes time, but playing consistently with people one or twice a week makes all the difference. 
---
As far as gearing for PvP. It just means you have clear cut goals on mind, like Player hit caps and I dunno I'm a healer so this is outside of what I know 😅
---
If you have a solid group that can push for bigger and bigger pulls, and go fast with everyone knowing what to do, it can be quite fun, but that's not how most PUGs ended up.
---
Just smoked a bowl of some good shit.
---
My condolences.
---
It’s not p2 that made you feel that way. It’s the slog that is level 50-60. Everyone gets that.
---
For many people yes, but not the people pushing for rank 14 first
---
No shit you ape
---
Same honor per point of damage. 
---
Which in practice works out heavily in favor of mages
---
Man I’m just soaking up these tears having rolled on a PvE server.  There was tons of action in Hillsbrad, but not enough for serious lag.  It was easily 150v150 and everything was running smooth.  You all may have the last laugh if they burn out and people stop flagging, but I’m definitely laughing it up right now.
---
Gross lol
---
What fucking mob do you need 10 seconds to get aggro on? There isn't a moon that lives that long that isn't a boss.
---
Lag had MUCH better performance than classic with, with even more people invovled than classic wow in the battles.
---
Took me 6 hours to get 40% of my level. Im level 45...im not even worth honor to the 60s, the game is 100% unplayable for me currently...cant even ZF grind as i cant even move near it...been playing respawn simulator in gadgetzan for the last 4 hours..
---
Got me good
---
I think people will get tired of this after about 2 weeks, then Blizzard will rush out WSG to tide us over in time for Christmas.
---
Spy addon ruined phase 2 wpvp tbh. Being able to scan the whole zone with 4 - 5 people is gamebreaking.
---
Not bugged, honor gets spread equally between raid/party members, but only the ones close enough to the target and alive.
---
Lol I guess you don't know what tagging is or how mob claiming works. Did you grin 1-60 on a pve server or something?
---
Never seen a single reserve group ad. Must be a server culture thing
---
I used to be super altoholic back in vanilla, but WoW is already taking enough of my time and now I'm quite comfortable with focusing on my one level 60 and just do some laid-back farm or some other raid prep during the most of the week.
---
I'm only saying that if you don't understand the importance of being physically able then I can't do much to change your mind, and being that I don't know you, it may be that you're unable to appreciate what difference it makes. You took an unusual amount of offense to that. I'm sorry. 
---
As for the rest of your post, I can't debate while you are having a temper tantrum. I'm just going to let you resort to name calling while I see my way out. 
---
✌
---
Sounds like politicians
---
What r u in a rush for
---
In dungeons its generally expected that warriors will roll on dps gear because warriors are mostly going to be dpsing in raids and pvp.
---
Otherwise, honestly just roll on anything you want thats a legit upgrade. Its dungeons, who cares?
---
It's not that we dont want it. It"s that the lag makes it pointless.
---
no one on server has gotten on first run....
---
You or the other guy have no idea what you're arguing about. Servers have a built in population cap. If they are run on azure or AWS, its already automatically scaling based on processing demand. The difference between pservers and classic included battlenet services such as agent, Which is an anticheat method. Every server tick,
---
every spell being cast including running checks on EACH client are included in the batch. Each tick is 400ms. 
---
Fortnite has a much smaller tick frame and lags with 40~ people in close quarters, but more inputs are being given generally.
---
It shows a /who button you can press to show class/level, name, msg and how long ago the msg was posted. You can set it to sort newest first yes
---
AQ opening will be glorious. True Vanilla feeling incoming.
---
Excited to see some of that phase 2 PvP.
---
The Realms are grossly overpopulated anyway. Reverting the insane pop cap changes to Vanilla should help quite a lot on its own.
---
Benediction for sure. We were the closest to 50/50, but a I think more Horde are transferring over. Def need more allies to keep it balanced. Tell allies to come the benediction.
---
On me and I’ll even toss you some bags or something to start.
---
Sure there are ways to prevent your own faction griefing. You can have more people to deal more DPS. You can collude with the other people in your faction to make a plan who gets the kill each time, etc.
---
Why is everyone on reddit so fucking whiney? I read the OG post about jokerd and sure, hes a fucking cunt. But that post was so fucking cringey. 1000 word essay finished with "I'm not mad iz just game". Yeah, if you write a fucking essay about how you're so sad about something someone did in a virtual word it's more than a game for you. Pathetic.
---
Nahh he probably simply joined a Schlachtzug in Vorgebirge des Hügellands.
---
Ticket time is definitely longer in classic than in any of the big pservers.
---
Also it definitely crashes more often.
---
Everybody always needs on the scourgestones tho
---
Lol how is 3 months after release late? I hate that attitude. I'm having fun getting my first mount and people actively shame me for being lvl 42? So bizarre.
---
No I’m not, I’m just ignorant.
---
Except, nobody actually knows this. It could negate any honor earned this week, for all we know. Unless it's written somewhere, that DHK's only affect the honor pool of last week.... but haven't seen that.
---
Idk, I am just happy that there are no achievements so all he has to do is keep reminding everyone that he was in fact the first 60 on classic, and it will be forgotten in a year anyway.
---
i love the difference between alliance and horde on this sub
---
alliance: please let me play the game im begging you ive corpse run all the way to this questing hub and the zone
---
horde: LOL ALLIANCE SUCK CRYBABY btw look at my horde tattoo loktar!!
---
Oooh drama!
---
Yeah, druids are good at running away, from 1 or 2 people any more and it gets difficult cause someone will just mount up and get ahead of you to slow/stun or just damage you.
---
I would be the impatient guy, that will start the fight.
---
As a fake tank its mega hard to keep aggro while wearing a shield, especially if your dps dont have discipline. You just dont generate enough rage from either damage dealt or taken, and whenever you lose aggro it gets harder to get ahead in threat because of lack of rage, which leads to losing more aggro etc.
---
Without a prot warrior/disciplined dps youre going to have a stressful time, shields or not
---
Everyone should be required to watch this video.
---
I know most people here didnt play on private servers, and think that people are just making shit up or whatever. These servers had their own set of problems, but large scale world pvp fucking worked.
---
I never in my years of playing saw the kind of lag that we see now on Classic servers. Sometimes the server would crash and restart, but it was relatively rare and most of the time it looked like it does in the video.
---
Blizzard are just incompentent.
---
Ahh back then you had to optimize for efficiency. Today you just throw more hardware at the problem ... or not.
---
Why is everyone on these streamers dicks? Should make another sub for this shit and ban streamer content from this sub. All streamers are toxic and don't belong in a video game sub.
---
I already have FiveSecondRule, what i'm looking for is an addon that tracks all server ticks, 5sr does it great for when i'm coming out of the 5sr, but i need to know when server ticks are all the time so i can stutter-step, FiveSecondRule disappears after two ticks from coming out of the 5sr.
---
For real tho, how much was he making from getting several server firsts on pservers compared to the potential monetary gain from being signed with method?
---
Sprinkled in my mountain dew.
---
And now he is dropped from method, and everyone knows he's an untrustworthy ass.  Wonder how special that makes him now?
---
As an alliance that left stalagg for heartseeker when transfers first opened, how was stalagg today? Just curious
---
That's 3 weeks of solid game time in 2 1/2 months. That's ridiculous. How do you not get bored playing the same game over and over and over?
---
Thats the dumbest thing I've ever heard...
---
So a server with 5000 people thats 75/25 will NEVER have more than 2500 people online because there can never be more horde than alliance and they'll be queued for hours?
---
Awesome:D
---
Why do you find yourself in groups with reserves? I will never toloeate that BS and will never join groups with it.
---
Vanish, Blind, Improved Sprint, Free Action Potion (before engage)
---
So much this.
---
Exactly the same classes!! T2 Warlock/Shaman legs at Ragnaros and 2x T2 Warlock at Onyxia yesterday. 
---
Went for minimum DKP as only one person needed each item
---
You'll never catch me !
---
But where does it end?
---
Wintergrasp is basically a battleground, not really world pvp. There was very little pvp outside of wintergrasp.
---
That's alot of pussy!
---
I love that these crying posts are almost always in the PoV of alliance. Lol.
---
Pservers provided a better experience. People expecting a rich af company to at least achieve the same or better with their own game, when it is dedinitely possible.
---
Warriors scale very well. Leveling can be a struggle, but once you start getting solid gear at 60, warriors can be one of the best tanking and DPs classes in the game. Ya just gotta take your lumps while leveling up.
---
classic is more casual friendly than retail at end game..... Until naxx.
---
&gt; being that I don't know you,
---
Yet you seem to enjoy to giving unsolicited, assumptious advice, even if off topic. Let me return the favor. 
---
I think you should really step back and look at what you wrote,  and try to see how preachy and pretentious you sound.
---
15+ years of hardware... Internet being 5x as fast?.... Private servers doing on a shoe strong budget with servers hosted in russia?
---
Welp i see there is an issue here but to be honest this isnt blizzards fault. People like to play horde and thats it. Nobody , NOBODY will reroll a human just because people on reddit are crying about it.
---
Even considering the amount of time in one sitting is require that you must commit to?
---
I mean, the customer service team actively looks through reddit posts. There is a reason the best one announced ON REDDIT that he was leaving himself.
---
Got to level 56 before p2, guess I it is time quit till battle grounds are added.
---
How is the balance here?i also play there but im low level
---
So which one is it? 65 340 or 285?
---
Have you ever looked at the code base of private servers? There's validation everywhere and pretty good anticheat
---
It should be removed but it won’t because people like it and nochanges doesn’t matter rn.
---
Nah that’s definitely not him, I think Jokerd is the guy in the new villain movie following a mentally ill character who thinks people love him for him, when in reality people love him for what he symbolizes
---
Actually kinda makes sense, never thought about it that way.
---
Im still 22 bc some nelf killed me in Ashenvale and I got so mad I went back to bfa. Now i feel like its too late to return... and too shameful
---
It's not a big deal
---
from 1.8 onwards the ''average weapon speed listed on the item'' was no longer relevant as all attacks were following a preset value  
---
two handed 3.3  
---
one handed 2.4  
---
daggers 1.7  
---
and ranged 2.8 (from 1.10 and onwards)  
---
this lead to players gravitating to weapons with better dps over just a slow speed. As the amount of damage gained through attack power was not calculated as  
---
attack power in dps (atp /14) \* 3,8 on a slow weapon  
---
but  
---
attack power in dps \* 3,3 regardless of how slow or fast the weapon was
---
hoj is still good defensively, it doesnt always necessarily mean a positioning break. imp conc is that good that it is similar in value and a worthy tradeoff though. it is very close to a tossup and could come down more to the comp you often play with.
---
So you didn’t make any friends or join a guild with reasonable people during your whole leveling process?  That’s really unfortunate but if you don’t make the social connections you definitely run the risk of having a bad time in the end game.
---
Bully ON CAMERA while being a little twink bitchboy?  
---
WTF, grammarschoolers would piss on your face kiddo.
---
Trying to whisper shout so mom won't burst in and give him a 1-2 combo?  
---
What a sissy LOL
---
or you can let them have the tag and then suicide to the boss until they won't tag it anymore. The only question is: will they be doing the same shitty thing? If yes, it will be a never ending cycle. 
---
And what about the guys without the intend to raid the boss, only to prevent the kills? Not sure why anyone can defend this behaviour, it is obviously griefing without the chance to prevent it, if some people really want to grief your raid here. this is a sad day for this subreddit..
---
That looked so fucking epic.
---
You monster!
---
i am playing in PvE server medium pop and i love it. No ganking when u dont want, just turn pvp off. Also yesterday we had a battle with hordes, 150v150 ( got like 700hk) and you know what, i didn't have a single laggspike, not even when aoe spamming was.  + Also wont be geting ganked while leveling up, can run to dungeons without being raped and so on.
---
arhh that makes sense. the mail head from dire maul west. make my nose look like freaking beak. its a shaman head not designed for dwarf
---
.5 is too long. You can maybe land a spell if he does gouge 0.2 seconds before cheap shot is done.
---
Yo! The fuck happened though?
---
Yeah, seems like a knebent immature response from OP. I've also seen numerous empty tomes, and never even batted an eye. Just seem like something that happens.
---
Maybe if op and a ton of other players would stop putting in useless reports for non issues, our GM's would have more time to deal with actual issues in the game.
---
It's about both obviously.
---
Looks pretty similar to attempts our guild did 14 years ago.
---
or warlock.. mage..
---
he does not, guaranteed  
---
this is a nobody on a powertrip because he exploited fastest on the re-release of a 15year old game
---
Such big battles are just a spam fest while running back and foreward. Being melee means you're at the short end of all of it.
---
&gt; The only way WoW survives is if they continue to sell nostalgia. That's why they're bringing back old spells for "class identity" and squishing the level cap. All they develop for is retention.
---
No shit developers develop the game so people keep playing it that's how they make money. What else are they supposed to do, make changes specifically so that people will hate it and leave?
---
there was a similar addon back in the day
---
Did you mine more than a second on nost/lh? They fucking teleport to the nodes and your done. Gl getting lotus or any other herb/node when they just vanish because of that. Nost had no anti-cheat whatsoever lol, stop pretending.
---
This is not true. Only blizzard knows why the servers lag and it’s likely not because of a few extra security checks.
---
There absolutely was not an open world add-on where I don't need to see someone but I am able to target them and find my way to them.
---
That dumbass should have waited until P3 for SSF. That one is BiS at least.
---
No, there are two blue sets, an original one from 1.4 and an upgraded one from 1.11
---
Blizzard replaced the old sets with the new ones when patch 1.11 hit, because frankly, the old pvp sets are quite crappy.
---
You yourself never upgrade anything
---
Where are you?
---
yes, but why 0.77 instead of 0.7?
---
exactly lol  
---
because the other 8 pakis he lives with in the outskirts of bumfuck manchester would walk in and slap him the like the litte Bitch he is
---
Jump off the bridge into the lava next to the wall where the NPC is. You will hit the portal and get into MC without talking to the NPC.  
---
The portal location has never been moved, you can do this on retail still--only you can just fly into the lava on your mount and hit the portal.
---
optimizing for HpS and Efficacy by removing all constraints is unrealistic so i'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. 
---
I feel like I'm talking past you. Efficacy is important, but you can't build your gear purely on efficacy. Let me just illustrate optimizing PURELY based on efficacy. 
---
If you're optimizing for efficacy why pick heal 2 over renew 1? that's a big decision and while I agree heal 2 is the go to spell for priests, you just completely gloss over how you arrived there. Using your equations with a set H of 300, rank 1 renew gives you better efficacy, which is your bottom line for which stats are better. Any +heal over 300 widens the gap. 
---
Se comparison:
---
(note\* sub lvl 20 spell penalty =  1 - ((20 - sLvl) \* 0.0375). For slvl 8 the penalty is .55)
---
 Se = (Sh+Sc\*H)/Sm 
---
renew 1 Se = (45 + .55 \* 300)/30 = 7
---
heal 2 Se = ((445 + 507)/2 + .857\*300)/205 = 3.57
---
At +300 healing renew rank 1 is almost TWICE as efficient as heal 2. 
---
Your point earlier was basically "if you need more HpS just rank up" but really if you need more efficacy you also have options (utilize 5sr, or even use renew 1). With high spirit efficacy becomes almost a non-factor. HpS in tough fights is almost always at least as important. 
---
All this being said, for gear optimization you need to consider both HpS and efficacy. If you have 65 spirit you can infinitely keep renew 1 up on your tank without even unitilizing 5sr (aka infinite efficacy). 
---
Just one last way i will try to iterate this point:
---
which is better:
---
Heal 2 with +500 heal power and no bonus int (603.33 HpS,  4.41 Spell Efficiency)
---
Heal 2 with +300 heal power and + 100 int (\~493 HpS, 3.576 Spell efficiency, 1500 mana (7 extra casts))
---
Heal 4 with +300 heal power and + 100 int (\~698 HpS, 2.29 Spell efficiency, 1500 mana (5 extra casts))
---
The answer isn't just automatically the second option because of the efficacy. HpS is also a factor. You originally said "if you need more HpS just use higher rank". But as you can see, if you want 600+ HpS or more, upranking to rank 4 decreases your spell efficiency by half. I'm not making a judgement that any one of these spells is optimal, it's situational. but you can't just pick a single spell and optimize for efficacy while ignoring the other important factor (hps).
---
He logs out and his party member resets the instance. This obviously boots him out of it. Then he logs in and runs in.
---
I mean, its not if someone actually wanted it to equip (paladin tank) and part of the loot rules. was in a 10 man group as well. you have to weed out the shitters somehow, better to test their loyalty on a glorified paladin aoe farming shield than something that actually matters for a guild.
---
just a prank bro
---
Yeah because horde have more will to fight.
---
Hurley's Tankard and Mug O'Hurt. Noted.
---
butthurt undead male rogue?
---
Then change servers lol.
---
Farmed the same people + large group. Unfortunately you were probably only getting 1-5 Honor per kill. Still crazy amount though.
---
does the weird gray bar always stick around it?
---
Hemmorhage was normalized in 2.2 TBC iirc.
---
But definitely not in vanilla, so it is indeed a bug
---
Rofl
---
Golemagg was actually pretty stable, if you werent bashing your head in Southshore vs Tarren Mill.
---
It was an amazing first night, 3vs3, 40vs40, 20vs40... 3vs40, we saw everything last night! Good hunting alliance, to our horde brethren I say 'For the Horde!'
---
Exactly what are you expecting them to do? Buy entirely new servers, install them, setup new software, link it all to an already existing cloud-service, make sure its sade and another thousand steps, all within what? 3 months?
---
Changing a server infrastructure is not something you do in a month or two.
---
Its how it works. There isnt any doubt
---
They pay for it and influence the design of retail.
---
I view ninjaing and reserves in about the same light.  I ran scholo and ubrs for literal in game days because the guy at the very end had shit I wanted, and you just had to get lucky twice in a row for it.
---
At least now there are two classes horde side, three alliance side that can tank.  I don't remember many druids tanking in vanilla, of course the multiplier from armor was shit on bear forms out the gate..
---
As a tank, I’m sorry but I’m not interested in joining groups from a random whisper. I get them all the time, and decline every one. Does anyone actually find people through this method?
---
Well I hope he thought losing eh at effectively was going to be his job was worth the laughs.
---
Then why can't rogues backstab by walking into enemies?
---
get a lawyer instead
---
Shouldn't matter. I got a Hunter book off of the King, then looted the tomes after killing the king where I found another Hunter book, the book is Unique so I couldn't loot it but the tome did not disappear when i exited the loot window. 
---
If there is loot on the book it will not disappear, empty books are a thing, I've had at least 3.
---
You're really asking this on a sub that only exists because people play a 15 year old game?
---
&gt;Ban Spy addon, any coder can re-write an addon that checks your perimiter about enemies that are not npc and casting spells.
---
The issue is that it is detecting people who are not casting spells. People get detected simply because they are buffed. Warriors get detected just because they are in a stance.
---
This should not be the case and IIRC didn't work that way until way later in the game#s history.
---
Yes there was. I can’t remember the name of it but the combat log has always worked the same way and they have no way of breaking the addon without breaking damage meters and a ton of other stuff.
---
A dog is even more responsibilities though, I have to go out several times a day and I just can't leave it home when I'm at work. A cat would be more suitable for a family, I don't get how people manage to have dogs with this day's life scheme.
---
He said it's official
---
It's not about it being fun for some though. It's about getting honor for ranking
---
Original repository was deleted because that was stolen code... not because original authors were active again.
---
Also original author is not back. HealComm4 project was taken over

You work break code license in the same way as Avianas.
---
&gt; LULW
---
Get the fuck out. This isn't twitch.
---
You couldn't do large scale pvp in Vanilla as well. It really doesn't matter what your past private server experience was.
---
BuT tHe SErVerS aRE UnplAYaBLe anD BLiZZarD reFUSes tO FiX ThEM or GivE REfunD.

Yeah most weapons with high base damage also have high dps. So for example this weapon  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13348/demonshear](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13348/demonshear) would still be much better then this weapon  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12790/arcanite-champion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12790/arcanite-champion) because it has higher base damage. And similar dps.
---
FYI, in an mmo if you like pvp, other players /are/ the content. You are literally losing content by being a toxic child.
---
It doesnt only hurt stealth classes. It devalues hunter tracking somewhat as well.
---
&gt; You can only get DKs by killing certain NPCs (they are marked, but I forget how).
---
They have a silver nameplate.
---
Cats are great no fuss pets. I have a cat sitting on my chest right now
---
you're a bright one are you
---
Because alliance is outnumbered heavily on every PvP server, partly due to blizzards initial fuckup of how they handled server transfers, and partly imo that they went with cross realm BG's off the bat alongside them being confirmed
---
You no longer get honor for killing stuff when you'rr 11999 honored with timbermaw. You need to do turn-in quests to get the rest of the way.
---
For paladins, maybe. In 1.11 Blizz allowed paladins to keep the old set, if they preferred it and buy the new one in addition. I think the same was the case for shaman and druids. But all other classes got their set directly upgraded.
---
And honestly, I don't think the old paladin pvp set is very good.
---
* Helmet is complete trash with 9 Str, 8 Agi and 31 Stam. You only gain 8 Agi and 12 Stam, but lose 9 Str, 12 Int and 26 Spelldmg.
---
* Shoulders are reasonable, but not much better than dungeon drops. Comapred to thenew set you gain 12 Agi and 5 Spirit, but lose 2 Str, 1 Int, 2 Stam and 20 Spelldmg
---
* Chest is reasonable. You gain 8 Agi, 7 stam and 1% crit, but lose 8 Str, 12 Int and 25 Spelldmg. That's comparable, but if you want crit, why not use savage glad?
---
* Gauntlets are a straight downgrade, old ones have +3 Str and Stam, but lose 1% crit.
---
* Leggings are the best piece of the old set due to 2% crit, but you pay for it with 11 Str, 12 Int, 4 Stam and 25 Spelldmg. 
---
* Old boots are in trash territory again, while their stats aren't bad, they only have +1 Str, + 2 Stam, +7 int and -3 Agi compared to Sapphiron Scale Boots, a lvl 53 boe. New pvp boots are great with 12 Str and 15 Spelldmg.
---
* Set bonus we have 1% crit and 6 int vs 23 Spelldmg and 15 Stam vs 20 Stam. Slight advantage for the new set again.
---
So all in all, 4 pieces of the old set are hands down worse than the new set and the other two are reasonable choices, if you really want some additional crit chance at the price of a lot of Str, Int and Spelldmg.
---
Well put.
---
Well if you consider how wow went through expansions, each offering less time to travel or do stuff in open world, getting more  sharding technology, since you didn't need the servers to be capable of having 100+ players in the same zone/place....
---
There simply was no need for servers to handle massive amounts of players since they worked hard on sharding, layering, instancing and other stuff that  got people out of the world and into main cities/instances...  
---
I remember in early BfA when we were doing world bosses, with less than 40 people the world boss lagged (well with high settings even raids lag, but you don't need to be able to have 100+ people there lag free). Considering how wow classic was basically legion client scaled back, it doesn't surprise me at all. What surprises me is that blizzard so far didn't do very much to adress this, and so far didn't indicate that they even intend to.
---
Haha I feel you guys.
---
Horde on my server formed up a massive amount of people outside BRM. Then people were spying on the ally streamers and warned us, “big ally raid inc”
---
They weren’t even 1/10 and got pushed from BRM all the way down to storm wind. We camped the gates for a good hour or 2.
---
2 bad I was not in the main raid, would have gotten so much HKs.
---
Playing a druid is *all* about balance.  The balance of talent points in feral and resto. 
---
Nah but low tier talents in balance are amazing, just not that great for casting.
---
Half
---
More likely to help out the fuckstick unbalance of wpvp than stability. WPVP will quiet down and stability will return, but the unbalance will remain.
---
Name of the addon u use for the minimap? Looks cool asf
---
Read it again, 75% of survey answers play on a pvp server, 49% of total survey answers play alliance
---
You coulda killed that warrior kek
---
4% more main hand swings is not 4% more damage, it's 4% more attack power scaling, it's way more than 4% rage as well, and you know what happens when you give a fury warrior more rage? The warrior gets to do more stuff, which means more rage generation, which means he gets to do more stuff, which means he gets more rage. And so on and on forever, which is why warriors is a broken class in classic.
---
Serious question tho, how do i level my 53 mage drin now in :(
---
And when they realize they risk using the casual players or players that can only play a little amount every week (on ally side mainly, and horde if on an ally dominated realm). Maybe both though since I don't think we've let anyone actually quest
---
Oh I see 😊 thanks for the advice mate!
---
Uninstall is probably the best bet, yes.
---
You think classic wow is going to be this popular a year after Naxx? Or even in a year? It's not going to fail, but we are in the golden era.
---
Also, they will never merge servers. That would force the entire server to rename. That's why you always go for the largest possible server, you'll have more opportunity
---
Something to keep in mind! Thanks mate 😁
---
also detects people on flightpaths flying over you.
---
Holy Nova is what you use for solo lasher grinding.
---
Literally sat here and calculated about 8 scenarios where you reserved loot and didn't with group fills and your 4% comment.   At no point of repeat clear did your reserve ever come in front of a straight up free roll assuming 3 players competed for the same drop based on my own exposure to trying to make groups to the dungeon.   Sat here and tried to type it out, decided fuck it.  You keep reserving because even if I did the math, your sure you will get it that way.  Have a good day.  And yes, your way is slower.  Sleepy time for me!
---
NO.
---
Are you read up ?  
---
Depend on the duration of the fight .
---
He supported him until he directly attacked Asmon and his guild.
---
Lol just download spy for yourself 4head
---
Im happy that I caught her at the same time as the chain lightning. An image of many words.
---
He gained nothing from Method, and the ninja will not affect his streams, only some of the sponsors which he cares about not
---
The other day some war was looking for a tank for DM N or W (I forgot which). I told him Id tank it if I can res forors. He said he asked group and they would let me res it if I paid them like 100g each, which even if they werent given jerky replies I guess they would collect 100% regardless of book drop. I was mostly doing jump runs, but out of curiosity, I decided to form a group for the exact wing and put it together in like 5 mins (getting a book res without issue), meanwhile guy was still in LFG for another 30 mins.
---
He took it cause its a fucking game and he needed the item lol, stop trying to read between the line KEKW
---
Wow thank you so much!
---
This is the first ever i got a silver!
---
FYI, retail pretty much has this in the sharding system. It's just moving you into the queue for those zones instead of server. The horde(who MASSIVELY outnumber alliance in retail as well) get shoved into their own little world with pretty much no alliance though because there just aren't enough alliance to go around.
---
No your instant attacks will do much more damage.
---
It’s very playable, I’ll stay
---
L2Read 5Head
---
That's way too long for just MC and ony
---
The fundamental problem is the gear gap between casuals in their 50s and hardcore players who've been at 60 for some time. Putting those two groups in the same honor category is just absurd. You can't blame those hardcore players for farming honor in level 50 quest zones - it's in their nature to be efficient. In time their victims will either retreat to dungeons or stop playing altogether, and those hardcore players will have to rely on fighting each other for honor (as it should be). By the time those of us in our 50s are caught up and ready to participate, phase 3 will be live and we'll have missed out on the whole experience.
---
I want to experience world PVP as much as you do, but I'm not sure where exactly I can do that right now.
---
It's a trap!
---
Dont even need to get solid aggro, just ffs, let me get the mobs to the pull spot rather than in the middle of 15 patrol paths.
---
Hasn't it been explained multiple times before that private servers did a lot less combat checks compared to blizzard servers?
---
Royson didnt ninja. He paid the gold for the items worth and shared it with everyone that was in that party. Stop spreading misinformation. Royson made it right.
---
That the tank is a druid
---
Keep in mind EVE is designed radically different from WoW. Sure it is possible to process all events asynchroneously as they come instead of queueing up everything and letting 1 thread deal with it per server tick.
---
After doing some world pvp yesterday, I can confirm that WoW does not tick an entire continent at the same time, but rather small regions. For instance, we had 5 horde raids at the gates of IF last night and noticed, that things would run somewhat outside IF, but as soon as you crossed into IF the game stopped receiving updates. This leads to me to believe, that WoW splits its' zones based on zonedata (they may still use a grid to perform inrange checks, thereby splitting the quite large IF zone into multiple pieces, so whenever you cast your arcane explosion, you do not have to perform a range check between you and EVERYONE in IF, but only those adjacent) and lets these tick individually. Whether movement and other events are handled in the same update tick or whether they are parallelized I do not know. I do however suspect that since we were fighting over the threshold between 2 "update regions", the server will have had a massive overhead to ensure concurrency (basically this means that when 2 threads are processing using the same data, ie players on either side of the threshold, they need to wait for each other so they do not write and read to the same memory space simultaniously, as this makes baby jesus cry and literally kills people).
---
Now, there are several other ways of designing this, albeit it gets substantially more complicated doing so. I think this was never changed from the way wow was designed in the early 2000s, as this method is the one usually employed by mmo designers back then as it is extremely simple.
---
Being on the other side of outnumbered, pretty fucking great!
---
I use addon for auto dismount and macro similar to this (I am at work so can't test it).
---
 \#showtooltip  
---
/cancelaura \[mod:shift\] Stealth  
---
/cast \[nomod\] !Stealth
---
Mine is bound to &lt; key so I just use shift to unstealth and can spam the macro so I do not accidentally unstealth.
---
Almost the entirety of the game is run server side to prevent exploiting.  
---
Blizzard will never offload that to the client. Ever. If they did, it would be impossible to prevent game breaking exploits and hacks.
---
You are fine you don’t give honor to 60’s till 48
---
98% certain dhks don't matter when you're at rank 0.  I distinctly remember losing rank % immediately when they happened

Anybody who watched his stream for a couple minutes realize its an act hes putting, hes playing the arogant guy whos the best in the world, seeing all thoses kids here taking him seriously is actually lame as fck, whats next, peoples gonna get mad at Tyler1 cause he scream and being toxic? Cancel culture is insane...
---
Boomkins already have 10% extra damage further up, but i think it is somewhat reasonable to do. Or just let omen of clarity not have a 5 point requirement...like all other classes with clearcasting...
---
Yeah we stomped a lot of allies yesterday 10:1. It was so much fun. Can’t wait to do it all over tonight.

Wasting your time? Your username must be a joke.
---
I'm done trying to explain something beyond your understanding
---
People saying their server have no lag are either playing in la la land or private servers.
---
I'm also on a med pop server and 100+ v 100+ definetly lags for everyone involved.
---
It didnt crash though and at some points worked fine, but most of the time the lag was pretty bad.
---
150 people fighting at tarren mill. 0 lag. 50 people fighting @ org and tons of lag
---
how does that make sense.
---
It’s your subscription. You should do what you enjoy.
---
I also agree with you that it’s more enjoyable to play retail if you have limited time.
---
Not my logic but jokers
---
Just defollow on twitch, remember his Name and never Play a god damn fucking dungeon or Overall a god damn fucking game !   hate those idiots -.-
---
I find it funny he wouldn't even go for the mageblade over the staff...
---
Druid: Sure!  I'm in Moonglade, it'll take me like 20 minutes to get to BRD if that's OK?
---
*20 minutes later*
---
Druid (in Moonkin form): OK, let's do this.
---
I think Lock gets stamina? Unsere with Mage tho.
---
Prepare for lag and being bored out of your mind watching players skipdedoo around you
---
Its not a patch. They just turned it on
---
Is there a webpage that lists server pop and ratios, especially for EU?
---
Yep, I'm using it because it's an absolutely necessary evil. Don't enjoy it at all. But it'd dumb not to have it.
---

Hope he's out there in p2 Mo' murda'ing it up at tha crossroads.

I don’t think its toxic, just indifferent like with every other rag kill, epic BoE drop, or ding 60 post.

I guess that’s what I get for sorting with /new, though.

And really he's just the joker.

Probably was fucking around because Blizzard tries to stabilize the servers with the heavy PvP load rn.

Is it viable to just do dungeon runs until levelling
---
Or

Farm mobs / grind next to graveyards.. So if u do die..

 U don't have to walk far back.

"Rankings and titles are only updated once a week, during the weekly reset. The only exception for this is Dishonorable Kills, explained below, which will affect your rankings immediately."
---
and
---
"Dishonorable Kills will affect your Honor rating immediately, making you lose standings within your server and, with enough DKs, you might even lose a PvP rank. DKs are the only thing that can affect your rating when it happens, instead of waiting for the weekly reset to witness its impact."

from https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview
---
Half or more of the mages and warlocks in your raid are going to go for the mageblade instead, too.  So the staff is deceptively a lot easier to get.  A new warlock to our guild raided first time with us on tuesday and got the staff that night.
---
yes it is the same , just the very slow weapons are not the only available choice to go like befor norm,  this is much more visible in long battles and white damage
---
There’s no lag because nobody wasn’t engaging lmao. The whole part of the lag is when all the spells and aoe start coming in. Ofc there is no lag when no one is fighting
---
Was the stupid ear rape necessary?
---
\#NoChanges
---
Yeah it’s full of all the pussy alliance that couldn’t hack it before.  I suppose now they are happy that the imbalance is in their favor because that’s what is really fun, right?
---
Flurry axe
---
WONT SOMEBODY THINK OF THE INNOCENT BEARS?!
---
Happy cake day my dude
---
They're pretty even... but mageblade is 1h, which makes it **way** better by virtue of the offhand.
---
Yes, but I still pity all people like me trying to quest in 50 zones. Yesterday a group of 10 hordes were roaming un'goro the whole evening with little to no opposition.
---
unfortunatly city raids dont happen much because of dishonorable kills hugely affecting your weeks honor score.  the wpvp happens outside of cities.
---
Yeah. Most of the people on this subreddit just hate streamers so they'll do whatever it takes to criticize them. He shouldn't have ninjad but I'm cringing at all the people taking this clip so seriously.
---
Grobbulus!
---
Don't come back
---
It may feel long but not long in terms of wow mindset. In retail we only get a new raid like every half year
---
There is no honor to farm if everyone from the underdog faction leaves the server
---
everybody complaining about servers when big pvp battles happen: *laughs in EVE Online*
---
My main goal is world pvp (1v1) and with so little time to deck up my character I think I will have no chance with it
---
... ok

One Raid to rule them all, One Raid to find them

I thought that one redditor figured out they we are just paying for toilet paper

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0
---
2.3 actually.
---
Got buffed to 125% wep dmg which meant it got normalized.
---
I think I'll try to introduce the idiom he "jokerd" instead of ninja'ed foe the future and hope it sticks =]
---
Hed already began escaping in the movie.
---
This shouldn't be downvoted. You're literally right lol.
---
"reasonable solutions for major problems like lag, shit easy raid content, faction imbalance"
---
Lol.
---
For each of those, the only solution is "find a new player base".
---
You're an idiot lmao. Malding.
---
Challenging is different. 
---
If you want difficult pve content go play retail mythic raiding.
---
Without really getting into the math of it, yeah it's a lot better.  The staff is *slightly* better when you compare both directly but the mageblade lets you use an offhand which is huge (aquamentas can get you 20 sp, drakestone can get you up to 28sp).  Or for locks, you retain the ability to use spellstone in pvp (important).
---
Keeping the numbers is changing the purpose of the game/raid. So yeah it depends what do you understand in #nochanges - the game is different so there are many changes. Its our/blizzards choise whether to use brain or not.
---
There's a blue 2h sword that I can't remember the name of (Blade of the Titans?) that looks like a giant orange spatula.
---
yeah for fury warriors fast weapons would be ideal.
---
Thd ice block is the beginning of the escape.
---
i can't watch esfand, the stream is just not interesting at all and his groups/raids are all a shit show.
---
I'll be staying in instances till 60.
---
As a healer priest i do diff shit. Mara runs cane be lucrative if you sell ring everytime. I also run a potion racket, sometimes im an item broker and get 10% when i get a sale to happen. Sometimes i make big money moves and creating bubbles on ah with my guildies. Other times i flip items as a door to door salesman.
---
You’re lame
---
In 2-3 weeks 95% of all the gungho pvpers will have given up. All the hyped up people who don't really understand what it takes to grind ranks in Classic will drop out very quickly once the realization starts seeping in.
---
That charge was wonderful. Chestnutz would be proud.
---
I kinda want to see ancient battle formations see some sort of usage in WoW but the targeting system kinda ruins that I guess. You can't have a line of 10 tanks with 5 healers and stab them to death like the Spartans of Thermopylae.
---
They dont play the same or fill the same role in pvp. Vastly different. Warlocks dont have mana issues because the class is designed around overpriced (in mana) spells and you are required to lifetap. Youll need to eat, not drink after engagements or just quickly bandage.  
---
  
---
Cant comment on scaling, idk where youve heard that being brought up from but its not a thing ive heard of.  
---
Soul shard farming is a pain and not a meme, its something you always need to be mindful of as a warlock with no shards is almost fucking useless and if you have little shards you wont be as generous with their usage thus stifling your performance. Its not exactly hard, but it is something that no other class needs to do.  
---
I would argue warlock has more survivability but theyre very equal. All specs of priests have the same mana issues.  
---
I'll tell you this much, if you do any kind of group pvp, expect your dots to be immediately dispelled by a priest and theres nothing you can really do to stop them also dots are not that great in pvp because its damage over *time* as opposed to simply blowing someone up in 5 seconds.
---
I have both at nearly 60 in classic. Also played both in TBC.
---
1) pvp roles? Spriest is the 1v1 king. Warlock, in many situations, is better, and in many, worse. But Spriest can always drop shadowform and throw some heals.
---
But the real difference between the two is Spriest gets mind flay (which slows while damaging, which is amazing) while warlocks get more dots. So warlocks can stay more mobile. Spriest has to channel mind flay and cast mind blast to do decent dmg. Warlock can drop dots and cast nightfall bolts.
---
2) Mana issues? In pvp? Yes, that's par for casters. If you die with mana you're doing it wrong.
---
3) sadly spriests aren't that great in pve until TBC. That said, one usually has a place in the raid. And on short fights, if they're allowed to cast mind flay, they're great.
---
4) not a pain at all.
---
5) overall more survivable? Soul link lock. But a well-played Spriest is damn close.
---
6) well, no, because instead of doing dmg all the time, they wand and save their mana for heals as needed.
---
They're both very fun. I recommend leveling both. I am (as a dualbox too)
---
Dear OP.
---
When you did Classic, did you look up a shit-ton of information about how to level effectively, where to get BiS gear and how to do every fight.
---
If you did, then congrats. You are part of the problem.
---
Not sure if you are sarcastic to be honest but if you are not do you really enjoy doing 10:1 ? I have done it last night as alliance, it was boring, then horde came as 90, boring as well. The moment I enjoyed the most when we were slightly outnumbered like 2:1
---
Arise, arise, Riders of alliance!
---
Im mining iron and herbing wild steelbloom on my lvl 60 druid.. in low lvl zones with no people. It is lovely. Supplying the war effort! :)
---
You miss heard. 
---
They said Phase 2 will be funny! 
---
Small but important difference.
---
No, but that is pretty minor consolation when it takes an hour to corpse hop into endgame dungeons.
---
Method posted a follow-up response concluding the investigation, the jerkface got booted.
---
Also worth including in your post - well written and to the point btw, appreciate when people can post in a calm and coherent manner instead of being overly dramatic.
---
&gt; people accepted shit on their plate when they subbed for wow classic.
---
ill be honest...when I subscribed I thought to myself, finally classic experience with more powerful computers and better internet than in 2005.
---
I had no idea it would be like this. obviously people paid for their sub, how else are you supposed to encounter issues like this.
---
and people pay by month, not by day, so you can't just stop paying to show blizzard your stance on this
---
I have to constantly tell people that I am a girl. My in game name is TohToh and I am a female undead mage. Guildies call me bro and man all the time, which I get is a slang thing, not always a gender thing. The topics of conversation are usually pretty masculine though. People always seem shocked that I'm a waitress or that I have knowledge about bartending. It's really silly. I admit, a 24 year old, female waitress is not your average wow player. It's funny nonetheless.
---
No. That is not how reserving items works. Again showing this sub has no idea what reserving is.
---
Seriously? You think any of these were remotely fair fights? I can't so much as walk 10 ft without a roaming death squad of 60's ganking me for honor
---
Yea I just notice that if someone leaves in retail, you pull up the LFG interface and they are teleported to the instance... I’ve had that happen in classic and it all went downhill, and we couldn’t find another player.
---
I thought those people are getting the most views?
---
Yes it works, sometimes.
---
That’s what I’m really getting at. Just with not much time, there is more instant gratification.
---
Yes. I'm a Holydisc, shes a Hunter. She got her Leaf 2 days ago, just in time to get ganked a bitchzillion times while trying to kill those 4 demons. Lets hope she doesnt loose interest
---
Harder, maybe, but not difficult if you know what you're doing.
---
yep that makes sense, not even surprised
---
I don't think that's an unpopular opinion at all. It's completely true. It's just that high-pop servers have other pros that some people value higher. Also the fear of investing time into a character just to have the server die is real for many people. Wow just doesn't work when there are no other players around...
---
That is not true anymore. In the first week yes. Since then blizzard have decreased the server cap several times. Medium server now was medium or high in vanilla but nowhere near full.
---
It's been one day and I'm already done with the shitshow pvp. Want 10v10 WSG asap!
---
And this is why I reserve orbs when I run strat live. Because I can, and people who don't want to spend 2 hours looking for a tank let me with a smile on their face.
---
:( That’s why i said same lvl. I thought Druid was weak in pvp until I was attacked by an undead mage and found out they weren’t...
---
Lol you’re fucked bro good luck
---
Dude give it a rest, a million comments saying the same thing. If you watched Athene's videos in 2009 and thought he was serious then you're crazy. He is a character, a persona, for entertainment purposes. Just like Asmongold and Zack are different people.
---
Just like fucking actors in movies are different people from their characters. Can people who play ridiculous characters also do ridiculous things sometimes? Sure. That doesn't mean they *were* that ridiculous character all along.
---
Honestly, you have probably never watched those videos. Nobody with social intelligence would think someone playing a keyboard like a guitar next to their fake boyfriend was serious.
---
I don't know what I said that gave you the impression I give two shits about pvp.
---
Are they really losing dollars? Seems to me everybody has a subscription and based on all the streams today that people enjoyed watching the lag fest lol but if people actually unsubbed blizzard would maybe do something but til then. They r taking in the dough
---
First two days? It's only been 13 hours.
---
Xd
---
No keyring since there was no actual patch released, its coming later (SOON TM)
---
It's amazing what good players can do with mage, they have so many tools.
---
... for lags

---
I'm miserable. 
---
Going to quit this game soon I think.

Nice
---
Aggro the boss then reset on the ledge. Kill the pat in the room before opening graves. Cone of cold (with shatter) kite the zombies.
---
I find it incredibly suspicious that most of the bugs that DO get fixed are almost entirely beneficial for players.
---
The shit that hurts players seems to be on the backburner.
---
Me being Alliance from Sulfuras, a horde-dominated server where horde would gank low level allies and steamroll allies all over the area with no repercussions throughout all phase 1. I was afraid of phase 2 coming out because I thought we'd get farmed endlessly with no mercy, but once the honor system began... My god was I amazed, the alliance quickly formed raids, I joined one being merely a level 55 holy paladin, we steamrolled the horde so hard all over Eastern Kingdoms, I got about 1.5k HKs in a few hours, rarely died, and it just felt good being a minority in the server and wiping the majority constantly nonstop
---
It doesnt disappear for me. It shows every 2 seconds when I get a mana tick except when at full mana.
---
patch history says 1.13
---
2 ppl are enough to activate the pillar?
---
You think you do, but...
---
Damn bro, that was fucking sick.
---
Nost lacked a lot of background checks that exist on blizzards servers.
---
The two are unfortunately not comparable.
---
But is everybody actually battling and spamming aoe and spells or is it just a cat mouse game
---
It's quite sad that he honestly thinks he is so above it all. What's even worse is that he will now play it off as if he doesn't care that method dropped him. Instead of trying to better himself he just makes up different excuses and finds reasons to never become a better person. The reasons are even silly, he *once* had the most viewers on a game. For 5 days. He *is* the world first 60 on classic, but no one cares. 
---
Just wake up dude, you need to get real.
---
We have no idea where there codebase is at and how much better it could be. You claim to know a lot about cheats that work without validation. What are the undetectable cheats for private servers that exploit validation of client sent messages?
---
1st orb... on undead...
---
He sounds like old school Athene. I think he watched Athene too much.
---
Alliance? Need a pvp buddy?
---
Yea definitely start saving for quel serrar imo
---
what are you talking about?
---
Nost in Orgrimmar was always full.
---
doesn't matter what time of the day you played, there were always people in pretty much every zone
---
you could go to Stonetalon mountain even which is a dead zone even for horde and find people levelling there
---
Valve anti cheat
---
Except that the 1.12 we play on is NOT the 1.12 patch vanilla had. Its kinda sad how people just assume shit without actually knowing what they are talking about. Blizz was completely open about that matter, a quick google and you have all your answers.
---
The why doesn't matter, only that their performance was better
---
I think lots of people missed that memo.
---
I've been dreading this day since launch.
---
I just wanna fish for gods sake.
---
aha okey , i saved up all the feather drops i have about 1100 but they wont get me to exalted. What more quests are there?
---
Because way more people in org sitting around
---
You gotta just open on anyone you see.
---
Make stealth not show up in combat log?
---
its clearly less than 65 and a halve
---
Yea literally just said the same thing. This guy is 100% trying to mimic the Athene mentality.
---
Now i recognize your name lol. Are you just salty that you didnt make it?
---
Why? There's a [blue post](https://web.archive.org/web/20050525020704/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=blizzard-archive&amp;t=27&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post27) that clarifies their stance on it from vanilla, I don't think anything has changed in that regard.
---
My gf doesn’t game at all but she’ll ask if I’m playing with a group. If I say yes, she’ll go do whatever she needed me to do herself. So at least I got that going.
---
wouldnt it minus all the honor you had that week?
---
Its from 2017 so its not even on classic, prob not working

PvE servers are a regulated brothel.

PvP servers are Epstein Island.

I did it in Vanilla and I do it in Retail to this day.

That might very well be, but if they intend to follow the vanilla launch schedule then BWL is far away still. WoW launched 7 nov 2004, BWL was released 12 July 2005.
---
From WoW launch to PvP patch was 5 months, April. For us now we got it after 2.5 months. So seems we are going at it at 2x the speed. That would mean BWL comes in 1.5 months, so late january/early february at the earliest. If they go more in line with WoW's release cycle back in the day, it will come out late April/Early May.
---
Ding ding ding, we have a winner!
---
I should've seen it coming, but I cannot believe the number of people offering how to play advice, as though I can somehow magically escape a roaming death squad of try hards who are armed to the teeth when I've got shitty levelling greens, no NS, no engineering, no pots...
---
I've got years of druid under my belt, I just haven't had time to play to the level cap. God I hope it calms down soon or it looks like I won't even get to 60 before BWL comes out. People who were saying the PvP apocalypse was coming were completely right. Playing the game is straight up impossible if "the game" for you is anything other than grinding honor in wpvp
---
That dagger is one of the best weapons in the game for casters at that level, especially when paired with the offhand from SM:GY - I'd of personally gave the casters priority
---
It is indeed an addon for neckbeard tryhards, I just chose not to use it. Just feels cringey to use
---
I don't think you need the c- part, warrior is enough when I search.
---
On the in-game page it says DHK immeediately reduces your HP. If you don't have any HP, you can't lose it.
---
Spy is not game breaking,  so you know if a rogue is stealthed around you,  what does it matter?  Rogue players are dicks anyway that will sap you nonstop.  I would rather be alerted to the fact that there is a raid group in my area so i dont get too comfortable on my farming route.  And devaluing hunters?  Please,  being able to track everything and kite to a frustrating extent not enough for you? 
---
Turn off your addon or dont,  game doesnt change.  Stop throwing a fit about stupid shit and wasting everyone's time.
---
esfand just gives himself loot
---
You need 1 shadow priest per raid. Or can sustain 1 SP per raid, as they take up debuff slots...because thats how mindflay works, yay?
---
Locks need their debuff. You could respec a healer priest for this, but a designated shadow is fine.
---
Game is basen upon 1.12, no?
---
idk if that helps but when i played retail like 2 years ago, there has been the name of the looter on the tooltip of the mob.
---
Most if not all servers also have an World channel which is for selling / lfg etc.
---
/join world
---
My stupid thing was that I thought I need to buy hemorrhage just once.. I've respecced between hemo and combat multiple times and been using rank 1 hemo most of the time. You actually need to learn it again every time u learn hemo.
---
You could maybe test it for yourself before shitting on it. It works.
---
Played for 3 hours in phase 2 and only got 1 HK. It seems that leveling isn't that bad on my server.
---
And the first one was a female dwarf hunter called 'Merkl', just like the German chancellor Angela Merkel. Won't forget that name, that's for sure.
---
Long time ago
---
I don't understand your concern 1 SP already is a good addition to the roster in MC.
---
You get a dispel class, decent dps ( i'm at 400dps on average ) and you boost the warlocks damage.
---
1.13 was released completly earlier today ;/
---
I will be first to tell you: Play whatever is fun for you. That said, shadow should be greater DPS and survivability. Consider just shadowform armor bonus, not to mention better sustain front vampiric-whatever-the-name-is
---
The problem is not hardware, it is how the gameserver is programmed. Throwing more hardware at something wont fix bottlenecks, and I do not see Blizzard being able to fix this entirely. Maybe they can optimise a few things, but short of a complete rewrite on how events are processed, this wont do much.
---
I'm pretty sure there is an explanation saying: "I doesn't matter how much damage you deal to your target. You recive exactly the same honor if you are only healing the warrior killing the target as if you were killing it yourself".
---
I'm currently LVL 43 on dreadmist in stranglethorn. Doing a duo leveling group, I'm warrior and  my buddy is priest, at least we're safe from the same level gankers.

I play Mograine it seems pretty good

It's like when a forum mod goes mad with power.

You grind more feathers, or beads. I've also saved the totems.

I'm not letting you distract the point. You call for BGs ASAP and are complaining about non 1v1. This is not an MSORPG. BGS are not 1v1 either. You have no proof other than your big human brain for any information concerning the release of BGs.
---
1. happens anyway.  If you don't reserve, then you just aren't inviting classes that could use that item you want.  At least reservation is more upfront, and maybe those people want something else anyway.

Last night was a time where playing on one of the low-pop (aka "dead") servers, Judgement in my case, paid off. There were at least 4-5 Alliance raids and at least as many Horde raids in Azshara contesting Azuregos for a couple of hours, and at least on my part virtually no lag at all.
---
I had 32 FPS in Ironforge the other day. That's with all graphics settings on low and a GTX 1660 SUPER as my GPU.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but HKs don't count. The honor obtained through the HK counts.. so if you get 4k honor kills, but they only grant you 1 honor point each you only get 4k honor points, which you do, because with this amount of people you don't get much.. where when you solo you get +160 for just a single kill.. so it's nothing really :P
---
They are not working on the keyring, they are just going to implement it later in the lifecycle of the game.
---
I use it simply because i have to otherwise i have massive disadvantage. And tbh im sad i have to use it. That addon is gamebreaking. But not at large scale pvp, rather at smaller scale, showing middle finger to hunter tracking and rogues stealth.
---
You said it, man
---
I fully expect at least one BG will be live before the end of the year.
---
Are they going bankrupt? No. Are they losing enough subscribers their 15$ potato servers are losing out on not being upgraded? No doubt about it. Obviously no one on reddit has the actual numbers and we are all guesstimating, but that's my guesstimate for sure. Pvp is a major content component in vanilla precisely because its fun and not scripted like raids, if you take it away you take away a big driving force for subs. There is a reason why the pvp servers are running over with players

Im a druid tho so guess i dont get as many whispers as warriors, and half the time im resto specced.
---
Funny part was when he said "I reached 350k viewes in 1 day! Ican do whatever I want!" + "I din't feel bad whatsoever" and the proceeded to do a Joker laugh.
---
Well if you have someone who has done it before and/or just reads a few sentences online then yes.  If a raid would in 100% blind like the internet doesn't have information about everything and nobody had even zoned in before (but somehow had quintessences) they would find quite a few surprises to wipe on.  Sure they would figure it out in a pull or two but you would still wipe a couple of times to things that are easily negated by reading a couple of sentences online.
---
I give them 1 month for bg's to release. Just in time for holidays when most people get to play.
---
Was fun, shame a few people didn't understand "DON'T ATTACK THE NPCs" and I wound up with 8 dishonorable kills :&lt;
---
You now: =)
---
You once you see FAP price:  =(
---
as someone who doesn't know about layers a lot (but understands their purpose)...how does he know which layer he gets invited to? what if people invite him to a layer he is already in?
---
it's an absolute atrocity. I got to Hillsbrad foothills, and wasn't even able to land a single hit because everything happens like 10 seconds too late, people keep teleporting around... it's completely unplayable
---
Noggenfogger is really good not sure about balance but maybe 40-60
---
Such a low effort class, I feel guilty just because I played it 10 years ago.
---
Because it is not "criticism".
---
Classic was made to emulate a game from 15 years ago with all the ups and downs. This was communicated clearly by Blizzard and requested by the fans.
---
If you play classic you need to accept it as it as or you will have a bad time. It doesn't cater to any demands as it should.
---
If you miss dual spec your options are either retail or ask Blizzard for wotlk servers or altered classic servers at some point down the line.
---
The game will not change and people need to understand that or do something else.
---
You want wow to slow down once 300 players are in a zone?
---
What are standing kills ?
---
Sick! Congrats! 🎉🤙
---
Woo-hoo so hyped x.x
---
GRATS!
---
I am actually considering quitting. I have limited time and was proud to get close to pre raid bis gear.  Was farming a bit this morning at 6 and got ganked by three individual raid geared hordies. It's never a fair fight. It adds no value. It's pure garbage. And now it's even incentives. F this so hard. 
---
And while we are at it. Why can't I transfer to a PVE server? I am stuck here bc of my friends, since they wanted the PvP experience and rolled on a PvP server. And know we have this shit show.
---
I have to add, that I am fairly easily tilted. Which, in a competitive fair environment I can control. But this shotshow that is open world PvP makes me fucking furious.
---
Nope its bis for hunter, but not by much. Not worth the effort.
---
I did this in Vanilla. I do this on retail to this day (only now I fly into it). Guess what? You can also hit the portal by jumping into the window next to the NPC. Here's a screen shot: https://imgur.com/SIk2Dkx  
---
Since I'm not attuned, I can't enter so I get the error message.  
---
What makes you think this video is from 2017? Is it the level PvP player? The "HD" square resolution graphics? Oh, the upload date. Got it.
---
Hey, don't put that crazy on us. He's Belgian.
---
Could you even get a 40-man raid into MC that way? BRD is limited to 5.
---
I unsubbed :)
---
I remember those days, it was fun to watch. You will always be the coolest redditor in my mind.
---
Especially the part when the tauren does nothing but jumping!
---
It’s about the honor gained not HKs, lots of people with high HKs getting 1-10 honor per kill vs people with 500 kills worth 100-200 honor because of the nature of “Hillsbrad pvp” compared to small fights
---
On this Field after 34 minutes of grinding the first honor i've got already a dishonorable kill.. xD
---
Join a 40-man PvP group spam your AoE and tag em like it’s quest mob, but HK and HP are not the same thing
---
don't do this shit man, imagine if everyone that wanted a group whispered everyone... its fucking rude
---
Only way is talents into wand specialization and agi increasing ranged crit.
---
Yeah I can see that.
---
It's reasons like this that everybody has to censor themselves now. Imagine how free the internet used to be...
---
The rewards and rank system is equally trash.  You need gear to get gear, most of which is worse than the gear you currently have, unless of course you get above rank 12.
---
Imagine Ragnaros saying " Hola amigos, donde esta la biblioteca"..
---
They have also been getting ddos'd (not sure how long this lasted) so that didn't help.
---
I had a resto druid take so long to get to UBRS that we 5-manned everything up to Rend without a healer.
---
Cult leader btw
---
Soo. be a mage?
---
Lol I’m in the background “forgesteel” I got a soul shard off that mage lmao
---
It’s mostly MS for them. They just run as tank to get in groups faster.
---
I dont see the point of reserving scourge stones. You'll get exalted eventually anyways. Also, exalted rep doesnt even give you anything special except for shoulder enchant that is "okay".
---
The only ways you arent 60 yet is either
---
a) You didnt start playing on launch
---
b) You played less than 4 days a week
---
c) You took long breaks ingame where you didnt gain an XP.
---
Its a sad reality but if you did any of those things you would have been better off playing on a PVE realm or wait till BG's come out.
---
Can only speak for myself, but either they offer paid character transfers, or I quit. Not doing this. Already got tilted into oblivion just by farming thorium at 6 in the morning.
---
By far the most infuriating thing ALL hunters do is use multishot on pull and then wait until a mob reaches them to use FD.
---
Just use FD right away dammit.
---
If by explained you mean wild unfounded speculation on reddit by people trying to rationalize the horrible servers, then yeah, sure.
---
[Yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh6iBkfvkY0)
---
Maybe the master looter from the post had already told the raid that x items where reserved, so "ninjaning" x items wouldn't be against the loot rules. If a master looter says that everyone can roll on everything and then steals a pice of gear for himself it would be a different thing I guess.
---
I was
---
Should of rolled pve.  Can do anything with no hassle you want, while word pvp has been easily available today.
---
Depending on your server pop, you can join / make an all mage raid group and coordinate pushes that way. Alternatively, you can join / make a raid flank group which is pretty enjoyable. I recommend filling the flank raid entirely before attempting flanks as you will inevitably have people that don't listen. Purge them accordingly
---
How did you get into a party with 2 druids lol
---
I think its more about having a stable income
---
Fow is best in slot for tanks until nax?
---
Oh no, multi billion dollar Blizzard would need to fix their client and server architecture.
---
I love to see people without the class/role capital to reserve trying to reserve. Like rogues reserving orbs n shit. Cracks me up every time.
---
Ah shit yes my bad totally misread that one because of the "lesser" which starts like Lesser Invisibility Pot. Invulnerability are actually called Limited Invulnerability Potion thus my confusion
---
Bloodfang seems quite balanced. Last night saw a lot of action across so many zones, and with both world bosses going to Horde in the end. Lok'tar!
---
That's genuinely my priority and if they gave this reason I would accept it unreservedly. I have so many keys and so little bag space!
---
No that’s not true.
---
You can get them low and wait for the debuff.
---
Because it's utterly stupid and misguided reddit speculation.
---
No joke, this guy must have the record on Twitch for blowing up over night, to getting thousands of viewers, getting on Method and then fucking his career up just like that.
---
Shocker it is Horde doing a 2v1...
---
I thought so. Ideal thank you. I'd rather stay shadow.
---
Fire.
---
I'd two 60s (one with 2/8 T2) on a different faction/server, and I re-rolled. Currently 35. I don't regret it. Gotta be comfy with your choice. No rush.
---
I just wanna make sure I have a spot I'm in the core raid team now and just want to make sure going forward.
---
No it wasnt lol
---
Shazzrah is pretty much the same.. I'm lvl 57 and plan to do dungeons only.. no point to even try quest in the open. Much slower and more frustrating.
---
Pussy horde doesn’t fight unless they can outnumber alliance.
---
K
---
I've killed every class but struggled against hunters, the casting speed is way to slow and they are unkiteable because of their range
---
Yes, except I hate that.  One of the reasons I'll never play retail is because of that system.
---
Each server should be it's own discrete world for sure.  But Blizzard still could promote faction and server balance by adjusting the queues accordingly.
---
Why is it even "honourable" to kill a player 6-10 lvl below you.
---
Nice spot to create it too. Gj
---
Assuming you're using a 2 hander, you should only be missing 5% of the time against mobs that are your level (this does not include dodges &amp; parries). If it seems to be worse than this, it is likely because you got a new weapon and still need to level up your weapon skill. Lastly, I would strongly recommend not fighting mobs that are 3+ levels higher than you, as your attacks will frequently miss or be parried.
---
then they won't get into my groups for sure
---
And then the server crashed
---
Yeah but it sort of defeats the point if someone doesn't want to be killed anymore. /Pvp should only work in a city
---
I did the same with un'goro just wanted to do some quests in peace and level to 60 but insta died as I landed ganked by 10 alliance level 60.
---
Considering his explanation, he is obviously the type that thinks he's always right and everyone else is wrong.  I'm 100% sure he doesn't regret it and thinks he's better off without Method now.
---
Yes but there is no way that the pservers core were retro engineer exactly has they where, so it's 100% sure that both core doesn't function the same way.
---
this argument isn't that far fetched and I wouldn't be surprise to be true.
---
 the same apply to you, you have no way to compare anticheat from classic and pservers to analyse the impact on performance. 
---
everyone here is talking without much Intel. 
---
I understand that pservers à better QOS than classic which is shamefull.
---
 But the narrative that pservers have the same technical challenge as blizzard is just plain wrong.
---
In a big enough mob warlock just wants to tab 'curse of exhaustion' for a spammable instaslow. Someone out of position also dot them. Just dotting random players at the edge of a mob means they can step back and get healed. With slows applied it's easier for all your raidmates to catch someone out.
---
Holy/Ret.
---
Also every melee class just get´s kited without some gadgets. That´s why Engi and Trinets are that important.
---
Parry: All creatures will now report a Parry on attacks from the front instead of translating them into a "Miss." Creatures will no longer be able to Parry attacks from behind.
---
Patch notes from 1.3.  Block was also included.  Shield slam and bloodthirst didn't exist and fury was a joke tree because those reworks came in 1.6.  Many other classes were also in a subpar state.  So good luck getting Rag down pre-sons when your whole raid is parry-hasting Rag constantly with that additional 16% parrying from behind, fury warriors don't exist, and winter's chill is over a year away from existing.

The problem is also that Orgrimmar was pretty much deserted on my somewhat balanced server, but as soon as we got close to SW, hundreds of alliance spilled out.
---
The reason is that alliance simply has less interest in PvP, therefore even on a 50/50 server, there is a 60/40 imbalance when it coems to PvPers.
---
I wish I could join one of these battles but I haven't come across any yet
---
If you would really remember battles this large in vanilla, then you would remember the hardcore lags, too. Nothing has changed.
---
I did census a while back and it was like 35-65. I assume things are worse as the alliance can’t even transfer from there (just like shazzran)
---
Oh hey, it's Kirtonos!
---
Firemaw is around 55 / 45 hord alliance and is one of bigest eu servers
---
There is a huge 2H sword which is a razorblade on a stick
---
As someone new to a pvp server, do you get anything from killing others? I heard of a rank system or something, is there kind of a reward for climbing ranks?
---
Yep but not for everyone!
---
This thread and subreddit are 99% retailer scum who started in mop or wod, they dont know athene :)
---
Reread the thread. 
---
Also you’re not on my server  - and still do this
---
Civilians and quest givers will give you DHK.  
---
and a DHK will result in a huge honor loss
---
I'm pretty sure all civilians ingame is low level.
---
I was there last night, it was fucking awesome! 
---
Here was my perspective of your line:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/3YhHT7d](https://imgur.com/a/3YhHT7d)
---
azuregos sapwned yday on our server.
---
was around around 150-200 allys and even more horde would guess closer to 300.
---
It was as if i were a ghost... I could run throu a zerg of 80 hordes and none could see or hit me. But i couldnt hit them either... 
---
I saw arcane explosions dmg popping up like a 100 yeard behind me at times. Then i see dmg coming on me from unknown sources... Its completly broken...  Oh and hordes got the kill at last. some happy horde healer got the head.
---
Like the argument against it.
---
None of us have the technical Intel to reply to those questions. 
---
Yet the "blizzard have a different technical challenge" arguments are usually way more detailed and explain than the other side which are mostly MEME without any detailed. 
---
Or just uninformed people that think they just have to spend money on hatdware. which does show that they don't know shit on how company operate. 
---
Yes blizzard is a joke and it's shamefull that some unknown people made their game work better than them
---
&gt; I'll get over it once BGs are released I think.... main reason I wanted to play.
---
You will get obliterated by 10 men premades with endless consumables and better gear. At least in retail you can only join as 5 men party and 1 geared person cannot kill 3 fresh 60s in 3 shots.
---
What do you think the best way to test it is?
---
They will be burnt out before actual progress via bg's can be made.
---
Get engineering shield. It makes a **HUGE** difference.
---
Ranks and honour are not the same thing.  Honour kills and DK are worked out as they occur and applied weekly.  If you get a do it will take from any previously earned HK you already have.
---
&gt; I don't think they wanted to roll on pvp server to be corpse camped or be farmed as free HK for 60s.
---
No one goes there to be corpse camped, instead they think they will corpse camp others. :)
---
No lol
---
The NEETS will just kill you after you come home from work, so I don't see how this is good.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news man but I feel like this GM was just trying to close a ticket. 
---
I too have Quel and not too long ago I was in a jump run and I looted a tome and picked up Foror’s successfully so you already having the quest item isn’t an issue because I’ve been in the exact situation and picked up the book.
---
Perhaps the tomes themselves are glitched but yeah you already having Quel isn’t the reason. I hope you get the book you deserve man!
---
What about killing players who are grey to you does that count as DHK?
---
Isn't the whole point of cloud based servers that you can add computing power based on demand ? I would understand them not wanting to upgrade server hardware for what they believe is a temporary peak load. But on a cloud server couldn't they just assign additional units to that server?
---
Since when has vanilla itemisation ever made sense?
---
This.  HK and hon points not the same at all.
---
Horde was destroying southshore tho. Ashbringer is pretty balanced imo
---
It's not blindly defending. It's speaking from a perspective of having a slight idea of what a huge datacenter like Blizzard's is like.
---
People are just angry and have no clue whatsoever about giant hosting environments and just think that Blizzard can, and should, throw money at the problem.
---
It's like people having no idea of cars saying "Why can't Ferrari make a car that's as quick as &lt;cheap kit car X&gt; when theirs cost 10 times more??". Because &lt;cheap kit car X&gt; is sacrificing a lot of stuff for speed, and Ferrari aren't willing to do it like that.
---
Could Blizzard modify the client to be easily hackable to gain performance? Yes. Will they? No.
---
Could Blizzard use millions of dollars to upgrade their datacenter for a small performance boost? Yes. Will they? No.
---
You people seem to forget that Blizzard has more than one service running in their datacenters and that the load is spread out.
---
Why can't you leave?
---
My dog is very sick and I always take a break in Mc to take care of her. 
---
Is anyone holding you hostage?
---
In Vanilla there have never been battles on that scale. Your memory is failing you. When classic released, Blizzard stated that server capacities are way above what they had 15 years ago. Pretty understandable if you compare computer hardware today and 15 years ago...
---
Tonight our Surgers had the knock back I remember from Nost/Elysium/Northdale. Also Geddon patrolled incredibly slow. Weird
---
Typo, 17k, and ofc not, not every single wow player answered the survey, this is purely indicative of the average Reddit user that felt compelled to complete the survey
---
As much as I understand your perspective, you were absolutely in the wrong there. If it's got caster stats then you should give priority to casters for it, as they can't use all the other weapons without caster stats. That particular dagger is so good for casters that many don't end up replacing it until mid 50s. 
---
I'm not saying his particular reaction was justified but you should have definately apologised/offered to run the dungeon again with the lock. Had I been the lock and you had not apologised (I would have explained why you were wrong to need if you clearly didn't know) I would absolutely have taken it up with the guild leader.
---
Wanted to tell you to get Flurry Axe before i read this post.
---
Still going to tell you Flurry Axe. It´s pretty much the only choice, ignore people telling you Quel´Serrar, only thing a Prot cares about on his weapon is attacks per second.
---
I mean, I'm really rooting for the Alliance underdog right now and for the next few weeks. But come on, guys, Cairne? Guy's super chill...
---
Killed KT prebc, killed cthun prenerf, gladiator/multi rank 1 every season - Most players 2019
---
Arbiter Blade or Mastersmith hammer are decent and easily obtained. Hanzo sword is also a great tanking weapon, if you already have a good amount of spelldmg (150+).
---
Then aim for an mc raid to collect aurastone or mageblade. 
---
Wouldn't bother with quel'serrar, it has no spelldmg, but if you cannot get aurastone or mageblade, it's the best tanking weapon.
---
I still have that dagger on my lvl 60 warlock ... and nothing in sight which will replace it .. so yeah that prob hurt since the drop rate is also really bad
---
Fell free to be the change here man.  So far your offering as little evidence as op
---
Yeah, performance always shows the holes, but its just sad.  
---
Worst so far, is a priest who will rant at me for hours about how addons make me a drone, and he plays to use his brain, so he refuses addons. But he has wiped the guild on baron geddon 2 weeks in a row among other blunders of performance, but he claims to be some ranked in the world healer or something, and we just dont touch that because we dont wanna burst his bubble lol
---
not a single HK for that, what a waste
---
I mean what he's doing is completely unrelated to pirates so he's an idiot on 2 counts.
---
The names generally come up alphabetically, so if your name shows up towards the bottom it's less likely you'll get an invite.
---
Srsly dude, leveling an alt right now is super stupid, especially on Alliance PvP. You had it coming.
---
Tf!? What a massive cunt.. his world first isnt even impressive.. I’d be impressed if he became world first in a more ‘regular’ every player kind of way..
---
No lag on thunderfury. I am doing pvp just fine.
---
No only civilians in cities not even guards
---
Regardless of.ylur opinion, if someone is discussing 1h, don't just disregard them and tell them a 2h is better.
---
Do some research into dual wielding, it's very good at max level, when u have more hit chance kit etc.
---
You are the one comparing different stuff. Large scale PVP is fucked in a game that is about PVP too.
---
They should fix it. 
---
Security, communications etc. is a different discussion.
---
Why bother? They don't have anything to actually say on the subject which will make a difference.
---
Nope. Blizzard will never give out those numbers. All we have are guesses and incorect data collected by addons.
---
Alliance i assume, cause Alliance still dont have a printscreen button in 2019.

Hardware is or isn't the spec it says on the box. The difference between a household SSD and a datacenter SAN disk is that you pay for the datacenter disk to be able to handle heat and vibration for months and months without breaking. It's not going to give you better performance than a consumer disk that's specified to the same speed.
---
Kinda like how the BiS list for plate classes don't really have any plate in them. 
---
Vanilla logic.
---
Which server which faction?
---
I tank all current content (maintanking onyxia) and offtanking in MC in regular 17/34 fury spec. (alliance though)
---
Until Blizzard starts fixing this its not low effort. It needs exposure. PVP doesn't work on large scale in a game that promotes PVP.
---
Just need to be on Skeram.  Horde at least have a surplus of tanks(although scholo/UD strat sometimes are LF tank for a little bit).
---
It’s not in the game lmfaoooo
---
'GROUP PIC!'  
---
NO TIME BITCH CHARGE.
---
How is this so zoomed out?
---
You are totally right, they were never that big. What I remember is the feeling I had from those kind of battles, no matter if it's 50v50 or 300v300, and I wanted to relive that feeling again. The point of this post is, that if the server capacities are way above what they had before, why is it not capable of handling those fights? What's frustrating is that we know it can work, but it just doesnt at the moment.
---
Wrong person?
---
Isn't it also BIS now if you melee weave?
---
250v250 on incendius. it was somewhat playable. but it was still a shit show.
---
Yes, they should fix it. Still the blizzard servers need to execute way more steps for every action, which makes it more ressource-heavy. WAY MORE. That's why messy private servers can handle more players at once.
---
Thanks I was there for this :))
---
Every reply adds another 100g.
---
Can you equip two briarwood reed's?
---
Yeah. But if im doing a repgrind I'm not looking for a group. So stop fucking whispering me yeah?
---
If you are "The Shadow Priest", you'll always have a slot. 
---
You can play whatever you want now a days, and do fine though. I think we have like 12 rogues and only 5 healers for our 40 man MC raids, but we still manage. But as stated, 1 shadow priest for the shadow debuff is great if you have a decent amount of warlocks.
---
The link is elsewhere in this thread. Can't link cuz I'm on mobile but it's currently the next comment down.
---
at least the gladiator stuff you can just say "oh yeah lets go to retail I wanna see your character"
---
all these people trying to claim they even cleared AQ is just sad lol
---
Yea it’s this thing called dopamine...
---
Like I said I don’t know much about end game time requirements.
---
He obviously did it in a past life, you dont know
---
Because from level 48 you give the same amount of honor as a level 60. So why fight someone your level, that you might lose to when you can gank the shit out of a level 48 and they can't do anything but tickle you.
---
That's basically what I said ... however if literally ZERO people have knowledge about the zone it would require a few wipes to figure things out.  That doesn't exist obviously because if you do wipe the first thing you do is go google a strat/info.  I did a really early MC PUG with pretty much no info because it was so last minute.  We wiped on Luci because I forgot everything about the fight besides the curse.  After that I just googled the strat and read out the 2-3 abilities per boss and made sure it was covered.  Rest of the run went smooth.  However, without having read a strat ahead of time we wiped.
---
Compeltely true. In all honesty unless you are a ret or prot paladin, where the blue pvp set is really damn good, there is nothing to be gained from pvp beyond rank 3 and before rank 11. Rank 3 nets you the discount and the trinket, that's all you need to get. And from rank 11 on you get the mount and the epic set, which is finally good stuff.
---
Sry sold all my chars with glad/r1 titles, and also lost my arenajunkies account but trust im teh bezt
---
Thats why loot rules should be stated before starting.
---
Going forward,  warlock are getting more and more relevant.  Meaning, they'll always need a SP.
---
How do you get 2000 kills in one day? How much time have you played? xD
---
If 10+ people started sending you textmessages everyday asking if you want to mow their lawn you'd be pretty fucking annoyed wouldnt you?
---
3 hours for a dungeon, 4-6 for raid? Yikes dude, just join a decent guild lol. Tons of guilds out there do 1-2 hour MC clears. You don't need to worry about being able to make raid time every single week, most guilds have some casual players that are able to fill to cover absences and it's not like you need a full 40 people to do MC/ony. Plus the casual raiding culture will only grow once ZG is out.
---
Also raiding isn't the only meaningful progression in classic, you're free to set your own goals and move at your own pace.
---
Half of what he wrote is shit
---
Story checks out, I stand corrected.
---
8fps at times
---
Census addon is not incorrect. Yes if you rely on someone else’s collection then might be. I did several censuses a couple of weeks ago with two accounts and I can be very correct if you know how to do it.
---
I don't even like the guy but is it not obvious he's doing the whole 'athene/I'm the best/memer' thing?
---
That clip reeks of it. Dude is a massive memer, if you watched his peak stream you'd see that. I'd take anything he says with a grain of salt.
---
Planetside managed it with fucking hit scan and projectiles on a much bigger scale and was near flawless... Both original and sequel... And it was run by SONY ffs
---
About as many people are going to quit over this as quit over Hong Kong. The servers are fine, and they're not going to spend the absolutely astronomical amounts of money they'd need to make a signifigant difference in the rare cases of battles this scale.
---
Anyone with half a brain can tell you that you spend money for the 99% scenario. You don't spend 10 times as much for the 1% scenario. It's just bad business and noone is going to do it.
---
No.  
---
I couldn't even roll for additional, after I got mine.  
---
Roll window didn't appeared, just saw in chat that someone got it.
---
After you, friendo
---
I somehow rolled with my Ex Guild on a PvP Server, Now Iam lvl 54 and now I get Killed every 10 Meters. Cant trans to PVe, dont want to Start new. I think Iam done with Classic.
---
I rolled on a PvP server because population and have no real interest in PvP.
---
Maybe once I hit 60 and get bored of raids I'll take PvP more serious but I doubt I will.
---
Fixed the link. This is from our kill attempt on Kazzak on EU-Golemagg, a coalition of several guilds actively made the call on voice chat to mass suicide into the boss so he heals up and enrages. Since they're the same faction we can not prevent it.

according to the original classic rules this was bannable
---
Because hardware back then had their limits and it now still has - just somewhat higher. Also, I doubt blizzard touched their server code much. Not unlikely it runs on a single core per layer. And since servers are all single-layer now...
---
So much for Blizzard. But then again, tell me one game which can handle more than 300 players in the same area.
---
True, doesn't make it false shamefully
---
Its addon. 1 was called advanced interface options. 
---
2nd Leatrix plus. both of them have option to zoom out.
---
what addon pls
---
I mean you can clearly see I got quite a few. But yea we could have had many more if we were in a full group. Many of it had to do with the lag of the server though because nothing was showing up on the screen most of the day lol. #classic #nochanges
---
No, because if they demand sole rights to roll on gear I need, then I'm not in that dungeon and they can find another tank.
---
Because vanilla WoW isn't a PvP oriented game, it's not even a really competitive PvP game. PvP is more a flavor, added element to spice up PvE. BG got added later, and ranking is more of a grind than it is a competition.
---
So again mr smarty pants, how can they remove it?
---
triggerrrrrrrrrrrrrrred
---
ElvUI
---
Blablabla... No screen no proof except "dude trust me"
---
No it's not. SP is shit while leveling.
---
Tbh I'm not convinced that they are.  My tin foil theory is that classic is nost with official numbers... There's still way too much dodgy shit
---
Mob pathing, pet behaviour, money mail to alts taking an hour...
---
I just don't believe that it's genuine vanilla
---
How do I see my honor? I can only ser honorable kills and dishonorable kills, but not the total honor.
---
you have 15 seconds to tell me the name of your character with these titles or youre lying, lol
---
Go to retail, world pvp is the most amazing part of vanilla.
---
Geniune question, what level are you or how geared are you if youre 60? If youre a tank with some threat items, there is not much reason for dps not to go ham and clear faster
---
I don't know why this would be such a difficult thing to do? 
---
Just sub again, its not like we have to stop playing WoW because of this - I won't. But unsubing shows them we don't like it, right?
---
I think it's much more effective.
---
It's different yes. Blizzard technical challenge is significantly smaller comparatively. They have every advantage. Do you really think Blizzard is not using the same server infrastructure that retail is using? It's build entirely around the concept of dynamic instancing (sharding) and operates nothing like the servers used in expansions of old (or private servers for that matter).
---
You don't know that zero effort was put in. I mean, look at lunch. They clearly did a bunch of stuff up make it go smoothly including the entire layering process but they underestimated how many people would be playing classic. These are not trivial things to predict.
---
I'm lvl 60 undead neutral with orgrimmar and friendly with undercity
---
This is just straight up lies, don't ever post this shit again.
---
think well what you want but we have so much and this remains, if you think they will fix it you are on the wrong path
---
Your not the only guild trying to get a world boss kill, regardless of faction.. #entitled
---
THEY SHOULD JUST BUY MORE SERVERS IN THE DATACENTRE! THAT'LL DO IT!
---
DM west dagger, scholo dagger, dm tribute staff, sword from maraudon, there's tons of better weapons really.
---
Shame HK and HP don't correlate
---
Agi and str potions.  
---
It's better to heal with bandages.
---
I am on a medium pop server which does not lag whatshowever and I couldn't agree more. I am enjoying it, but it definitely is not compelling in any way. I would be fine with an early battleground release.
---
Private servers were 100000% guaranteed virtual machines. There is basically no one in the entire world that uses physical hosts for anything other than specialised scenarios (Exchange Online being an example I can think of). The overhead of using a hypervisor is tiny compared to the benefits and if you think Blizzard can't afford to hire someone familiar with virtualization and that they've overallocated guest machines on their hosts to the point where resources are queued you're out of your mind.
---
You can just re-sub in a day or two. We're all here because we love this game (well some of us at least)
---
Nah, you're over a decade late.
---
Found the cult member!
---
remember to git gud
---
No idea how you managed that honestly.
---
&gt; My estimate based off their statements was originally 5-10k cap. With P2 experience, I think my "about right while full" server is around 10k ish.
---
I did censuses in the beginning and for 2 months from now. It was around 16k in the beginning when they have increased the cap. Like 1 month ago it was around 8500. I think it is a bit less now, but I haven’t done census for a while.
---
If they don't, many people will probably get bored. As fun as world pvp can be, it's almost always imbalanced. Either it's 1v5 or 5v1.
---
That's true, but same faction griefing is a bannable offense by the ToS.
---
You know, when I pay 15$ a month in 2019 I kind of expect them to host the game on servers that perform better than ones using a total of 6GB DDR1. The fact that the performance today is even somewhat comparable to what we had in 2004 is utter madness.
---
There's global channels that you don't need to be "in".  
---
/join LookingForGroup  
---
Also people are using custom channels like "world" or "LFG".
---
Pretty sure the first guy hitting 60 happened 15 years ago...
---
You should just consider what feels more fulfilling to you.
---
I have limited time too. Took time off to get to 60 "quick". And ever since getting to 60 i can play absolutely casually. I do my weekly MC + Ony clear, maybe a dungeon from time to time or i farm for a quick hour to get some gold. 
---
And there is almost no downside to that, Guildies of mine who have double the playtime might have their epic mount or professions maxed out but other then that we are on the same level of Char Progression.
---
Whereas Retail has so many systems you can/need/have to do on a weekly or daily basis that i always feel like im loosing progression or get behind by not playing the game. And that just doesnt feel good to me.
---
But for someone who just wants to hop in and get some action as fast as possible then retail is the better option. But maybe then a mmorpg isnt the right game after all.
---
Lol. I'm not passing things I need to random people who arguably need it "more." Sorry I wiped your raid bud.
---
Even random vendors are bugged sometimes.. it's crazy
---
So we run past the MC entrance to enter BRD to enter MC instead of just entering MC when we pass it?
---
Nope I haven't. Makes sense why I never got to do it.
---
How does it work with the one month waiting? Is it that when I delete my char over level 20 the name is reserved for a month in case I restore it?
---
I guess that Blizzard just made an especially extra powerful server just for them then. ¯\\_(ツ)_//¯
---
I’ve gained Honor with Ankh.
---
Please, point out a game, any game that has had the large scale interaction of users in a similar way WoW needs to be able to do it, without lag or shortcuts of some sort.
---
That is, players moving around an environment, interacting with each other constantly in real time and having many different choices of what to do. Tell me a game that has solved this issue.
---
Well that depends. Do you have friends and guildies to run with? Im sure they wouldnt mind if you tag along even if you're a bit underleveled. 
---
If not I'd say farm ZF and Mara untill your eyes starts to bleed.
---
While we're at it can we get tokens? if we're making it easier to level we may as well farming gold easier
---
Prolly trash blade. The difference in proc rate is like 1 or 2% so it's decent enough
---
Never forget your feathers.
---
Below level 20 - apparently if it's above that then the 30 day limit kicks in.
---
&gt; There is basically no one in the entire world that uses physical hosts for anything other than specialised scenarios (Exchange Online being an example I can think of). 
---
Oil companies in the north sea for VR to "walk" on the bottom of the sea to find oil. Thats one more for you.  
---
&gt;The overhead of using a hypervisor is tiny compared to the benefits and if you think Blizzard can't afford to hire someone familiar with virtualization and that they've overallocated guest machines on their hosts to the point where resources are queued you're out of your mind. 
---
You mentioned one out of many things in my post so Im not gonna take your reply too serious. This is very unlikely which is why  I said "**IF** they are". I guess you chose to ignore that. 
---
Have you tried work heavy loads and compared them to VMs vs physical servers? If yes you know there is a huge difference in the user experience even with just milliseconds of delay. 
---
Im all for VMs btw and I would never go back to physical servers.
---
Fkong christ first comment i read and caught me off guard. Cant stop laughing help
---
I was spamming fade couple of times through the fight and that shield was a panic move i realised second or two too late i got targeted. But yeah, could be the move.
---
How is it whining when it's supposed to be against the rules? Blizzard needs to know this shit isnt acceptable
---
I've looted empty tomes before I even saw a Compendium. Tomes can just be empty.
---
I'd prefer if it was removed too, but I'm not going to not use it because of that.  It puts you at a huge disadvantage not to use.
---
Brother literaly every zone was poppin at prime time on herod, with no lagg. If you chose to go to the worst zone to fight thats on you. I had a blast with zero lagg. Raid v raids, 20v20s 15v15s.
---
Everyone going i went to pvp and fly to hills makes make actually laugh
---
JEEEJ Excellent this fucker should hurt
---
You mean like DBM, Healbot, Threatmanagers, Pallypower, Swingtimers, Autodismount and some more? Yeah
---
"You must be truly desperate to whisper me for help..."
---
Because you can't stack enough spellpower while leveling for it to actually matter. Leveling for casters is all about mana efficiency, so unless you stack enough SP so that it takes 1 less frostbolt to kill a mob all that SP is just wasted, it does nothing for you. You don't kill the mobs any faster, you're still killing them in X amount of casts using the same amount of mana you did without the SP. Stats are never wasted, int let's you cast more spells before you go oom, spirit is the MVP stat since it increases your regen. You can stack enough spirit without gimping yourself as a mage for example so that you can blink on CD while regening all that mana back during the CD of blink.
---
wow wat a moron, he is the most random player ever!
---
&gt; He lost all of that because of sensitive types such as yourself. 
---
No, he lost all that because Method (and likely their affiliates) don't want to be seen working together with someone exhibiting such terrible behaviour. 
---
&gt; Imagine being such a frail and weak human being that mere words can hurt you lol.
---
Imagine being so dense that you equate someone voicing their opinion on something to them being hurt lol. 
---
&gt; Whatever happened to "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me"?
---
Whatever happened to not spinning tangents in an effort to ridicule others? Why would you ever think that is a good idea? That you then in another comment here complain about you just wanting to have a "discussion", when you are clearly not showing any signs of actually wanting to discuss things is flat out hilarious. 
---
&gt; So what if he was being an asshole?
---
So nothing. People are just saying that he is an asshole and that he got what he deserved. You know, for being an asshole. Being an asshole is not something that a normal person would expect to fly by without issues. 
---
&gt; He's not wrong about what he said.
---
Even **IF** that is true, that's not the point, the attitude is. 
---
&gt; He was World first level 60 in WoW Classic. No one can take that away from him.
---
So what? What does that have to do with anything? He is acting like that gives him some special priority (as well as once having had a large amount of viewers). 
---
&gt; The only reason why you care about this is because he is so well known and that there is nothing else going on in your lives.
---
Based upon what usually goes on here, people would still have the same opinion of him whether he was famous or not. Are you new here or something?
---
There can be empty tomes, and they always despawn after looting
---
Those are pixels, he didnt steal shit, if this i what you call stealing then every guild master is stealing shit from every single one guild member the same way, cheers.
---
Ps. stay with bfa, you won't like how it goes in older games, "stealing" like this is part of the game.
---
Tbh I dont mind the warning that some rogue douche is going to attempt a gank.  Lets me pop bear and at least makes it kind of fair.  Rogues are pure cancer in 'natural' vanilla.

Well. I had a 1 and half month break and server died and my guild with it. I used the free transfer earlier to have more easier time leveling without bazillion players around tagging mobs. Now im thinking of re rolling to normal server but im so tired of infinite leveling. I have my 50 lock and 43 shaman. Shaman is kinda retired because apparently im never viable to raid as dps.
---
You could smash out the last few levels doing dungeons, there's bound to be others in your situation that also want to level,  or have a break for a bit and come back when the initial rush of pvp has died down.
---
Nope. They just wont give any Honor
---
Mind flay is in the lowest debuff priority fyi, and doesn’t need to be on the boss to deal it’s damage. The debuff slots we take up are SwP and Shadow weaving, and if you make sure to have good attendance, consumes etc you’ll most likely always have a raidspot.
---
Man, the warrior makes no fucking sense...
---
Cloth shoulders? Frostwolf tabbard as Alliance?
---
&gt; Private servers were 100000% guaranteed virtual machines.  
---
Probably yes. /u/StadenDev can probably confirm/deny.
---
I'm not trying to start a movement here. Of course I understand that it isn't realistic and wouldn't work in practice. It would probably need thousands of players to unsub before they take notice.
---
But as an individual, it wouldn't be much of a sacrifice.
---
This was Searing Gorge on Golemagg last night.  I'm only level 49 but I abandoned questing and joined a raid group last night, we went from SG to EPL to Southshore.  It was immense.  Hit Southshore, pull back to the tower to avoid DHKs, rinse and repeat.  It was therapy for the repeated gankings from level 60 alliance braves the past few weeks.  Haven't had fun like that for a long time.
---
Dont have to see you wearing them for me to kill a hunter, its the best thing there is..
---
&gt; Do you have any specific examples of this perceived "toxicity" you speak of? Perhaps a definition that we can use to filter through chat and locate this massive problem?
---
https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/toxic
---
Anything else you have to say?
---
Yeah but did you reset your UI
---
And this is why world pvp in WoW was a dumb idea to begin with.
---
It worked in 2005 because the game was new, people were new and there were alot less players overall. And more servers too. Heck, even then it was abysmal if you just wanted to play the game.
---
Anyone with half a brain could  have predicted what the endgame zones would look like on imbalanced, but busy servers.
---
But, I think  blizz banks on people quitting. You get a free max level toon on retail if you have a 60 in classic (or at least thats what the promotional mail said) so they hope to reel everyone back into retail.
---
That is indeed well timed at this point! :D
---
Do you know how surveys work?
---
Never had this issue in classic.
---
ItemRack, you alt click a slot and it adds it to the bar.
---
2019/11/13 21:15 Kargath belongs to Alliance
---
It is, but they lost it, and it's hard to replicate again.
---
oh no. you mean the debuff shows up, but the armor reduction doesn't actually occur? that'd really ruin me. how can you know that?
---
Ask alliance on literally every server and they'll say its 75/25. If surveys mean nothing, that shit means even less.
---
Wholesome clasisc community
---
fade only remove you threat for the duration. it comes back after
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
Blizzard does now what they are doing: optimise money made per effort put in. They just don't care about the players. If it doesn't lead to a large exodus of the playerbase nothing will happen.
---
Yup lol
---
That was actually my point, both server architecture from pservers and classic are vastly different which mean the challenge are different as well. 
---
&gt;. Blizzard technical challenge is significantly smaller comparatively. They have every advantage
---
Don't you understand that blizzard have legal and security standard to follow which doesn't apply to pservers. 
---
Plus the fact that the classic client is integrated into the legion client which also make comparing them irelevant on the technical end. 
---
YES they should have take this into account and work on network performance from the get go. 
---
But depending on the issue (which we can't know for sure) the fix can be month/day/hours/years of work. So stop claiming you have a clue on how to fix this.
---
I thought the whole reason we had to put up with this new shitty spell batching shit was so pvp like this would be do-able... not to mention how filthy rich blizzard is and the fact that we have futuristic 2019 technology. what am I missing?
---
Obviously. I just stated people will remember who was first to 60. Nothing else.
---
I always thought wow PVP was kind of soft anyway.
---
My favorite was Asherons Call:
---
No factions, no guards, no stealth, everyone against everyone and towns were death traps
---
Because of the relentless ganking level 10s were basically gods
---
I’ll take it! Hello China? I have something you may want... but it’s going to cost you. Yes that’s right, all the tea...
---
Well yeah because I don't mow people's lawns.
---
But if 10+ people whisper me on my *warrior* asking if I want to tank? No, I don't get annoyed.
---
You are just full of shit. Blizzard servers allow freedom for client as well. If they would process everything on server you would see push backs like in any fps game. You can argue who allows more or less but I would say its pretty much the same.
---
Very true. That guy got overwhelmed by his tiny success... What a fool
---
Undead because troll feet looking fucking stupid and they make a noise like a frog when they get hit.
---
What how did layering work ??
---
You can pick a broom (staff) from the farmers in Tirisfal glade, and a shovel (2 hand mace)  from the Kobald in Elwynn forest. They aren't great weapons (both are low level whites) but they add a bit of flavor to the game.
---
I feel like every justification for griefing lowbies is exactly what rapists say to justify rape.  Like 100% the same.
---
Yeah you are right if you look into that. I only checked the actual online players, because for me that is more useful. I don’t care if a server has 10 million alliances if any given prime time there are only 2000 of them are online against 5000 horde.
---
&gt;All pvp servers are horde populated
---
this is simply false
---
well, if you include rp-pvp, which is just as much of a pvp server as any other. actually, pretty sure theres more alli at 60 than horde.
---
and sorry to be rude but holy shit man, its the first day, of course its gonna be nuts. maybe just stay off for the weekend and try again next week. i mean....you rolled on a pvp server and honor just came out, what did you expect? flowers and kisses from orc rogues?
---
Sure, but it would be nice if blizzard communicated to us about looking into the issue. Or at least acknowledging there is a problem.
---
Hmm. Y’all been doing some big 40+ v 40+ all day.
---
The whole group gets honor based on damage done split by number of players.
---
As a healer you get the same honor as the warrior. However don't expect healers that aren't grouped with you to heal you since they get nothing if you kill something.
---
U can dl addons to see how much the disenchanted matts are, for the most part I just vendor
---
1. Yikes
---
2. You went horde, the no skill faceroll faction
---
Actually isnt.
---
&gt; Performance and money doesn't scale linearly. If you want to increase performance by 10% on a shit machine you can spend a little.
---
A datacenter is not "a machine". It is, in fact, a collection of many machines. Someone upgrading 128-&gt;256GB of RAM will reap exactly the same benefits regardless if they do this to one server or ten thousand of them. However, in the latter example economics of scale kicks in. Blizzard has the benefit of being able to operate at a far cheaper cost per server than any single private actor could.
---
I hope that clears it up.
---
&gt; There were only two EU-english-PVP realms at name reservation.
---
yeah that's not launch
---
&gt; They just try to save money where they can and one way is to save on server capacity. 
---
I would understand that for a game that is expensive AND have a small player base. But Classic? Being cheap as  hell AND being the biggest MMORPG out there?
---
So, basically, Blizzard are just another cheap ass corporation. Not that I am saying anything new.
---
He means you didn't wait 30 seconds for debuff to wear off.
---
Honestly think you might have to wait for AQ40.  BWL was before a lot of classes got their revamps so it is still indirectly nerfed pretty hard.  Sure guilds will still wipe when learning but I doubt anyone will get "stuck" on something.
---
Yes but also on servers where alliance has the advantage, or even in that moment (where you are) have the advantage in players: they just seem to have a (it’s not me so who cares” attitude
---
Feels a bit like that yeah. 
---
Sometimes allies win or have numerical advantage but it’s usually horde.
---
Skinning and mining / Herb while leveling. Engineering at end game for pvp, Alchemy for Pve, Stick with gathering for gold.
---
Retail was dying, but it still had more subs than the amount which was gained after classic launch... 🤔 Shadowlands is also likely to bring back even more players to retail so without any MTX in classic, it will always be a side project as it's less popular and brings in way less money. It contributes to less than 1/7th of the total revenue from the WoW IP and that's going to drop drastically as a lot of people who just came for the nostalgia are going to quit. Next quarter classic will probably be barely 10% of total revenue from the WoW IP.
---
gitgud research wowhead
---
In preparation for* phase 2. +Int
---
Yup.  Just get good at incurring huge losses, then afk for 30 minutes while horde corpsecamp you.

I dont get why anyone corpsecamps.. nobody is going to release when you're there.

I'm on Incendius which is 40-60 for horde, and it's bad at times when enough horde roll around but otherwise there is plenty of alliance steamrolling over horde.  They did open up horde only transfers so let's see if the server improves.
---
Og has been lagging since we had two layers on golemag.When oni head was used the whole og was lagging for like 5-10 mins.
---
Imagine the ppl after  layer removal waiting oni buff on raid days.Yesterday with relase you had 30-60secs laggs in og until late dawn
---
Doesnt change the fact that its a dick move to take gear your healer needs.
---
Yes, and then it would be pvp which *actually* is a part of the game. Griefing your own faction is 100% a bannable offence.
---
It was punishable in vanilla as per I linked. Why should classic have different rules? Did you play vanilla? It happened there and people got punished for it so gms advised against it. This is the same thing except guilds are allowed to get away with it
---
Not at all what I'm talking about. Also weird comparision. 
---
It's just war out there right now. We had a couple of large scale battles last night and of course every lowbie trying to do quests just got killed as collateral damage. What do you expect people to do, stop AEing to not ruin someones questing experience?
---
Outside of large scale WPvP Everything that yields honor is free game. If you don't like that idea you picked the wrong server type.
---
Hah. I've had the same thing happen, but with a Warlock trying to fear spam me, a Fury Warrior.

I'll just be sticking to dungeons with guild mates and people from my friend list. DPS made their bed, now they can get fucked in it.
---
I think you fundamentally misunderstand surveys and sample size.
---
Actually is.  I've tried entering BRD as the 6th player of a raid: "Instance is full".
---
I still have ptsd from trying to recruit new people halfway through AQ progression on a dying server. No thanks.
---
when the kills are shared with another 40+ people this will not equate to as much as most people think.   
---
50-100 solo/duo kills are often worth alot more than this, and you won't get any DKs either (shouldn't matter this week, but for future weeks)
---
**190%.. Pretty sure it's only a 10% decrease in classic
---
If the lag is so bad you cant jump through the window or talk with the NPC, it could be worth it.  
---
The MC run is even soloable, so it's not a big hassle for 5 raid geared ppl.
---
What an ass
---
So I can't play the game because I chose the "wrong" faction? Sounds good indeed!
---
If they aren't willing to let someone who heals roll for heal gear, then they can either tank it, or find another tank.
---
Nah, it was about 300 Alliance vs. 100 Horde.
---
Not surprising on a server with a 74:26 Faction imbalance.
---
but then tell me which weapon at lvl 34 has has more stats besides the sp .. with an offhand I had around 16 int and 10 spirit - nearly no two hand to 50ish lvl blues has that amount of stats and the sp ..

I mean, BWL mechanics have lot to do with threat resets, so I honestly think half the guilds will at least hemorrhage DPS trying to get through there. the bottom quarter of raiding guilds are gonna get hung up with the coordination parts.  
---
Id say by the end of classic most people who want to get there will get Nefarian, but its gonna take some a while
---
Read last line with goblin fucking voice.
---
Different strokes for different folks my dude. Play what you want.
---
They could make the combat log only read spells and actions of enemy players that has affected you. That would lessen the effect of the addon a lot.
---
It is obviously acceptable. 
---
People will keep playing and the massive wPvP battles are a minor part of WoW.
---
If it was not acceptable people would cancel their subs, but they wont.
---
Funny is, in our guild we need force the casters roll on Staff of Dominance.
---
They all want Mageblade.
---
I saw Jokerd at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
---
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
Dismiss pet, feign death. 
---
Unfortunately spy mod lets people know where i am.
---
sounds extremely made up. come on people don't just believe random comments
---
Everyone wanted that classic experience till it happened.
---
That's exactly the point. It's 15 years later. Technology has gotten vastly better. If anything, we should be able to expect a smooth experience now more than ever.
---
For pvp booming voice is better. You need it to counter rogues and you get more rage overall by not needing to cast battle shout so much.
---
You shouldn’t use arms for serious pve. You don’t need unbridled wrath for dungeons.
---
If you must maximise raid DPS somehow as arms (???) then yes UW adds DPS. But it’s way wayyy less efficient compared to fury.
---
That was truly awesome
---
&gt; That was actually my point, both server architecture from pservers and classic are vastly different which mean the challenge are different as well.
---
Yes that is what we are all complaining about. Blizzard using entirely unsuitable and inadequate servers.
---
And yes, we can sit and speculate that it's possible the servers are in fact nothing like what retail uses and that the problem is somehow due to some dramatic error in the client that uses up the vast majority of the servers resources. Can't be disproven, but it's hardly likely.
---
Red is dead.
---
When am I supposed to skill Engi? I am Level 52 got 150g and a mount, skinning + mining on 300, first aid and lock picking are up next on the list (both around 200) but I am not sure if I should focus on pre bis (Devilsaur), epic mount or Engineering from here?
---
this is alot of fake news DKs lower your RP not your CP
---
BG's will be cross server
---
Honestly it couldn't get any better... After the initial wtf moment thinking if it's troll or not i was certain i witnessed the birth of a glorious copy pasta to enjoy for times to come!
---
No. This is not what that means. If the server is full the lower pop faction gets placed at the front of the queue until the balance is somewhat close. There won't be a queue if the server isn't full.
---
PvE player KEKdobalU
---
2: yikes.
---
Level 57 here, 4 hours of plaguelands farming got me 5 bars.
---
It does add an extra dimension to the game though when you feel a massive sense of achievement from killing 1 mob
---
Nope, still shitloads of mages everywhere.  Most of them terrible due to only leveling with aoe and never using anything else.
---
Looks like ElvUI.
---
using Elv since day 1, never saw that option (to add race/class icon).. mind sharing SS where do you enable it? (elv config)
---
If you want a faster car, do you buy a 200 dollar car and then slap a V12 800ps motor on it? And then expect it to run 350km/h?
---
No? Cool. That's not how server infrastructure and software development work. You can't just throw hardware at problems.
---
Without the +15 Agi Enchants they aren't preraid Bis, that honor goes to Barbarous Blade. (and +15agi isn't in the game yet)
---
Dafür kommen wir dann schneller in bgs
---
Booooring
---
as a lock i wait 4 mins theyre focused on someone i else i quick res and pop a invisi pot and hide somewhere to either mount up or if theres no escape and no fp i hearth
---
go hillsbrad; join raid and Rain of Fire
---
yea fuck blizzard
---
you cant ban us all
---
True, they could rewrite all their code to make it a bit better and opt for mass scale PvP. Point is that's insanely expensive and takes years to develop and that will never happen. Not defending blizzard, but you know they won't spend millions of dollars on that.
---
Warlock: Raid to your heart's content.
---
SPriest:  You can only raid if there is no other SPriest in your raid.
---
No layers, and no raid grinding in dungeons.
---
Nope.
---
I don't think we will get "phase 3" for a few months. I suspect we will get WSG within 4-6 weeks
---
Since you basicly do one hit when weaving, you would want to have that single hit be the highest possible: 2h for Melee weaving
---
Intellect.
---
Damn, good luck on getting these items - please update with what happens!
---
It shows what rank enemy player you killed or assisted in killing. scout is first rank so 90% of what you will se is HK: Scout
---
I can't remember.  Are BWL bosses tauntable or only only certain ones?  For some reason I remember taunts for drakes but I feel like I remember the threat swaps on vael being a bit harder to manage.
---
Good rogues dont have a problem with spy.
---
'Method investigation'

Translation: some random nobody(s) watched the stream footage.

I too am a detective 🕵
---
people ARE unsubbing, that's fact. People on my friendlist not having been seen for weeks, there are tons of

I still don't get why this is a problem. If you don't like their rules, don't join their group. If you think they "spam" lfg, ignore them. Problem solved.
---
they can't , stop QQ
---
Good people dont have problem with cancer normalization and destruction of core mechanics.
---
I totally feel you, always played rogue until I‘ve tried warlock. I felt like a god compared to my rogue experience, in pvp and pve.
---
Exactly this.
---
It’s a customer service portal I doubt half of them even play the game I wouldn’t be surprised if they have a database system where they type in your query and have a somewhat automated response to try and smooth over tickets. 
---
I hope you get some kind of resolution though OP.
---
Wow, you are so good. Do you stream ?
---
Needs more harlem shake
---
It is pretty simple. Everytime you use your sinister strike you generate a combo point. You can see how many combo points you have in the enemy’s portrait right top corner. You have some spells what you can use when you have combo points only.  For example eviscerate or Slice and Dice. The more combo points u have when u use these abilities the more benefit will u get from them (eviscerate bigger damage, slice and dice longer period attacks). Hope I made it clear for you. :)
---
Rogues are still invisible. The main difference between using Spy and not using Spy, is that if you are using spy, the Rogue gets the opener when you are full health and prepared for a fight. If you are not using spy, the rogue kills you while you are fighting a mob, and you have 0% chance to fight back.
---
I usualy dont get so many alerts coz I dont spam, but it was laggy as hell and for some time i didnt even know if i was dead or not. So all i could do was spam
---
Who was it? Always remember your first :D
---
my region didn't even get an rp server until the very last server wave
---
I also watched him when he was at the peak of viewership. He was good with memes and I kept watching because i couldn't tell if he was being an ass just for the show sometimes ir was that for real. Well now we know.
---
This post is complete bs.
---
One of our hunters is using brutality blade and cht now (because none of the melees in the raid needed them anymore when they dropped ofc)
---
4k/40 = 100 kills.
---
Nonsense we love it. 
---
You know how many times I would’ve totally missed somebody to gank, and passed right on by without even seeing them?
---
I see the alert, check the combat log to see what you’re fighting, and find you.
---
My killing in game has been tripled.
---
10/10 PVP Sensation
---
More importantly, what font is that. It's beautiful
---
But you also seem to fundamentally misunderstand sample bias.
---
oh no, dont cwy little baby
---
possible yes but blizz doesn't care
---
Dunno if it’s bannable, but it sure looks like it’s whinnable. Holy F. those cry babies nowadays.
---
What is a combat check?
---
And break every dps meter addon while doing so
---
Rogues have always been the easy joke class for noobs.  Did you ever watch "World of Roguecraft"?  You're literally the noob rogue in that video whining.
---
A druid starting in near or a priest getting to put up PW:S should not significantly affect your chances to kill them.  If it comes down to that, especially in this phase where rogues are ludicrously OP (Perd's being busted and no trinket), then you're bad.
---
Yes. Rogues do that. Its because they can and its okay. You are stripping rogues of their core mechanics. Imagine if i took a druid and told him if he is feral he simply cant heal because its unfair that a mellee dps can heal
---
Level 35 mage here questing in STV on Shazzrah. Haven't gotten time to log on from p2 came out. How fucked am I?
---
yep, pretty spot on.
---
If this is real im rofling irl, what a champ
---
That's just a bit of a generalisation mate, there are plenty of great streamers out there, just stray off the top 1%.
---
And if your "sample" is from LiveStreamFails...well that says it all does it not.
---
It is certainly annoying, yes. We had our fair share of this last night, in the end two Horde guilds ended up playing defense to prevent Allies from running in and suiciding so that the 3rd Horde guild present could finish their fight. Doing this same-faction is a scummy move, and says more about your server community and said guilds than anything else. 
---
However, it **does not say that it is bannable**, more specifically, it says:
---
"...some players have been abusing Kazzak’s special abilities with the specific intent to harass other players. At this time, our In-Game Support Staff (Game Masters) **will be taking action**..." 
---
"When a group of players has engaged Lord Kazzak, any *same-faction* players interfering in the encounter **may be given a warning** as in the examples below:
---
 A group of Alliance characters has legitimately engaged Lord Kazzak and a level 1 Alliance character engages Lord Kazzak as well (Level 1 Alliance player receives warning)**.** "
---
Those excerpts are direct quotes of your source, bold is for emphasis. Given that GM staff was a lot larger back in the day the responses you get now might be much less pleasing, and I don't think there's any great chance that they will get banned either way - but hey, go on and report them and see what happens. The more reports, the better, and documentation and references to how cases have been handled should support your case.
---
But do those reports in-game, try to sort it out with guild masters and on your own realm. Posting here is little else than an attention grab.
---
The difference between having 0 sp and having over 250 pre 60 is huge
---
I play naked rogue, i have no problem with any 1v1 pvp. (I love to cheese people to utter frustration) But i fight for my less fortunate brothers
---
no wonder hemo feels like you're hitting someone with a squeaky toy
---
What a fuckin sook.
---
Use soulstone 
---
Rogue decides to use ambush critting for 1.8k (soulstone restores 1.7k). Dead again. 
---
So far I've seen a couple of things. Druids and warriors are mostly useless when it comes to world pvp, wars being only good when you're winning anyway otherwise they're mostly just sitting in mage CC. Paladins are disgustingly strong, much better healer than priests for pvp. Rogues are very overpowered 1v1 due to their extreme burst potential. Locks are good at 1v1, but only at 1v1 anything else and a mage outperforms them.
---
Well yes it does, but for daggers the speed norm is 1.7 which is terrible for daggers
---
I have to admit spy is reallyyyyyyy borderline.
---
So many times somebody just flies over my head, for one second and I don’t even see them and I get the alert.
---
I would say that function needs to be removed, but the ad on immediately knows that there are other people there, even though there was nothing in the combat log.
---
That being said I think it is great for increasing the amount of interactions in world pvp
---
Riiight
---
Finally respecced out of this build today after using it a few weeks. It's fine for people in greens and blues, but once your raid starts having melee dps in purple weapons it becomes super frustrating. You're going to be taunting on cooldown and wishing you could generate more threat on every mob
---
That extra threat from Natural Weapons and Leader of the Pack are too important if you are more interested in tanking than healing
---
followed by some good old fashioned naming and shaming in the in-game chat so their reputation will precede them.
---
When you get bored of affliction try destro.  It’s really fun playing a glass cannon too
---
They should use physical server but cloud infrastructure have many advantages when working with shard, instance and to dynamicly allocate more ressource. 
---
Cloud infrastructure cost less and have many advantages for this kind sharded world. 
---
I don't think it's a dramatic error from the client, retail large scale are laggy as fuck as well. 
---
From my POV it's an accumulation of those things :
---
Legion client, unfitted server infrastructure, 15 years old sources which all are the result of blizzard incompetence. 
---
All of it is just speculating and without seing the sources themself we cannot know for sure.
---
There was talk among us on discord that many things weren't working properly. For example the HK's, and honor shouldn't register or populate on the "Honor Tab" if the buffs were actually active. When we were landing the honor less target wasn't on buff or debuff bar. Did this have something to do with server lag? I have no idea. Do we actually get honor tomorrow when it registers and populates in honor tab? Time will tell. 
---
But 200IQ from @chidyco - translating rogue talk to mage
---
That’s encouraging! Yea I’m mainly looking forward to PVP but I know I’ll need to gear up in some raids
---
He's the first famous streamer to not invest into a better cam/mic to give his viewers a better experience. 
---
That itself, is an achievement!
---
If i remember right you can taunt most, (the middle bosses require a good tank rotation and taunting back and forth)  
---
I think the problem on vael was just keeping up with the super buffed dps
---
GG, may I suggest you try out Checkers or maybe Solitaire?
---
So after this you still have your gnomish recipes you learned before deleting the skill?
---
:O Click to dismount...
---
I got my lock to mid 40s before P2. Very fun and 1v1 they're very powerful pvp wise. Def shocked a few horde that got smart with me thinking i was an easy mark cause i was mid fight or low hp/mana. 
---
Fear is beyond Op. Wait till you get deathcoil
---
Just hit 40, got mount and all the loot I want from SM - where's good to head to now? (Horde priest)
---
if gms do nothing about stealing devilsaur leather they shouldn't do anything about this
---
I was fishing in TB, GF shows up, asks where i am, i say on the north side fishing beside guy. Theres no one here she says, i invite her, everyone for her disappears, then we appear along with everyone in my layer. So like guy said either people would disappear and new ones would appear or nothing would happen cuz whoever invited you is on same layer.
---
&gt;The GM did   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;not  
---
&gt; confirm that OP's tome had a Compendium in it
---
I think he did though.
---
&gt;So since you could not recieve another, it came up as empty.
---
That sentence right there implies that there was compendium in it.  
---
Even if he didnt thats still not excuse for the copypasta about reseting ui lol :D Thats just so unprofessional.
---
You should try it. Its really fun. But my point stands. Spy changes PvP and it greatly damages certain classes (i like how you dont mention it turns hunter tracking useless)
---
He stated in his streams that this was the staff of his dreams, and really just because of the 37 int, not any other stats.
---
He also bought the jewelled amulet of cainwyn for \~200g or so, claiming that it was alltime bis for him, when everyone in his chat was spamming him to not do it. But he just goes on explaining how int is the only stat that matters to him because all he cares about is blizzard-aoe-grinding. Just shows how good of a player he really is...
---
Then your metaphor skills suck since it sounds like Blizzard should build a better chassis if they're unable to effectively utilise a V12 800ps motor. A better metaphor would be something like saying that your engine doesn't help you traverse busy city streets any faster, since you're not limited by your engine, but the amount of people around you.
---
No you need 3 which is why we couldn't do it.
---
8-10s? Yikes dude, either you're undergeared or bad. Not only that but pulls really only take 10-20s. Why would I increase the kill times of each pack by 10s when you can kill everything in the same time?
---
Well said! Yea I’m hearing that in retail you can fall behind if you miss a week? I don’t understand why though.. never played endgame since 80
---
What a sad person.
---
Think I Park my self for max Tested EP and than Grind If I find a Quiet spot
---
Tell me why spirit is completely useless for a shaman?
---
Indeed, people are just griefing fucks no matter the faction. Horde just seems worse cause they are the majority on most pvp servers and numbers matter. On alliance dominated servers I bet it's exactly the same for horde, which is a shit gaming experience.
---
50s
---
"Done with the game"
---
Obviously it will not stay this way...
---
Just make an alt or play something else for a while.
---
Näätä Kerho should be a compound word
---
I made the mistake to delete all my alts in a rage of not making up my mind on what I wanted to play. Started fresh on a new server (pvp) 2 days ago. Now in phase 2 at lvl 15 its not funny
---
&gt;They find another tank 
---
That's the point. It's a non trivial manner to find a tank and letting them roll on OS gear is a pretty trivial request compared to what some people pay to get a tank
---
Feeling like I've done the exact same. Level 53 warrior and haven't been able to keep playing for more than 5 mins at a time over the past 2 weeks without quitting.
---
I have to ask, what's the navy seal one?
---
You are mistaken
---
Are you talking about improved mind blast as the "wasted points"?
---
For leveling i did not take improved mb talent for this exact reason. You don't don't mb a mob twice unless its tough.
---
There are exceptions:
---
- Fury tank in epic plate but dualwielding in defensive stance.
---
- Epic geared tank with lots of %-block and engineering shield/aoe trinkets etc.
---
(I am both of the above).
---
Demo shout pulls them out of stealth
---
You’re gonna need to grab all big fella. I’d absolutely get the mount first. Use those last 8 levels to farm golden pearls in some secluded area in azshara or tanaris (use your imagination) and cash in, because un’goro, felwood and plague lands are a massacre during phase 2. 
---
Hopefully you saved enough ore to level engineering a good chunk otherwise I’d say get the epic mount then get to work.
---
I've been ready for P3 for weeks. P2 adds literally nothing to the game for me. Especially now there is no keyring.
---
So glad I rolled on a PVE server. All the kids that never played vanilla are "hardcore pvp'ers" so decided to all flood onto megaservers.
---
Enjoying your #nochanges now?
---
Enjoying your pvp server now?
---
*laughs in PVE server smugness*
---
why does this sub have so many cry baby bitches? Don't worry playing classic will toughen you up in case you decide to go outside someday.
---
Don’t have any numbers but ashbringer feels really balanced, maybe a slight favour to the alliance side
---
Dead zone mate they literally can only use bandage/fd/traps 5-8 yards
---
You got any sources on that?
---
You know, there's a finite amount of memory.   You can't just use it for everything.
---
People get urged to switch from overcrowded servers then acting surprised when their massive pvp 500vs500 shitfest cant be handled by the servers smh.
---
Was a lag fest, Could only imagine the lag on pvp servers.
---
Agreed. I'm proud to say I never gave a shit about world first, streamers and I'll never understand the fuzz.
---
In the end it's just a videogame, and not even the best game ever made imo.
---
On the internet, it someone makes a mistake, it inflates people's ego and self image of being *better* and therefore the anonymity gives them the power to flame and insult to further boost their ego.
---
Why would you ignore someone asking you one question that they dont know if youll say yes or no to since they cant read your mind when theyre not spammimg you more than once?
---
Lol ofc trandate of heaven is crying
---
Knocking someone out cold in the real world is also a good ignore feature.
---
Came also here to correct this outrageous counting error which would have ruined everyones jolly friday. Glad I wasn't the only one! Blizz blue post states its:
---
Diminishing Returns from repeated kills on a single target are as follows:
---
* 1st: 100% of Honor
---
* 2nd: 75% of Honor
---
* 3rd: 50% of Honor
---
* 4th: 25% of Honor
---
* 5th (and beyond): 0% Honor
---
That would be cool and all, except the hounds don't respawn until the whole instance resets
---
They probably do, but not publicly while also ninjaing.
---
I am not 60 yet either, but I dont expect it to change when I hit 60. 
---
You still have to do dungeons for your pre-BiS and probably also have to corpse hop there.
---
I was asked to heal on my lvl 33 paly the other day, truly desperate.
---
Been a while since I've played horde on classic, but I'd think tanaris/desolace
---
You mean some idiot dying on first pull without using a single CD to save himself?
---
I'm waiting for PCT too.
---
Not interested in PVP vs PVE vs RP realms, it's just that my 60 mage is on a dead realm.
---
Windseeker horde here, hillsbrad was almost unplayable for me on a decent gaming rig lmfao
---
Exactly, thank you!
---
The fuck lol
---
I think it will get a bit better with time, but not much. 49+ really is going to be unplayable in contested zones outside of graveyard hours because they still give honor to 60s.
---
It may be best to get those last levels in BRD (and so on). Which isn’t so bad ...go ahead and get on that HoJ, Naglering, Second Wind, etc. grind.
---
Today gave me the feeling that all of this may lead them to push up p3 release. Or break p3 up like they did p2, and push out BGs early — which I’d very much be in favor of.
---
Which items specifically are you refering to?
---
MC takes ~2, maybe 3 hours at worst - if you are all naked and unprepared. Compared to retail, where you (have to) play all day to do the dailies, this is much better. You can literally log in for ~5 hours/week and you are good to go. If that isn't casual, then I don't know what it is.
---
This fucking guy
---
Actually 12k pop was sustained for some time and backed up by independent cencus
---
yeah I noticed lots of tanks have an attitude like that, but I wont tolerate that - every one in the group has the same rights
---
tank shortage is only really a thing in shitty guilds or for guildless people
---
You're cooked if you think I'd pass on this as a pally rofl
---
Yeah that's how it usually goes. A friend of mine once took some Adderall to help her do her homework, but she just ended up literally cleaning her entire house.
---
How many points did you put into improved mindblast? I did 4 points (6 second cd) for raid so i can do mb - mf - mf - mb. But i would think if you are mind blasting less, i usually do once per mob when farming you would place those points elsewhere.
---
Here we are clearing MC in under 45 minutes and you want how long per pull to build threat?!?
---
*d00d ur only doing 210 dps while in doing 225 dps, clearly you are playing your class wrong so I'm not first nova*.
---
Oh my god lol I'm not the only one. I keep begging my bf to tank dungeons for me (for BiS Pre-raid) because I'm always afraid people won't take me. Plus he's the best! I always make sure to have mana pots for his thirsty paladin self too. ^.^
---
This is madness.
---
Then stop playing
---
Yeah I definitely got got haha
---
https://youtu.be/NXX8URSUWm0
---
Implying anyone fucking cares when you shame them in world chat
---
Decoy snail. Checkmate, rogue.
---
As a healer I support you. Something something Danny DeVito started blasting meme.
---
Then I won't continue spending 15$ a month on wow.
---
Epic gamer move
---
I never understood this in PvP in MMOs. Dying has almost no consequences. If this were Everquest or a full loot game ... sure. Just fight and have fun.
---
Stop giving this child attention.
---
Final confirmation requires soembody to rnak up to 6 (so in 2 weeks), but I do expect the new sets only.
---
- Valor shoulders are better than those and most warriors will use them instead.
---
- Good bracers (I use them myself) but also easily replacable with other items.
---
- Certainly not pre-raid-bis boots. 3rd or 4th or 5th in line maybe. They are decent for fresh 60 tank.
---
Both sides were probably busy counting participants to make absolute certain it wasn't a fair fight. God forbid you ever engage in a fair fight in an MMO.
---
Is this how all EU brains think? Autistic as fuck
---
i doubt they will
---
Up to 15 now, am i still good?
---
Dunno if gullible or just clueless but ASHBRINGER and to some extent MORGRAINE fall under the "balanced" server category, compared to the 60% 40% split or worse servers.
---
So you can't really make an assumption based on 2 servers out of 10 or so.
---
Yea, that's your call.
---
&gt; the last dude and a dagger with pretty nice dps dropped, it also had some useless caster stats but its an upgrade (that would let me use some skills i hadn't before and +8 more dps) so i rolled need.
---
Yeah you are an idiot and need to learn to play.
---
I had an argument with someone on this exact matters. Then he stated that his FPS drops where server related, it felt pointless to try to convince him. 
---
People act like they know stuff when they don't  have a fucking clue xD
---
I've been tanking deadmines on my newly-created Warrior - Grobbulus RPPVP. Added a warrior / druid healer duo and was warned that the healer doesn't like when things get out of hand, so I should pull conservatively. 
---
I noticed halfway through the run that I was really struggling to hold agro with the Warrior in melee range. Turns out he was taunting whatever enemy he was fighting. I asked him if he was taunting off me, he said yes because he thought that's what he's supposed to do. I asked him not to, and explained how it's easier to have enemies focus on me rather than spreading out damage to the group. Smooth sailing from there. 
---
Sometimes all you've got to do is have a conversation and the situation will change. Like you said, not everyone is perfect - but they may get a little better if you help.
---
Ill need all u can do with full mana , evocate , mana jade and major mana potion thanks !!
---
I think the real problem is that they are letting more people in than what it was back in Vanilla. On PvP servers (especially high pop ones) World PvP is everywhere. You just can't avoid it. When back in Vanilla there was much lower realm population it meant that sure there was hotspots but you could easily avoid conflicts if you wanted to. Now kill squads are everywhere and you are never safe.
---
I can personally live with that (and of course I am Horde so situation is not too bad). But I do understand why some people (especially Alliance)  don't like current situation.
---
Did you find it yet?
---
its about stating fact that make sense in the context.
---
Most people explaining why it's not simple aren't defending blizzard its about not propagate misinformation.
---
Plus the same apply to you, everything you say is speculation and aren't even based on arguments
---
Everything scales exponentially? What, a ton of checks dont need to scale exponentially. I don't think Blizzard's devs are quite that bad.
---
At any rate, most chinese MMOs handles the 100 v 100 easy. Archaege handles it, I reckon at least 30% of MMOs that've came out in the last 10 years can handle 100 v 100.

Don't feed bad. Your druid is valuable part of the honor ecosystem!

i'd say flurry axe is the best thing you can get for the money you'd be spending on it. it's usually not too expensive
---
what is zerging ?
---
Druid tanks are actually pretty damn great.
---
Heard something like that. Not a suprise, when I was a teen I would have followed this man into war.
---
NordVPN 🤣
---
I like the crit as well in fury, but I wanted the def/armor/last stand as well. I love tanking but want to be able to play arms pvp as well without having to respec all the time
---
O
---
He is not even right. His Twitch statistics show his peak viewers was 308,086 concurrent viewers. He also averages 900 viewers so he seems to have a talent at being so completely unentertaining to not make anything out of being the first level 60 character in wow classic. That takes some fucking talent.
---
the man has a point
---
Concussive Blow and Shield Slam are the obvious pickups, no? 
---
You can probably get by with your spec since you want to pvp, but you'll be missing out on a top threat ability + concussive CD as well as some extra threat from 1h mastery / misc utility from whatever else you could pick up with remaining points. You're gaining a pvp ability at the expense of tanking ability.
---
Haha it's like that is it.
---
Gru no
---
OMG hahahaha
---
Logging on while give you a more accurate answer than any you can find here.
---
Faction imbalance is not the point here. It’s the assumption of horde bad gankers alliance good non-gankers
---
they don't want to fix it
---
This guy needs an attitude adjustment.  I'd volunteer.
---
Basic supply- and demand dynamics of the open market disagrees.
---
What's more troubling is that it is my bis, and he's not even dps in the run
---
It actually is his BiS bracers. Just because its cloth doesn't mean he cant roll.
---
Just because the item he has is putple doesn't mean it's hetter than a blue.
---
If you need to check position, range, cds,latency etc. For 200 players per tick it adds up pretty quickly. 100vs100 is possible, but for that blizzard needs to rewrite their code.
---
Private servers have nowhere near the amount of backend checks, logs etc. as live has. Comparing the two is dumb.
---
&gt; its about stating fact
---
Please source these facts then. You'd be the first to come up with something. As you say, we wouldn't want to propagate misinformation.
---
From the call they made last week or something, they less than doubled the amount of subs, classic has no MTX, you don't have to buy expansion and only requires a sub. WoW's revenue last quarter was around 350 million and 2.5-3M subs would only contribute to around $40-90m (sub fee differs depending on country so no way to get a number aside from an extremely rough estimate). Also keep in mind that people can't buy the new expansion yet, and BfA is the least successfull expansion so far, so at the lowest retail has ever been, it's still way more profitable than classic. And Shadowlands will likely be a "Redemption Arc", just like legion after WoD, so they literally have no reason to put effort into classic.
---
we've played this same game for the past 15 years, and 3 weeks of playtime has you asking all sort of questions?
---
just don't turn on his f\*\*\*\*\* stream. This is hopefully an example that streamers are NOT allowed to do what ever they want. So JokerD  go f\*\*\* yourself

" i need to get the last comment in too cause my ego small "
---
i Am GeTtINg PvPd On A pVp SeRvEr. 
---
That being said i hope the offer transfers to pve servers, I think that will help.
---
 I think alot of people misunderstood the current pvp meta is essentially to hold down any choke points and just kill en mass anyone who is there. I think there notions of world pvp are different to what will and has occured. 
---
I feel pve servers may be more fitting for the people that find this so unfun they need to post about it.
---
Pve servers are fine btw. That being said i love all the player  created content that comes from a pvp server.
---
You've got to remember that "traditional" runs also use the hidden reserve system. The warrior tank who needs plate drops just simply doesn't invite warriors or paladins. Or invites only casters if they want the weapons.
---
I do think it's pretty silly to waste people's time when your party won't fill because of the reserve list.
---
Agreed. Also OoC procs are handy for that extra maul or three! I've been moonglow myself for awhile now but I often still get whispers like this to tank occasionally and I'm just like "me not that kind of druid!"
---
I'll probably never spec back into a Hotw/NS build as it just spreads druid too thin for tanking. Healing is fine with only 21 points into resto but tanking really needs the 11 points in balance and deep feral to be viable, especially since we're seeing dps with more purples outta MC.
---
That's the only way to find tanks outside the cities.   As a tank, as a healer, yes.
---
I know perfectly what a datacenter is, thanks. A private server in a hosting environment could most likely increase their RAM by putting in an order and having it allocated to the machine without any downtime. Blizzard increasing the total RAM allocated to Classic without major downtime would mean they'd have to install new hosts entirely to help spread the load, or using a lot of planning and man hours juggling around the load on the remaining hosts while bringing down and upgrading the existing ones. It's not even slightly comparable. Even while Blizzard pay less per stick of RAM than an end consumer would, the actual costs of the operation is insane in comparison.
---
And still, noone that runs a business with actual profit margins is going to spend 10x the money to plan for a 1% scenario. Not even if you run your environment in AWS or similar where elastic load balancing is a thing you're not going to say "Just add more performance infinitely if needed" because you're going to go bankrupt.
---
E S T I M A T E D
---
I'd imagine everyone who grinded instead of doing quests is in a similar situation :D
---
Rate limit targeting
---
Other than people around your level range being more eager to fight (which could be a problem in STV since 35 is lower than most people questing there), you're mostly ok until you hit 48 since 60s will not go out of their way to kill you.
---
The downside is you'll have to look longer for a tank:)
---
My understanding is shield slam is solid, but I was more wondering if I'm going to struggle tanking the later dungeons or if I can make it work
---
Nope, Bgs sind Serverübergreifend.  ;)
---
I think the dungeons have a limit of 10 people at a time. So 10 people steamrolling lava run to get into MC should be pretty fast
---
Because private servers are full of shit, holes, security risks, no real anti-cheating or botting software etc.
---
I'd prefer that over a little less lag.
---
When you’re a warlock and a priest asks how much of their mana you want after life tapping.
---
Hi guys, does anyone know if the talent "Gift of Nature" increases total healing(after adding +healing)? or does it only increase base healing of the spell (similar to Spiritual Healing as a Priest)
---
It really isn't.
---
I've tanked all the 60 dungeons apart from DM:W with a 9/31/11 spec. Getting Parry and Tactical Mastery from Arms, then improve shield block from Prot.
---
Basically I wanted to do the same thing as you. Be able to do solo things as a Fury warrior but still tank in dungeons.
---
I didn't find any issues with tanking.
---
Explain this then since you know:
---
Raid 1 got the gold and could see the loot window (The mob was red, not grey to them). They could not loot it.
---
Raid 2 could see the loot, but they could not distribute it (The mob was red, not grey to them), their Master looter had players from Raid 1 in the distribution list.
---
Oh well
---
And your experience is everyone elses....
---
If he was a boomer, he’d say it wasn’t loud enough.  Do you know what a boomer is or are you just repeating it cause you saw someone else say it and it seemed funny?   Know your memes bruh.
---
Apples to oranges. Private servers did not have the logging and auditing the Blizzard servers do.
---
I agree that it's like that IF they don't tell you about all the rules upfront.
---
Telling you about all the rules up front is more like someone posting on some friend building website that they are looking for like minded swingers for friends. Some people are totally okay with someone fucking their wife, and someone making it clear they are looking for that kind of person isn't rude.
---
Lmao you're an idiot, go back to your hugbox
---
You can visibly see the panic when they arrive with the sporadic camera movements and waiting 5 seconds to grenade. It's beautiful
---
&gt; So you're saying classic wow is going to fail?
---
are you an idiot?
---
&gt; If/when that happens, that's when they start merging servers.
---
not gonna happen.
---
/dnd
---
Any competent RL would let heals free roll because it's BiS for all of us.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
This has not been my experience at all.
---
Azshara world boss kill yesterday brought atleast 800 people to azshara not even counting alliance players and our server IS 60/40 and yeah it was lagging but it hold up well considering the amount of players.
---
Also the rest of the night we pvped in raids with atleast 40-50 players plus alliance. This was in felwood, wintersping, badlands etc
---
40v40, 100v100, 200v200
---
Yeah, I got 40 days during vanilla and I didn't start until several months into EU release, people blabbing about vanilla servers running fine and being able to handle large battles clearly never played vanilla...
---
In this post, douchy tanks being douches and everyone accepts it because they need a tank, fuck you guys, but tank my dungeons.
---
Especially with batching, getting guaranteed crits on both CL and earth shock. I open up with nearly 1500 dmg bursts at lvl 46
---
I take ritalin daily only for work (with prescription). I have tried them in the past a few times just out of curiosity for some extended (once up to \~60h) gaming sessions without sleep. Since for me its 2 biggest effects are a loss of appetite and not feeling tired. But there are really no negative &amp; harmful long-term side effects, not even from "overdosing" (or atleast to this date theres still nothing known about any), as long as you dont do it constantly.
---
Your sleep rythm obviously will get fucked and you'll very likely feel shitty due to that for a couple of days if you deprive yourself from sleep. This twitching or feeling nervous or anxious you often see when people abuse it is usually a sign of a too high dose. Unlike other drugs/stimulants, taking more ritalin than what would be your optimal prescribed dose doesnt make you "higher" or give you an even better focus or whatever, it just brings more negative (but temporary) side-effects.
---
dude you are ddosing the server at this point with 600 people 
---
Minecraft cant even handle over 112 people on top servers
---
Surely Method is kicking themselves now for having briefly been associated with this absolute douchebag.
---
You should have hit 60 then. Retail is that way ---&gt;
---
My narcisist alarm is screeching...
---
You need to be top 0.8% to beat the decay on rank 13.
---
Top 0.02% would be insane, that would be 1 per 5000 players. The top 0.3% of players are in the top bracket, which earns enough to even beat the decay on rank 14.
---
Warriors are just rogues. And paladins are wearing dresses. So is my restodudu...
---
You pay money to Blizzard and they use that money for the entire Battle.net plattform. It's not a separate entity with a separate economy. It would be sweet if it was and if it ran on separate hardware, but it doesn't.
---
Retail looks so nice now
---
In my case nobody ever ended up dead, or at least so it seemed. I just wandered around the lagfest watching boss health slowly go down. Sure, whoever was too close to the boss got nuked, but everybody else was seemingly safe and there was nothing we could do to stop the other faction from claiming the kill despite the numbers being somewhat even.
---
I'll def be playing more at 60 with RL friends as opposed to pugs so that shouldnt be a huge problem. Im just already broke as hell and dont want to respec a ton until it's absolutely needed lol
---
Don't mind the salt mines responding to you. While leveling there a lot of staffs / daggers with caster stats but with crazy good dps. Fucking roll need on it.
---
Made up propaganda
---
bye Karen
---
This was actually stunning!
---
Ask people to wait a couple seconds so you can get aggro. Marking a skull target really helps and you should do it every pull. Bind it to a hotkey.
---
Also you just need to accept that you won't always have aggro on everything and that is honestly ok. Most dps can tank a single mob or kite it quite easily, just focus on building threat on the secondary mobs.
---
I too would like to hear more about this come back check.
---
Shut up. No Changes. It's not laggy enough.
---
https://youtu.be/ORL-CpNVFzc
---
the effect of a DHK happens immediately but we have no rank points to deduct from yet so nothing happens until weekly reset. first week is a convenient freebee
---
The main value in Imp Shield Block is that you get an extra block, so 2 guaranteed blocks per use.
---
The armor and dmg reduction isn't actually that relevant. It's how block interacts with the enemies hit tables that makes it useful for tanking. Basically whilst you have Shield Block active, you can't be hit by a Crushing Blow.
---
15 years of technological progression.

&gt; I hope i'm not the only one having this issue.

This is why so many tanks don’t pug. Best find yourself a guild that knows how to dungeon with a pally tank. Until then you’re going to get a lot of pug dps that don’t pay enough attention to threat.
---
Server capacity implies that the server can actually handle that many players. What's the point of raising the bar from 3k to 15k or whatever players, if you can't actually support that many?
---
ROFL what are you a fucking child or something? Jesus christ just stop. I feel sorry for you. Pathetic.
---
My guild is the same, but that's comparing apples &amp; oranges because one is healer vs healer and the other's healer vs dps.
---
Dps is much more important in MC than heals.
---
Exactly! The guy literally threw away an entire real life career for one piece of in game loot. The guy is a simpleton.
---
Shut up you are the ignorant one here. People like you defending blizzard because they read on another thread that computing is not scalable infinitly.. yeah that's not completely wrong but if you really think they could not provide way better servers you are delusional.
---
I don't know why people feel the need to still defend blizzard with everything after all this time.
---
Then just get the hardware from 2007
---
When 15 agi comes out in a couple weeks it will be bis
---
Considering how rarely 300v300 (or 100v100) pvp  battles happen, I'm pretty sure they won't be spending much money on fixing this.
---
A lot of DPS players seem to be too busy watching streams or something while doing instances.
---
I've keybound the skull marker so it's easy to place mid fight. Then I've started telling groups that when the skull appears, that's the signal to start.
---
I'll remind them once, warn once more. If they still insist on being streamer-spastic tards, I leave the group.
---
Have no idea what the fuck that means and I'm not religious
---
that point when you don't want to do Maradoun cos it's such a pain to get to, but will struggle for ST... yep.
---
Oh and you should be lvling in burning gorge...good luck with that.
---
Edit- tractable should say "take".
---
You think taking best in slot gear that can't be upgraded for months so you can upgrade in a few days and vendor it is fair?
---
Imagine a hunter vs a warrior taking savage gladiator Chain when the hunter will just replace it in MC while warriors have another 3 months to wait before it can be replaced.
---
Makes you sound pretty annoying to me.
---
Lmao. At least you have some friends in Undercity.
---
Yea man wtf. If you want to pvp in crowded zones with large scale battles you need to pay another premium sub to unlock the feature.
---
15$ sub only get you 20v20 or 15v15.
---
Thats blizzard quality stamp right there.
---
I for once joined a Random group - tanking inies like M+ since the start of classic - but thought let's give them the worst impression you can ever get. Holy they were pissed about someone tanking 1 Mob solo each time, marking, cc'ing and so on on all packs. And i only used SA and DS so only dmg from AA's. Best 2H of my Life :D
---
Thats not an excuse for their pitiful servers. You pay 15$ per month, so having a certain level of expectation is fair. I dont mind having some lag, but atleast let me cast a damn spell before i die from consecration spam.
---
He used a method that could only be done by 1 out of 10 classes AND which involved heavily exploiting a no-longer-existing mechanic.
---
His biggest/only achievement is basically WoW's equivalent of winning the special olympics.
---
Lag certainly can be fun, when you do a massive event and it kinda breaks the servers for a bit..
---
But when it's 24-7 and every single event, then it's not that fun.
---
Sup jokered
---
non vanilla player confirmed, in vanilla the server lag was rare and it came from your shitty modem, not from the server. And u might be confusing FPS lag with server lag as well. Stop shitposting, fucking white knight.
---
He'll get banned from Twitch too for sure. He's a sociopath who isn't capable of following the ToS.
---
Hahaha. Congrats bro.
---
Just like making a claim without proof is. Its pointless.
---
that doesnt even make sense because it removes rank points not honor, and it happens immediately, which is why they got that message. but there were no rank points to begin with so nothing happens.
---
It felt like an embassy siege, alliance raid was forced onto the roof of netherguard keep. Furiously aoe'ing points of entry.
---
They are too big to fail.
---
You think their revenues are from monthly subs, HS card packs or cosmetical shit? Nope, they use THAT money to invest in other stocks, and not to mention other shady businesses which are not legal for you and me, but Blizzard has friends "all the way up", so they can get away with it WHILE getting massive tax refunds and the like.

Capacity means more than just the maximum players being able to play at a given moment. Your computer surely can handle Photoshop being opened 4 dozen times, but only of those instances rendering an image will bring it to it's limits.
---
Without ranked pvp gear going against a fully raid geared person you will get assblasted.
---
This method isn’t a guild.
---
It’s a company with actual real life sponsors and a PR dept.
---
That is also true.
---
I had getting a single stack of 12/14 at the start of an instance is gone by buffing and the first couple of trash mobs :|
---
With a competent team and tanking gear you should be fine. You still have the beauty that is BRD ahead of you, though, hope you have some friends to bring with you into the depths - that place can get very interesting if you do it with a clueless pug (as I did, while being pretty clueless about the layout after 14\~years time - luckily I was healing and not tanking). I'm guessing you're already wearing a shield, but if you do not, ST or BRD are the places where you definitely want to start wearing a shield.
---
31 arms / 5 fury / 15 prot was very popular back in the day.
---
That way you can get 1/1 Last Stand, 1/3 Improved Shield Block and 3/5 Defiance, while still getting full arms +5% crit from fury.
---
It's an allright all-round kind of build, and Last Stand can be pretty good for non-tanking stuff too.
---
This is when you sapper
---
Best 5 gold you ever spend
---
Back in Vanilla every so often you'd get someone really angry on the blizz forums QQing so hard about rouges being overpowered that they seemingly lost the ability to spell and form coherent sentences. 'Rogue' was a commonality in their posts.
---
minor? It's literally 60% of the endgame if not more. I already know several people who have cancelled because of it
---
because player interactions in close proximity is an n\^2 problem. The amount of calculations needed going from 50 to 300 doesn't take 6 times as much work, it requires 36 times as much, because the effects of each player need to be applied to every other player.
---
This means throwing more hardware at the problem gives quick diminishing returns.
---
That's a normal way for dime a dozen DPS to form groups? Unless a tank already has HOJ and really really wants SGC and is too lazy to form his own group where he can likely put SGC on reserve himself.i'd argue that there's no way a tank is going to agree to join that party.
---
I'm not arguing or even complaining. The point of the post was that generally in order to make demands or "barter" you have to have or offer something people want. There's nothing a random DPS can offer me as a tank that's going to make me want to tank your run where you're reserving 1 of the 2 items people actually care about running it for.
---
If they kill you back does it reset?
---
Yep they are very much active in the wild.
---
Horde coming in strong!
---
You won't have clear casting with the shatter aoe spec at that level. My mage alt is a gnome so I have a bit more mana but I finish with enough mana that I believe any race could do it
---
must be fake. The horde being organised? Is that a world first?
---
Isn't that exactly what I said? Not sure how that's disagreeing with my comment.
---
Honestly, if Blizzard wanted to restore any sort of faction balance to the game, they shouldn't enable cross realm BGs. The idea being, if Horde have to wait 1 hour+ to enter a BG and Alliance get instaqueue, maybe they'll actually consider transfering to a server with lower Horde pop and balance servers out a bit.
---
Firm agree. My med pop server with a decent faction balance means I have more people to play with than my vanilla server with a faction I'm balance that was in our favor.
---
Small-mid pop servers have the great sense of community that I've missed so much and that the loss of in wrath caused me to stop playing.
---
You're doing just perfect. Add in slice'n'dice once you can learn it, try to keep that buff up all the time and you pretty much have 95% of your optimal endgame dps rotation down.
---
Wie heißt du dort ? Fühlst sich immer so an als ob man der einzige auf reddit ist wäre :D

Wouldn’t that break a tooon of other addons?
---
Get some int and stam gear from AH and go AoE already. I was doing 10+ AoE pulls at level 23 with ease, buying my gear from AH.
---
Hey I can see my corpse.
---
I thought DK tool from honour gained which then impacts rank.  Is that not correct?
---
Speaking of, wasn't there a guy who was grinding to 60 killing only boars? Anyone have an update on him?
---
The exp distribution was bugged and they exploited that, go back to lapping up streamer fluid fuck wit.
---
In all seriousity, I have big issues with gold farming.
---
The relic coffer keys is 35-50s each in my server, so that's not profitable.. I farmed blasted lands material for some days, and sure, they are worth a lot but how many times I tried putting them in AH they will not sell. Been trying for days.
---
I did some few brd pickpocket runs, but died most times due to being pve spec and not having improved stealth + the resist. 
---
I'm 300 engi and 300 mining, it's so hard to find a single thorium node, and even getting a crystal is so hard.  I okay perhaps 1-3 hours a day. And now when p2 came out I need to respec all the time from pvp to pve, and thats 50g each week.. anyone got tips? "/
---
Same formula as karma.
---
Maybe big fights like this but I had a lot of fun last n different parts of the world with smaller fights
---
He lost his viewers, Method lost their interest in him.
---
My conspiracy theory is that I'm starting to suspect he was waiting for a big enough item to ninja to make himself the heel of the Classic WoW streamers. When he was thinking about taking the staff, I got the feeling that maybe he was wondering if the item was big enough to cause drama or if it would just fizzle.
---
Seems like his viewers and subs were declining, and perhaps Method weren't worth the contract, so he took the chance on becoming the guy everyone loves to hate.
---
Could be BS, but seems like it's probably working for him.
---
Engineering takes about 200g to max out and a TON of bag space. Do that last if you can. Also Devilsuar is legit only 2% crit over shadowcraft but you lose out on like 20ap. It's not that big so if you can get shadowcraft set save the gold.
---
I used to play on TBC arena servers back in wotlk, and I never realized that the lack of batching is what made everything feel so crisp. Only downsides were that it was a lot more difficult to fake cast and to death polymorph etc.
---
Yeah screw dwarf racials, shadowmeld is MVP for world pvp. Combined with invis pots to reposition and meld again in another location, it really messes with people trying to find you.
---
Also you are a fucking hypocrite. Duhh everyone is entitled to an opinion but I wanna cry. Literal your words.
---
How does that argument work in Blizzards favor?
---
If those logs and audits objectively provide a worse game experience, please tell me how they are justifiable?
---
So what ? Do i have to look for jed, use my key (thats i sent 60g on it so people let me the last gem after 30 lbrs run) form the group, tell  the same tips over and over so people dont die (still died anyway)to whelps egg/bump/arena event bug so someone who did jackshit afk in orgri, last dps gets the item ive been looking forever ? 
---
You're the entitled one to complain, just form the damn group yourself. Atleast with my group people gets their onyxia attunement or benefits from it in another way. I could also just make full caster run, which one is preferable in your opinion ?
---
, or a panic fear and the mob run into more mobs..
---
Any addons that pull data about enemy players you aren't fighting sure. Or addons that abuse target scanning sure.
---
Any addon doing one of those 2 things is doing some fucky stuff
---
no,

a DHK is when you kill importent NPC´s of the oppoing faction

Wasn't he technically not wrong. Like rolling 89.97 is the same as rolling 89 then rolling again and getting 97? Well ofc its not but it kinda is.

It would have been in a chest which he could let you loot for a fee
---
100% of the time I get attacked by a druid, it's ALWAYS tauren.

Youre trying to act like your feeling numbers made up from an inconsistent piece of trash, broken-by-blizz addon is anything for me to agree with or learn on. Youre delusional. We aren't going to agree.

Pathetic that his claim to fame is being the first person to "beat" a 15 year old game.

Aren't gray mobs give you 0 exp? Or is it still 0,000075 exp /mob?

Oh, they will...

Technical discussion is beyond the point. They charge for a game, we are allowed to expect no lags and a smooth experience.

I work as an engineer, when a customer shows up and ask me for something I have to tell them how much work it requires. Never a customer would take "sorry it's not working because it's technically challenging" as a valid excuse after they paid us money. They pay us because it's challenging, if it was easy anyone could do it and I wouldn't have a job.
---
In this scenario if Blizzard knew from the start that servers could not handle the population (if they don't know, who does ?) they should have opened more servers to spread out the player base. If there is no technical solution to a problem you find a non-technical one, leaving issues unresolved is never acceptable.
---
They were set on their vision "You think you do but you don't", they believed they knew what players wanted more than players themselves. They didn't open enough servers (most likely believing people would quit Classic after 2 weeks) and now we're in this situation. I don't care how they fix it as long as it's fixed. If they have to spend 10 times to amount of money on fixing software because they failed to wanted to be cheap and didn't open servers that's their mistake.
---
It doesn't even work does it? Shadowmeld breaks the moment you start your cast, instead of when it finishes.
---
Time was invented by industrialists to make workers more efficient.  No one cared about what minute it was 300 years ago.
---
Zero, but there are boars of all different levels so you cam technically make the whole journey with them
---
Another half ass comment from a person with no clue as to what is happening🤦‍♂️.
---
Also please don't use security risks in such a way that makes absolutely no sense. I am an infosec analyst and the shit portraid on tv and in movies about security is already horribly inacurate and completly out of context. We dont need more ignorant people with no knowledge of server technology, networking, security, business or even sizing and capacity planning (that last one is the actual issue thay led to the current situation... but you probably don't understand it anw) to start spouting nonesense as fact.

He's not stable, healthy, nor what society would consider "adult".
---
But he definitely exists, so he sure is ***"A"******.***
---
You can believe whatever excuses you want, you are fucking naive if you think people have never lied on the internet dipshit. Go throw him some more money so he'll say you're name out loud, I know how much you idiots love that menial amount of attention. Unless you watched every last minute of his leveling progress, you can't make any of those assertions with any real accuracy. I however watch numerous streamers abuse bugs and the layering system. From that we can extrapolate that most streamers with a legion of loyal autists could easily have done it.
---
It doesn't.
---
Desolace will be too low and has no crucial quest items at this stage
---
I definitely use It on my arms warrior. One extra minute on battle shout will just make me forget to use it.
---
This comes up again and again.
---
This is **not** an easy problem to solve - anyone saying otherwise is an armchair engineer.
---
Whats the addon called that shows detected enemies :)?
---
You probably want to be 52-53 minimum for the early parts; arena/angerforge and possibly jailbreak/interrogator (has some cloth drops) and Golem master for your priest friend. The place has 18 non rare bosses and spans a huge level interval, with the final boss being 59 and hitting like a monster. Doing a full clear at "regular" level of 56+ (healer can be lower, but obv. has bigger aggro radius) of people who don't know the place inside out is an easy 2.5-3.5 hours.
---
If any dungeon can be called a 5 man raid, this one is it. I recommend looking up "tanking BRD" on YouTube if your memory of it is as bad as mine was, there is a thorough (well, I did not watch the whole but I assume it is) 1.5h video you can skip through or watch over a beer and popcorn.
---
Most people play it casual
---
I can’t not say I don’t blame him.
---
There, all fixed
---
Burden of proof is on the one making the claim. OP makes the claim so he will need to show the proof.
---
Imagine first inventing a product and then inventing some reason to sell that product.
---
Its like AppleCare.
---
Yeah it's like we didn't care about wasting our time like alliance did beforehand, and now we're here not only for revenge, but honor too. For the horde!
---
You're pretty stupid for not getting UC to honoured though, since I'd assume with that much grinding, you'd be purchasing an epic mount now.
---
Or maybe you didn't knew about the 10% discount :p
---
What time of the day does the honor update daily? (eu)
---
You have absolutely no idea what you talking about. Try understanding the technology instead of just throwing out broad assumptions based on a hate for private servers.
---
On Kazzak fight there was literally 20 second delay.
---
If on a pve server visit stranglethorn vale, follow the road from duskwood, to the south is the entrance to stv
---
If on a pvp server I would not go there right now, since you will have a bad time
---
I agree on the service side of thing, they should offer a lag free server with large scale pvp.
---
Blizzard are clearly clueless and out of touch. 
---
My point is against the argument that compare pservers and classic on the technical end which doesn't make sense for me since the context is so vastly different.
---
With the toxicity of that comment you should be following your own arrow boiii.
---
If i'm correct, you dont lose any durability when killed by other players?
---
Undead Prot/Fury Warrior with Blacksmithing Trinket.
---
&gt;warlock wtf r u doin
---
I get these pretty often on my priest and I don't think it's rude in the slightest. They won't be upset about not getting a response.
---
I am at level 59 couldnt get even 1% yesterday. I think I have to wait until bgs are up so everyone will pvp there, so close....
---
Minimum 100v100 battles are bound to happen every week on each worldboss spawn for at least few months from now on, at least on the popular servers. It's not gamebreaking, I will enjoy classic even with those issues, it's just sad we can't experience the large battles how they should be.
---
Aww it's still equipped on my rogue alongside some other long lost items, really makes it special to log onto him everytime
---
I feel like this is a joke? 
---
;)
---
It doesn't. It updates with the weekly reset.
---
If people actually did the stuff it's not unlikely there's some proof somewhere on the internet if you go digging. I did some digging on myself and I found videos showing what guilds I were in, forum posts talking about things I did, boss kill pictures with me in them etc etc. I even found a list of the original vanilla race for my server back in the day tucked away on an Asian forum.
---
However, even if you were try to prove what you did or didn't do most people wouldn't believe it anyways. And you look even more desperate to prove that you're "someone". 
---
Personally I barely even talk about that stuff (most of my guild doesn't even know anything about it), and hell, it was 15 years ago, I'm not the same person anymore. I'm not above admitting that the first time I went into UBRS in Classic I was insecure as shit about what to do etc.
---
Gandling seems like a pretty good split
---
\&gt;Where are all the tanks?  
---
\&gt;Same person:  
---
\*rolls mage and rogue\*  
---
\*needs on BOEs that the tank needs\*  
---
\*flexes his 5 digit amount of gold from solo farming DM or ZF or whatever is popular now, inflating the cost of every single thing to the level where the only way warriors can compete is to reserve all sellables and drops\*  
---
\&gt;Where are the tanks though?
---

[I'm talking about this in the honor ui](http://puu.sh/EEPAv/b48753d69f.jpg)

I've opened 2-3 tomes already that were completely empty and didnt despawn after opening, and that was before I had any of the books or their quests on that character, are you saying that those 2-3 tomes out of the maybe \~4-5 I opened in total should all have contained a buggy invisible Compendium?
---
Don't buy the pattern, just run LBRS, it'll drop soon enough. You need several runs (if not 50+) for pre-BiS.
---
Do a mix of running Stratholme for gold (orbs) and Blackrock Spire and Scholomance for loot. Everyone wants mages for that.
---
15 hours a week is a fucking lot for an average adult in the US.

I have about 2 hours of leasiure time each night after work if I want to get a normal amount of sleep. I have a good job, and my commute isn't terrible. My weekends are packed already, but I could fit in 5 hours in the weekend if I wanted to.
---
Also, all my leveling has been done with my best friend, because that's how we enjoy wow. We don't have the same schedules, or the same free time all the time.
---
If BRM is full of people and it's laggy, this method isn't reliable.
---
I once didn't get ported before P2 even just jumping through the window. Maybe don't risk this with world buffs, etc.
---
Reminds me that Stan Lee meme, when Spider-man and Lizard were fighting in library.
---
It's fair play. The world bosses are faction vs faction. It's guild vs EVERYONE. Don't be a pussy
---
Yes. And your HKs update in real time, but your honour calculations are only done at reset. So it'll say 0 until next Tuesday/Wednesday

thanks a lot for this, appreciated it
---
Same fucking story. My friend forced me to pvp server and he quit!!!
---
Yeah, it's pretty common to sell cleared runs if something good drops - rode, ring, a melee chest too i think
---
I'm gonna teach you how to get the same functionality as the Spy AddOn just by using the in-game combat log.
---
- Click the "Combat Log" tab in chat.
---
- Right click it, then select "Settings".
---
- Click "Add Filter" and give your new filter a name. How about "Spy"?
---
- Manage sources for "Spy" and check "Enemy Players" under "Done By".
---
- Check all of the options under "Done To".
---
- Click the "Message Types" tab and make sure the following is checked: Melee (Damage), Ranged (Damage), Spells (Damage, Heals, Power Gains), Periodic (Damage, Heals), Miscellaneous (Kills, Deaths).
---
- Click the "Colors" tab and colorize "Unite Names", "Spell Names", "Damage Number" and "Damage School".
---
- Click "Okay" in the lower right corner.
---
Congratulations! You now have the exact same information as the Spy AddOn provides in an easy to read window. You want to ban this as well?
---
“When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker?”
---
Awesome ..world pvp is fun cause of this badass moments
---
The fact that nothing has changed is the problem though.
---
It all depends what you want to do endgame. If you want to keep being dps shadow is your best bet. For healing you can pretty much do either disc or holy. 
---
As far as farming is concerned. Priests can aoe farm pretty effectively with holy nova with a dedicated intelect set. Shadow priests can farm maraudon princess to vendor the drops,.
---
LOL, THAT WAS EPIC, YOU'RE A LEGEND. CAN U GIV ME NAM OF SONG?
---
world pvp is gonna kill classic anyways lol
---
brd
---
depends on how many enchanters in your server has one of these. some hardcore guilds might pay thousands of gold for the recipe if they dont have one yet
---
\*laughs in Gehennas\*
---
This is the pinnacle of World of Warcraft
---
This is what happens when you play a 15 year old game, it’s studied so much to the point where it’s not fun at times.
---
If I had the option I would love to forget everything about wow and enjoy that amazing new player experience.
---
One Thousand Needles, Tanaris, um I forget the name now but the zone where the big fat princess is in a dungeon. Name is escaping me. Maraudon?
---
purpose of video?
---
well.. if he doesn't come through, it's disappointing, but understandable lol
---
BRD range lol..good luck getting to it in first place
---
Seriously. Tanking ZF last night was a nightmare. DPS immediately jumped into all fight and 2 guys had 5 levels on me. Of course I'm not gonna hold aggro.
---
Luckily they were actually decent at DPS and most mobs would die before I even had a chance to get aggro back so nobody died (except for one time when a runner pulled all around the Ghaz area), so we made it, but it barely felt like I was tanking.
---
Somehow a small non-profit group of people could provide a stable mass pvp experience but Blizzard, a small indie company can't?
---
Hillsbrad, arathi highlands are exceptional
---
I wouldn't use imp drain soul or imp weakness myself.
---
Just seems like normal kazzak shenanigans to me. I thought same faction healing was just a thing that happened.
---
It has to be. This is beyond cringy, it’s just sad.
---
Lol shut up. Blizzard has listened to fan feedback at every turn with Classic. World PVP has always been an issue and was never going to be perfect. Stop whining.
---
Maybe don't use Google Translate for your posts.
---
Just use something like [this](https://de.classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-holy-priest-healer-leveling-talent-build-1-60).
---
There are tons of well written guides out there. 
---
I respecced to holy/disc as well yesterday, since I can‘t kill mobs peacefully anyways at 50 and pvp doesn’t make much sense either right now. At least at that level range. So I‘m just grinding dungeons as a healer to somehow get to 60. 
---
Holy Nova seems to be super mana inefficient but it can be fun to use and you will need it for the benediction quest (you will respecc at 60 anyways so no real argument here). You can always down rank the spell, so it could come in handy, but I seriously don’t know. 
---
If you‘re on a pve server however.. I‘d say you should stick to shadow until you‘re 60 (or in the level range for you pre bis dungeons), since its pretty nice for questing and farming.
---
👍🏻 good advice
---
Some people's mains are not 60... including mine.. 42 warrior.. Basically, only able to do dungeons such as SM because they are in safe area's..
---
Completely agree with you, its a 15 year old game. The same issues happen in retail.
---
Blizzard need to stop milking this old game and release wow 2 on a new engine.
---
Not something to brag about, in fact you kinda fkd yourself if you ever want to get those reps up. All the lower level quests no longer give rep or only a tiny fraction of it if they turn grey. You also missed out on the 10% discount on all faction vendors/trainers at honored which you could hit as early as \~20-30.
---
All those fools who took their sick days/holidays on wow classic launch. THIS is when you need to be doing that. It will at least be a little quieter during the day if you pick the right place to level.
---
Like someone else said, I would go 31-5-15. If you really look all of your damage mitigation talents are in the first 3 tiers of the prot tree so you can still pick up shield block/defiance/last stand. This is why the fury prot build utilizes the first couple tiers of the defense tree and thats about it. MS is nice for pvp obviously but I think you're going to miss out on a lot not having enrage/piercing howl in a PVP setting.
---
I will say that I LOVE the control that deep prot brings to dungeons, specifically having a 5 second stun, and revenge often proccing a 3 second stun that isn't on the DR. it's not uncommon to have 2 mobs completely stun locked to dead.
---
I have been called in to ZF to tank, to find 3 (Yes 3) warriors and a healer, making me the fourth Warrior. These guys were 2/4 levels above me if I recall and any of them could have just tanked the whole bloody thing easily. Not to be a cnut, I begrudgingly tanked the run while highly vexxed at these 3 fellas the whole time.
---
Imagine being this mad guys.
---
[Read this buddy.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview)
---
I had it last night it was a 3v2, then flash to a second later an I'm 20% hp with 5 extra enemies beating me down from what appears no where.
---
Classicwow.live was a game changer for my leveling
---
Did the key ring come out with this update? If so how do I access it?
---
Same with herbalism as a lower level. Feels good
---
Personally, I love it. It reminds me of EVE, except I don't lose my gear when I die. The world is a dark and dangerous place. War isn't fair.
---
You mean Minecraft that was written by one bloke in java in a basement. A game that has terrain made of millions of blocks that can be destroyed by any player at any time.
---
mounts are not the only thing discounted, its everything from vendors, including repairs
---
Sounds like you're the one who sucks, dude. A few healers rolled on spellpower gear so you're purposely trying to fuck over anyone you run with now? Grow up.
---
Probably not but it might have an impact on said player and make him just a tad bit worried about his reputation in the future :3
---
one hit wonder

---
I hope blizz can fix it. But it’s so annoying seeing people parrot this. Pservers never had this many people wpvping like this.  Pservers only had this many people at launch and if you experienced a pserver launch you’d know how idiotic it was to claim they could handle this.
---
I know it's from a private server and not classic because they get the Onyxia loading screen graphic rather than the molten core one.
---
Still interested to try it
---
Also applies to us oomkin Druids
---
And this is daily right? So the next day the same player would give 100% honor again.
---
A consistent raid group has 40 people to gear...
---
We did 1 hour 45 mins from first trash pull to rag kill with a druid main tank.
---
I accept sometimes. It's always a full group usually ready to go, and if I'm near the dungeon and have the time why not.
---
Until they realise its thousand of gold for a recipe that will surely drop for their MC farm before BWL comes out, all for a 150g/mats recipe for +1 extra stat to chest, for use in raids that already are on farm with everyone wearing greens.
---
i.e. people have to be bloody stupid to play 1000g+ for something like this.
---
But if OP is on one of those top-tier PvP servers full of tryhards, I could totally see it happening.
---
No.
---
I'll admit I just pulled that number entirely out my ass, lol. Thanks for the correction.
---
Ackshually..!!
---
Ich war auf der anderen Seite - bist nicht alleine hier ;)
---
Hypervisor overhead isn't the big issue you think it is. Nothing would be fixed by going to physical hosts other than decreasing stability and scaleability.
---
Install spy and walk around them when they pop up
---
They might’ve said they were non profit but their was profiteering on multiple private servers. I played on them heavily so I kinda know. 
---
But in the base argument of “you make millions from our subs. Please give us stable.” I understand and side with you. I took the same stance with Disney+ and their server outtages
---
TiDi for days!
---
If you don't have the need to be top DPS, roll a shammy and give healing a shot (resto shammies are quite sought after with their excellent group healing and utility) - if that doesn't stick, you can still go Enhancement. There's 1-2 spots for Enh in most raids due to the added DPS they bring via imp. WF/Str totems and (later) Nightfall debuffing, as well as tons of utility. They are fun in pvp, tackle any dungeons/open world stuff very well and are quite versatile.
---
I would never take improved curse of weakness, I frankly don't know what encounters will ever warrent it. Improved Drain Soul is great while farming but pretty insignificant in raids and PvP, and the one point in fel concentration seems kind of random. For pure PvE content, drain soul is the best because it is the only relevant one and might help you to some tiny, tiny degree with trash clearspeed. 
---
I don't know, I personally went 3 points into improved curse of exhaustion because that is a huge boost for kiting.
---
lol I get 150-200 honor for solo ganking.
---
It's so cringey that it seems staged to me. I'm not convinced it is, and I have no evidence, but doesn't it seem too obviously drunk-on-power for a young guy that grew up on the internet and knows how this type of thing will get you cancelled?
---

i'll do whatever the fuck i want you stupid faggot

MMO's are always having people unsub. Did your friends leave because of lag?

Thats the joke
---
Superior effort, 10/10
---
For real. Holy Paladin is the bread and butter of tank healing and raid buffs, and they’re not bad in dungeons either.
---
&gt; Imma say it's either your ISP or your computer not up to par.
---
this is idiotic, many many people have reported issues with extreme lag in these fights, myself included, my internet connection is 300/150 and my pc is certainly up to par.
---
Nope, I just skip the improved weakness/drain soul: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZxx0tMbz
---
Fel concentration is better in PvP, but skipping max suppression is a bad pick for raids because you really don't want to deal with resists on your assigned curse/corruption.

According to ShadowPanther, stick with the Mass of McGowan.

---
How is he in the wrong? It's an upgrade for him, for his MAIN SPEC, and that's all that matters when you press need. I've played this game since TBC, and in my opinion, he did nothing wrong. In fact, it could very well be that the dagger offers a bigger boost to mob time-to-kill of a dagger rogue than any caster, compared to a generic green weapon of slightly lower level.

---
Lmao
---
But, how many deaths before this first kill, sir?
---
OK MILENNIAL!
---
If you're such an expert, can you explain what is actually happening then?
---
It's a fact that on private servers I could use third-party software to literally teleport myself around WSG without instantly getting banned. Some servers had more checks than others (i.e. not being able to teleport directly between flags), but I was almost always able to use that software to teleport 10 yards forward everytime I pressed a hotkey (I guess anything less than Blink range worked, but without any cooldown).  Another fact for you - some people even managed to figure out how to spam boss spells like Hand of Death (https://www.wowhead.com/spell=35354/hand-of-death) in to instantly wipe the opposing faction, also without instantly being banned. 
---
Clearly that's not the case on the official Blizzard servers.  More advanced checks for all players (i.e. if this person did just teleport X yards, was it because they used a spell? Do they have access to that spell as a class? Do they have access to that spell via their spec, or an item they have? Was it off cooldoen? Was it 10 yards in the XY plane, or was there movement in the Z plane? Did they jump before casting it? What does the terrain gradient look like when they casted it?)
---
Infosec analyst who doesn't understand what's he's talking about and only tries to spout nonsense as facts. Cute.
---
My gf just smiles and nods
---
When you’re undead and you eat their corpse
---
the addons is just chat parsers, if he didn't say LFG strat UD in any of the chat he shouldn't show up in any of them either. Most of the random whisper spam is just from "/who undercity 60 warrior" and ppl just whisper all the 60 warrior/druid/paladin in whatever zone and level range they choose.
---
Seemed relatively fine on Sulfuras NA PvP. With over 100 on each side my animations were like half a second too late, but the inputs went in on time it seemed. Good enough for mass world PvP for me
---
*whisper* desolace
---
/s? If a tank isn’t actively participating in the LFG chat, or if you have no prior relationship with said tank, why would you assume they would want to run some random dungeon you need?
---
You don't lose durability when killed, but getting hit still damages your gear.
---
Yeah, definitely SexyMaps. OP even forgot to remove the green square.
---
I wonder if the servers can even handle an 40v40 clash in field of strife.
---
 **Asmongold** is a failure at wow at all.
---
The player that kicked you should've given you more guidance.  
---
There was a Warrior in Uldaman last night that had never tanked.  The group offered guidance to the player and was very patient with them.  Observing the tank adapt and become better as we crawled our way through was very fulfilling.
---
In the end, we couldn't kill Archaedas (we tried 3 times) due to dps being so low and most of their spells/shots being resisted/missing, but it was still the best Uldaman run I've had.
---
This is how it starts 
---
Weak memes starting first with one, and then overwhelming until eventually the whole subreddit is overwhelmed
---
Yes, also worked 15 years ago and is usually much more efficient than LFG.
---
If they are not interested they just ignore it.
---
If they wanna join, they got a group before even looking for it.
---
It's a win win situation
---
Same my buddy stopped at lvl 20 now im 41 and tonight will be my first log in since phase 2 started....yay?
---
I want my 2nd char to be warlock so bad but I love the shaman class as a whole so much. Even though I prefer TBC to classic shaman.
---
Bloodfang feels pretty 50/50, but Horde here so perhaps I'm biased without realizing it. Haven't had to que in there myself at all though, and last night there was a lot of open world action.
---
I believe OP had a typo and meant to say "heal me/smite other"
---
I totally agree
---
this is what proper gear looks like. not your black acid green glowing skull flying flame wing shoulderpads with legs
---
I tried it as soon as i hit 60 (wel, a couple of scholo/strat run after that) but I had to go back to full feral / omen of clarity. The problem was not the threat generated but the fact that in restoration I was going to be oom too fast. Is there a reference about which stats should I get before thinking about that spec?
---
I will not do any raid (don't have the people) and would like to be able to just switch equip and heal sometimes.
---
Atleast you can die. Flamelash was just 300 horde in every zone with 0 alliance.
---
Since level one? Or since honor kicked in? I prefer not to answer the first question, but the answer to the second one i zero. Got this kill a few seconds after 20:00, the fighting had already begun in small scale, and this lucky fellow became my first official honorable kill :)
---
It's the truth though.
---
If you are gonna do one run with us and its a pug. You getting 4 stacks.
---
It's not fun, it's a gear grind.  Except these mobs whine when you kill them.
---
The game is so widely different then it was I am pretty sure Blizzard fucked this up on purpose so they can get that inevitable see we told you, you didn't stab in.
---
Don't forget that wow classic is no more than a cash cow to squeeze on the last years of wow, I don't think that is realistic to expect development or infrastructure on a 15 years old game when high end content is done only by a minute minority of playerbase
---
Speak for yourself dipshit, wpvp is the purest form of pvp
---
Yes! It the same concept as bullying. You feel good because it sucks for someone else. 
---
Ironically the new system is called "honor" system. When there is usually nothing honorable about the kills that you collect.
---

You can't even spell portrayed, but I am supposed to believe you are an expert at anything?
---
Stop this nonsense. 
---
Just because someone swears doesn't mean they are "mad". Its a childish, moronic attempt at dismissing someone. Just brand them "mad" to discredit them. 
---
Its banal and stupid and you have absolutely no clue about the mental state of a person you don't know based on a couple of sentences.
---
None of those things are true for any Nost-core server.
---
As a dps warrior, I have tanked some dungeons from people whispering me. Namely love strat, because then I get the first orb and no one complains about my shitty dps tanking.
---
They also can't be beat heal sniping the raid with fol top up.  Also can't be beat in endurance in later gear sets.  Absolute monsters.
---
Wars rage across Hillsbrad. Azuregos and Kazzak have spawn and died to several servers. But these guys? They have a this....
---
I am a druid tank, and i have a similar problem, i run in, feral change and demo roar to get the aggro of the mobs, before i m doing feral charge, i already see a dps casting something before i pull, so i do this :he pulls aggro and screams tank get aggro, i let the mob kill him, he complains that i didnt pick the mob up and died because od it, and i say, next time, dont dps before the tanks gets the mobs.
---
Sometimes let the dps die, is not a bad thing, repair costs and consumables etc etc.
---
Lost HOJ on my warrior to a druid who joined as our healer. Said "what Im feral" after winning. Ill probably not see it again
---
Even inside Molten Core, 1/4 of our raid members were lagging out so bad, we barely managed to get to Golemagg.
---
If you have a 60, you should not waste your time farming low level mats unless they are extremely expensive. You can make what, maybe 2g per hour mining copper and tin when you could do Mara for an hour and get 50g to just buy all the mats through iron.
---
OMG THE CRINGE
---
that server is so dead it’s not even funny
---
My highest levels are a 35, 29, and 20
---
Lvl 50 priest here - respecced to holy/disc so that I might get a spot for brd arena runs. But yeah, stopped believing in that. So I‘m stuck with zf and maraudon. 
---
Hopefully I can get a spot in a sunken temple group, since I haven‘t been there countless times yet and I think there are some items I could use at least. 
---
All of us 50+/- need to stick together during these tough times. :D
---
According to some poster a few days ago memes are "the lifeblood of internet". 
---
Apparently this is the world we're living in now.
---
Yep I feel the exact same way, I’m so disappointed. I knew it would be bad, but I played for 3 hours and didn’t get a single 1v1 fight. There was 10 horde outside everlook in winterspring so we started to battle, it was pretty even for 15 mins. All of a sudden 10 horde turn up, then another 10 etc.
---
All of a sudden it’s 50vs10 and we have to try and excape to hearth. The horde have so many people there that they just tank the guards in the town and keep killing us. 
---
The worst part is that we only went to WS because EPL had 2 raids full of horde camping the flight path. Literally fucking unplayable. 
---
I’ll give it a week or 2 and if it doesn’t get better I’m just going to drop my subscription. I’ve almost got full phase 2 BIS already so not much to do on the PvE side of things...
---
So i got over 2500 hk yesterday. Method used as we were typically 50-75 ally vs over 150 horde was to stay in SS town and force them to spawn guards. Eventually they would bottle us into the town hall or Inn and like idiots start getting those DHKs and slammed them with many elite 60 guards
---
Easy on the warcrimes, buddy!
---
It's not that we have less interest in PvP.  It's that 4v1 is more appealing that 1v4 when all you need to do is farm kills.
---
Warriors are only as good as who's behind them.  If people push in behind them and commit you'll slaughter but in mass pvp no one wants to commit fully. It's hard to get that many people organized.
---
What? Most people do Runecloth to get exalted. 
---
He honestly just added 6k/9k rep to turn in. Which is another 150 or so stacks.
---
It's not much extra considering through revered and exalted needs like 660 stacks snywsy
---
Hey guys, I'm currently a 57 Spriest and since honour was released I'm having a real had time questing at all. 
---
End game I wanna heal but levelling is real slow right now. Will I be able to respec now and start healing end game dungeons to level and get my pre-raid bis or am I too low still?
---
I hope this gives you a full ban from Reddit, it's truly classless to take a joke about a game, go through someone's history, and make a personal attack against them.
---
No, it resets after a "short period" which some people say is the day reset.
---
You play retail?  I've heard of your kind.
---
If you're one of the few who have it, you can charge ridiculous amounts of money to enchant it. That 1000 gold investment could easily turn into a profit within a couple of days.
---
True, nothing to do with getting gangbanged.  Shower thought, horde is ez mode PvP for people who can't win 1v1 battles.
---
I don’t have a 60, but the warlock will likely be my first 60. Druid is the only char I have with mining high enough to farm reliably.
---
Thanks for the answer, but I was asking about the PvE servers (Mirage Raceway, Pyrewood Village, Hydrazian Waterlords and Nethergarde Keep).
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers
---
Wow. An actual legit unplayable.
---
Is this based off raw damage? Because Thrash Blade is a lot better than anything pre bis for MH if youre specced in sword spec in combat
---
I played for about two weeks but... it turned out for me that a lot of Classic was better left to my misty-eyed nostalgic memory. I went back to playing BFA and went “oh my god, this is so much better”. 
---
The quality of life changes over 15 years are pretty amazing, lol. 
---
Having classes and specs trapped in a space in time really sucked, because a lot of specs are just bad. 
---
I played a Paladin in 2004, Day 1 player. But the difference was... back then I didn’t KNOW Paladins sucked. Lol. I was just playing what I had and enjoying it.
---
Went to winter spring: 35 horde camping flight path. Got in city, around 20 horde there killing in the city.
---
Went to WPL: 95 horde at Chillwind camp. 2 20 man death balls roaming the raids.
---
Went to EPL: 30 at lights hope with at least 4 groups of 20 roaming roads.
---
Went to southshore, game became slideshow. AoEd to death by flight master. 
---
Found a nice location with farming horde and killed some of them. Got ganked and camped by a 15 and 25 man squad that showed up in azshara.
---
Stormwind was getting raided, big fights at lights hope and outisde MC. Hehe suckers I will go to felwood, no one is ever there. I fly there and literally 20 meters from flightpoint I see 50 alliances and about 100 hordes running too me.
---
There is literally no place where you can hide now lol
---

sapper ?

Fear to force WoF &gt; Sac Void &gt; Deadcoil &gt; Fear &gt; dot &gt; dot &gt; dot &gt;Fear &gt; Dead
---
Sure man, BRE is **"a lot better"** then Sufluras for pvp. You have it all figured out, and other people's opinions are useless because you KNOW.  
---
In Pvp when you connect with someone you usually kill him in a matter of seconds, rendering the BRE proc useless in most cases (the PPM of BRE is 1.93 which is great but doesn't make up for the dmg range increase + dmg proc of sulfuras).  
---
BRE is definitely not "BETTER". Sulfuras gets a lot of hate because of the mats farming it requires.   
---
The only weapon "a lot better" then sulfuras for pvp is MOM.  
---
BRE is easier to get and thus clueless people not willing to make the effort recommend to use it over Sulfuras.
---
It makes no sence that some sweaty neckbeard in France managed to get better servers than a multi billion dollar company. Stop shilling, Blizzard doesnt care about you at all
---
And he had a team behind him to play while he slept.  It's a total cheat.
---
Just because reddit people make shit up does not make it actually true you know?
---
&gt; holy priest are one of the rare spec that you pick your deepest talent.
---
I think you mean "don't pick our deepest talent".
---
by ignoring private servers ever existed and downvoting any mention of them just like 90% of this subreddit
---
You’re not wrong, its about 15 mins before ony, i just hadn’t seen this amount of people even before ony buff until they removed layering a few days ago
---
Cloth armor is the cheapest to repair I think; Then leather, then mail, then plate.
---
It is better
---
Is it?  I feel bad for you.
---
meh, tried to roll in a less than 10 man group and it was a bit better than slacking southshore but it was pretty trash still. People we encountered were either less than 3 or more than 30. We had like one good fight against a 8 man unit that were just scooting for 25 man.
---
Yes 100% without a doubt. If youre combat specced and have points in sword specializiation. Yes yes yes. Thrash is OP as fuck before you get purples
---
Less checks and balances behind the scenes, they didnt log and check and detect everything Blizz does at all times, they only did a fraction of what blizz does constantly.
---
Nice thought. But if someone says orgy, he'll also get invited.
---
The Kobold was also nice enough to give me some copper too!
---
no they will not.
---
Lol
---
Classic WoW = Mage blizzard
---
Dhks don't matter at all in the first week
---
In five years we will hear about how he created a cult too.
---
Because they did a ton less stuff than Blizzard servers are doing. There is a lot more security, anti-hacks, and that kind of stuff that requires cpu time and network bandwidth running on official servers compared to private servers. Private servers were exploitable and less reliable overall. All this comes at an extra cost.
---
My Details damage meter malfunctions every time there's another hunter in my group.  It doesn't work, doesn't track any data at all.  Does anybody have any ideas on how to fix it?
---
Noggenfogger is by census and wlogs one of the worst balanced realms in favor of the horde. Take a look in their official discord and you can see both factions confirming that
---
Ok boomer.
---
This is sad but true. PvP last night on Flamelash was just 300 horde steamrolling every zone, we have to keep running around just to find 1 ally.
---
I hope they would offer paid faction change to alliance, i would fucking pay for that in a heartbeat so i could actually have someone to kill.
---
'....yes you fucking idiot'
---
'No guys really, he's not mad'
---
Its not rough. On my rogue i could only handle 1 mob at a time while lvling. Got a 6 warlock i just started with, i can easily pull 5 mobs, dot, imp atk and wand its so faceroll
---
So, this is the highly requested world pvp? Such skill required, i'm impressed.
---
Obviously it would be great if there wasn’t lag and if there is something bliz can do they absolutely should. But Are there any games that can support a 300 vs 300 battle?
---
This has been my experience all day yesterday. You kill a few Horde then suddenly you're fighting 40-80 of them. I clearly picked the wrong faction because Horde was mopping up everywhere we went to PvP. Yet when I hearth back to Ironforge its completely full of Alliance just AFKing and having mount parades. Seems my faction is softer than charmin.
---
you're right but this bullshit isn't really making a compelling argument for scalability
---
Ask yourself would you lay down the money if you were in the higher up. I would from a common perspective but they don’t care about the small minority of the playerbase
---
if you break it down it's marginally better in the current phase. can't forget int provides some fraction of crit
---
Is every player out there a streamer these days?
---
Yeah see ya
---
The reinforcement thing is what really pissed me off. I went to 4 fucking zones to try and find something that wasn’t being corpse camped at the flight path. Winter spring is decent, there’s maybe 10 horde outside the town but there’s 6 or 7 alliance there fighting. Pretty good.
---
There for 15 mins, all of a sudden 10 more horde get summoned in. Then another 10 horde, then another 10 horde. Now it’s 40v8 again just like every fucking other zone and I just hearthed to IF when I could finally get 8 seconds alive.
---
As I’m logging off i see in trade chat that a horde raid is outside IF killing people. What an absolute cluster fuck, this isn’t how vanilla was.
---
Edited was harsh
---
I wonder if all those times you get 1 CP are actually 0 CP kills since I've never seen 0 CP displayed even though I'm sure I killed some people 5+ times.
---
I also assume that this also counts if anyone in the raid kills someone, ie if someone died 5 times while someone from your raid tagged him you aren't going to get anything?
---
Because as the developers have said multiple times, the code of wow is so intrinsically sandwiched together and on top of each other, that one change made could sometimes cause a major bug in underlying code. Changing the code of that size with that much change would require a top to bottom thorough cleanup of the entire code wow is based on. This would take forever even if they didn't have bureaucratic obligations to follow. With the company processes it would take even longer, and then you have to go through testing and alpha and then beta until finally releasing this new code. Before you say "we wouldntt need testing" i can tell you, all of the people begging for a code rewrite would be the FIRST to come crying to the forums if there were bugs after they did this.
---
I wish i could comment on the relativeness of battle sizes and lag but i didnt play vanilla. From what i have seen, it appears this lag was always here (Source being plenty of classic videos and images), but people attributed it to shitty computers, or incredibly slow internet speeds rather than servers being unable to handle battles of that size.
---
There is no mmo right now that can handle battles of upwards of 50 vs 50. Especially ones like wow, with each character having a multitude of different options for abilities to cast or use.
---
I have no problems with reserves as long as they make sense.
---
You the government?
---
Okay thank you. I feel pretty dumb now. Would you recommend farming up the gold for Sword of Zeal or Krol Blade? Otherwise, I will enchant both with crusader.
---
They were laggy af, too.
---
I don't pop evasion vs warriors, that's a noob move.
---
We were steamrolling horde all last night benediction hillsbrad
---
Did your parents not love you or something?
---
I think your info is wrong. Hunters were not the most played in Vanilla. Raids dont really need them and basically after t1 you are all set. If on the other hand you count the bots and gold sellers that were running hunters simply because they were the best farmers no matter what then probably.
---
I think he's trolling
---
It has only one exit, doesn't it?
---
Ignoring mage's ability to teleport...
---
Dude got me into playing poker, what a legend.
---
I'd put that money towards epic mount first - that'll make a bigger difference in your gameplay than an epic chest piece.
---
Which has been the problem from the start, the hordes park their toons in front of the entrance and alliance never fights back.
---
If you have the gold just slap crusader on both depending. Then get the swords i mentioned before from mc and ony.
---
This is what happens if you allow people to turn a minor faction imbalance into a colossal issue because people rather instantly transfer off the realm (of course TO a realm where Alliance outnumbers Horde). They should have had faction based transfers right from the start, then we wouldn't be in this situation.
---
As someone stated was classic promising everyone world scale pvp of 200+
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 20 warlock in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 2 fucking viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 20 with warlock. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
Kinda feels like the same game bro
---
For the Horde!
---
Or is he?
---
Right, if they release the bgs too soon it will ruin world pvp. i bet a lot of people with quit then since it's the main focus of the game for the next while.
---
You did it you madlad.
---
Umm you're clueless. Yes we are lagging cause it's checking were not teleporting. LOL
---
Spell reflect as an ability isn't even in classic. The only spell reflects are the engineering trinkets and eventually the ZG flask.
---
There's a reason plate classes can wear leather/mail, it's a trade-off.
---
You can get those reps in p3 in av as well, unless for some reason you really need to get your cross-racial mount now.
---
On my Paladin (human, +10% rep racial) I am now at \~13k/21k Stormwind and revered or atleast almost revered with all 3 other factions as well, without ever turning in any additional runecloth, just by questing. Horde side has even more imbalanced faction quests as most of their quests are for the orgrimmar faction. I levelled an orc hunter on a pserver once where I ended up with \~15/21k orgrimmar after hitting 60.
---
You should create your own server infrastructure. If you were really long forward to 300v300 the most, then you would know its going to be laggy. Luckily the vast majority of people dont pvp that way and it works just fine.
---
You know I thought I'd be the same, but it's very satisfying to grind your prebis and getting exp to boot! 
---
It does take around 5 corpseruns to get into the instance though :P
---
You could have tried to make it less obvious, that you're a butthurt alliance hahah
---
Nice, now get 420 dk’s
---
Perfect. New place to camp
---
Not understanding itemization is not against TOS.  As others have said, it's just stockades man.
---
I'm a lvl 50 human, combat swords, i have thrash blade, most of the gear from Mara including the ring. 
---
What should my next gear goals be at this point?
---
You can do that in real life as well
---
&gt;so there's little to lose now
---
There's nothing to lose this week.
---
Mass pvp has ALWAYS been shit. I distinctly remember in vanilla we once had a guild vs guild battle in a remote location each bringing a 40 man raid and it was completely unplayable.
---
I see you are a man of high class.
---
List of addonS?
---
It’s not a bug lmao, if it was normalized it would be a severe nerf. #nochanges.
---
Laughs at pve scrub\*
---
\&gt;this is unacceptable!
---
\&gt;continues to pay monthly
---
No,
---
Combat does the best in raids
---
I’m lagging just looking at this picture.
---
Rogue is the only reason I play this game :D
---
I agree too. Our so called "balanced server" seems like we have more griefers than pvpers. Most of them just complain in general chat.
---
and the fact that you are humble about it makes it even more believable
---
He should also write less in subjunctive mood. Turns off people.
---
What do you think of faction transfers? All my friends would pay money to get on the low side so we can actually pvp.
---
How do you get crit on both?
---
Get out of here with your rational arguments and sensible tone!! \**fetches pitchfork and rallies the crowds*\*
---
But more seriously, I think your post is pretty close to the truth. Regardless of how it is received on here.
---
I mean, how do you expect people to fill groups if we can't ask for tanks?
---
Judging by some of these comments (not yours) people are apparantly harmed by getting asked a question. If you play a class/role that's high in demand, you know these things will happen.
---
Btw, not saying you HAVE to respond to these, I understand you probably get a lot of these. Just a general response to anyone who feels harmed by these messages or who put people on ignore list for this.
---
Oh, sure. Even if it's solely for the benefit of anti-cheat it's a good thing, I don't think anyone is claiming otherwise.  
---
But IMHO that's not really the point of threads like this one. It's about the experience of gameplay during the mass-events, and the always upcoming comparison against Pservers.  
---
This is where the "defense" of advanced logs is always brought up. And if it's really the sole reason for the performance disparity vs. Pservers, it _does_ provide a worse experience for some people playing the game _right now_.
---
Can you use it safely or is it against the TOS mate?
---
Gunna make that my ringtone
---
Spy - it's ridiculous isn't it?
---
My only question I guess is am I the only one who finds it ridiculous? It's so OP. Negates any need for situational awareness, any point in hiding behind terrain etc
---
Healing power first.
---
Spirit stat bonus second.
---
Talent multiplier third.
---
Crit multiplier last.
---
It’s as if phone pics are a new form of art to trolling.
---
The cokes-
---
Warlock is probably the easiest class to level with in the entire game, tho.
---
Team Languste
---
You usually only reserve items that have low chance anyway. HoJ and Rend MH only have a couple of % droprate. Running those even with reserves can take a billion of runs and spreading out the people who want it makes sense for everyone.
---
The caster loot in all the most common cases of reserving (HoJ, MH) drops a lot so casters feel fine about joining and competing with other casters.
---
the only reason for me to ever get that rep is ony buff need friendly with OG, warlock allready has the best looking mount in the game
---
This is what happens when people get what they ask for....
---
#nochanges...
---
What a surprise those changes were made for a good reason...
---
You kids made your bed, enjoy sleeping in it. I'll have fun on my normally populated PVE realm.
---
Private serves were an actual improvement. These official servers are nothing but embarrasing.
---
You mean videos from pservers that had more people at Azuregos running just fine?
---
That's when you  [show up](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Terry-Crews-Is-Not-Playing-On-Everybody-Hates-Chris.gif) at their inn.
---
everything red is 5g :&gt;
---
bought the mats for my epic mount for about 200g in p1
---
I don't see why not, if russians pull it off on their free servers blizzard should be able to pull it off too with everyone paying 15 dollars a month
---
On Mograine we had lag when landing from griffins
---
U had world pvp in phase 1, 10v1 is not world pvp (im a horde, so no, im not the one being camped)
---
PvP server. I don't even usually kill Alliance, but I can't feel sorry for you when every time I am minding my own business Allys start shit without provocation. Nobody is neutral.
---
It's safe, but some people still want it out.
---
People said private servers were capable to handle it. Dunno why these people pay money to play if private servers were better.
---
Buff, drink, buff, 0,1 seconds before you start drinking again tank pulls and puts you in combat with 10% mana.
---
Marxist communism, not authoritarian communism.
---
Its safe, it reads of the combat chat
---
He was like, damn guess it's time for WPL.
---
Can't it hamper / reduce the honor you should get from HKs this week? 
---
But yeah, my point was that if you're going to get some DHKs at all, this is the week to do it. Some guy earlier today posted that since he got 7 DHKs yesterday in a raid he "might as well uninstall". I told him that's probably the best solution.
---
But that's how layering works. Let me give you another example. Spell batching and Elemental Mastery
---
&gt; Your next Fire, Frost, or Nature damage spell has it's mana cost reduced by 100% and is guaranteed a critical strike. 
---
With spell batching you can cast Chain Lightning and a shock right after and they will likely be in the same batch and both be affected by Elemental Mastery so they will both crit. Is this also an exploit? It's clear that Elemental Mastery is suppose to work on ONE spell and not two but due to how spell batching works you can, if you will, exploit this. 
---
Imo, the system is there and working as intended for both layering and spell batching + Elemental Mastery so they could both be used in that way. Blizzard never said layer hopping is forbidden.
---
I have little knowledge on WoW or pServers specifically, but I'll explain what he's talking about in general.
---
When you attack, all you character stats, ability stats, weapon stats and buffs/debuffs all go through the math and then against your opponents numbers to calculate how much damage you do. Then you have all the math like are you in range, in sight, the right state, in AoE range, etc.
---
Whilst your client on your machine can do a lot of the calculations, the server knows all your details. It knows who you are, where you are, how strong you are, that your items are valid, etc. Essentially a client can say "I've done 500 damage to that dude" and the server can accept the client is telling the truth and move on, or the client can say "I cast this ability on that dude, who I think I'm allowed to attack" and then the server does all the calculations from top-to-bottom to prove it was a valid cast, calculates the damage done and tells the client "alright, you've done 501 damage!".
---
Blizzard has a lot more of a requirement to prove that every ability, item, movement, interaction, drop, etc is legit.
---
That sounds extremely server dependent...300 kills soloing is just not going to happen on my server (Herod). Every zone is full of 10+ man squads roaming. There's nobody you can kill solo.
---
That reply made no sense and reinforced my point.
---
Did you try to level a hunter to 10 without a pet?
---
They do say the most important thing is to be able to laugh at oneself.
---
At this point I just dont know what my buddies and I really plan to do a lot of. If we start heavily going in to dungeons and raids I'll likely go deeper prot, if we pvp ill prob go arms/fury but I like the idea right now of doing some kind of hybrid if I'm doing a mix of both and playing solo a lot. Appreciate the input!
---
Wpvp is great when it's organic encounters this just reminds me of playing fucking ashran in retail.
---
Get some levels then start running BRD, there are a couple prebis pieces in there. The boots/neck from the end and the coveted HoJ as well.
---
because they weren't
---
Welcome to group pvp in 2019.
---
And people wonder why there’s massive lag, as they have 80% of the raid just spamming Blizzard or rain of fire.
---
You get paid to represent a company....
---
I had 0 issues with lag yesterday in hillsbrad where other people I was playing with did. They also said turning down their settings fixed it and my computer is brand new, just built. 
---
There are probably server issues too of course, but I think a lot of people's complaints can be addressed by lowering settings in those huge fights.
---
That won't happen. Retail's ability lag in certain zones at certain times is catastrophically bad. According to blue posts, Blizzard knows about the problems for well over a year now, but couldn't figure a solution out yet.
---
Pretty sad if you think Blizzard isn't running regular, if not constant, verifications on player movement.
---
Ofc. ^ ^
---
More appropriate title:  yup that's me, now you're probably wondering how i got here.
---
Completely agree with this.
---
The arguments that many people use in this discussion are often invalid. Comparing with other games, with private servers, that's comparing apples to oranges. You can even argue that large scale world pvp was never a core feature of the game, but rather something that's possible (and obviously desirable by part of the player base).
---
But I don't see how Blizzard then imagined the interaction with world bosses, especially if they increased the number of players per server.
---
I wonder how many times this quote will be used before becoming old. That guy, though, that guy..
---
Not really. I’m a pretty cool guy unless you are a total asshole in which case I’m likely to call you out.
---
people with 10 iq that likes to watch blizzard's sfx for hours.
---
PVE servers give you the option to pick your fights without having to roll rogue.
---
So much better.
---
I'm not natisocial but when you're to lazy to fly to kargath, at the very fucking least have 2 people ready to click ma portal
---
most people just want me to search for 2 other dudes to get their lazy ass somewhere for a 1g tip, that's ridiculous to request
---
in conclusion any stranger who randomly whispers me for port is someone I will never want to play with
---
Whispering so he doesn't want Mommy and Daddy lol
---
oh those kazzak shenanigans
---
Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done about it. I use it because im not going to play at a disadvantage, but I wish it didn't exist.
---
Every. Damn. Time.
---
I started including It when i say I'll buff. "Need to drink buff AND drink again".
---
It's over 11 years old with other addons before it. No one will care once BGs are released.
---
That's why I never join pugs with anything reserved. The entitlement of these man children is outrageous.
---
Dumbass
---
That is interesting, I feel this sub suffers as most do from the loudest minority mindset. All we see is bad news, when actually its not all bad?
---
Even if this is the case its a pretty terrible excuse as Blizz has almost infinitely more resources than the private server teams. The fact is that Blizz is shipping a product they know wont work, hoping that the consumers doesnt complain too loud.
---
One thing you might be overlooking (but maybe not sorry to presume) is that he isn't limited to ~40 hours/week. He could stream 10-14 hours a day 6-7 days a week for like an ~80 hour work week, even making like $400- 500$ a week would easily be enough to live where I am, and you would get to play wow all day.
---
Only rogues seem to care, they hate that they cant run 30 yards behind someone and stealth without the addons calling out stealth in combat log range.
---
This should be Blizzards #1 issue to fix atm. And also time for a bluepost regarding the issue. We need to know what they're doing to fix it (if its possible at all).
---
Can't really knock a player that follows through, but you can knock one that drops a 34 as a 60, that's just unbecoming.
---
If you are a warrior alone lvling, you are just fu\*\*\*ed :D
---
Make yourself a warrior friend or other dps friend who can’t self heal. We will love you and you will love us. Doesn’t help against the high level spanking, but the buddy system does help deter a lot of potential antagonists.
---
&gt; It stands to reason that since griefing your own faction has no counter play, that it simply was not intended to happen. 
---
Running around on characters during same faction duels has no "counter play" either. Doesn't mean it "wasn't intended" or is punishable. At the most you get told off and a GM teleports you, at their discretion. I'd love you to find some evidence of anyone, *ever*, getting banned for lvl 1 griefing on Kazzak. 
---
OP linked to some 2005 post as if that's got any remote relevance today. Guess what, the TOS have changed. A GM even said that cross-faction collusion is no longer an offense: 
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/VflcJxT](https://imgur.com/a/VflcJxT) 
---
Guess why? It's not realistically enforceable. 
---
&gt;How would you have responded if your faction prevented you from killing the boss? 
---
Not cry about it the strangers on the internet and try again next time. Probably collude with a guild from the other faction, which we know now is okay, to kill griefers. 
---
&gt; Same faction griefing is not the height of gaming. It's the lowest low of gaming. 
---
If you think something as trivial as this is "the lowest low" of gaming, you haven't seen very much.
---
Don't bother replying, there will be no convincing you. I'm not saying it's a good thing, I'm just saying it's stupid to whine about Blizzard not banning people for it on Reddit when everyone knew exactly what was always going to happen on day 1, and everyone also knows that Blizzard don't give a solitary shit, sorry to burst all your bubbles. Instead of whining about it, do something. Form alliances with the enemy or something.
---
Same. Me and my warrior friend Got jumped by a better geared war/SP and we burned down the SP but the warrior got him then me. Ankh into FS was all it took to get the HK.
---
This is amazing
---
Morning pugs are great too.
---
I guess I can't say that because I'm only going by my own personal experience, however I can report that my experience was damn near flawless with several full raid groups on each side.
---
I check the market quite a bit but have only saw it being sold once for the same price as a Krol Blade on my server. I will keep an eye out for it. Thank you for your reply.
---
Same in the opposite faction, was in gadgetzan and it was something like 30 horde and 10/15 allys running for their life and getting farmed for 30mn. Then an alliance raid arrived with 40 ally in mc/guild group and started farming the horde.
---
And it was the opposite in other region, stonard got attacked, not horde their, suddenly 100 + horre and no more attack
---
Wpvp is pretry much gank or get ganked
---
Hmm ok... I thought you couldnt ''drop'' an item and make it available for people who join afterwards, thanks
---
Because 60v60 is the same as 300v300.
---
This narrative is getting tiresome. 
---
I highly respect the work done by the community on the wow vanilla server core. Reverse ingeneer wow server is amazing and require a lot of skills. If you take the time to check the github repo you can see that this is years of work with a lot of contributor.
---
Stating that blizzard can fix this in no time is so naive. Usually you are better off with few high skilled IT scientist  than having 100 'normal' people working on those kind of issue.
---
I wouldn't be surprise that those contributor are really brilliant IT ingeneer which skill can be compared to what blizzard have at their disposal.
---
Open source contributor are some of the best IT scientist I had the chance to exchange with.
---
To be clear : blizzards QOS is shit but it's hardly comparable with what pservers had to do.
---
Nice.
---
It was so cool man
---
I did it for a couple hours before raid, then 3 hours after leaving I came back and it was like I'd never left.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Nice!
---
He paid the gold back and that was it. His viewership increased five-fold and he made a big fuck you reddit video. He only benefited from this scenario. So to me nothing of negative consequences happened to him don’t tell me I’m spreading misinformation
---
The stoneform shoulders from scholomance share the same model and its plate.
---
Is P3 coming out in a couple weeks?
---
I wonder what would be the least contested area to level/quest in for level 50+ ?
---
I'm sure you'll be fine. Mages are good at getting away.
---
Yikes... I don't think you are helping yourself any dude....
---
You stole my comment
---
Agree, on gehennas only 1 guy had it and charged 15g fee and every1 needed to get the enchant since its bis for several classes, he surely got ALOT of gold, my entire guild went to him to get that enchant and im betting several others
---
I mean if classic is unplayable it increases the odds of people going to retail.
---
Blazin’
---
But... unless you healed him you are not in combat :D
---
If you have any BRD quests left, respec to a healing spec of your choice, stock up some mana potions for safety's sake and find a group for it. Do a full run to clear them all, get the Save the Princess done simultaneously, run some Arena/Anger/Golem runs for that elusive freaking trinket (I'm starting to think the boss only drop Omnicast boots and those leather pants) and grind LBRS / DM:E for quests and drops. At 58+ you can heal any of the end-game dungeons, provided your gear and skill are decent. 
---
Some groups can be picky with level, so playing with friends and guildies helps.
---
Actionbars?
---
To quote someone else in this thread "dps made their bed with their bad habits and not caring about tanks gameplay or qol. Lay in it."
---
Every single time I see hunters with those I die a little inside. Hope to god they didn't win them over a rogue or warrior etc
---
Cries in 32 as mage
---
Might aswell pay 2 usd for every login instead of subscribing
---
If you're referring to VanosKoS, you can use it on the opposite faction as well! I put an opposite faction member on my nicelist (I am on RP server though so no WPVP)
---
Haha sorry, i mean it's extremely rare ! (If u were talking about the eternal darknesss one)
---
He's right though. Just adding more hardware won't automatically solve the problem. If the software is not able to use the extra hardware (or not efficiently anyway), then adding hardware won't do much.
---
&gt; I'm yet to try PvP, but have high hopes of pissing people off with fear, void shield and seduce. 
---
\*Laughs in undead\*
---
LOL, who knew Mages made such great pavement?
---
People actually proud of what they do in Wow? I ve done top 10 raiding a couple of times, or got gladiator titles, or went diamond/ challenger/ rank 1 in other games but its not nearly as fun as grinding with friends. People should take a step back and start enjoying games again. Thats why i own a switch as well....best fun ive had in years
---
You just need to bring more people. On Shazzrah Kazzak died because he didn't do his heal/shadowbolt volley even once when people had 7000ms.
---
Oh really? Does that lead to full on 150 vs 150 fights or are the maps big enough to have spread pvp battles.
---
Also more than %30 of quests were broken :D
---
seeing a lag fest of 100s of people is fun once or twice, then it becomes something you quit over or avoid entirely
---
Sending whispers is rude now?
---
Best I can do is a Renew.
---
Any time I read faction balance whines and the obligatory "isn't playable" I really want to wash all the sand from these really dried out vaginas.
---
Since honor kicked in :) In that case.. gratz! :)
---
I find it annoying when people got a question and just write "?", and then it's my job figuring out what they are wondering about. Such a unnecessarily difficult way to start a conversation. 
---
That said, the guy in your situation was definitely an asshole, throwing insullts like that over just a question.
---
then ban AH addons since it's basically spy for auctions, ban multiboxing too since that also gives a huge advantage
---
The double standards with flipping out on spy are so damn high but other broken addons remain ignored :DDDDDD.
---
This is a fair point. The hardware is likely the primary source of the issue, but you are correct, just slapping in more and/or better hardware isn't going to solve the problem (might help a little, but not noticeably). You need the hardware and to update the software to better utilize that new hardware, and that doesn't even address the potential coding issues within the software that may have to be addressed to see any significant performance upgrade.
---
You realize tanks can get weapons that no other DPS wants to use, like eshkandar's or QS, that provide more than enough threat? MC weapons are precious and you want to prio them to DPS if possible. Onslaught yeah sure.
---
I haven't done any BRD quests yet! I have a fair amount of healing gear so I think I should be okay. I'll respec and get on it later! Thanks for your answer!
---
Because you think there were actually 600 people there...?
---
You can continue tanking at 60 in dungeons with an arms or fury dps build just fine. The points in prot are nice and talents like defiance really make that tree, but you definitely don't need points in prot, especially while you level. My guild asks me to tank on Sulfuron and Majordomo, and I just throw some tank gear on and do just fine with my fury dw dps build.
---
&gt;announcing people in stealth around you is a fucking joke
---
Beside that it doesnt ?
---
It shows when someone in your range actively goes into stealth by reading the combatlog.
---
IT DOES NOT DETECT ACTUAL STEALTH!!!
---
How hard is it to fact check this stuff before you form such a strong opinion.
---
Yea it’s a pretty bad addon. In most cases I’m a big proponent of addons but this one goes too far.
---
was on Atiesh last nite and not one bit of lag at the Tarren Mill attack...Horde had at least 3 raid teams defending and it sure looked like Alliance had many more....not one bit...it was fun
---
It was a completlete slaughter on Noggenfogger-EU, atleast when the server updated once every minute.
---
Not if 5 of them sapper at least
---
I have honestly seen more celebrities that are good role models than bad. Seeing as most of them are normal, decent humans.
---
A big problem when we see celebrities being upset is because of paparazzi. They're harassing celebrities constantly just to rile them up so they get video and pictures.
---
I will never fault someone for getting pissed at that.
---
Right? Go play another class. Warlocks suck. Wouldn't you like to have a nice shiny set of plate armor instead? Stay the hell away from my precious Robe of the Void recipe!!!!
---
Thank you kind stranger :) This was however 19 minutes before my ISP shut down my internet :(
---
How can you tell it will happen "at least once every day"??? Its still just guessing..
---
Hurd da furd
---
I really appriciate clean UI setups!
---
HOLY FUCK THE COPY PASTA WAS REAL
---
Fuck Southshore, they deserve this for that yeti quest.
---
This addon is absolute trash. It shouldn't even be in the game. No addon should negate a classes ability all together. If you can't play without it you fall into the first sentence as well. - random guy who mains a mage
---
Minecraft is probably the worst example you could've given next to pubg.
---
Well with horde disbalance in all server this is fucking normal...
---
Don't give, I am a 47 warrior and I will go to razorfen downs to solo elite trash in peace. I got so much rested xp from not being able to quest anyway.
---
That's a really weird comparison to make, are things okay at home?
---
I’m on stalagg, I spent a decent amount of time flying between zones today to watch the alliance get hunted like animals. Was honestly a little depressing.
---
Fer de herde
---
Pretty sure the answer is no, but I'm going to ask anyways.
---
If I have a horde character on a PVE realm, is there a way I can send gold to an Alliance char on the same realm?
---
Or can I put up some crappy item for a lot of gold and buy it off the neutral AH?
---
Pretty sure all the methods involve other player.
---
Take a look at all the “Tanking sucks” threads to understand why there are no tanks.
---
Onyxia loading screen?
---
gibt aber insgesamt mehr horde als allianz spieler weil viel mehr leute PVP als PVE server spielen und somit die allies es nicht ausgleichen können.
---
Agreed, STV yesterday I only saw one person that appeared as a skull, they still killed me but it's better than previous experiences where it seems every horde player is being escorted by bloodthirsty lvl 60s.
---
Are you guys simple? Really not picking up on the fact that he did this for attention and views? Look at all your guys comments, look at all the posts in this subreddit, everybody popping into his stream now to troll him.
---
People calling him dumb but he clearly out smarted y'all.
---
No changes?
---
Has nothing to do with difficulty but rng instead
---
Some Russians in their basements knew something Blizzard dont.
---
Imagine speaking about yourself like you're a god while you sit on ass behind a computer desk with a headset on. Guy doesn't look like he could lift a gallon of milk.
---
&gt; people who defend it and say it just reads you combat log are morons
---
No, they're just correct. That's literally what it does.
---
You can't just stop Spy working, hence they haven't. If it was as easy as flipping a big disable button they'd have done it **years ago**, but they can't, because to remove that functionality would break so many more addons it's not even worth it.
---
Is it good? No, but it's inevitable. Install it and suck it up. You're only gimping yourself by refusing to install it, which you're free to do.
---
So, I agree that rewriting the code, or even trying to optimize it, is likely outside of their willingness or ability to do. But consider this:
---
Private servers were able to handle huge scale pvp battles. Now, we've already talked about the reasons for this (basically, Blizzard checks a lot more data to keep things fair and prevent cheating) but what the private servers tell us is that the code is capable of handling larger scale battles. What needs to happen is those extra checks that Blizzard does (and trust me, they're important) to happen faster. And that, I doubt, is as difficult to adjust the coding for than for the entire base game. And that would benefit from better hardware.
---
Everything you just said is bullshit.
---
You made up 60%. Completely out of your ass. And you don't know anyone who cancelled a sub TODAY based on release day lag. Can you just not lie and start drama?
---
Yeah it's a bit odd. I don't understand why it's ok to have so much information provided to a player with no input from that user. In other games that sort of thing is sometimes a grey area as well but when it's as automated as Spy it's generally a no no
---
It reminded me of fleet warping in Eve Online
---
I have a friend that would take it and play L4D2 all night.  He would go from being okay at it to being a master at the game.  He would also be up 36+ hours at a time because of it lol
---
Private servers don't have nearly the same amount of stuff going on under the hood. Stop parroting shit you have no clue about please..
---
And also, SM LIB is not that hard to farm and get your dagger if you lost the roll the first time.
---
No problem, and yes - do that bloody BRD! You want your group to be 56 + (or 55.5++) since the final boss is 59. Reserve 3 hours for your first run, unless you have an experienced team. It's a long, gruelling dungeon, but lots of XP from the insane number of quests. You will likely do it a few times, but the other times you might only do partial runs or select routes, lava/Emp runs or the like.
---
The server lag in Hillsbrad last night was awful.
---
When's the last time Asmon ninja'd anything? He's been overly fair with loot in Classic.
---
^ this guy knows what's up
---
Your guild should be "Ace of Spades" :(
---
Quit then, better for you.
---
Ahaha, that's really original, wish I went with that!
---
Lol this, it's so funny, it usually comes from people who haven't actually used it and have just heard about it, so assume it places a fucking moving dot on your minimap.
---
It just becomes a game of "there's a stealthed player somewhere nearby" WHICH IS ALMOST ALL THE TIME IN WPVP
---
Yes?
---
40v40 AV or 40v20 city raid was the peak numbers for Vanilla PvP. Even in the massive events like pulling world bosses to stormwind there weren't 300 alliance in the City.
---
TukUi, Spy, Details, Decursive, Itemrack
---
Is that goodwill worth the investment cost. Probably not, and the 10% is a very kind number. Gut tells me less than 5% of server actually attend large scale pvp consistently like day in and day out. Sadly I don’t have evidence, but feel free to provide.
---
I know what an offhand is.
---
IQ10
---
&gt;since 60s will not go out of their way to kill you.
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
Yeah but in retail there’s always something to do
---
MH Brut blade 100%
---
There are other places to PvP, unless you want to grind, for a lvl 20-25 you have like 7 quests in ashenvales, 7 in stone talon and about 20 in hillsbrad ...
---
"I’m sorry to say that... no one’s *that* good."
---
So, I listen to the instance too, but I honestly do not think it’s the best way to participate in the classic wow community. Scott is pretty out of touch with WoW and will play some retail occasionally but he’s always like 6 months behind on doing things. Patrick doesn’t even play WoW, either version. Garret is really into classic, but he hasn’t been on as much lately because he’s been super busy, and when he is on Classic is still only getting like 20% of the airtime, max. 
---
I’m not trying to shit on the podcast. It’s entertaining, but it’s not really about Classic WoW.
---
Guess I’m just tired of the crying
---
Fuck off with that phrase. If you want to waste time chasing grays while others farm honor, you do you.
---
How does entering combat in a dungeon work? Occasionally I’m drinking/eating and a mob runs by me and puts me into combat but sometimes it doesn’t, what’s the deal?
---
Well actually each additional player increases load *quadratically* not exponentially. Each subsequent player's actions must be relayed to the n existing players, but n^2 is still polynomial time.
---
Got ~50 hks in about 10 minutes just by aoeing in Hillsbrad.
---
dw i wont give up i just try to hit 52 so i can respec healer and grind Dungeons :)
---
Actually the answer is yes, sort of
---
Go to a neutral AH on your alliance character.
---
Post any grey or white item on it at a ridiculously high price.
---
Alt over to your horde character and buy the item.
---
AH fees are higher on the neutral but you can pass a lot of gold between factions that way.
---
Cast Elemental Mastery.
---
Cast Chain Lightning.
---
Immediately cast Earth Shock.
---
Batching applies the buff to both spells.
---
how does multiboxing give advantage?
---
x good players communicating &gt; 1 multiboxer with x toons anytime of the day
---
That is a valid argument, and i can see that. But the Pserver's werent in some russian basement. They were outsourced to companies. Which is where i think the main problem lies, Blizzard will be under tight constraints to not buy or add new servers. Whereas with pservers those servers either worked or they didnt, if they did then they would stick with them. If they couldn't handle it they could just get new servers.
---
Is anyone here actually in favor of banning the whole guild?
---
Maybe not on your server but Illidan was an actual battleground
---
Everything from anti-cheat to stuff that can help identify performance issues etc. The game was never made for the amounts of people raiding against eachother and these logs are not the type any sane dev would disable.
---
It's kind of an old meme, still funny though!
---
But it's for lovers
---
Character boosts are disgusting. A big part of Classic is the work to get to 60 and therefor the identification with your character.
---
Everybody having every class at 60 doesn't mage things better but really annoying instead.
---
Send voidwalker in. Cast agony. Cast corruption. Maybe wand it. Re cast corruption as its about to fall off. Maybe wand it again.
---
You're a bloody legend mate. Just found a list for the quests... Its a good job I have nothing planned this weekend!
---
"You weren't there when all the laws were passed, so you can't possibly be a lawyer"
---
Username checks out.
---
Not hard on a low pop server. Not a ally in sight lol
---
Depending on what is cheaper go with that option. I bought Seal a few weeks ago after spending all my time in Ubrs to never get the MH and it was an amazing decision. The proc happens so frequently it’s almost always up. Also on my server zeal was 150g whereas Krol was 350-400.
---
Wow I have not thought of that ty.
---
Welcome to vanilla. It's as if you remembered it more fondly than it deserves.
---
15 years of blizzard devs talking and standard operating procedure for a largescale production environment.
---
In fairness the old athene was hilarious in his videos
---
The battle for Azuregos commenced shortly after this guy popped my cherry. Managed to get a few 100hks before the Alliance gave up (too easily imo). The numbers were quite even from what I could tell, so not sure why they bolted after 1 wipe :/
---
Anti-cheat and hack checks. Every action is double or triple checked against the servers data. Private servers never had these checks and were faster. Because of these checks theres tons more data to be processed.
---
I guess I can't speculate on that
---
What does a smart boy like yourself do to entertain yourself?
---
I'm not a rogue and I'm not a fan of the addon since I think it severely lowers the skillgap in worldpvp. Not that I necessarily want it removed, mind you.
---
Sulfuron, french server with 53/47 in horee favour I thnik. And with the removal of layers a 2300 / 2 hours queue
---
I was lagging in un’goro by while by myself yesterday
---
My guildy just got one. He must be rich as now, right?
---
same happened on Mirage raceway, awesome battles ebbing and flowing between Southshore and Tarrenmill. Brought back great memories!
---
Even if you just drop into the lava and “swim” straight into the wall below the window it will still teleport you, you don’t have to hit it mid air
---
I had to tell my friend hos to join lfg. He was like, ".....the fuck?"
---
That feel.
---
Rank 1 SW:P is your friend. Honestly the beginning of your rotation can just be rank 1 SW:P 5 times to get weaving up then fall into your normal rotation.
---
yeah this never happens in real life
---
You should understand what you're saying before you say it.
---

I rly like your UI... is all of that ElvUI? I dont recognize player frames.
---
/console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 3.5
---
What do you mean? Hundreds of thousands of people played on servers where large world PvP battles worked great. Why do we personally need to explain to blizzard, who had supposedly hired the best people in the world at this, how to do their jobs?
---
Suck Blizzards dick more with your 0 knowledge metaphors.
---
Moonkin Form has the armor bonus, so maybe? :)
---
I love shamans, just not in classic...
---
Because it's not about the item, but about his attitude on stream. That definitely didn't happen in a virtual world.
---
Well avoiding hillsbrad since its the least interesting battles happening is a good start
---
Happy to help, sounds like an awesome way to kick off the weekend!
---
If (when!) the runs turn sour and all the things go wrong, have a read through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6dt6o/the_blackrock_depths_experience/) awesomely written humorous recollection of what the real BRD experience is about. An excellent read, and very relatable - and quite the pick-me-up after one too many things went wrong during one or several BRD runs. Also a good thing to read so you know what you might expect, perhaps. 
---
Good luck in there!
---
The WoW version of ODST
---
You upset them
---
I was getting camped in un’goro while questing too, also 52 druid. Might have to grind instances for a while
---
That place was already a warzone
---
Hmm i agree. He could have answered ''im selling the run'' or something tho
---
Yes
---
In some ways I am very glad they are releasing the honor system before BG's because it forces these big wpvp groups.
---
You understand official servers have more layers of security, right? :|
---
Flash of Light is your friend, the key is to always heal to full and stack Mana per 5 over spirit.
---
No but it's an option that they have enabled and available, therefore they should have the capacity to facilitate such activities. 
---
Release world PvP but not have the capacity to facilitate the activity on a scale that is relevant to the server. 
---
You shouldn't have the options to do X if it cannot be facilitated 
---
Either way battle grounds need to come out earlier, like significantly earlier, in order to compensate
---
Such trials and tribulations stand before us all
---
It took me almost 2 hours to get from northern felwood to southern felwood. The damn graveyards are placed in inconvenient areas amd distances away, and it's a coom place for level 53+ people to be so a 60 will get easy honor from just that area alone.
---
if you can't ban it then nerf it.
---
since you can't tab target through LoS you shouldn't be able to target through spy addon frames.
---
I started over and haven't hit 60 yet. Its nonstop. I'm debating not playing for a week or three.
---
We play horde Jokes on you
---
You get to 60 with quests only easily. I'm 60 with mostly quests and low level dungeons. And i haven't even touched Winterspring.
---
 I guess many skip the low level green quest areas, long quest lines or dungeon quests and then run into problems after 55.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta
---
The fact that we still have simpletons making excuses for the server performance is shocking.
---
Most players have been 60 for awhile now, with preraid-bis gear. After your weekly MC and Ony, what else do you want to do?
---
But it looks.. amazing? 
---
Also, could you share how you've gotten zoomed out that far? There was a command for it early on that worked to increase the view distance, but I thought Blizzard patched and fixed it.
---
Wanted to post exactly this
---
yes they were m8
---
They don't because you have no rank points to lose. But I heard the loss per DK goes up the more you get, so having a bunch in the first week might cost you eventually. Not sure if it's true though, cause other source just says 100 RP flat.
---
I stumbled upon that video a few weeks ago and it makes so much sense but yet it doesnt. Never really liked him but wow he went far to stay relevant
---
I agree with your assessment, though it saddens me. WoW Classic is profitable, and unless adding/upgrading servers would increase that profit by more than the cost of the server upgrades, they won't do it. Corporate greed sucks, and we should be upset at them, but lets not damn the developers or customer support staff. They honestly have no say and no power to do anything about this.
---
We started raiding MC with 10 mages.  Now only have 4, the rest have just quit out of boredom/frustration or whatever.
---
Is it only if the same person kills you they get the diminished returns? Or is it attached solely to your deaths so that everyone gets diminished returns?
---
&gt;Or is everyone too busy farming honour?
---
Everybody busy crying in reddit about SPY addon and server lags.
---
Tbh, they should just create incentive to fight max level toon. Increase honor yield by a good margin when you are 60 and killing 60 and decrease honor yield for killing anything below 60 by like 90% and should fix the problem

In EU, is it only Zandalari tribe which is balanced?
---
I’m sure he was thrilled to lose the Method money?
---
More like kargath , put my hs there . At the little price of 1g I get the benefit of a portal hub near brm
---
I have 8 chars between 20-34... But of course, thats on me, I don't expect my stupidity to be catered for.
---
Prolly 0 honor per kill if they keep going long enough.
---
I'm not gonna chase anyone, but I know other people will.
---
I got chased tons of times as a lowbie, so it's just personal experience.
---
So what exactly are you referring to?  Not letting a tank get 3 sunders before doing damage??  I'm saying tanks are being pretty greedy with thier only wanting gold compensation to tank even though they need the instance just as much as everyone else, lol.  Never done a live strath out of guild that didnt require payment of 1st orb or nah, it's kinda dumb, lol.  What more can I do to make the run smoother, I cc whatever he wants, I keep monster close to him if dps split, I focus his target I wait for sunders and I have to also pay him? If it's some super geared tank and hes over it, sure but we get 58 tanks expecting this same bullshit.
---
Because the private servers shut down for this
---
&gt;AH fees are higher on the neutral
---
15% is the number, IIRC. Regular AH should be 5%.
---
Hmmm... So where can I get me the # oh ranking points needed to achieve each rank? And each tank's percentile?

---
I tried farming them, spent 3 hours and got none. :(
---
i dont understand this. are new versions of luna not worth downloading now because it wont work properly? like it cant use the most recent healcomms anymore?
---
Did you kill the Horde?
---
Nothing cool about it, massively advantageous horde pushes alliance to the very port of southsthore, then falls back and repeats over and over. It has been very fun for the first hour or so though.
---
Delusional - achieves 1 thing inside a 15y old game. Suddenly think he's a god. Bless him
---
Yes. Sad though because I had a blast so far. Would pay 50€ for a server transfer to a PVE server right now.
---
pretty sure that was sarcasm lol
---
If I'm out for blood and a lowbie is nearby maybe I'll considering spending a few seconds to chase. But if there's only like two 48+'s in STV, then going there at all is a huge waste of time.
---
Should I expect my guild to help me craft Sulfuron Hammer? We are a semi-casual to semi-hardcore raiding guild, but I feel like its pretty much up to myself to achieve the 50 Arcanite Bars..
---
Aren't you exactly one of those people? You have no idea the magnitude of the difference in loads between blizzard and private servers, yet you're able to confidently say that they're similar? Plus your last sentence is another assumption, parts of the data sent are definitely the same but unless you've compared both you can't be able to confidently say they're the same.
---
Why isn't your name 'twat' then?
---
Like avoiding any security or integrity checks.
---
That's not the analogy. It's "you weren't there when the laws were passed, you can't comment on the personal experience".
---
Dude this is a troll. The wand from enchanting and 2 dots i had everything dead in seconds
---
Quick answer to the wrong question.
---
wtf estimate doesn’t mean 100% accurate? literally uninstalling wow right now
---
Because tanks can do things like reserve runs.
---
You die though if are afk longer than fd duration, but no repcosts so its okay
---
Rank 1 - 0, rank 2 - 2k, rank 3 - 5k, and then goes up 5k for each rank.

I feel like you don't know the very basics of "aggro"?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Aggro_radius
---
I personally switched to deep prot at 49 from the Arms spec because I wanted shield slam.  Tbh even though I was leveling entirely in dungeons it was a few levels too early as I could only get 4/5 tac mastery and no anger management.
---
I did survive and am now tanking endgame stuff at 60.  
---
The deeper prot is all about threat.  Slam is obvious, but one hand wep goes a long way to helping make up for the fact you aren't using a 2h in def stance any more.  
---
However, as you go deeper into BRD then move on to the other dungeons with 60 level bosses you really need the extra 2k armor you will have from a shield.  So without deep prot, your threat using 1h+sheild will blow cookies.
---
Is it possible to tank with plate and a shield those dungeons with a dps spec, yes, will it be harder than prot, yes, will you be able to main tank a raid boss, not likely.  I would suspect the other answer saying they get asked to tank on Sulf and Major is they are put on add duty.
---
And the mob going from Grey to red means this raid was in possession of the tag. Regardless of what you think, when have you ever been able to see the loot on someone elses tag? This is a bug, take your high horse someone else.
---
Being able to reasonably mass pvp without the serves just completely lagging out until people leave?
---
This is a good copy pasta right here, to replace the "what did you just say to me you lil bitch" pasta.. lol
---
Does vanish remove the hunter mark ?
---
a shadowpriest can dispell the feather, its always fun
---
It’s to incentivise you guys into learning English. 
---
The rest of Europe have native languages but somehow every one of them also bothered learning English.
---
Guild wars 2 comes very close as it's 3 servers battling against each other
---
So you made a post crying about the criticism?
---
&gt;We still don't know the details about the blizzard servers and configurations.
---
And yet we(not me, but many) assume they are geniuses. That it must be extra computation, not inefficiency, and cost cutting. Private servers are stupid pirates that bypass cheating checks but also smart enough to reverse engineer the whole thing based on the game client and assets. Yeah right...
---
Need I remind you how many massive successful studios produce absolutely atrocious code? Valve? Bethesda? How good has server stability been since launch on Classic? How many desperate patches did they need to make on a 15 year old game?
---
you can't, the item drops from a tribute chest at the end of DM north and he doesn't pick it up but sells the item and gets the guy into dungeon and leads him to chest then the buyer picks up the item. 
---
when exactly the gold trades hands im not sure about
---
You can do the solo without killing the dogs?
---
I don’t think so, but I’m not entirely sure
---
This doesn’t make sense. What are you trying to say here?
---
And Donald trump is president of the United States. It is truly the twilight zone.
---
It's supposed to (was changed in 1.12) but I can't get a straight answer out of rogues. Some say it does some say it doesn't.
---
Was this on ZT by any chance?
---
40v40 I barely noticed any lag. The largest battles we did last night were, I'd say *roughly* 100v100, the lag was noticeable but not unplayable. Nothing like some of the videos getting posted here.
---
However our server did boot a ton of people from Azshara apparently when like 12 entire guilds showed up at once.
---
So dope
---
Welp this thread is over, wrap it up
---
Stop fucking mithering.
---
Even better, be a Night Elf. I have drinking and shadowmeld macrod together. It's saved me a few runs back when the DPS gets impatient.
---
A site, which only parses data uploaded to warcraftlogs.com
---
The relaibility on this is near zero.
---
I mean mmochampion says it's one day
---
they can quit and spend 10 years following the game and seeing if it gets any better like I did....ya easily
---
Please elaborate?
---
Was this on ZT
---
&gt;  the code of wow is so intrinsically sandwiched together and on top of each other, that one change made could sometimes cause a major bug in underlying code
---
oh I see. The LinkedIn version of spaghetti

&gt;&gt;You can't just throw hardware at problems.

&gt;
---
&gt;Ok, so, like, this is completely wrong lmao
---
Pretending you have an idea of what you're talking about, nice.
---
youre gonna have a surprise when you'll try to rank higher than 6
---
Okay, but what about the enormous Wintergrasp battles in 2008/2009? Those weren't as laggy.
---
In the end, there are asshole ganker/campers in both factions. There's just a certain percentage of pvpers that seem to enjoy this type of gameplay. But since more pvpers roll horde than alliance, that necessitates that more ganker/campers will be horde, even though its the same percentage of people.
---
They definitely weren't. Hell I remember lagging in just 40v40 fights sometimes.  I don't think I ever saw anything close to the size of the battles on classic that I've seen so far.
---
I’ve just always loved enhance. But I had a 70 Twink elemental shaman in retail who could absolutely delete people so after I get my druid geared I’ll probably go for that.
---
No idea when server xfers will open up but he should really make a ticket about his situation. Couldn’t hurt
---
In all honesty, in a group of 4,  13.8 boars per second is doable if you...  LIVE TO WIN, TIL YOU DIE,
---
Imagine taking this clip seriously
---
What about the enormous Wintergrasp battles in 2008/2009? Those weren't as laggy.
---
Come to ashbringer
---
As a horde player, I had to do at least 12 corpse runs just to get to the BRD instance last night. Ashbringer seems alliance dominant at times!
---
I just want to experience everything at least once, ugh
---
&gt;vanilla was never lag free
---
no but after 15 years you'd think there would be technology capable of fixing this
---
I remember the anxiety of healing this at 4fps.
---
Elune help us all
---
How is this different from what Asmongold does every day with his warlock? Makes raid and takes everything he wants to his toon. Both are arrogant dicks.
---
There will never be unrestricted server transfers. Grobbulus?
---
Not really any news on the topic, no. 
---
That sounds like a super toxic community, like really bad. I have a hard time seeing why anyone would act like that and single out one or a few people to that extent for no real reason. Do you have any screenshots and/or logs about the expired events? Not likely that they will do very much good, but who knows. 
---
If 50+ people left, you could try gathering those and building up a guild and do your best to outperform the other guilds.
---
Why do mage perform locks outside 1v1? You'd think the dotting class woth a minion at its disposal would do better.
---
Guild officer told me respec to deep resto or no raid spot. Feels bad
---
nobody is acting like it's a new thing
---
I was present when AQ was launched on Elysium (the continuation of Nostalrius) and participated in WPvP during the event. I was also logged when Honor went live yesterday, and participated in Southshore vs Tarren Mill and went to Kazzak. 
---
Elysium lagged during the AQ event, but nowhere close to how terrible the servers were yesterday. Not. Even. Close.
---
Not sure about faction imbalance tho
---
When we rolled up to Ironforge's front door last night with half a dozen raids it was quite funny seeing random Alliance dudes just standing about in the middle of the fiercest AoE storms I've ever seen, not toggled so not taking damage. Pretty sure one dude was dancing right in the midst of it all.
---
Not only being outnumbered so heavily that we would lose every single fight even if all the characters were exactly the same, but also having worse characters for PvP. Even at a 50-50 alliance already have a worse starting point.
---
So many surprised pikachus. I rolled PVe and couldn´t be happier. Btw we had epic large scale battles in TM, STV and Blackrock all day. Except players could still travel to dungeons. Best of both worlds.
---
Paladin, cloth, pvp. She'll do well!
---
I really feels bad.   
---
There is no hiding no nothing.
---
Why so serious dudeette
---
Yes, you do. People in the party get honor if they haven't done damage. If you are not in a party with that person and you get a hit on the enemy you will get honor.
---
got em
---
There are plenty of good tanks that prove your argument to be invalid. I would feel ashamed for forcing the group to waste time on each pull while knowing there are better players who don’t.
---
You’re probably going for defense cap too, it’s not  2004 anymore, wake up.
---
The combo points are a save/spend type of resource.
---
Instead of mana like a mage or priest, you need to use your combo points (and energy) for  some of your abilities. 
---
Most (but not all) rogue abilities either give a combo point or cost combo points, so the idea is to use a couple abilities to get more combo points before using them on a "finisher" such as Eviscerate or Slice and Dice. 
---
Just because it is a "finisher" doesn't mean you have to wait until a mob is almost dead or your combo points are full. Slice and Dice increases attack speed, so you usually want to get 1-2 combo points and use it as soon as possible so you can start doing more damage more quickly. 
---
When you use your "finisher" abilities and how many combo points you should save before using them is hard to explain because a lot of it depends on the situation like how much health the mob has, how much health you have, how many mobs you're fighting, etc... You'll learn most of it very quickly and naturally by playing the game and testing out different skills in different situations.
---
Because it remains more accurate and relevant than memes and hashtags.
---
&gt; Pff just imagine dying and having to corpse run, what a drag.
---
x20 because tons of FP's are camped as hell. Questing is out of the question right now lol
---
Some people would call it a difficult task when the RNG have bad odds.
---
Prove it, because apparently you're the only one with a good connection.
---
A giving up a huge junk of your real income kinda item ?
---
nO ChAnGEs
---
You can take the honor if you have damaged them o healed the guys damaging them, doesn't matter if you're not in his same party.
---
Blizzard is also a subscription service though, where you have an account you pay for with your name attached to it.
---
Would it really be so aweful to not do these checks once the player count reaches a certain amount in one area and rather redo the calculations and checks later based on stored data, and then ban accordingly if anyone is caught cheating? Seems preferrable over not being able to have large scale PvP at all like is the current reality.
---
Its not difficult it just takes time
---
If your warlock over experience made you feel like a god compared to rogue, you never knew how to play rogue. If swords rotation is too complicated go daggers it's much easier rotation
---
Literally America rn. Cancel culture and Whining
---
Yes, but it's absolutely unnecessary right now. So you might as well farm MC for another 3 months before we get BWL and see if it drops then, and invest those 1000g in Black Lotus or something instead.
---
At this point I'm sure the people on reddit who think another +1 stat on chest is the same people who think only hardcore players can clear MC in less than 3 hours :p
---
It doesn’t solve the problem, raid nights will still be fucked due to brm not being able to handle more than 2 guilds at a time
---
ok thank you!
---
thank you!
---
Man chill, people correcting spelling mistakes already lost at life so dont sweat it
---
He’s throwing a tantrum on a 15 year old game dude, don’t hold your breath. This is SERIOUS to him
---
Honestly not that laggy.
---
When whispering players, use complete sentences and punctuation (Would you be interested in tanking Stratholme Undead?).  Think of it as an in-person conversation rather than a text, and the player you're whispering isn't familiar with abbreviations.  I always get a response using this method.
---
Your message will dictate how that player interacts with you.  Always give the player at least a minute to respond, in case they're reading a quest, fighting a mob, engaged in PvP, etc.  When they do respond, even if it's negative, thank them for their time (Thank you for your time), then move on to the next player.  If you message several players in a row and two of them say yes, you'll have to come up with an excuse to not take one of them and it feels horrible.
---
I start adding damage classes to the group using the Looking For Group channel, then go to whispers for the tank, occasionally posting it in LFG (LF Tank, Strat UD - keep it simple in LFG)
---
Check your main cities first (/who Stormwind, Ironforge, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar Warrior/Paladin/Druid 58-60).  The players standing around in the main cities, most of the time, are there because they're bored and are more likely to join you.
---
\*started writing this out before reading the comments and everything is spelled out for the new players that may be reading this -- read the good comments about whispering players, there's helpful info there\*
---
That thread is utter bullshit, stop being a blizzard apologist
---
Hello from the Raid Leader of the party that came from the north just as you guys were getting pushed out of tarren mill.   
---
My name is Insert and I leaded a raid of 40 people to tarren mill that day. When we got there we could see your guys were overwhelmed by hordes being 2x more than the allys. My raid took control of north flank and we were able to assist you in farming them for about 20 minutes there. From our point of view, it looked like we were in lord of the rings part 2 where Gandalf came with the reinforcements to claim victory for the Alliance. EPIC.  
---
I just wanted to say it was pleasure to kill hordes with you guys
---
... thanks?
---
This is exactly what's happening.
---
Lmao i can tell.
---
Kite and CoC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OxMbupKW4w
---
No that's just no honor. Civilian NPCs are the only DKs
---
Everyone is mentioning private servers. Forget those. Wintergrasp in 2008/2009. 250 vs 250. People who were lagging were lagging because of their PC. If you had a good PC, it was relatively smooth. There are videos on YouTube.
---
I just want to confirm you are using the "LookingForGroup" channel right, not just "LFG". Have seen that a couple times
---
Is there a go-to talent build spec for "drain tanking"?
---
Unless you are a professional hairdresser or are just shaving your head, you should ask your friends this question and ask them to be very honest.

Hey maybe she'll notice you if you keep flaunting that crusty exterior.

i have only seen skulls and red levels fighting... anyone below or equal generally dont start anything
---
Always
---
Create a character on a few interesting servers and ask around in world.
---
Gotta hit em with the innervate for moar waters.
---
Server lag makes bosses speak Spanish?
---
Are there good public raids going? Horde
---
That happened during the AQ gate opening event for sure. We had roughly half the server there for that, and my server had queues regularly (more than 3k players online).
---
City raids, too. Get a bunch of guilds to raid Ironforge.
---
This
---
I laugh every time I see a group made of just dps looking for more while reserving loot , it's silly . The only right way of reserving stuff is , provided you are geared , whisper the leader of the group that you see spamming for a while and ask him if it's ok if exchange of your time to get the loot you want , if everyone in their group agrees you join and everyone is happy , you get what you need and they get to run the dungeon instead of sitting around spamming
---
People unhappy with their realm being too populated can always transfer to lower pop realm for free.
---
Its minus current honor no? So since we all have no honour..... We don't lose anything
---
Here's me, pleased with getting over 700 honourable kills on my level 41 rogue and then there's people with four goddamn thousand.
---
whats this estimated honor points thing? i domnt think i saw that in my chat log ... am i missing a setting ?
---
Maraudon yesterday 
---
"hey Mr. Mage could you let me maul the giants a few times  so they stay on me ? They hit pretty hard"
---
"K"
---
We kill around 10 giants + landslide everything is going decent,  except we get to the princess and the mage forgets everything we talked about ( I guess because she's not a giant ?) and just starts blasting. We get wiled because she fears me and starts one shotting the casters.
---
 Mage proceeds to tell me we can't wipe again because he has to leave.... 
---
"Ok pal just let me build threat first like I said earlier :))))"
---
Or just jump in the lava before you get to the window
---
TIL some people play without vocal alerts deactivated.
---
He's proposing that the only time an ENEMY PLAYER shows up in your combat log is if they affect you. Nothing changing for NPCs or Ally Players. While a hamfisted solution, it would limit the effectiveness of spy.
---
It is funny. Where is all thay "no changes" people now lol
---
I’m pretty damn sure backpedaling still counts as movement as far as leeway is concerned, aka leeway would still be active. I actually Don’t have it bound tho so I’m not 100%. I usually Don’t move away from mobs until I nova, so backpedaling never really comes into effect for me (both you and the enemy must be moving at the same time for leeway to kick in)
---
But in general I totally agree that 2 major issues a mage could have is not understanding leeway and thinking that mage armor is the play
---
I'm in a massive guild but it just becomes that I cant do anything alone anymore, and everytime we group up and fight back at equal numbers the horde can just go on /1 and call for double ours.
---
Yes not lfg channel
---
As I said, OG was deserted, alliance hubs were bustling with activity, having hundreds of characters in SW after 30seconds of fithing. You can deduce that these alliance player didnt fly in to help out, they were already there. 
---
If you have 50 people sit infront of the bank of Orgimmar when PvP launches, and you have 200 in SW, these 150 people are missing in the big Tarren Mill battles.
---
It's 0 RP for rank 1, 2000 for 2, 5000 for 3 and then +5000 for each subsequent rank.
---
For the brackets:

Not that easy.

Software is  not something you can just throw money at to fix problems.

I just transferred here two days ago. Definitely feels like 80/20 LOL
---
Lol u mad XDDD
---
EVE can handle 1000+ player fleet battles... which it does by strategically slowing down time in the region where the battle is happening, sometimes by 10x.  Obviously not an option for WoW.
---
Planetside 2 could handle up to 300 players per faction per continent, which was honestly amazing for how much was happening in that game... But individual objectives would rarely even see 100 vs 100.
---
Simply put, it's amazing that a game with a netcode base as old as WoW, with as much server validation as official Classic needs to prevent cheating, can handle 400+ players in combat in a single location. People need stop acting like they should be able to cram the entire server population into view range range of each other without problems.
---
Yeah I said at least Eastern Kingdoms crashed and Kazzak is in Blasted Lands which is in Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Not if it only affects enemy players. No changes to NPCs or friendly players. It could definitely work, but it's not elegant
---
Nice. Thank you very much for this clear answer
---
Make sure you love your cast animation!
---
I killed a level 49 who was afk on my 48 rogue, am I a pvp god now?
---
I've seen quite a few people do it. I tried leveling as sub and the difference in speed was definitely noticeable. As combat swords, when you have blade flurry you can typically fight 3 mobs at a time with no issue. As sub, I could manage one. Any more was scary. But as sub I also completely fucked everyone in PvP 1v1s, so there's a trade off I guess.
---
That survey was before the 2 sets of transfers I'd wager
---
Send blizzard a cease and desist letter to give them a taste of their own medicine
---
All it does is to increase the awareness in PvP which only matters before the fight even starts. The real skill in PvP will be untouched by this.
---
Its been less than one day...
---
Farming is going to be much easier in a week.
---
I'm certain Blizzard uses modern and impressive hardware solutions. The problem is that it is the wrong type and is ill suited for a game like Classic. Classic was designed to run realms on a single (for the time) powerful server blade. It's kind of an antiquated server hosting solution that Blizzard no longer uses for any of their games. Even then it's fairly unique to (typically older) MMO's. Dynamically instancing games (sharding) drastically lowers the requirements of the hardware needed promotes a totally different server philosophy. And Blizzard's servers are excellent for this purpose.
---
I think it's a fair assumption that Blizzard didn't set up an old-school server hosting solution for Classic WoW. Some would disagree I'm sure, but do you really think it likely that they purchased and set up new hardware in their scramble to set up new servers at launch? Layering also fundamentally wouldn't work if they did. Which is another weakness of the old way of doing things. The reason for that approach though is that you can manage massive load spikes in a single instance far better.
---
No Kromcrush!!
---
what they can do is add WSG now
---
Good point, thats a bummer.
---
Now we have Classic. And, you're point, while valid, isn't the whole truth because there are still private servers running right now.
---
Hahaha alright! Woo Yay. Ok we've had our fun. Time to release WSG.
---
I won't group with ninjas or assholes and I appreciate people in chat letting me know. Reputation matters in this community.
---
Except that's a healing robe so she wont be doing that either
---
I remember crashing the server in Vanilla with 80 people raid on orgrimmar, with 15s freeze between attack on thrall until the crash. Servers were really really bad back then.
---
Shockadin one-shot? Wait what how?
---
If you are using Luna Unit Frames you do not need to have this addon. This is just for people using default unit frames.
---
Mograine is nice, kind of a fuckfest with Phase 2 but It'll die out i think
---
Yeah, horde have numbers for sure. Still had a lot of fun. They own the goblin cities though, and nothing is safe. I just do my corpse drag to where I can finally mount up and try again. Winning a lot of battles but definitely losing the war.  :)
---
This looks like Pacino wasn't supposed to be shouting that line.
---
There was no pvp in ph1, not only because Flamelash EU is 75-25, but also because most people avoided it at all costs.

I could run from the bottom of felwood to the end of winterspring and see **0** alliance.

no because that would be too logical and makes too much sense

I got a couple thousand honor killing rogues in menethil harbor inn.
---
How can it be griefing? It's stupid and annoying, but well within the rules of the game. Use official channels to find a group and you don't have to worry about it. It's a private channel. Simple as that.
---
Yes, i murder real people, instead of fighting npcs
---
LOL that still has the 33/66 split for Fairbanks. Those the numbers from before the first transfer
---
I call people a fucking idiot all the time. Doesn't mean I'm mad. People need to go outside, get off Reddit and stop thinking they can judge human emotions from small blocks of text.
---
what does blizzards cum taste like
---
Did you do it naked with white daggers if so, yes you are
---
same experience here on firemaw alliance.  60:40 faction ratio in favour of horde.  this morning we had a very good back-and-forth in hillsbrad, but it took me about 15 corpse runs to get there cos i went to check out EPL and basically found loads of bands of 10 horde and about 3 afk alliance
---
Sappers win battles for sure. I’m guessing after a week of this, they’ll be used a lot less LOL
---
Yeah, best bet is to close in spamming frost shock. Quick chain lightings if possibile. Ns comes handy versus them so you can get insta healing wave.

Bm hunters can be problematic as they're immune to cc during BW.

Can't handle the truth i can see.
---
Yes at this point we were stomping them. They did come back however an hour or so later and started to roll us! Fun back and forth actually.
---
I'd honestly play the alliance if the races had been created with more vision. Humans, pink humans, hairy, drunk humans, small humans with an annoying laugh. 
---
Later on they fixed that by implementing more interesting races like the worgen, but if I want to play a human, I just turn off the game and go outside.
---
When you are a brand as big as method. You don't want in any way to be associated with someone who will so obviously and deliberately do something that 95% of the community will frown upon. It's not good advertisement for them.
---
100vs100 Is a lot smaller than 300vs300.

No you don’t have to do it for goblin. You only need to do it once.

I've started using inner focus to cast fortitude cause of this.
---
My server is high pop and I wasn't experiencing latency issues even close to the same level I see people around here describing. It was barely an issue at the worst of times, and usually it wasn't noticeable at all.
---
Yes! I have several elaborate slurs for these giys so its fine.. ''your mother smelt of elderberries''
---
Yeah, Lucifron is a slaughterhouse basically. 
---
As a lvl 50 fellow alliance player I just want to get some xp. :D
---
Have you tried taking the ship in theramore? I couldn’t believe my eyes when 40 horde or so ran out and instantly killed me at like 1:30 am. It was pretty funny, though.
---
Is that the real Asmon? Did his cult try to get revenge on you?
---
Fascinating on a sociological level, to witness all these people so enthusiastic about the good stuff they missed from Vanilla, yet so eager to ruin it all yet again for yet again the same stupid reasons.
---

I avoided the massive battle in EPL yesterday by just hiding out doing all the bats and plague hound quests and stayed cleared of the roads. An ally popped up doing the same thing and we just kinda stared at eachother for a minute before resuming our questing. We both eventually got totally rolled over when we had to go towards plaguewood though. The pvp in EPL yesterday was fucking wild.
---
I got 2 60’ with bis already rerolling is not an option for me. If its not coming soon i dont have any other option than taking a break for a while. Rip Dreadmist-Eu

They already ruined wpvp with transfers and lack of creation caps. P2 was the phase I was most looking forward to I'm super bummed

World pvp is a joke in classic right now. Battle of the sapper charges and zergs basically. Wish there was more skill to it.

Can you get itemrack to give you those bars? Because I can’t and I’m starting to give up on it. 
---
I use dominos and think it may be causing issues with it but I can NOT get movable bars with itemrack. I have to go to the character screen each time.
---
Guess the game died. -Them probably
---
Because the people who are saying "This is unacceptable!!!! This is 2019!!! Russians in their basement could do this, why can't Blizz!!! They just don't want to upgrade their servers because they're greedy!!!"
---
What they don't understand is that the complexity of interactions when you go from 5v5 PvP to 100v100 PvP is non-linear. You can't just throw hardware at non-linear software problems. 
---
 
---
Each player is using abilities which impact every other player. So in a 5v5 there are 10 people interacting a maximum of 9 other players, so 90 potential interactions. In a 100v100 each player impacts a maximum of 199 other players, so 199000 interactions.
---
Improving hardware can only provide you with linear gains. You can double or triple the amount of RAM/Processors/whatever. The complexity is increasing at around a n^2 rate, but you can only increase your hardware capacity at a linear rate.
---
**You can't throw Hardware at this problem**
---
If you think you have the solution for this, get in touch with literally any game developer and sell it to them. Being able to meaningfully solve this issue is a golden idea and companies will pay you big bucks.  
---
However I'm betting that most commenters on reddit don't actually know anything about it and are just saying 'OMG fix it, it's so easy'.
---
Maybe you are the idiot given you now want to view his content? Baaaaaaa
---
Mages should know this though.  You don't have time to drink the entire thing.  You're lucky if you can get 6 to 8 seconds of drinking in before the next pull.  Especially if you have a couple melee and there's no other need for downtime.
---
Holy paladins are awesome in pvp but the pvp gear is for ret paladins. Try to find some plate with int and +dmg and healing instead.
---
You dont use daggers with hemo
---
I was present for elysium AQ and it definitely lagged and felt like a slideshow at times but keep in mind this was 10k people shoved in one zone. You could still use abilities and the server didn't disconnect you constantly. This is honestly a disgrace for blizzard and the devs should feel ashamed for launching with the game engine/servers in this state. One of the most talked about issues prior to launch was this very subject amongst the pserver crowd. We all knew this would happen and they did nothing to address the issue.
---
not really, it increases the odds of them just not playing.

I'd agree with that

no, it does remove the mark

&gt; That being said i love all the player created content that comes from a pvp server.

When I played warrior back in vanilla my buddy was a shaman and there was no getting away from us. I can't imagine trying to play warrior without my backup shaman now.
---
Congratulation that's probably a more honorable victory than most of mine yesterday which tend to be 20 v 1 people trying to get into BRM (i really want these sweets honour points)
---
I have no idea about the server population numbers back then and now.
---
Unfortunately, I was on PvE server in Vanilla (ironic, since I fell in love with PvP), so most of my Tarren Mill battles were like 20-40 of us Horde vs like 2+ Alliance raid groups. (We won a lot, lol)
---
I'm interested if those numbers are really small for Vanilla time, compared to PvP server.
---
I also remember they decided to remove the corpses (or limit the number and duration?) due to so much lag.
---
But it was normal play, no lag, even on Pentium 4 with 512 MB RAM and a lousy graphics card, along with 0.5Mb connection :D
---
You're wrong on this one.
---
QS is surely a possibility, but that's 500-600g for the book on most servers and another 700-800 gold for edgemasters if you aren't human if you wana go that route. It's incredibly expensive for something that's far from optimal and far from BiS.
---
That's on top of an already incredibly steep shopping list that warriors have to get through to include things like Lionheart, Annihilator, Flurry axe, Axe of the deep woods, reactive disk and other BoE's / crafted items depending on your race / goals. 
---
Eshkandar's is meme. If you're using something you can't get the +5 weapon skill for its a massive gimp. If you're early in MC it's a nice pickup but really it's only a stepping stone weapon. 
---
Taking Deathbringer from one of your warriors isn't an option for people who are sane. 5% drop rate and it's a massive boost to one of your fury warriors. 
---
Perdition's on the other hand is a 16% drop rate. Most rogues also prefer swords to begin with. There are also plenty of other raid daggers that you can get your hands on as a tank like GGR and CHT. Daggers are very strong weapons for tanks and you can get the +5 skill from either gloves or belt perfectly fine. 
---
The bottom line is perds is bis for your tank. The only axe in the game right now should be reserved for fury warriors and really should only even be considered if your tank is an orc anyway. For the most part rogues prefer the swords that are avail to daggers. Most guild will have 1-3 dagger rogues in the raid and there are 3 different daggers for them to get their hands on that all have good drop rates. That means there is going to be a surplus of daggers, it only makes sense that the tanks get them.
---
If the tank in question is human you could make a better case for QS, but that's one out of the 8 races, and it is still not as good as perds.
---
Onslaught is a VERY strong tank item and is easily justifiable in guilds that have strong DPSers. 
---
To circle back to your main point, seeing a tank with Perds and Onslaught is certainly something in the realm of sanity and is even optimal depending on how strong the DPS in his guild are, where as giving hunters brutality and CHT at this point in the game is almost always a waste. Way to many melee that need those right now.
---
LOL, starts casting blizzard...
---
What /u/remlek said :)
---
This sub is full of insufferable hordies posting pvp pics where they think they're awesome for winning a 5v2 engagement, but you sir get an upvote.
---
But it was said on this video wtf... Plus I was quoting it !   
---
And calm down omg, it's just a joke.
---
Firstly, sweet downvote.
---
DPS don't generally do all, sometimes any of those things you listed. And are always quick to blame the tank when they pull agro and die. That's what I was referring to by qol.
---
Strat live is a perfect example. Warrior tanks need literally nothing from there. If one runs out with no compensation, it's a favor to someone, or something they just enjoy doing. That's why they request the first orb, or greens  
---
Lastly, if ungeared tanks are requesting payment for running the dungeons they actually need gear from, they're delusional. The problem is that people expect raid geared tanks to tank stuff for them just because.
---
Ooh damn problem is I’d never get the tags and it’s probably still more efficient to stay in raid during large events rather than hunting out loners
---
The private servers are running a client much closer to vanilla WoW.
---
It’s important to remember that classic is actually running on the current retail server system, they’ve just tweaked it to have an experience as close to vanilla as possible.
---
There have been a thousands of code changes and quite simply computers have gotten faster, so the developers do a lot more. I’d argue that the vanilla server code is much more efficient than what we run on classic.
---
My main is a level 51 Human Warlock on a server where Horde dominate. Needless to say, I've taken a little bit of a break from leveling due to the overwhelming amount of PvP going on. Started having some fun and leveling some horde alts. Have a warrior, priest, rogue, and hunter. Got all of them to level 10 and just had some fun with it. Having a hard time deciding which one to actually level up.
---
At that level you’re probably fine just going with whatever you find until you get to the higher levels. I’d recommend checking out shadow panther for a list of all weapon choices - figure out what might be easiest to get and go with that. For instance a decent sword choice at that level, of you can get it, would be Firebreather from ST.
---
The worst I ever had was a dps war that kept using sunder armor, I was a level below him so I couldn’t apply my own. It made tanking hard. I had to rely on my shields threat. 
---
When I asked him if I could apply sunder he went berserk about how bad I was and couldn’t hold threat and didn’t know what I was doing. I needed to be spamming heroic strike and demo roar. (Both have threat, but both are let really the lowest threat per rage in the game.) he wouldn’t stop. I eventually left. 
---
People like that are just not worth the emotional expense. Move on. If you’re in a group with someone like this kick the asshole don’t wait for the other people to leave.
---
Everything you type is so dumb its not worth really arguing with you.
---
Yeah I will see if I can find something too. This kind of stuff interests me so let me know :D
---
All i can say... go for it! u will have fun with this build good for both things :D

---
That is their current attempt to 'fix', true. And I really don't know as Blizzard will ever do anything different, this very well might be it. Or they might just lower the pop cap that can log in, prompt some queues and hopefully (their hope, not ours) more transfers, and boom, everything is slaptastic again. 
---
But if subscriber numbers are as much of a boost for them as it seems, and they the executives take note and decide Classic isn't just nostalgia for a couple thousand people but a real potential market to be tapped, then they might decide to address the problem. It really all depends on what their long-term plan for Classic is, which isn't something you or I could answer outside of optimism or cynicism. So my stance is, good, let there be lag, let there be complaints, tickets, videos, forum posts, streamer rants, and so on.
---
Kromcrush was originally balanced, or at least 55-45. But blizz fked it up by offering free transfers, and lots of people apparently couldn’t resist rolling on an alliance dominated server.
---
Blizzard should offer same realm faction transfers as well as faction specific queues. I would transfer and join alliance. 
---
However blizz will just ignore the problem, and announce WSG in 2 weeks, and say it is coming out like mid december.
---
Not at the end when everyone was in the base.

Im curently using

Stop being so simple minded. Throwing money at hardware is an incredibly ignorant suggestion.

especially if you are questing in hillsbrad.

No dude, that's not how it works at all. This week it means zero.

I see, perhaps I misunderstood it then but my assumption came from [this blue post](https://www.wowhead.com/news=292085/hit-cap-in-classic-wow-clarifications) on classic wowhead.   
---
&gt; There is some code in 1.12 that explicitly adds a modifier that causes  the first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear to be ignored against  monsters with more than 10 Defense Skill above the attacking player’s  Weapon Skill.
---
I’m sure that spot will he camped too but it still is easier
---
exactly
---
Played ZF with a Druid healer, very nice guy and while he had no issues healing us, we were perplexed that he couldn’t make the jump skip to the boss after stairs because we accidentally killed the Goblin.
---
We made some small jokes that he was a keyboard turner and what not, turns out he was playing with one arm since he lost the other in a bike accident. 
---
He took it well tho, don’t think it was the first time people assumed things. Ended up with him on my friends list.
---
2019 has improved over 2004? Woa. Fuckin fanboi.
---
This isn't remotely unique to horde.
---
Extra info:
---
If they need ya for improved Motw - just remove Tranquil Spirits, waste anyway to be quite honest (it's such a marginal gain when you usually spam rank 3 or 4 healing touch anyway and regrowth for panic scenarios).
---
Check my response to u/a34fsd, but yeah I may just be completely misunderstanding the message in that link
---
This so much. I don’t understand the obsession with being signed to a gaming “org”.
---
Gee, I sure hope there aren't two classes that entirely rely on stealth, or the majority of decent pvpers use consumables that hide you.
---
Yes, an unhappy customer is definitely free to walk away and stop giving them money. If their amount is high, it will make Blizzard to take action way more likely than complain threads on Reddit. Alternatively, it will lower the population to non-laggy amounts of people on realm.
---
if you ever actually played Vanilla, you'd know this is exactly how it was in Vanilla.
---
That might be because there are no where near the amount of people in that video as in the Tarren Mill battles on Classic. We had legit over 200 v 200 and that video looks like 80 v 80 tops.
---
If it’s a software issue, throw money at resources to fix that, then. Just because someone doesn’t care to understand the complexities of server architecture doesn’t mean that they are simple minded. It also doesn’t mean that blizzard failed and cheaped out in some way here.
---
Ahhhhahaha this is the best comment ever
---
7 8 and 10 are the blue parts though. 6 for entering should be enough if thats what you mean.

This makes me proud.

It was worth your comment though?!
---
Copied the copypasta duhh.
---
I saw one post about that earlier today someone else mentioned two addons which are capable of doing that. One of them is Leatrix, IIRC
---
Im glad i choose Gandling, server is pretty even
---
Now ding 49 so you're worth honor
---
Why not the new ones? We have updated MC gear too.
---
It doesn't, this has zero impact this week.
---
Yes you are right. But why do someone have to write something that probably bad for the postmaker? Let him just be happy. Atleast that is my own opinion.
---
I had the same experience.  One caveat though.  Before I went to Hillsbrand, I was running around in high end zones on my alt, and they were empty.  Normally during prime time you can't find many herbs, find quest mobs, kill any water elements.  All those things people do for end game materials.  Last night, zero competition.  
---
My point is that our servers probably just aren't as packed as some of these others.  When I went to Hillsbrand there were easily a couple hundred people there, but I think it was a significant percentage of level 55+ players who were online.
---
Also pay 5g for someone to open the door for you in dm and you can get the priest trinket easy. Quest gives xp too.
---
What did you expect when you rolled on a PvP realm?
---
then speak with your wallet you entailed shit,? you are the one paying them each month
---
That is perfectly fine solution as well. Stop paying them money, play something else. A goodbye post on Reddit with proof of your character being deleted will surely show them as well.
---
Yeah that's bs. Nice shill for blizzards incompetence. Imagen if just a few hundred players had the same impact in eve online lol.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one...
---
I said this yesterday when people were like "were gonna go from steppes to brm, someone check RR pass" felt like a proper roam o7
---
&gt;that's just unbecoming.
---
No the fuck it's not. The fighting is happening in a direct line from Southshore to Tarren Mill. If you stick to areas outside of that you'll be mostly fine. If you don't, it's on you when a 60 decides they don't need you snooping around.
---
Demonshear
---
Jesus y'all it's been one day
---
Demonshear from the last boss of Strat Live is a good one for arms that is easy to get, and you will get orbs while running for it.
---
Nice power point
---
Lol I've been thru all of naxx too and I never bring it up. It's just knowing the boss fights and preparing correctly, anyone could learn the same info from YouTube. Plus either way I'm rusty and needed to remember the fights especially MC which I haven't done in forever. It's funny some of the comments here "they say they run max naxx but then mess up in MC." Like being to naxx meant you were a godly player, lol it just meant you had time
---
Wow dude you’re so fucking intelligent. You must be an expert of everything!!!!!!
---
I’m genuinely curious. What game out there can smoothly provide a 300 v 300 experience that had as many calculations going on as WOW?
---
Came here to write the same thing. That voice...
---
Probably emperors axe, alternatively the mace off the mail boss probably wouldn’t be bad.
---
Doesn't seem like he got a lot of return on that investment huh?
---
Well here’s one thing I know: we were always gonna need more than 2 pvp servers. They didn’t know that, I sure did tho. From there... yeah I’m not surprised their providing a cheap and shitty experience. They probably could benefit if indeed you did the otherwise absurd thing and picked a random player and put him in charge. He might actually know something their profit algorithms don’t, judging from what we’re seeing. Insane, ain’t it.
---
Even if they're cross realm with pve realms, horde will have 10 minute queues, because more horde bg than alliance. Just a guess though.
---
Specifically why I rolled alliance. Instant bg queues always
---
Would also depend on whether you specced your arms into mace(awesome for pvp) swords, or axe.
---
Arcanite Reaper axe is boe crafted.
---
Barbarous Blade sword from DM N is farmable.
---
Bone Crusher mace a DM Quest reward.
---
And plenty in blackrock, ony, and MC
---
I agree alliance could stand to cooperate more.  40 people will crush 1 person just as easily as they crush an organized group of 10 though.
---
And to think if we brought 40 that 80 more horde wouldn't show up is laughable.  Faction balance is a massive issue and calling alliance uncoordinated and cowardly isn't the solution.
---
beacuse i sort by new and comment on any and all shit i see.
---
Swedish chef, is that you??
---
It's also nerve wracking as hell as sometimes you port instantly and others you're drowning in the lava before the server picks up what happened.
---
Please tell me how your abilities look so clean! Is this achievable with bartender4?
---
Any other tips for UI would be appreciated, looks real good
---
&gt; Your assumption is that there is a simple and easy fix for this. And that the only reason that Blizzard isn't doing this is to save money.
---
No, that's not how corporations operate. Stop trying to create strawmen.
---
How does dishonourable kills work? Is it any npc, even yellow ones? 
---
Do I get the dishonor even if one member in raid kills the npc?, or do I have to be active in the combat?
---
will do ty &lt;3
---
To be fair. If I was a popular streamer I wouldn't go anywhere without multiple raid groups either.
---
They literally had tears to figure it out
---
According to that post at least it seems you are right.
---
Vs mobs 3 levels above you such as bosses if you dont have any +weapon skill having 1hit % would do nothing.
---
I like the stealthiest class in the game leading the charge! Combat for a reason is see
---
this isnt facebook, i dont give two shit you got your mount or what you had for breakfast,
---
it doesnt
---
You remember 300 v 300 fights in vanilla? Cuz those servers crashed 50v50. Now I’m not saying the lag doesn’t suck, but there isn’t any game that runs a ton of servers like wow does that supports this many people. Hell, CU bas been developing a system for half a decade now to address this very issue. It’s just how it is.
---
As an alliance player on Whitemane all I can do is laugh! It’s PvP man, and it’s unbalanced but SO WHAT?!?! Play the cards you’re dealt and concede “ok I’m going to have to limit my time in neutral cities, flight points” and figure out clever ways to engage in PvP. What I’ve seen is a lot of horde are being lazy and camping the same spots in huge groups so you have to just concede that to them, bait a few idiots away, move around, etc.   it’s not like the whole server is locked down, it’s just very challenging. Plenty of alliance groups forming and making the best of a tough situation.
---
I for one am going to fight it out as the underdog and I knew what I was getting into going in and it’s all good.
---
Fuck the Horde!!!
---
Buffs are not nerfs
---
Dreadforge retaliator from emperor in BRD or barbarous blade from king gordok in DM N. This is excluding all the low % epics or crafting anything.
---
Sounds very odd, but seems that is taken into account when calculating the hit cap (9% for yellow melee abilities if not DW), but not very versed in DPS mechanics as that's my offspec.
---
Ok, so every streamer has a bad connection? Just trying to figure out your point. Every single streamer in big fights was lagging. That's just a fact.
---
My connection is outstanding. I host a media server, among other things. I lagged in our Southshore battles.
---
Wow mages are unfun
---
No, it's not. There's dozens of reasons that throwing more powerful hardware at a problem won't reasonably increase performance.
---
Surely you must enjoy being an ass or you wouldn't do it

I jsut checked and according to all the twitch all time streaming stat sites say he had a peak of 308k (not the 350 k he imagined) and over the last month had a peak time average of 2k and an average of 900. I am actually impressed how he managed to fuck that up.

Vael is not hard. Because of a lot of your abilities generating static threat on top of the damage you can just stagger attacking a bit.

You mean c# right?

Honestly, just focus on getting to 60 and do professions at 60.  I made the mistake of going enchanting on my priest, luckily I didn't level it high (100 something).  I dropped it at 60 and am leveling alchemy and tailoring.  I have an alt with herb and skinning that I send herbs to.  I plan to level engineering on that alt at 50-ish (drop skin) and just buy the mats.  Professions aren't worth the time input at low levels (just my opinion).  Some low level pots might be nice. I tried to do the tailor while level thing but dungeons always beat out craft gear and it was hard to "stay ahead" with tailor.  Just get the lock to 60

Wrong.

You lose directly ranking(points) and not honor

There isn't shit like resilience or any real difference in pvp/pve gear other than pvp gear usually having more stam and pvp oriented set bonuses.  To this extent pve is the easiest way to gear for pvp and will provide a significant bonus.
---
With that being said, many pve people will pvp in pve specs so they don't have to pay to respec as often and that is a substantial disadvantage.
---
Weapons are the biggest thing, especially for weapon classes!  Raid weapons are comically better than anything a nonraider will get until rank 14.
---
What other reason could he possibly have for doing it? Seems pretty obivious.
---
look out for a quest run
---
there literally were 600 or more on many servers yesterday in a lot of different zones lol
---
Quick! someone give him some gold!
---
But what about Scholo?
---
And that proves what? If any Blizzard has one of the worst server infrastructure of any MMO out there, and they were never willing to upgrade.
---
UBRS doesnt have an attunement, but it does require a key.  The key is difficult to get, and requires multiple drops from the LBRS dungeon.  To get all the pieces to the key is a major pain in the ass, and usually requires guild coordination to make sure that certain people get the parts of the key that they need to complete the quest.  If you have the UBRS key it is not a common thing, and if you don't even know what it is (and actually have it)- yes that is surprising.
---
They are just trying to get Blizzard to fix it so they can play. This plays out the same way in every game.  If it wasn't a private server to use to insist it could be better, it would be another game, and so on.
---
I do completely understand the complaints, but we had several hundred playing last night and it was fine.  It seems to be more an issue with the over populated servers.  The trade off is those servers have more people to play with to do other things, like Pug MC, Ony, all sorts of dungeons groups.  
---
People might have to just prioritize what they want to do.  No game provides everything.
---
Are those latin rhythms? *I love latin rhythms!*
---
yikes
---
Yes thank you
---
Fucking shit security if it kills their servers.
---
hate to break it to you but pvp fights of this scale rarely ever happened in vanilla either.
---
👀
---
Unfortuantly Yearh, But that’s a part of the game Apprently. People not understanding How loot distribution works
---
the world server went down btw
---
Tanks are an exception because most tanks cannot run tank in raids. There is literally no point to them running as tank since all it does is get you gear to tank more 5 mans where you're not allowed to get any gear.
---
If only raid tanks actually tanked instances, there'd be an even bigger tank drought.
---
I believe it basically depends on how you stand in comparison to the rest of your raid. It seems to me like you get honor based on the % of dmg you did to the enemy player. So if you're solo and you do 40% of a guys health, you get 40% of that guys honor worth. If you're in a raid however, the entire (nearby) raid gets 40%.
---
So the question is, is the average damage dealt by your raid lesser than or greater than your own? Honestly it's kind of awkward. The highest DPS are better off solo, which lowers raid DPS, meaning now lower DPS are also better off solo... In the end the only ones that want to not be solo are healers basically. Rather flawed, really.
---
Dude this happened to high servers as well. Shit post more.
---
That’s only our pets. We have 15% chance to resist any slow/snare in pvp spec though, so frost shock might do damage but not slow.
---
Expect to see razor cheesed a bit more by guilds. A lot more people know the 'kite strategy' being available now and most guilds have a prot/holy paladin in their ranks. So many warriors are fury and make sure at least enough know piercing howl to make that fight relatively a joke where you only kill the casters.
---
This about sums it up
---

---
I'll assume you have never applied this in reality because it's a pretty shitty mechanic to sac immediately and use death\*coil at full hp and I'm not even trying to offend you.
---
No raid will be hard skillwise. Just like everything else in Classic, the grinding makes it hard. You need to invest time to raid AQ and Naxx. The boss  mechanics are rather simple.
---
The man was just asking a question.
---
My connection was also in the green, I never went above 26ms.
---
It was still a laggy shit show and you are talking out of your ass.
---
Either you weren't in the fights, or you don't know what lag is.
---
It’s a very common idea in game design, and one of the easiest ways to generate tons of items without much dev time. 
---
Create two arrays, one with item names, the other with some sort of stat boost. Instead of creating 10 items all with 10 different stat distributions, you create 100 items. 
---
Very popular with small indie companies.
---
I deleted after someone made a post like this and life is better.  
---
I get ganked without warning sometimes now but that’s life.  Horde also don’t get ganked as much bc I don’t always know one is nearby. 
---
It’s worth it - go delete that shit and forget other people have it
---
This happened several times to both factions on US-Bigglesworth as well. Took 8 hours to get the kill.
---
This was a joke, right? Please tell me he is joking.
---
That's incorrect.
---
Oh yea, mb I worded it like that. 
---
Rolling rogue after you level warrior -&gt; feel like a God
---
Roll ranged after levelling rogue -&gt; you feel like a God, again
---
Levelling difficulty
---
Warrior&gt;Rogue&gt;Ranged
---
&gt;Why do you think we have so many supercomputers? 
---
You know how these work right? They run proprietary operating systems hosting proprietary code that is specifically designed and written in order to take advantage of the scaled and clustered nature's if them. You don't just take "bobs code" and copy and paste it from your local station to the "super computer" and think it's going to run faster because it's got more hardware.
---
You just proved the point that throwing hardware at the problem doesn't fix it.
---
I never played a rogue before, and rolled rogue in classic. It does suck at times, but I am enjoying it so far. I havent had any issues at all getting into 5 mans or ubrs 10 and im almost complete pre raid bis and it hasnt really been hard to obtain the gear. Not much into PVP so I haven't tried that out yet, but pve wise I really like the class and very seldom lose on the dps charts unless its a mage with all bis gear and raid gear on.
---
Okay it turns out I thought the horde versions were new versions and the alliance versions were old versions. I figured they changed it when they updated the models for T2. Turns out I just hate the horde versions
---
Soooooo epic!!! This takes me back to my vanilla days! My server was unplayable, lag was insane. Blizz needs to figure their shit out. Can't wait for AB/WG. Has anyone tried getting into Hyjal yet?
---
Idk what icon that is, but its definitely not Aquamarine.b
---
it speaks to the legendary stupidity of this subreddit that this isn't the top comment
---
You're considered supbar and technically, you're worse than a healer putting up shadow weaving and then going back to healing. So if your group is already bringing you, they're likely just gonna keep bringing you, carry on.
---
they don't make fascists like they used too.
---
Tell that to the alliance death squads I was running into all last night
---
Feels like they might have upped the power on servers at least for ours.. one of the most populated servers and hillsbrad went from a slide show to almost zero delay throughout the day
---
I'm excited to hear Thunderfury was balanced. Wasn't able to play yesterday :(
---
&gt;you are talking out of your ass.  
---
&gt;Either you weren't in the fights, or you don't know what lag is.
---
Right, here is where you're becoming an insulting piece of shit. You either accept my personal statement of my experience or go fuck yourself, I know how lag looks like.
---
Imagine being so jealous of streamers you want them to lose real life money because they stole pixels.
---
&gt;What is so crucial in the prot tree that I need to go deeper?
---
As far as tanking dungeons go, nothing.
---
Use miks scrolling battle text and only turn heaps on. I use that to show mana ticks I’m getting as well with the “show all power gains” option. 
---
Just remember to turn all that other clutter off.
---
The only deep dives that were good were the skarm ones, and skarms encyclopedia like knowledge of vanilla and chill enthusiasm was the driving force there. Skarm by comparison is doing well iirc
---
He isnt a particularly entertaining person on his own and "that's absolutely insane" isnt commentary. He doesn't add much to conversations or ask particularly interesting things 
---
The "clear comms" video and some others really painted him as a dick instead of the more lighthearted persona he puts up for videos. He just didn't seem like a pleasant person more of your typical neckbeard
---
I didnt see much hype over the dueling tournament
---
Well, you are on the right path.  Instability like this isn't without a background story that we'd all probably find sad.  I'm guessing a self-loathing sandwich with a side of insecurity.
---
As long as they can get in range and have time to hamstring then Warriors are very solid in PvP. Especially since Blizzard enacted that original classic melee distance increase while moving, it is very difficult to get away from warriors when they've hamstrung you now. If they have the right support from a healer and/or a class that can slow down enemies (shaman frostshock, mage frostbolt) and the occasional fap, then Warriors can reliably break through kiting and deliver huge hits. The problem is that this requires direct verbal communication between warriors and their supports during big group pvp, which oftentimes isn't the case, which is why you see so many warriors flounder during big group pvp as they go in somewhat aimlessly, without coordinating with their support.
---
Or like talking out of your ass like you're doing right now.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely piggybacking off the presence of a raid. As you said, the average raid dps is probably incredibly low until a dam breaks somewhere. Whereas when you solo and hit the flanks you can burst single targets reliably and back off on your own terms. Poor healers
---
&gt; It's also a phasing issue, I went to go investigate the Benediction area when I saw the yell and I just got beaten to death by invisible skeletons
---
Huh, interesting... Could this be why literally everyone in my guild, including me, was able to do the quest undisturbed?
---
Quite a bit of money probably, but is it enough to provide a moderate profit after the installations of whatever upgrades needed to happen? 
---
Not to mention that this amount of action is not active for enough time for any proper justification. I believe that if world scale pvp of 200+ was active 50+% of the gameplay time then sure they should, but it’s barely a few hours once in a while and then what?
---
I agree with you. But things like this are dependent on single thread performance and/or coding. 
---
Hardware can only do so much.
---
hey love your UI! what addons are you using?
---
It rly isnt, just anything to bend over for big ol' daddy blizz.
---
Thats about all i could do. Never got an aimed shot off, not possible
---
They did talk to the developers of nost, what they talked about? Who knows. Did they listen? Probably not.
---
The reason everybody on here and the forums claims there is an easy solution to this lag is simply because private servers were able to do it and a billion dollar corporation can’t, I know it’s a meme at this point but that’s really it. Is it a simple solution? Probably not. Did Blizzard have years to develop better net code for Classic knowing they couldn’t use the same sharding technology they’ve used for the retail game? Absolutely.
---
It’s disappointing that they advertised epic world pvp battles by dedicating an entire phase to them and in modern ActiBlizzard fashion they came up short when delivering on something that people knew would be a problem when Classic rolled around *years* ago, (you can even go look at old posts on this subreddit showing concern for server’s stability).
---
Gotta love horses
---
Yeah I was in Gadgetzan on Sulfuron just now and it's packed with AH. Our server seems pretty balanced , I like it.
---
WHY DON'T YOU RAID in a REAL GUILD? 
---
You can't have both,  being a small guild leader and being in a proper raid.  Either merge your small guild into a raid guild or just join a proper guild yourself and accept you can't lead your casual friend guild and raid at the same time.   Or stay in your small guild and accept you can't raid.
---
Did someone say jump?
---
Mobility, CC and aoe. Locks got jack shit for pvp aoe, mages got nova, cone of cold, arcane explosion and blizzard with an 80% slow.
---
I wasn't aware you are killing enemy players in MC
---
QS is a transmog weapon and eshkandars is a meme.
---
Is it a bug that leader of the pack does not work i.e does not activate when powershifting?
---
**Honorable**
---
Facing enemies who are within 10 levels of your own character and defeating them will earn you Honorable Kills.
---
**Dishonorable**
---
You will be given Dishonorable Kills for killing civilian NPCs which immediately impacts your Honor rating.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23221132/wow-classic-world-bosses-and-pvp-honor-system-available
---
I think DM:E/N runs could be a good money maker if you find a few people to go with you. Ideally I think you want someone with Mining and Enchanting. 
---
Then you can blast through these dungeons: gather the ghost shrooms/other herbs, d/e some boss drops and vendor the others, and hit the rich thorium veins.
---
But that does require you to find some people to do this with you.
---
As for solo stuff BRD pickpocketing is generally said to be very profitable. Though I've heard complaints it's hard to stick with due to being kinda dull. But given the PVP explosion, it might be easier to hide inside the mountain for now.
---
Priest T1 is usually expensive af, if you even manage to see one on the auction at all. I've seen bracers for 1k a couple times.
---
+int is not available, and yeah you want +healing if you don't plan to PVP/farm/go shadow ever or prioritize your healing over everything. Otherwise +30 spell power is very solid, too.
---
At the same time people who get a little bit of power lose themselves in it. 
---
You can see it when people are all friends/co-workers and then one of them gets a promotion. You think oh this will be cool but then that guy starts being a complete dick to everyone including your group of friends that he is/was apart of.
---
Also why you see so many professional athletes doing crazy shit when they first become pro. They feel like nothing can touch them and then a couple DUIs or videos of them beating up women surface and now they get humbled.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if this is really him and he is power drunk because he can stream a video game for a living.
---
Gratz guys !! I am on venoxis-de horde too :D
---
Dude I think you should talk to someone
---
It is unplayable garbage on Herod. Everyone I spoke to is disappointed, I imagine a lot will be quitting. Get any group together in sizeable numbers and you will be outnumbered and camped within minutes. The only "fair" zone is Hillsbrad but the lag is so bad it isn't even content. Too little too late on the faction only transfers, so now we have out of whack server ratios on both the over populated servers and the xfer servers. If we ever get faction-based queueing, it will also be too late. Blizzard dropping the ball every step of this release.
---
Great music to put to it
---
I got a whisper last night to tank SFK as a druid, while I was still flying from Moonglade to TB. They are desperate for tanks.
---
Last resort by limp bizcuit - Got it off limewire
---
Druid is one of if not the best dueling classes in the game if played by a competant player, the problem is you aren't going to get into 1v1 Currently, the best odds I have seen have been 10v1.
---
That 'DPS' item is a priest healer's pre-raid BiS.
---
I like how this is at zero upvotes because all of the waste of life hype boy pieces of trash who like asmon r downvoting
---
As a warlock how hard is to get decent pvp gear? Obviously not the best but how much pvp would I need to do to get like rank 10?
---
How was it wrong I watch a few other guide videos like punkrat or defcamp and his videos are pretty much similar. 
---
I also don't think the tournament was a dud tbh. I thought the turnout was great even if the classes who won was expected
---
Imagine being a warrior specced fury and refusing to put on a shield and tank a dungeon. "We have no tanks" is only an issue because of lazy ass warriors that are incapable of putting a damn shield on. 
---
"But mah DPS" ...nobody cares. You absolutely do not need to be prot in any way shape or form to tank any of the level 60 dungeons. Seriously, the population of classic wow is made up of a high majority of people playing warriors in leather gear that refuse to do anything but smash things with their 1337 DPS, it's this meta that makes me dislike classic sometimes.
---
Symbiotic relationship right there
---
Maybe he's thinking of the priest dispel?
---
yes.
---
This was a fantastic burn.
---
god i hate undeads
---
Windfury used to be able to proc windfury which doesn't happen in classic. They were op with this in place, but with the nerf they just became too shitty.
---
Yes, I'm alliance, by that definition I've spent a lot of time trying to find 1v1s that turn into 7vs1 campfests. 
---
Just like it seems by your response you've spent several hours waiting to see a red that isn't dying before you can cast a spell.
---
40v40 wpvp crashed the servers on contact back in vanilla btw.
---
You can play the game if you chose to skip queues and lag. I guess some people are sadistic
---
As warrior your role is to stay back and just pick out those players who overextend... charge, harmstring, back again. You do not go up front and try to kill anyone - that is not your job. Well if only there would be no lag and you could play properly, that is...
---
YOUR TARGET IS DEAD
---
I remember the AQ event. Burning blade crashed maybe 50 times that night. It was NOT ready for that shit.
---
That's Asmonds kindergarten!!
---
That's very true though
---
...what? You have to pass the molten core entrance to get to there, so why would you walk farther, and spend 5x the amount of time getting your raid into MC........
---
It gets up if you kill more on the same day. So he is fine for now.
---
So, basically, we agree that there are legitimate reasons why Classic's servers are more laggy then private servers, but you disagree that Blizzard can do much or anything to address it?
---
As a warlock I'd really like some +hit talents beyond affliction.
---
This is why most of the discussion here is pointless.
---
&gt; Did they listen? Probably not.
---
You have nothing to base that on, other than the fact that you dislike Blizzard as a company and are assuming the worst from them. Maybe they listened and took on board everything they had to say. But the Legion engine wasn't compatable with the solution Nost had?  
---
But no, that isn't entertained as an idea in this thread. 
---
"Blizzard could easily do this, but they don't".
---
&gt; private servers were able to do it and a billion dollar corporation can’t
---
And the reason why?  
---
Because greedy blizzard bad!
---
No other reason for this is entertained.
---
I agree they shouldn't have promised large scale PvP since it's clearly not possible with the current implementation of Classic. But the anti-corporate "all businesses and execs just want money money money and don't care about the product at all, there's no other reason why things are the way they are" schtick is wearing pretty thin IMO.
---
Respec only if you plan to level exclusively through dungeons, if you plan on leveling with quests with only occasional dungeon dwelling stick to Shadow.
---
Cannibalism macro'd to yell OM NOM NOM NOM gang here.
---
Camelot Unchained can support a couple of thousand players fighting in a small area with decent performance. It's their major selling point. But the game is still years away from being finished and the controls are so bad it feels like an MMO from the previous millennium.
---
It's a mix between spaghetti code and security implementations as well as integration to battle.net. I recall someone saying they couldn't increase the main backpack to more than 16 slots because it's nested so deep into code that is ancient that any attempt to touch it breaks the entire game.
---
Would you be willing to pay for a retail copy of Classic WoW to fun that and make it a viable expence for them?
---
Punkrats wrong a lot also.
---
They're spreading disinformation or private server information. Talking about things they don't know because they need to make videos.
---
It’s not wrong, giving it to a shaman or paladin is suboptimal, as I pointed out in my other post. No need to get emotional about it.
---
k
---
Not high. Every time you take phys damage there's a small chance to lose some durability on your armor, but that happens anyway so it's not like pvp makes it go any faster considering you spend a large portion of the time dead.
---
A ticket for this feature as already been made https://gitlab.vuhdo.io/vuhdo/vuhdo/issues/31
---
Keep it up alliance skeram. Recruit more troops to the cause
---
I did say that, so I guess we're agreed on the cause? The debate then is can Blizzard do anything to optimize it. My bet is that it's too expensive for them to do anything.
---
What in the world made you think hemorrhage was bugged?  Like, what evidence did you have that this was the case?  You said you did some testing.  Why didn't you post it?
---
Of course supercomputers run efficient code and all sorts of intelligently scaling systems to split workloads and whatnot. I've followed several courses on this. But at the end of the day they still decided that this particular set of problems required more than your average computer's worth of processing power. They decided that they needed thousands of cores to solve this problem faster in parallel. How exactly is this *NOT* solving a problem via hardware? They did the absolute best they could to solve the problem via efficient software, but in the end scaling up the hardware was the solution they arrived at.
---
I'm worried what you hear was give me a lot of mage water.
---
What I said was, "Give me all the mage water you have."
---
Do you understand?
---
*gentle fist pump*
---
Yoiu dont even need a shield. 2h arms tanking is where its at for 5/10 mans. Only some bosses actually need a shield. For raids fury prot is where its at. And you can tank dual wiled fury for 5 mans as well.
---
that chest is pre raid bis for holy paladins.
---
I don't know how many players were actually involved, but on my server the Hillsbrad zerg was big enough for the game to become unplayable (15+ seconds for "instant casts" to go off).
---
Pvp is kinda all there is to do once you kill all the bosses currently avalible, which is kinda easy.
---
Yeah I’m sure the stuck-up six figure salary “our way is the best way” network engineers at Blizzard would love having a couple of fresh off the boat Europeans start barking orders at them on how to do their jobs.
---
Shaman
---
LFTank Stratholme, no loot but great exposure!
---
Time is convoluted
---
lmao that might work with the meteor trinket which is not in the game yet and a shit ton of gear on a badly geared character. I hope you speak about 60s and not low levels..
---
I'm so jealous of that ratio
---
Yeah, the key ring was in the beta, so they figured out how to implement it. I guess what you said is right, that they just don't consider it a priority to release at the moment.
---
Definitely makes my bags sad.
---
Eh. I like playing alone a lot. It sounds like it'd be pretty cool, and then within a couple days I'd be like, why don't you all fuck off and leave me alone already?
---
I thought the cap was only added in the ToC patch?
---
Don't do it here, but on the Herod, discord call them out. Show us your guild name, their guild name, the offending players, and most importantly what proof you have. A load of people and guild leaders in particular use that discord for keeping tabs and open eyes for the players/guild like this. They and their guilds don't get invited for azuregos/kazzak, PvP raids, ect.
---
I can’t speak for everyone, but I am looking to farm dungeons to get 2 pieces each of devout, dreadmist, and magisters and enchant each with Stam or improved armor kits.  Each set two piece gives you armor, it all has stam on it, and can easily be farmed.  Just set the standards against your mages and priests that you will be rolling need on the stuff
---
How could i not doing this ;)
---
It requires an anke to use
---
There you go. They're not going to give Staff of Dominance to anything but a Mage or Warlock, I can guarantee it.
---
You're going to get downvoted into oblivion. OP is obviously someone who can't handle any kind of social interaction, bantz, or how to deal with assholes IRL.
---
You're going to encounter these people your whole life - you need to find ways to deal with it, not just bail the instant someone hurts your feefees.
---
Don't forget Robe of the Magi active + Celestial Orb actives!
---
Two orbs to the tank is not worth it nor have I ever seen such a request on my server. I tend to avoid tank reserving orbs at all. I'll accept the first orb to tank in a round robin style system and the tank cant roll until everyone else has one.
---
You'd add a third if your two man group isn't effective enough. By far the best duo is warr/resto shaman so if that's what you're running don't add a third. But certain groups of 3 couldn't do it with 2. Like don't expect to effectively 2 man it with 120gph with a rogue and resto druid.
---
wintergrasp WAS that laggy and bad, it had a cap applied to it of 120v120 in 3.2. 
---
I see you don't know much about what actually was going on. 300v300 never happened because it CRASHED THE SERVERS. Remember when you'd try to go to northrend and it would tell you that the server was down but you were fine in outlands/kalimdor/ek? Yah that's why.
---
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. After they proved they didn't honor the loot rules you should have stopped raiding with them. Find a new guild that has and sticks to an established system.
---
That's like comparing apples to oranges.
---
According to this: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Honor_system_(pre-2.0_formulas)
---
It's just flat 100 with no ramp up.
---
Really didn't affect me at all so far.I can mount up fast as a next guy. It has it weakness like you cant use it while silenced (but you will be still in combat most of the time) or that small marginal mana cost but it just looks fucking awesome.
---
Pvping with it so far was no problem.Sure later on you can get another mount to avoid its weak points but as i said they are minimal
---
? Aquamentas is the quest reward from the linken chain that starts in un'goro, an off hand with just spellpower.
---
What is MOST disgusting about Blizzard's server performance? The fact that this level of lag did not occur on PRIVATE servers. What a fucking joke.
---
About 200 hk at 2 or 8honor each, and like 30hk at 100 to 250hk, better honor while questing in a bit lower lvl zones
---
Wintergrasp was 120 vs 120 max btw. Not quite 300 v 300 like people are having fights over Azuregos with.
---
Yea in a raid context and with blinders on.
---
I still think you should have rolled a priest.
---
I'M A FIVE STAR MAN
---
Is it safe to get dishonorable kills this week because we have 0 rank points?
---
Imagine being this fucking stupid....then imagine being a dick about it.
---
As a shaman, I am now eager to test this out. And it being unexpected, I'd imagine most mages will just panic, flail, and die, with some of them also still dying from blinking at the wrong moment.
---
the only atrocity in this thread is that attempt at a screen cap
---
It all counts, especially when we juggle so much in and out of the game. Have fun! Enjoy!
---

And We actually do, We do not however give two shit about your comments, so please leave. 
---
How self absorbed do You have to be to shot someone down that’s just trying to be happy over something that’s obviously Big to him.
---
can you stop repeating this? Wintergrasp got a cap of 120v120 with a queue system.
---
I've seen LF1M tank ud strat, Baron cloak and mount on reserve. Yo if I'm tanking for you what incentive do I have if you take everything...
---
I’m a noob and someone paid me 3 gold to be Horde bait. I’ll take it.
---
I use healbot. It can even set priority and which cleanse to use. It can also be set to dispell on click
---
Retail lags like this and has no MS delay
---
This is a vast oversimplification. I agree that block + revenge is great.  But it requires rage.  There are situations where you get very little rage on dungeon trash.  In those situations, it makes sense to put the shield away.  Caster packs in scholo are a good example of this.  
---
I don't doubt that you guys have grouped with some terrible tanks, but that's not the level we're discussing here.  We're talking about conscientious tanks adapting to situations.  Sometimes the shield doesn't help.  If you're 31 prot, it always does, but that vastly limits what else you can do at 60.
---
Raiders and their raid groupss*
---
We're not fresh 60s anymore. The orbs are the only reason for anyone to run strat live.
---
Why is the DPS cape that Ragnaros drops not considered BiS, while the Cape of Baron is the BiS?
---
Guys no matter what the engine is not designed for that. They can spin up the best servers in the world and it wont get better. They would have to redo classic from the ground up.
---
Hell even current MMOS struggle with these numbers.
---
Go back to pservers then.
---
The hive-mind of this sub has a lack of understanding of software development and refuse to be educated.
---
Does this count as /r/beetlejuicing  ?
---
Priest gear on our server cheap AF. The belt is going for 380g right now, and I don't think anyone's bought it for 2 weeks now at that price. 
---
Just really depends on whether or not the server in question has 1-2 guilds that have been getting the same loot over and over again (like ours).
---
&gt; those greedy fucks couldn't fucking care less.
---
When you stop viewing companies as faceless entities and more as a large collection of people with varied incentives you'll be less angry.
---
Do you really think the developers thought process was "Oh looks like large scale world PvP will be a bit laggy. What should we do about it? LOL Nothing, fuck em. We get paid anyway".
---
&gt;they did this almost out of spite
---
Do you think there was a meeting where the execs sat around and went "Oh fuck the players. Let's give them a shitty wPvP experience. We totally could deliver it but let's give them something shitty instead LOL. They'll totally pay us anyway."
---
Of course not. And if you genuinely think they did, then I think you're quite naive.
---
As alliance, getting full t1 is incredibly easy with the lower number of locks on this side. As horde, it might be a little tougher.
---
How much better is Core Hound Tooth than Gut Ripper?
---
So bascially what you are saying is. Let's let Blizzard off, this phase is not important because you don't really care for wpvp, so screw everyone else that really enjoys this period of open world pvp and world raid bosses.
---
But nah, SouthernOpinion doesnt care as he will just sit in his instances, as he can't level his alt without being ganked until BGs release and he might dabble in one or two before he get's bored and logs off and boots up minecraft
---
" But Are there any games that can support a 300 vs 300 battle?"
---
Brings up planetside 2 
---
"not comparable"
---
Am I on insane pills today wtf
---
Aye I think so, but that doesn't help anyone in a group where no one has done the quest-chain prerequisites!
---
Most lfg's for Strat Live on my server have orbs reserved or at least the 1st one going to the tank.
---
Yeah cause I don't need gold either. I'm just here for the *fun*.
---
As a combat sword spec, I'm trying to weigh Murder, Lethality, and Aggression.  At 56 I can't max them all, so which is most important?
---
They aren't teaching PHD students about print screen? Shame.
---
You're a meme spec that needs to be carried by the rest of the raid...
---
Wait until you get corpse camped and run out of soul shards. You are a free kill when you respawn and it takes like 5min to get ready to fight again
---
&gt; People like you will grow annoyed at consumers for giving feedback for the product they pay for and blindly defend a companies actions for pretty much no reason at all, especially when they’ve done extremely greedy actions fairly recently.
---
But you aren't giving feedback. Everyone is just saying 'This is bad', followed by 'This could easily be fixed' and finally "The only reason Blizzard aren't fixing this is because they're greedy.
---
The first is feedback and is worth saying. The second is based on no evidence at all. And the third is just standard reddit.
---
It means that there are more people not at level for Strat yet, which will be at some point Running Strat for upgrades, just like all of the "Non Fresh 60s" have done. There will still be plenty of groups doing Live for Gear and not putting Orbs on Res.
---
Pure DPS difference. CotBB has 15 Agility and 20 AP, while Rag cape has 22 Agi. Comparing the two, CotBB has 13 more total AP, but because Agi offers more than just AP, i'll convert the stats into Agility Equivalence Points (look up the Shadowpanther guide to understand this system more). In this system, 1 Agi = 0.5 AP, so CotBB has a total of 25 AEP while Rag cape has 22 AEP.
---
Honestly, the DPS increase, while there, may not be as important to you as having 120 extra health and more fire resist.
---
people are reserving items in SFK
---
Take and hold ground, like for example the entrance to a popular instance on a popular raiding evening?
---
Or perhaps all the camps setup at flight points.  I don't recall landing anywhere since honour went live where I wasn't instantly effected by shaman totems sitting there waiting for me.
---
Paladins are certainly powerful, and fear ward is incredibly useful.  But 3:1 odds kind of render those benefits a mute point.
---
You get 10% rep if the quest is grey to you...
---
&gt; Weapons are the biggest thing, especially for weapon classes! Raid weapons are comically better than anything a nonraider will get until rank 14.
---
At least in the case of TUF when AV comes out, it basically IS a raid weapon.  It's roughly equivalent to an AQ20 weapon.
---
On the plus side you save 1 inventory slot for the mount because its a spell from your spellbook, imo thats worth more than not being on the gcd which rarely matters anyway because to mount up you have to be out of combat.
---
It has collision detection on all players and npcs, and a lot more checks in pvp than wow but ok..
---
You should play the game however you best enjoy it. 
---
If you don't like tanking, don't tank. It's your game time, use it however you feel it best.
---
Nobody is "owed" a tank, a warrior is not obligated to tank just because they can. If I feel like tanking I'll tank, but if I don't feel like it bring me as a DPS, or don't bring me, there's plenty else for me to go do than something which I am not going to find fun.
---
If you're close enough to him when he pulls, or if he brings the mobs over to your drinking spot, then you automatically get put into combat.
---
Free transfers only give you a limited set of realms to choose from and I don't think there are any pvp to normal transfers among them.
---
First time you were told all rolls are equal and had your roll ignored, you should have withdrawn from your 'coalition' on principle.  Right there, in the middle of MC.  If they want your members so badly, they need to treat you as equals and not stooges.  You've shown that you are just going to roll over when they pass loot to their inner circle first.
---
If you aren't going to stand up for yourself, your guild, and your principles, you may as well quit because no one else is going to for you.
---
No it does not
---
Yep, meant sinister strike, my bad
---
&gt;You can also carry 2 of the same unique item if one is in your bank when you loot the other, I tested this deliberately.  
---
Are you sure? I had a Unique Ring (the random enchant one, dimly opalscent in scholo) in the bank and when it dropped again, I did not see it to roll on it. AND it rolled a different modifier too.
---
Never said you were sniping pacifically. I was just stating what I saw while stuck at work yesterday. I wanted to see some pvp battles since I couldnt be in any myself so I went to twitch and watched his stream. Whole raids were following his ghost waiting for him to spawn . That's shitty no matter who it is.
---
It's dynamic based on how many people in the zone. It's in place to reduce lag, and you'll probably see a lot of it in big wpvp engagements.
---
Maybe the hunter doesn't raid? BiS for the entire game.
---
Four times is very generous.
---
Yes sorry lol. Fixed
---
Maybe I am remembering wrong, but I transferred to Illidan during the Ulduar patch, but I remember that during those huge uncapped battles, my game would lag in the sense that my fps would be very low, but my spell cast and buff durations wouldn't be affected.
---
I don't remember the server crashing during the battle, but then again it's been almost 11 years.
---
I remember fighting you and your group all over the continents last night. It was all out war in kargath and winterspring
---
Thats called an Internship.
---
I never did this in p1 "for fun" but now it's the way to rank up and get the gear I'd set as my goal getting now. So I roam the world either alone or in a small group looking for any PvP targets that provide honor. Of course I prefer to fight equal opposition that's doing the same, and I've already had dozens of such great PvP encounters since yesterday, but it's not always the case and sadly I'd be gimping myself letting any potential HKs go on their merry ways. I guess I'm a count now, huh.
---
PVE nerd
---
Its confirmed. It will be by region
---
Yes, since the effects of DHKs are an immediate loss of RP.
---
Not to say blizz servers are the best but i didn't have an issue with lag. Aside from a couple posts to r/classicwow I didn't get dc once, only fps was muddy. Also i saw a ton of warriors, rogues and feral druids duking it out vs all class types.
---
Those are rookie numbers boy! You need to rethink your life priorities boy!
---
Stop using words you don't understand. This has nothing to the with "the engine". It wasn't possible in vanilla because the game was hosted on [this](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/WoW+Server+Blade+Teardown/9389), and it has since undeniably been proven possible with better hardware.
---
"bUt VaNiLla hAd LaG" 
---
There is a stark difference between shitty FPS in vanilla, and the servers immediately rubber banding when 60 people start fighting. 
---
Even then! Are you seriously trying to make an argument in favor of shitty latency?
---
Top 5 DPS in every fight, what carry is happening?
---
Actiblizzards maths r gud.
---
This is like the epitome of everything everyone hates about this sub...
---
This entire post, from the title to the picture of the screen, is so fucking obnoxious
---
There are way too many priests on our server
---
It's cool to see that the entire server showed up.
---
I was wondering last night why I could only the see NPCs in about half of the view distance I can usually see them in.
---
I mean, think of the kind of person who actually wants to be a slave.. I mean grad student, only to come out of 8 years of schooling as a postdoc making just bit above the poverty line.  Those folks ain't that bright.
---
Azashara .go underwater and fight murlocs and crabs while also farming golden pearls. Forgot their level but i think 48-52?
---
Oh, ya thats right. Idk why I read Aquamarine. After farming them for a while, I think they haunt me.
---
Hello mr squishy meet my friend aimed shot
---
BiS AF'
---
nope, just guessed and I was right. 
---
What I have yet to undertsand regarding these complaints about getting camped, why did you chose a PvP server? This isn't a critic I'm just interesed because I often see people complaining about being ganked.
---
If you take a right after entering BRM you can also jump down into MC. Don’t even need to go down to the window.
---
I've seen 5 orbs on two runs. It's posisble for almost eveyrone to come out with an orb, and you can still come out with two.
---
This is an excellent write-up thank you!
---
Do you normally die 10+ times a day outside pvp? I know what the repair bill is, I just don't die enough to phase1 content to need to pay it every day.
---
You forgot to include dick size breh
---
Barons cape’s stats: 
---
15 agility, 20 atp
---
Which translates to:
---
.5% crit, 35 atp
---
Cloak of shrouded mist stats:
---
22 agility
---
.8% crit, 22 atp
---
You’re basically trying to weigh .3% crit vs 13 attack power.
---
The issue is not too many people in one server. The issue is too many people in one area. This can happen on a low pop realm. Even your poor suggestion is not going to help the lag in large scale PvP. It will happen in alterac valley too.
---
And it’s because those gems can be a huge pain to get so there are tons of people who don’t have the UBrS key.
---
I used a free server transfer when blizzard offered them and the current server I’m on has absolutely zero lag. Hillsbrad was very fun last night. Maybe you guys should get off the high pop servers? I think activision sucks just as much as the next guy but you can’t say blizzard hasn’t provided solutions to overpopulation issues.
---
Saw that as well - not surprising
---
Russian bears living in a cave in Singapore ran Planetside 2 better than this autobody shop.
---
Are there any dishonorable kill targets in southshore?
---
Funny, if everyone bitching about lag and queues transferred to these 'dead' servers, they wouldn't be dead anymore.
---
The solution is right there.  And yet no one wants to move because they are afraid no one else will.  Suck it up buttercup.
---
You can't. Make a 360 turn and walk away.
---
I play on Faerlina and was 60 in 2 weeks. I feel like I know a ton of people and am always seeing familiar names on both sides (not talking about streamers lol)
---
Just to add my anecdotal experience
---
Buuuhuu. Rogues start crying every time at the slightest hint of disadvantage even when their class is so ridiculously overpowered in world PvP.
---
Not sure the size of your battles, but on Grob we've had literally 300 vs 300 at Hillsbrad, and the servers simply can't handle that. 
---
One time we had 400 vs. 250 in Undercity and it was so bad the servers rolled back.
---
Yeah, a guildie was like, "only a handful of alliance here ... OMG TAKE THAT BACK HUNDREDS HERE"
---
And when I landed, I was thinking, how could that be, then the world populated as I ventured out of town. lol.
---
But it always does that
---
I got downvoted hard for trying to warn people that it wasn’t spell effects and procs prior to launch. But hey, you can’t be reasonable on this caustic subreddit.
---
Yup. As a rogue, I'm just gonna pull. I accept this and have the tools to handle that situation.
---
We also did this on Sulfuras
---
Are you kidding? I love that. I'm the least stressed person in any raid especially since I learned to temper my dot spams and not pull aggro. I use maybe 3 buttons total, have my dots macro to spell sequence, have my curses macroed to control or shift, and good old shadowbolt takes prime spot in button 2. Whenever there is chaos, I'm usually able to escape it or I die last. I always soul stone the healer, so they rez me fairly quick. I barely have to work in a raid.
---
You killed the evil stream man xD epic gaming
---
They did it on a private server and just pretend they knew this 15 years ago. It's just a mean to enhance your life by getting some of that sweet sweet cred from people on the internet.
---
Lots of people claimed Classic beta was fucked because /sit macros didn't work like they did back then.
---
I had some warlock muse about how sweet it would be in P3 when you'd be able to summon people into instances again like you could in BWL in vanilla. Etc.
---
People just take their private server experience and apply that to their memory of what they did in vanilla even though most people probably didn't even play it.
---
Me, an intellectual, managed to wipe on Majordomo in actual vanilla and was chocked to find that UBRS isn't a 15 man raid anymore.
---
Best class and looking class in game
---
This is a special shitpost
---
This gives camping fp's a whole new meaning
---
Winterspring Saber
---
It is dispellable according to wowhead though: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=130/slow-fall  
---
Again, it's something to test and see if it works or not
---
Well blizzard acknowledges server issues normally, and calls out DDOS attacks when they recognize them. I don’t see why this would be any different...
---
People LOVE ruining the days of other players including streamers, and Herod is another top server and people love to fuck with people there.
---
I use grid
---
My favorite mages are the ones who don't even ask and just fill up the entire window with water.
---
And then there's those that give me 40-60 for raid and I don't even ask for more - I just go find another mage lol.
---
Because its same with mobs who give you experience .They are green on 60 level as well and pvp copied that Also ppl on those levels can kill you if they outnumber you so imagine group of 50s ganking 60 guy with "impunity'
---
HEY GUYS ASMON SUCK AMIRITE?! XDDDDD
---
Similar to me yesterday, gnomer group I'm lvl 31 but there is a lvl 42 and a 41. Now whenever I do a dungeon with a higher lvl I get told to hold back and even when I try to keep up the mobs are dead pretty quick however in this group one of them keeps bitching about DPS. I can't kill shit when it's already dead and I'm also picking up and completing multiple quests. Some people just don't think. I did a sm gy spellcleave the night before and it was a breeze even at my lvl.
---
&gt; Your using it to bypass native classic pvp.
---
By that argument, you should be running headfirst into every group of enemies you see instead of picking your fights carefully?
---
“In my case no one ended up dead”
---
“Well yeah, people were dying”
---
You seem incredibly upset
---
Because as people like to point out, not everybody in this thread is a network engineer, myself included, giving detailed feedback is hard especially since nobody who might even have experience in this field knows what *exactly* is going on behind the curtain.
---
But there are two clear cut examples of a product working as intended on a free fan-curated server, and a product malfunctioning on a legitimate pay to play server, that alone is enough to cause at least a concern and I’m sure most people would be satisfied with *some* level of a response from Blizzard.
---
&gt; or am i just unlucky woth my dps in groups? 
---
I think you might have hit the nail on the head here.
---
Might want to tell them to give you time for consecration, and buff them with Salvation.
---
It was like this in beta too. Wait til you see how broken "yesterday" and "last week" are
---
Faerlina here, completely agree with you
---
No you’re not alowed to pvp didn’t you hear that blizzard hates its player base because of. *looks at paper* server lag?
---
&gt;But the anti-corporate "all businesses and execs just want money money money and don't care about the product at all, there's no other reason why things are the way they are" schtick is wearing pretty thin IMO.
---
That is the point of capitalism though. (im not anti capitalist). Business exist purely to make money and fuck everything else. Thats not a schtick mate its how it is. Its funny because the commies that hate blizz support china in hong kong.
---
Even just watch any Crowbcat video and games are just dogshit now a days
---
Imagine looking at the specs of the servers that ran said Vanilla Servers.  
---
Then looking at the specs of the Classic Virtual Servers.  
---
the head scratching begins.  
---
You are now bald.
---
A majority of players will never even hit 60 my guy. Almost every run I do on my server of Strat Live blues get passed on. I know this is anecdotal, but my sample size is pretty massive. I play too much. I'd say there will never be more players pursuing gear from that dungeon than what weve seen over the past few months. It's being to taper anyways.
---
damn... I got 1200 in about 7 minutes ganking hunters in winterspring.
---
Oh, so they changed their mind? They used to say they would add cross-realm later to simulate the original release.
---
Carebear
---
&gt;If a priest can track me i want a mod that lets me heal.
---
It's this attitude that brought up retail. Where every class has a heal and interrupt.
---
If I enable my combat log and filter it to only show Stealth event I can accomplish the same thing that Spy does. That why everyone was running with their combat log on display in vanilla.
---
Spy is just a bit more in your face.
---
If hes farmin dm east he can get key for free and recipe for int food.
---
Sure, but the guide does tell you how to play up until that point as well.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
This is super helpful, thank you so much! I will definitely put this advice into use.
---
But, it is the way the Private server/Classic community is.
---
There's no changing that.
---
They're simply terrible people, and it won't change.
---
IIRC it take into account rank and talents.  
---
+healing doesn't counted in priorities.
---
The problem has also been the faction balance, I don't know what the official numbers are at this point but during leveling it felt like 70/30 Horde.
---
Yeah? Well I graduated in the top half of the bottom half of my college. I play hardly at all - just 13 hours a day after my shift as bank president which is 17 hours. And I just hit level 10 and got my first talent point (not 5 like the obvious try hard here) 
---
My advice? Play what you like.
---
&gt;Pretty much guarantee that if you understood how to fix this issue you'd have an extremely high paying job at Blizzard within the day.
---
pretty much guarantee you know nothing about development if you think anyone besides existing employees knows how to solve a problem in proprietary code. 
---
Also pretty sure there is no 'one issue' to be solved and it's a collection of factors that include the engine being optimized for 2000s machines and built with some assumptions about the internet and equipment at the time, legitimate mistakes which crept in left and right in their self described spaghetti code, cost cutting due to Blizzard being a corporation in 2019 not going for the best possible server infrastructure KNOWING that the software is shit and any 1% you can squeeze out of the hardware matters, social factors such as the huge fuck-up at launch with not nearly enough realms created whilst reservations were open, and finally many others I don't have the knowledge or experience to even consider. 
---
Do you know anything beyond 'there must be some qualified guy that can do it'? Because that makes you sound like you view the world as an idealistic child would. There's definitely an adult that can take care of this somewhere, and we should let them handle it, is what you're basically saying.
---
"Why is this neckbeard so popular?!"
---
\*makes 700th post about him on reddit\*
---
'I just don't understand!"
---
PHD but can't figure out a screenshot. Roger.
---
I mean, you're not wrong  =D
---
I'm not sure whether it's the case that they once said it wouldn't be cross-realm at the start, but they definitely have said it will be cross-realm at the start most recently
---
I transferred in the first wave before we new about its balance. Weirdo
---
Fear is straight up broken in classic.
---
"Damage may break this effect" is a fucking lie
---
Get DOTed with enough damage to do 80% of my HP even if I win. Then instacast death coiled which also hears the lock. Get feared helplessly for 10 seconds. Sometimes there's s seduce thrown in there.
---
Are they really cloud based servers? Oh ffs why can't we have nice things anymore.
---
no it doesn't have you even seen the scene?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuPghU-T-kE
---
Goodluck winning a 1v5... and then good luck winning the 1v5 after you die and accept a res at half health
---
yeah it was all fun and games til his 40 man group showed up and immediately sappered us haha
---
Coz it's not just some random ppl asking me kindly to join their group. It's the same people that use lfg addons. Same names, when you answer them no, they don't respond, but after 30 mins they write you the same shit.
---
Nah they had more. Because we're talking on a per realm basis.
---
Nice try...
---
I don’t think there’s anything in the UI yo can use to achieve this. I’ve seen it talked about a few times on here
---
Do you not see the servers right now and what is causing that? You think having basically 2 combat logs now would improve or drastically increase the current issue? No it cannot.
---
This is when I let them just die.
---
[Jame's Alliance leveling Guide - Chapter III (50-60) [old Version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_iii_5060_old_version)
---
i feel sorry for the casual players who fell for the pvp server meme.  the big pve servers have had a non stop battle in hillsbrad so the neckbeards can farm their honor the same as any pvp server but the lowbies can actual level without an ebin gank squad ruining their limited play time
---
It's 100%. No one can rank up until next week.
---
I love slowly putting 5 stacks of water into the trade window, and then waiting for the other person to accept the trade, and then put the 6th stack of water in there so that they have to accept the trade again.
---
Stop lying you only did it for that succubus booty.
---
&gt; how they're actively spending it.
---
Use it as capital to make even more gold. Buy cheap herbs during low traffic times and craft lots of pots (only those that are worth the effort though, depends on your server) for raid nights to sell at a markup I'm comfortable with. Atleast that's how I do it with Alchemy.
---
Then spend it all on some fun bullshit like /roll bets, sending low level players desperate for some gold on made up "quests" or just pay them to follow my friends around and get on their nerves for personal entertainment. 
---
Alternatively I level professions and get some gear on my alts.
---
Not to mention a number of us are taking longer than 7 days to get to 60
---
There are no guards on the airships.
---
I actually don't think it's possible to fix given the way the game is built so no definitely not an idealistic child lol
---
Sigh.
---
I'm not saying that world PvP is in an acceptable place. Blizzard shouldn't have promised open world PvP if it wouldn't work. Blizzard shouldn't have increased the population cap to a point where things like this could occur.
---
It's just that the premise that this is an 'Easy fix' and 'Blizzard are just not fixing this because they don't want to pay for more expensive servers' is just dumb.
---
You don't/can't solve problems like this with more hardware.
---
So the solution isn't just 'Spend more money on servers' as many people in this thread seem to believe.
---
I just downvote all streamer drama.
---
Same. I miss it when I pull aggro in dungeons now that I’ve respecced
---
it's a reckbomb build with heavy trinket + engineering use, it has nothing to do with being a shock paladin.  
---
He doesn't even have holy SHOCK.
---
Playing a server that's basically "Full" but not queued at peak time, there's definitely a give and take. I definitely recognize some people, especially the hardcore that are geared and play even at odder hours of the days. Tons of people fly by when leveling, but I definitely notice the occasional familiar player while going through the zones for quests and stuff, even at times recognizing familiar players of the opposite faction (PvE, not PvP though). The main drawback for a high pop server to me seems to be that competition for resources / quest mobs can be insane even with a relatively small number of people actually there, but the main pro to me is that other than really unpopular dungeons I'm able to have basically my choice of the lot for what I want to do when, with PUGs for group quests often being realistic and commonly available. I haven't branched out into the more specialized runs at the higher level just yet, but there still are "questing/full" runs of dungeons that pop out and tons and tons of groups looking to nail some specific loot.
---
&gt;and corruption
---
You're not allowed in our MC raids
---
Dat spell lag though
---
Not as far as I'm aware. That is a great suggestion though. If I decide to continue developing this addon in the far future I could check to see if this possible. It may be very difficult as I might have to check for cost increasing debuffs.
---
If he made a mistake then it was a calculated mistake from the moment he set that raid together.
---
Errr, I think people dislike him because he's actually a giant douche.
---
Not on my server, we've got some bad eggs but overall there's nice people around. I've helped and been helped several times now. More than I've been dicked over tbh.
---
Exposure! Look at all the guild influencers out there.
---
In dota, all this shit would be cheating and banable. You make an ad-don that scans the map to tell you were enemies are, or a mod that works out your enemies gold to let you know when best to gank them to gain maximum impact. Or even just one that remembers their items. These would all be cheats since it bypasses the games design in order to make it easier for one player giving them an advantage. 
---
Oh its alllll available to the player the mod is just collecting that information and displaying it. Its cheating. You gain that information about rouges in a meaningful way is cheating. Same as collecting and working out player net worth in dota would be. Its fine if you do it in a human way but you bypass the skill with a script. 
---
In dota the biggest advantage you can have is vision. Its the element of surprise. You are cheating that away by using spy. 
---
I know wow isn't dota but the pvp sides imo should share the same qualities. In regards to vision they totally do.
---
Well you’re EVEN MORE fucked
---
Nice tri,  wife
---
Playing a warrior currently. I have been doing mining / blacksmithing but don't really see the profit in that. (except the lionheart helmet which I probably will never be able to craft) 
---
So I have been thinking to unspec to Alchemy to be able to brew my own buff potions.
---
Is there any advantage of staying blacksmithing as warrior or should I consider switching?
---
Some tryhard farming method people try to copy from tryhard videos that was profitable on private servers but is far from profitable on live.
---
People don't think, people mindlessly copy.
---
Only 5 kids and 1 wife ? Pff casual. 🤣
---
It was a blast last night, especially in badlands
---
I’m regretting rolling on Remulos right about now
---
What flavor of boots is your favorite?
---
Those 3 DKHs pretty much negate all the work you did to get the HKs lol.
---
I downvote everything with Asmongold. This was downvoted as well.
---
what a fucking cunt lmfao
---
Distorted equals funny
---
I have no clue how you managed that. You're counting dungeon quests which is easier said than done. Finding groups as a hunter is hard as fuck as it is--it was nearly impossible to find a group for any 50-60 dungeon quests.
---
I completed nearly every single quest in each of the 45-60 zones and once I got to 57 I was pretty much left to dry. The only quests I had left were elite quests and dungeon quests. Since I wasn't keen on finding a group for an hour, I decided to just grind it out.
---
Really like your minimalist UI.
---
Same, I got my HoJ from Angerforge last night after doing some WPvP and deciding to get my lvl 54 ass into BRD haha
---
False
---
The point is that the people who join the group end up being people who don't need the item anyway. You're getting righteously upset for no reason.
---
PvE. There was a massive PvE bias among the game designers with a lot of them having an Everquest background. PvP always felt like an afterthought in World of Warcraft because it actually was.
---
Should do, want to tank UD Strat, 15g?
---
EVE online also, very publicly known, slows down time on the servers almost to a crawl to be able to handle more than 50ish players. Its just lag with a coat of paint.
---
I've made him cuss me out on his stream before.  Good fun, but I had to watch his stream to snipe him so it was a solid 5/7.
---
Jokerd is that you?!
---
High velocity also contracts time and distance
---
The difference is, WoW allows and encourages customizing and extending UI functionality, Dota does not.
---
You can fly hack pretty easily on Warmane, although you have to move at running pace to avoid being  detected. Not sure about Nost.
---
Blizz already fucked this phase up by not releasing BGs at the same time.
---
Never heard about it either.
---
Ud start at neutral with other factions
---
Its been a problem on retail for years, what makes you think they'll suddenly fix it for classic? They wont spend more money than they have to. They'll listen to people complaining about this for some time and then release WSG as a 'fix'.
---
Ironic shitposting is still shitposting
---
my bad.
---
Hey I was wondering if there would be a way to include BiS items which aren't based on stats ? 
---
For example: for a DPS druid BiS is a wolfshelm (all the way into TBC I think ) but it only has 10 spirit  so i don't think it would get suggested.
---
Also it seems like some quest items are being suggested as duplicates although you can only get one of them. This is probably my favourite wow related website for gear, thank you so much!!
---
Any tips on a decently balanced pvp server? Rolled on normal but realize my mistake. Thanks!
---
People are using too many addons which cause lag. Disable spy or whatever=no lag
---
yo, any tips on being a mage in wpvp? I usually just go in and pop my sappers and a few AE's then iceblock, but I often end up dying and losing out on that sweet honor.
---
Yeah cause all the alliance cry and moan then go to a server where they can be the zerg and its silence from the people who deal with the imbalance that becomes worse because of carebare alliance leaving.
---
I've had nights where I was stuck rez running for an hour then got off cause alliance were camping BRM. Didn't cry, didn't make any forum posts, just went on with my day. It happens to alliance and they server rage quit.
---
I really don't feel bad for yall being imbalanced, first off anyone that willingly picks alliance for any reason outside pve racials and buffs is the kind of person that deserves to be killed. 
---
Second off yall still zerg whenever and where ever you can. It was a cat and mouse game of alliance going to remote areas to zerg then getting upset when horde countered them. How do you expect to us to not death squad you when you're death squadding the most random places?
---
You almost AOE'd them all down though, if only you got to finish that blizzard...
---
So...you can just like attack org NPCs?
---
If a group wipes multiple times they are doing something wrong. Its the job for those that know the instance to explain it to others.
---
I started in vanilla but didn't reached 60. I raided in TBC and Wrath pritty serieusly. I also raided in modern wow, cleared most of legion mythic raids including Kil'jaeden wich is considered one if the hardest bosses ever. I also reached 2.2k in arena so I got some reflexes.
---
I would not consider myself a new of noob player.
---
But when we did UBRS I would wipe the group if a party member didn't point out that the orcs before Jed do a knockback that could trow me into the Leeroy whelps. 
---
My point is not knowing 1 little thing could be a wipe and a 20 minutes corpse run. Better save that sorry.
---
It seemed pretty balanced on Faerlina for most of the day, then at night the filthy cretins came on and it was definitely an Ally smashing field. The horde just grossly outnumbered Ally everywhere we went, except maybe Hillsbrad, but that shit too laggy and a bunch of people are trolling for DHKs. Fuuuuuck that!
---
Admirable how you make those assumptions. I mean only reason to kill Asmon in videogame is sniper who is jealous of the money he makes amirite?
---
&gt;Not his fault you probably have the personality of a doorstop.
---
Dunno. While i got nothing against Asmon, i think doorstop's have more important jobs than he does. I think he does admirable job of playing kindergarten for large amount of people and hopefully he manages his millions right so he never has to stop. Good for him.
---
I think it is maybe because you get more hardcore mature players at that hour.  These are the players that might understand their class better and be more dedicated with running instances.  The downside of late night runs (especially on weekends) is sometimes you do get that players that are like "I am soooo drunk/high right now".
---
Generalizing I just think that a lot of casuals don't spend as much time in game and therefore aren't pushing into the late night hours unless they are not in the same time zone as server.  Also I suspect that any younger players (which can be more immature) aren't on that late also because of parent aggro.
---
Why are you rolling of they're not honouring rolls?
---
I logged on in Tarren Mill, tried to check my mail, and it literally took nearly 5 minutes for my automail opener to open 7 payments I had gotten from the AH, as players ran in place and clipped by around me the entire time. Didn't even bother trying to see how the PvP was, as soon as my mail finished processing I just jumped onto an alt that I was leveling in Ashenvale and didn't bother trying to pvp til the servier died down late last night.
---
I don't crave honor so badly that I'm willing to struggle through rage-inducing, impossible lag to get it.
---
Oh no doubt he’s without a doubt my least favorite wow player. Just joking about how vocal the sub is in hating him.
---
Ahh, thanks for the clarification &lt;3
---
Ugh, I'm tired of hearing the "Vanilla Experience" as a justification for shitty server infrastructure, which is what's causing this mess. 
---
Of course World Bosses are gonna have several top guilds from both factions competing for the kill. Of course that's going to mean hundreds of players will be bunched up together in the same zone. This was obviously anticipated by everyone involved, and saying we should have to tolerate lag that renders what is arguably the most fun part of the game unplayable because "that's the Vanilla way" is just asinine. 
---
The original vision that brought us World of Warcraft would not want to see the genre-defining spectacle of large-scale world pvp ruined by poor server infrastructure. Unfortunately, this is just another sign that Blizzard is no longer the company that cares about making great games. They're just going to milk this for everything it's worth while prioritizing their budget for whatever shitty micro-transaction ridden game that they're working on. 
---
This is the reason I'm not intent on investing any time or money into any other Blizzard game. At least Classic is a vestige of a time when Blizzard was a great company, and we get to enjoy most of it despite Blizzard's perennial efforts to prevent that from happening.
---
He is doing it to himself, saying others are doing something shitty (stream sniping) when he is in full control of who has access to where/what he is doing in game.
---
But reserving items makes it likely that the server as a whole gets geared up faster, since you will probably have a more even spread of classes in dungeon runs. It is the efficient way to do things.
---
Who said anyone is being pushed out? Did you read the whole post?
---
tl;dr: Be upfront with your group if you are new, dont be afraid to ask questions, and dont be mad at someone for being upset that you're playing poorly - it's natural.
---
They should either fix the servers or lower the sub cost
---
all could proc on their normal proc chance on same strike
---
&gt;but you disagree that Blizzard can do much or anything to address it?
---
What can they do? Legit reasoning here. Take the game down and rewrite it from scratch? It would literally take years. We should just ask for WoW 2 at that point. Makes more fiscal sense for them to entertain that idea than to start over on WoW Classic.  
---
Throwing more hardware is not the answer. This is like buying a new 64bit processor when they came out to play Vanilla WoW. When Vanilla WoW's executable didn't even utilize the 64bit architecture. WoW as a software would not even be able use the extra "power" from upgrading from 32 to 64.  
---
This would be like taking a game made for xbox 360. putting that game disc into an Xbox one X. and wondering why it's not in 4k 60fps with modern graphics.  
---
lag in gaming is a fact of life. Just like rubber on tires going bald during races. it's the nature of the beast. There was always and always will be lag in online video games. To expect otherwise just shows naivety towards the hobby and the technology.
---
Carebears are on PvE servers, at least he's playing PvP.
---
I am 55 and already gearing for pre raid BiS in BRD so that train has left for me.
---
You can rely on me &lt;Aftershock&gt;
---
&gt; there are still private servers running right now.
---
yeah, but only small, tame ones. Don't be growing too much now, you don't want to end up like Nostalrius and actually present a challenge to Blizzard's dogma.
---
I’ve only really started watching Asmon since Classic launched and I actually like his content and find him pretty funny at times, why is he so disliked? This is a genuine question if there’s things he’s done I’d like to know..
---
And now he’s a cult leader
---
Undeads shouldn’t have to /wave etc logically it seems they should be able to speak to the alliance. I could be wrong, I don’t follow the lore closely. Even all the horde npcs have no problems speaking to the alliance.
---
I've said it many times, but blacksmithing is the worst profession by far.  Drop BS for alchemy and don't look back.  The only reason to be a BS is if you get the plans for lionheart helm, or are a world champion duelist and want the trinket that makes you fear immune for 30 sec.
---
Tanking is hard - doing it optimally without any kind of research is very difficult.
---
I hear you and agree nobody should force you to tank. That was not the point I was trying to make. Maybe I did not articulate it clearly. 
---
I have an issue with warriors that "do not tank" as this just seems strange to me. You are playing a class designed to be able to tank, but instead, they refuse to ever tank because they want to play a DPS class. Which is cool, I get it. But if that's the case then play a class that is not also expected to tank from time to time. I just do not see the value of bringing a DPS warrior who refuses to tank to a dungeon. I would just invite a class with more utility, or a player willing to do what is needed for the group to succeed.
---
Love spy. Fuck the stealth Gank. Pop perception and a nade and get fucked. Lol
---
It's beautiful.
---
Nahh
---
Blacksmithing doesn't offer any BoP gear and, like you say, isn't very profitable unless you happen to luck into getting the Lionheart helm recipe. Guilds like to have a couple dedicated guild blacksmiths (particularly 1 armorsmith and 1 axesmith) for funneling recipes to and crafting useful stuff like nightfall, and if your guild doesn't already have one, they'd probably appreciate you biting the bullet and taking on that role. That's pretty much it. Alchemy is way more profitable.
---
I would go normal combat swords until 40 then respec and buy double of those epic daggers that are usually cheap. Think it's called gutrippers.
---
Try get a good sword too for hemo you kinda wanna be both dagger and sword at same time.
---
I had the same debate with my warrior and ultimately settled on mining/engineering and then picked up herb/alch on my alt. I think mining is good for farming instances and obv crafting for engineering, and engineering is really good on warriors for making bombs and things that can help with aoe pulls.
---
As you identified, blacksmithing won't really make a lot of money and while engineering also doesn't make a lot (sometimes you can sell bombs to other engineers who don't want to bother crafting their own) but it at least provides more utility.
---
"...Okay, dude."
---
You need 16 hours per day of pre-made BG grinding for twelve weeks straight. Doesn't matter when you start.
---
/console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 4
---
Zooms our way further and really useful for wPvP as well as giant dungeon/raid bosses. Also blink and Ice Block are your two CC counter spells. Ice block removes harmful effects on cast and blink removes certain movement impairments. Frost mage build and make sure you level fireblast and maybe scorch with it to weave into your rotation for a quicker spellcast
---
I don't know, there's people everywhere right now. I was getting ganked repeatedly by legions of horde in the BADLANDS of all places (I'm lvl 40 so I give no honor???)
---
Welcome to nearly every class in Classic in raids.
---
Warriors are the farthest from one-button-spam, but it's really just BT/WW/SS+HS as rage allows.
---
Being scared and nothing happening?
---
Doesn't make the stream snipers any less shitty.
---
While I agree, and am normally open to explaining mechanics and stuff like that, there is a point where some of the responsibility falls to the new player to do some research on their own. Go to Youtube "Zul'Farrak dungeon guide" and take 10 minutes to educate yourself before hopping into a dungeon. This isn't a Yes or No issue, you can help newer players while also expect them to help themselves. There is enough information these days available that there really isn't an excuse to be completely unaware of how to play your class or what to expect in a dungeon/raid. Now executing, that takes time and practice.
---
Usually they'd be bad, but they have instant effect so afaik in the first week they don't matter
---
Cht is a worse mh than gut gore ripper because backstabs scale off weapon damage.
---
Nah pala + warri is better because of cleanse. But ally sucks so yeah shaman + warri bis 🤣
---
In that situation I would have recommended using it for like 5 days straight to get used to it. One and done will make you feel like you’re barely strapped in for the ride and you won’t have a good time
---
No nutritional value.
---
In order to get to R14 'all you need to do' is be in the top ~0.3% of players by Honor every week, for multiple weeks. Not sure on the exact number of weeks, that's probably findable with a Google.
---
If you started in a year would it still be possible? Sure. It might be harder though, as you'd be competing against other people with all the PvP gear already. But what you need to do remains the same:
---
Be in the top ~0.3% of players by Honor every week, for multiple weeks.
---
New player here, just got ganked for the first time. A 19 rogue got my 22 druid, they surprised me in the middle of the lake in redridge. Any advice on how to prepare for and handle situations like that?
---
Aep is kind of suspect for the reason you lay out and because its parameter values are internally inconsistent, but it gets a basically correct answer most of the time while being really simple. You should probably keep stacking hit until youre above the crit cap, i.e. until your effective white crit rate is probably within sampling error of your raid buffed character sheet crit. With mongoose, raid buffs, and a mix of good blues and mc gear, youll be losing several points of crit if youre only around yellow cap, so adding a point of hit adds a crit and a hit.
---
Same, the majority of people I play with are friendly and try their best.
---
It's the 1 in 100 that are bad, anti social players who can't handle criticism and they think they CAN'T get better, so they don't even try.
---
hey you did some pvp, grats!
---
You sound like a happy guy
---
That UI though! looks awesome! :D What is it?
---
I dunno I find this kind of silly, I don’t see the problem of trying to put together a group that doesn’t want the item you want. Especially if there’s other things in the dungeon people could want but you only need that thing because at that point, if it drops and you don’t get it that run was essentially a waste of time. I also don’t understand with “disagreeing with the practice”. Why? If everyone agrees it seems fair enough. Yeah it’ll be slower to get people but that’s a clear and obvious trade off for anyone doing this. I mean you can do what you want in the end, I’d probably just tank the run if I didn’t need the item, I was just looking for some insight.
---
Nah, its normally my name but it got yoinked. I'd never play that class with their good dps and extremely efficient farming methods... jerks.
---
I always forget to hide UI when I take these kinds of pics.
---
12 hours every day, 7 days a week, having to be on for the audience and interacting with comments and such, sounds like hell. That would be $840 - that is not "extremely well paying". The median wage in the US 2019 for a 40 hour work week is $900 a week, so $840 a week for 12 hoirs 7 days per week is less then half the hourly rate of the median US income. Im not sure it even makes it in to the "well paying" category. Extremely well paying would be at least that weekly wage paid per day, for an 8 hour shift.
---
Hahahah I know right!?
---
Not my proudest moment but I've tried meth... got higher on Adderall lol.
---
I have been feeling the same. Thanks for backing me up. Was unsure of switching
---
i cant say the. hotfix fixed that only the lowest guid got lost aggro
---
I couldn't get Grid to work, but Grid2 works like a charm. I don't know what's actually different between them.
---
Rattlegore is slightly outweighed by horde and a little campy but definitely playable. Come join us and help us fight back! FOR THE ALLIANCE! IGN: deltaninethc
---
Kromcrush is pretty balanced, slightly favored towards horde
---
you do you, im hopping next fresh as soon as it  comes. This is garbage.
---
Druid or out Kappa
---
Holy shit! He's a fucking joke lmao, good name he picked for himself.
---
Do you have a job?  Do you like to go out every once in a while?  Do you have household responsibilities?
---
If you answered yes to any of these questions and cannot devote 14+ hours a day to only PvPing then no you will not be able to get r14.
---
Why is this regurgitated like people aren’t aware of the nuances of a pvp realm?
---
DHKs take effect immediately and reduces your RP.
---
Since it's first week and everyone has 0 RP, DHKs are effectively meaningless.
---
Sick
---
Fair enough. 
---
&gt;anyone on reddit 
---
make that anyone outside of blizzard's employees that have worked on the project. All others fall into the 'might be able to solve it, if it's even solvable' category.
---
why do you think stream sniping is bad? i dont get this logic?
---
A lovely adventure of a night elf continues :) Druid life, meeting new people, exploring Teldrasil, finding rares...and most importantly having fun with others :)

Code isn't that spaghetti anymore, [this has been addressed in the reddit Q&amp;A during Blizzcon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/dqvbqd/blizzcon_rwow_interview_with_steve_danuser_and/). There's not much left of Vanilla code in current retail codebase, most of it has been rewritten over time. 
---
Cases like the backpack are the exception, not the rule.

&gt; **Question: We had a hard time narrowing down our questions for you [Frank]. I think both of us work in tech. So I think this one we really want to ask which is like, WoW has a 15 year old code base. What parts of working with that have been the trickiest over time? Like is there anything in the engine itself that is just, like, if someone says, we have to work on, I have this idea and you're just like, that is going to be a nightmare? Is there anything like that, that you can tell us about?**
---
&gt; Answering: Frank Kowalkowski
---
&gt; * Before working at Blizzard, he had the same assumptions those outside the company do about the codebase.
---
&gt; * When he was hired, the codebase was 10 years old if the Alpha was included in the timeline.
---
&gt; * "I was surprised at how much, when I was going through the code and reading a lot, about how much of it had been rewritten since the very launch of WoW, I'd say at that time was half the code has been completely rewritten."
---
&gt; * To enable Sharding, the entire way the game puts players into the game had to be rewritten.
---
&gt; * "I'd say the trickiest thing is how dynamic the code is to meet the needs of the game. There's very little code left from the day that we shipped WoW initially. And that's got benefits to it. And in the sense of it is adaptable, and we're able to do a lot with it. So I think it's been quite a ride."
---
LMFAO bro u serious /thread
---
Sell elixir of the mongoose.
---
Ahh yes that was some fun crippling lag
---
I don't even mean optimally, I mean looking up simple stuff like "what is tanking wow classic" or "how do I tank wow classic."
---
Having the same issue. Not looking good. Gotta log on early  and mana up hiding in  bushes lol
---
I am not even part of a guild that would force me to take that role. Guess its time to switch
---
And if you don't sit in those queues as a penalty for being the popular faction, when all of us alliance unsub, you will have no alliance to fight in the world or fight in BGs. Have fun dueling yourselves ;D
---
good thing it doesn't do anything week 1
---
They changed the enitire game engine in Cata. Would expect that things like this would be fixed and code more efficient from there on. And since the Classic is running on the same engine...
---
I guess they didn't plan the game to have massive scale world pvp going forward from Cata, so why even write the game code in mind with that?
---
Hunter is the easiest one when you have grenades, net or charge helm. When you get in their deadzone just use frostshock and totems. No cl or something so he will never get out of his deadzone = win.
---
Yes maybe, my point is that after he had done it he lost control.His rant lacks conviction. Like he seem to be saying those things while being not sure if he should be saying them. This is not a stronk man asshole rant saying " I'm the Man you cant touch me!" . Its  cornered puppy rant saying " Please dont touch me! I'm the Man!".  Just a though of mine after watching the vid :). Doesnt have to be true!.
---
Wow classic is ruined.
---
Representation of Alliance trying to PvP on most PvP servers. 10 vs x2-3 their numbers
---
Thanks for your input! exactly what I have been thinking!
---
I agree with you, and I'm not opposed to helping new players - I feel like I said that several times in the post.
---
Game's aren't all about anyone is what I am trying to say. It's okay for noobs to be noobs, but adversely, it's okay for good players to be good. If LeBron James doesn't want to waste his time to come to your local park to play a game of pickup with you and your friends, he's not an asshole.
---
But with that logic if someone said that, you would just auto kick them, Even if they are of lvl?  I might agree if it was a tank, but theres no issues for dps or a healer. But thats just my opinion
---
Rank isnt determined by the raw honor you have, rather, it's a kind of complex system based on the honor you gained in the past week compared to the honor  everyone else in the server gained in the past week. So you can never get "behind" in the chase for rank 14, it doesn't matter when you start as long as you keep grinding once you start (because rank decays if you don't continually increase it)
---
jesus fucking christ
---
Mograine aint that dead.
---
I made thousands just by the traditional way of crafting pots. Timing and knowing the market is the key here. It depends on the server, though.
---
you traded improved gouge for 1 point in seal fate? why lol?
---
*laughs in pve server
---
tukui.org
---
Yes I'm only 22. I like pvp. Don't even mind getting ganked from time to time but damn I at least want a chance to be able to defend myself. 50-60s running around ganking the low levels is really annoying.
---
Not true, every time I was attacked yesterday on my lvl 54 it was always atleast by 2 alliance, but I’ll give you that horde did seem to eventually our number them with the bigger raids after 15 or more mins of craziness.
---
I didn’t have many issues. I saw some characters skip around but it was def better than I thought it was going to be!
---
I just don't understand what Blizzard was thinking.  Obviously with the massive populations they are allowing on the servers and releasing honor without releasing the world PvP objectives or BGs was going to cause this.
---
All they had to do was release the world PvP objectives at the same time as honor and everyone would have went to those zones to play real PvP.
---
I didn't rush to 60 and and have been lvling a couple different characters that are now both in the 30s.  The game appears like it is going to be unplayable for me for the foreseeable future.  Guess it's time to reroll on a PvE server.  I honestly should have known better than to roll PvP but I wanted to play horde and the servers with good horde populations are PvP from what I could tell.
---
A lot of people I know are quiting the game because they're already sick of it. 
---
Hope blizz will release real pvp soon so this charade for 'muh classic feeling' that a few want, will stop soon.
---
For now I just plan on keeping it on github. When I'm more comfortable with creating releases I'll consider adding it to CurseForge.
---
Does it make any difference whether I collect 500 or 10k honorable kills this week, given that I won't be able to play in the next 3-4 weeks? I will progress one rank anyway, right?
---
What if somehow I manage to get the absolute minimum 25 HK each week to get ranked? The weekly decay would still diminish most of this week's work, right?
---
Lol I don't see any raid bosses in hillsbrad
---
Do you actually use it all? I think I need to report this water fraud to the mage council.
---
Coming from the dude who's suggestion to help combat faction imbalance was a paladin casting blessing of freedom and running into the middle of the fight....
---
I am trying my best not to get salty, but how "accomplished" horde act over "winning" the faction war makes it tough.
---
We get it, you decided to play on easy and you get more rewards than we do.  Quit acting like you earned anything.

Genuine q: who is better for pvp alliance or horde?
---
What a twist. Yeah, go fuck yourself then.
---
Yeah, I've played for a long time but I still google basic stuff like this everyday. I feel like most people who post on WoW Classic subreddit are the type of people who use social media religiously. Kind of like the people who post on instagram everytime they go to the gym, and focus on taking pictures instead of actually working out...
---
I disagree. Every piece of gear from 1-60 is in tatters to show off your elbow bones and your posture is terrible.
---
&gt;I could be a scumbag and RESERVE ALL BOE GREENS AND EPICS AND WHATEVER but I’d rather everyone get some gold and shit.
---
That's not really being a scumbag if you just reserve an item or so. Everyone usually needs drops from the dungeons, but tanks get done with them much faster than everyone else, which means that they mostly join the dungeons to help others. While that is good of them, it's not a base expectation. Tanks can work to get some benefit out of a dungeon just like everyone else, and if that benefit is an orb, so be it.
---
People sell marathon runs like BRD arena and such.
---
True, but since PvP wasn't really the focus during development, there were a lot of design and technical decisions that went against the ability to have large scale outdoor battles.
---
I suspect that those decisions are backfiring now, with range calculations, line of sight calculations or validation of player movements (to avoid teleportation cheats) and similar systems are scaling terribly with a high player count.
---
Sure if you think that way go ahead. I just asked myself why people complain. 
---
Any more insulting you wanna throw at me or are we good mate?
---
Why do you care about not being to compete with nolifers for a pvp rank when u obviously werent going to compete with them anyway?
---
Ah I see that i have upset you by agreeing with you. 
---
Let me let you in on a little secret, this math has been done a million times in a million games all over, and in fact it has been done in real life with people really dying. I agree with you that if you are outnumbered and don't have a big enough force equalizer you will die. period, full stop. 
---
I commented on a granular balance issue, and you think that I feel accomplished about somebody else winning fights by using unit number advantage? I'm not here to invalidate your emotional state. I'm here to randomly comment about very small game logic and/or game theory topics and then move on with my day.
---
I said that exact thing last night in my Mara run.  If tanks pull quikly I am using water per pull.   Lets GO!!!
---
Also he really speaks to neckbeards. The man is a multi millionaire because of world of warcraft which let’s be real is everyone’s dream
---
If you got nothing to do, Free Orb is like 30g.
---
Or to put it the other way round, the only way you're already 60, is if you
---
a) significantly sacrificed your social life for wow or,
---
b) don't have a social life (not judging) and devoted most of your free time to wow or,
---
c) don't have a job or,
---
d) took a fortnight off work
---
yeah, but then there's some melees who don't need/want (or are willing to wait) and by advertising for only casters, you're cutting them out and vice versa.
---
and besides, saying you'll only take casters is no different than saying HoJ (or w/e) is reserved. you're still basically removing an entire dmg class from the run
---
Thats not worth not having fear ward and stoneform
---
Well if I continue to get 1 frame per 5 sec in W pvp i'd say battlegrounds hands down.

T0 dungeon blues is an EPIC length quest chain for every class. I love it.

yeah anyone not understanding his popularity probably just don't get why any stream is popular. I probably can't watch 5minute of him with that said, but that's a me thing.
---
That's just freaking awesome.
---
Kromcrush
---
Yep his streams are 8 hours of him talking and playing/watching video requests.  It's actually really impressive how much he talks and keeps it entertaining.  He also says exactly what he thinks and does not give a fuck of it's politically correct or not.  He has his own strong opinions on topics and doesn't shy away from it.  I think that plays a big part in why people like him.
---
Because you can check your honor tab and others honor tabs...
---
depends on the server, in my experience horde more often than not though
---
Shamans do have spirit based mana regen in combat, just have to follow 5 second rule. Take the point that others may have talents that make spi more useful for them, so not disputing whether it's a shaman item or not, but as a levelling shaman I was confused by the notion spirit is useless for shamans.
---
you forgot to tell people how many confirmed kills you have.
---
Yea, you dont get 30k regular viewers on a game where 5k is usually 2nd if you're not good at what you do.
---
PS2 was so great, remember alot of epic battle for the modèle of the map
---
Buffs only put you in combat/generate threat if the target is in combat. With that said I don't know if Well fed would give you aggro if the tank had pulled, and not generated any threat on a target, all after you got pulled into combat.
---
Because he's not the kind of nerd that would challenge someone for having multiple interests and a varied social life

The classic blizzard method of half assing everything

We are almost 3 months in... Not sure what you expected.

Who would ever run just angerforge? I couldn't convince even friends to just run angerforge over and over for me.
---
Felt like Normandy questing in hillsbrad last night on thunderfury. Raids on both sides, then me, a lvl 31 trudging behind enemy lines to for my quests
---
He plays an arrogant high ego character for the stream, and people dislike him for it.  What people dont get is that asmon is a character. We have heard him on Esfand stream and its just not like when he is streaming.
---
There was no patch. You know it came out because the game has honor and blizzard told you it was coming out.
---
you're talking arguably the best player in the word.
---
I get what you are trying to say, but it's not the same.
---
Was more looking for people to explain the reasoning behind their choice - but yeah I should not have included "POLL" in the title.
---
Getting off the road does help a little, I've noticed patrolling 60s on roads.
---
That sucks it'd be kinda cool to be able to be an outlaw
---
There was guy in general chat in hillsbrad yesterday making a raid full of people with Goblin Sappers to just charge into the job together and nuke all of the alliance at the same with them.
---
It's worth it if you're a druid and can only be a Nelf
---
Can I just say that I'm really frickin tired of people opening up trade without saying a damn word, like they're just entitled and expect to get whatever they want.  Then I'm like..yes? And they just say "water" or something.  They act like it's a huge problem to ask nicely.
---
To anyone who does this - Put your ego aside, use your fuckin manners and ask politely, it's not difficult.
---
I had some cool large scale pvp fights in gadgetzan and even though most people were 60 and I didn't stand a chance it was really fun. But getting killed by rogues camping 45-50 level zones is getting pretty old quickly.
---
u/vredditshare
---
I don't agree with reserving on my hunter. But for some reason, all other DPS in my groups just happen to be mages and warlocks.
---
I do get frustrated with zoomers who are constantly like "GO!" "hurry up, PULL!!" and pulling stuff themselves and trying to go go gogoo faster faster. Luckily, I've rarely seen that on Classic and it's more of a retail problem. 
---
On Classic I mostly get the DPS Warriors who are geared to death and don't want to watch their aggro so they die constantly and call everyone noobs. They obviously have good gear and know how to DPS, but they get blindsided by the fact that the tank just can't hold aggro for whatever reason.
---
At the end of the day, I want everyone to be better skilled players, and I honestly don't mind playing with new people, hell if they are honest about it, I'll teach them the ins and outs of any dungeon for several hours. But thats because they were upfront about it. You go into a dungeon expecting it to take x Amount of time, and when new/bad players make it take X+4 hours, you get pretty pissed. But if you go in and everyone says "first time here, can you help me out?", now your expectation is Y amount of time, so it's not that big of a deal.
---
Is that unreasonable? I'm getting roasted in this thread and I think it's possible I'm not very good at expressing myself and coming off as an asshole elitist.
---
Do you refer to the \_\_retail__ / \_\_classic__ file structure? It doesn't have to be spaghetti, even if the client was never designed to do that in the first place. I expect the dev team to have a lot more maturity about clean code and best practices now than they had back then with the pressure to release the original game.
---
Again its my personal stance. I dont tank for groups with reserved loot. Any loot.
---
 BoP, BoE, recipies, mats, keys, dont care.  I dont agree with reserved loot, you cant change my mind.
---
I'm pretty noobish when it comes to raiding but that's pretty bad.
---
Definitely wouldn't wanna run with
---
you know it came out when suddenly roving gank squads simultaneously erupted in every zone all over the server
---
🤢🤢🤢
---
I haven't seen one either.  I was running around on my druid earlier and since I constantly change sets, how much of my mana bar is depleted with each heal can vary wildly.  A nice visual way to see that would be cool.
---
The fix in Vanilla was battlegrounds
---
I couldn't say it didn't, but my personal experience is the same as yours. I participated in a 2 or maaaaybe 3 raid wPvP group max, and wPvP was my bag. Darkspear server
---
He means joker. Not you. Why are you the way you are?
---
And the best players usually won’t play with bad players
---
&gt;level my lock in retail.
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
Well you posted the pic with the main target of the "streamer bad" sheeps, if you had posted like a sea of corpes in brm nobody could had cared.
---
And yet, they're top tier aesthetics.
---
I commend you staying and figting cause i woulda noped the hell out of that.
---
I'm a software developer, you don't have to act like all of this is a dramatic burden for them. This is all normal practice for literally every game being developed.

Through my years of playing wow I managed to have a total play time across all my characters of 5 years.

But then I realize I've done something that mattes for 5 years, South Park taught me that.

Im happy being unemployeed living at my moms place, with a strict sleeping schedule with 4 hours a sleep everyday to effictively grind for 20hours per Day.

---
I feel sorry for you MR CEO, i know u'd switch life with me anyday. Enjoy your noob level, i already got all classes at 60, u filthy casual.
---
between you and me, i really would like to know in your option why it is bad? i am open to hearing your side and am willing to change my mind, but i dont see how stream sniping is a "bad" thing?
---
I'm just interested in why you think you're fooling anybody.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
classic horde. They fight with fair number, lose , then cry and add 30 more people to ensure victory
---
That's why he said for raids fury/prot is where it's at - Worldbuffs, full consumes etc. means tons of threat if you're DW tanking, good bit more than deep prot even from my experience.
---
But **fuck** Fury/Prot for dungeons, it's so inflexible ugh. I really dislike tanking anything but bosses as Fury/Prot. You need way more damage taken for Fury/prot to get it going, and you won't use full consumes in dungeons so...You just feel gimped.
---
I see a lot of players in the 50-52 range that forget to do Searing Gorge. Make sure you knock that out before head to the popular Un'goro/Early Felwood areas.
---
Have you tested this and know it for a fact?
---
that certainly doesnt prevent you to continue drinking till your mana is ok for the pack.  Kind of a dumb point really.
---
Imagine getting so mad about a video game and trying to come back with the most overused word of 2019.
---
"This is what you asked for. You think you did, but you dont"
---
People who act like #nochanges also means bringing back the hardware, software and internet limitations of 2005 are so obnoxious.
---
You've failed to notice the original post is a troll for karma though
---
Well majordomo is also spanish for butler, right?
---
Did a Tarren Mill run yesterday and wracked up 905 HKs but 5 DHKs.
---
At this level does DHKs really kill my honor/rank or is it only a problem when you're pushing higher ranks?
---
and why people hate him. opinionated people are only tolerable if they have a decent sense of consistency, Asmon just seems like a reactionary (if a bit light-hearted for that term)
---
That's all mages know how to do, they did it from 20-60 so why stop there?
---
[Gutterspeak] fuck you
---
You’re correct that I don’t personally do that. In general, I find it rude for people to whisper each other out of the blue. I think it’s acceptable for someone to ask in general chat channels if someone is willing to provide those services, but I think it’s kind of dumb to try and randomly get someone to do something for you.
---
Will PVP be this shit until the BG's are released? My main is 48 now and leveling in zones is nearly impossible, getting ganked before running 100 yards in any direction, FP's in contested areas are constantly being camped by full raid groups. Is this a p2 release hype or will it be instance grinding from here till 60? :&lt;
---
You can get to 225 for under 100g on my server and get to 275 for maybe another 100g. It's the push to 300 from there that costs a lot of thorium, so I would say 300-500g depending on thorium prices on your server.
---
I honestly always feel so awkard being the guy that "knows more" in the group cause I'm so afraid to accidentally come across as the know it all asshole or sarcastic and not actually trying to be helpful. 
---
So far, people usually take things as helpful but I definitely have seen people react to others with "I know how to play" and stuff like that.
---
What is a back end server code ?
---
Yeah people don’t seem to realize that the 40man pvp teams are pretty inefficient when it comes to gaining honor. It does make for some pretty damn cool battles though, assuming minimal lag which is unlikely.
---
Last night I spent 1-2 hours with a roaming 40man getting 1-3 honor per kill. Then I split off into a 5man group and started getting 40-50 honor per kill, on average. This morning I was solo and getting 150-200 honor per kill. 
---
# of HKs don’t matter. Honor gained matters. The honor gained is split amongst your entire group.
---
I'm too low lvl to test it. Have you tested it? :-\]
---
Yep, to the point where most 60s who raid have their hearth set there.
---
We didn't even get to see if she managed to aggro anyone :(
---
I do Stealth runs for my rogues all the time.  I’ve done runs for warriors in the past.  You need better friends!! XD
---
WF means +30% dps, ur poison not ;)
---
Poison actually has the higher priority though, so you never want to put poison on ur mainhand if wf is availlable (u cant cancel the poison either)
---
Yeah, thats a little different. As others mentioned, it wont help raids much to craft the hammer..
---
Why only a few weeks? Aren't they doing this to get honor to rank up? And I heard it takes months to rank up. Maybe when BGs release, if you get more honor there things will slow down maybe.
---
Because every warrior, no matter what spec, **can** tank. Taunt, mocking blow, challenging shout, sunder, revenge, demo shout... All designed for tanking and every warrior has access to them. 
---
But because every warrior thinks he's a special dps snowflake, most servers have a scarcity of tanks. I say this as an arms warrior who loves to dps with sweeping strikes, but exclusively tanks dungeons because it's the easiest and fastest way to get a group going.
---
He overreacts to a lot of stuff. Like his stance on the whole #nochanges thing is pretty silly, and this criticism is coming from someone who came back to the game for classic too.  
---
He just has his head up his ass most of the time and can't consider the fact that maybe he acts a bit like a dick from time to time.
---
What happens if I join a raid but have to leave before we start?
---
Youre a fucking idiot
---
Actually he's a turd sandwich
---
Get a turkey baster and just squirt it all back in.
---
I could, but I didn't want to take daggers from the other rogues who are actually dagger spec. We run with 5 rogues usually, 3 dagger 2 sword.
---
Oh, I don't believe anything is wrong with a small update. That is just not the way blizzard is approaching it.
---
This entire thread is bananas tbh. Funny read, though.
---
Outgoing or Ingoing or something else? And why dispels? I have Outgoing Heals on already, because Blizzard should have added those already tbh. Do the Dispels make mana reg ticks visible?
---
In order:
---
1) wPvP Small  
---
2) Battlegrounds  
---
3) wPvP Large  
---
4) Arenas
---
The small skirmishes you find in small world group and battlegrounds (not AV) are the most fun to experience with a group of close friends.  Groups from like 3-5 are a blast to play with on discord with friends.  Large scale world pvp can still be fun, but it's a bit chaotic and often feels like more of a dice-roll than something that personal skill can have a big influence on.
---
I actively disliked arenas due to their impact on the world, how players geared themselves, and how it changed class balance philosophy.
---
40v20 in city raids? Common dude, you've got to be kidding me.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Lag is definitely a problem. As melee, you basically are waiting for someone to make a mistake and pounce on them, hoping that you aren't currently standing in what has now become the new front line of AoE.
---
Not a warrior, but as a rogue I'm basically always off on the flanks, calling out flanks, hit and runs on low health players, and stun locking / sapping people who push too far.
---
Maybe 60-80g for 250 and the same for the last 50 points.
---
With blackjack and hookers?
---
You definitely sound like a CEO. Think you are so important that people care that you invested a few hours into a video game to reach a level slower than millions of other people who play. Good job, my toddler got to 15 before you. Stand proud!
---
Nice try, the Alliance.
---
Does asmon really get all that mad? I warched yesterday stream and he got killed 4 times in a row in (I think) blasted lands and didn't get mad. He did create a raid to get revenge and protection tho.
---
Funny, my Bagnon seems to track all my items mailbox or not. Bank alts ,etc. Maybe it's a plug-in with it or a setting.
---
Remove the full retail price of the game for classic. You don't need to pay anything for classic and just need the sub.
---
I pick B.

I saw this in the theaters and the volume made it seem like you were in the middle of a real shootout. So good.

Horde dominate Stalagg, Lights Hope is no different. We made a pass by there after alliance pulled out of felwood last night. Southshore/TM was somewhat even but that was the only area. I hear alliance were gathering in winterspring but my group didn't go there.

How????

This is all correct, except the last paragraph.

DKs are always worth the same amount.

Oof
---
Just means you've gotten some kills either before you were born or after you died

Very good write up. Thanks for the dungeon run down. I am on PvE so I’m not worried about ganks at all.

they are NOT in those channels because they are NOT looking for a group.

There's a big novelty factor right now.  It's not going to disappear by any stretch, but it'll decrease quite a bit in the next few weeks.  Especially when people start to realize that those 1200 Hks they earned in that giant raid don't really mean shit, since Honor is what matters and you get way less of that in a raid - especially when you're killing the same enemies repeatedly.
---
And without that powerful hardware they'd be waiting on that software of theirs to complete for a long time. When viewed from the perspective of your average end user, neither the software nor the hardware is of any concern, as long as the thing does what it's supposed to the instant the user desires it. Whether it's achieving that via software or black magic is of no concern.
---
Holy sh*t, well done
---
Let's be honest, asmon is a skilled streamer. He might not be for everyone, but he's good at what he does.
---
While I think that for the most part a DPS shouldn't be a big issue if they're inexperienced, this does highlight that, if you're a tank or healer, some experience will be very important to keep things moving along - especially a tank. But you'd hope they got some of that in earlier/easier dungeons.
---
Because rogues and warriors in battle or zerk stance have a hidden 20% threat reduction built-in.  In theory, it's to cancel out the built-in 20% threat reduction that ranged have for being &gt;20y away from the target, but plenty of pulls in instance don't really allow casters to be that far away, meaning you're generating 20% more threat for every point of damage you do.
---
who the fuck is downvoting this fucking retards
---
If you’re getting this bothered by someone posting something they deem an accomplishment, you need to take a reflective look at yourself to understand why you’re such a bitter cynical asshole.
---
To be fair, warriors are exceptional damage dealers especially if you have even some fury/arms talents. As for druid tank, that's a bit odd
---
like wtf is pve server smugness lmao
---
Muy Caliente
---
That's only something you can decide. If you spec sub you can easily get 30-40g/hr. Combat will lower this due to long vanish CD but it is still a fair way to get gold. Whats your time worth? This is gauranteed money since it is instance based and you aren't depending on the AH. Honestly I think until battlegrounds are released this is a rogues best way to make money. With the removal of layering this increased competition for nodes significantly. Now that honor is out people will be camping known farm spots to kill yo ass. My guild raids Fridays. So i will do MC in combat then respec sub until next week. Melee doesnt do anything in ony so dont respec just for ony. I am just going to straight gold farm until i get my mount. After that my need for gold kind of goes away. Just need enough for consumables and respecs. Which is like 3 hours of farming a week.

You deleted your post, so I take it you got similar feedback

This comment should be fucking pinned it's so true

I somewhat agree with you with him digging his own grave but why are these reddit threads so full of hate and joy of bringing someone down. There isn't a single constructive comment in all of these treads everyone is just regurgitating more hate as if he did something irredeemable.

Horde on my server got the kill right as Ally showed up and wiped them. Horde were able to see loot, but unable to distribute while dead. Ally ended up getting over 100 people to camp the corpse until despawned.

The comment was a quote taken from the clip of Classic Wow in question

Honestly if I were you I would run ZF/Sunken Temple a couple times and try hard to get to level 52 and then just start spamming BRD to level.  It's going to be a mess out there for a while.
---
This sounds like me, but I say it once and hate arguing the toss to support my strong views.
---
Also I don't stream.

yeah basically. I'm the class lead and I told them we cannot all be swords, there are not enough swords to go around for us and the fury warriors. They don't seem to mind much.

Aah

Wish this was a joke, some hunter made a post on here basically asking amita for needing on dal'rends in a guild run even it's hunter bis. Turns out he was the asshole, shocker.

A Chernobyl reference? On our r/classicwow?

Anyone who's ever played on nost/elys/lights hope, and also classic wow, will tell you that there were more players on those private servers.

Why bully cairne if he eventually dies, go kill sylvanas that doesn’t die lol
---
I haven't found this at all... Just look for BRD Arena/Anger/Golem runs.  You can do those when you are level 52 or 53.  Just have to be careful with aggro range.  I've had many level 52-55 in my groups on those runs.
---
Not even remotely the same thing as what I'm asking for
---
You wanna be 60 with full bis, an epic mount, and a lot of excess gold to buy a buncha pots, consumes, sappers and nades so that until bwl comes out, all you do is raid 2hrs a week and spend all the rest of your time grinding pvp rank so you can get it out of the way before future content comes out. Much easier to get to high ranks when all u need to do is raid 2hrs a week, vs when bwl zg and the two AQs are added to the list.  I bought 4 months worth of raid consumes and pvp stuff before p2 so i won't even have to farm for that long. People standing around in their main city arent playing efficiently
---
My best groups have been right when I get home, when I go later at night everyone is impatient and we'll have dps pulling trash instead of waiting for the tank to do it
---
It's not hunter bis until the 15 agi enchant is released

---
Thrash blade works just fine. Krol and Zeal just dont seem worth the cost. By a mount instead. Its fucking hilarious when HOJ and Thrash blade proc at like the same time.
---
Agree as soon as we made a group in my guild to fight some of the smaller groups, everytime we beat a horde group in a relatively balanced fight they would just call for backup and double our numbers again...
---
Blizzard was too slow. There was a 3-4 second delay on casts (lag was that bad). I would do the freeze method instead and it worked perfectly for me and my fellow horde.
---
&gt; (Retail WoW is better for anti social people and poorly skilled players, I would 100% recommend checking it out instead).
---
Retail is harder than Classic wrt technique and execution.
---
I agree with your post otherwise.
---
I love when I absolutely destroy a shaman or warlock and they think to themselves "that rogue still has like 90% hp after killing me, I'll probably win this time because I have the element of surprise!"
---
Sounds terrible and boring
---
At what point does it become griefing? When all that needs to be argued is that it's PVP, there is a fine line. You take your lumps but it doesn't mean you have to be happy about it. There are others that enjoy the game more by making you enjoy it less when they camp you with more people. People should be be able to vent frustrations regardless of what server they are on is my point.
---
That's a normal occurance in the life of a tank.
---
You have to understand that tanking is stressful to someone who's not familiar with it. And some people just want to see high DPS numbers.
---
This is why you have privileges as a tank. No one wants to do it.
---
Also, that guy is probably a Reddit user since they all started mindlessly spamming SA after that post came out like a month ago, saying it was the best use of rage for SOLO LEVELING. But I guess they missed that last part.
---
You gotta have a few fool-proof macros to tell warriors not to use SA, and to tell hunters to turn off Growl unless they don't mind their pets dying.
---
Its a game dude chill. Yes if you are a low level its fucking dumb to expect to be able to walk around all out 60 warfare.
---
Most efficient way is just Farm Strat Live as a Tank and res the first 2 orbs. 50g/H for doing nothing.
---
He was referring to you, dumbass
---
So you can just laugh at them for being dumb and loosing honor.
---
People who steam snipe are using the information to gain an unfair advantage over the streamer right? Its like a form of cheating. Games are based around rules and boundaries when I player uses something to bypass a boundary of the game (ghost forms invisibility in this case)  by definition  it's cheating. It doesn't matter if the information is available or not.
---
Questie can do that
---
Easy if you take 3-4 days breaks between each playsession and only play untill your rested exp runs out.
---
Same on Lakeshire. Quickest run yet actually.
---
It is only terrible if you are an AOE mage, since they gain relatively little from spell power. This is not true for warlocks, who do indeed benefit from spellpower as well as stats.
---
It didn’t last night on thunderfury
---
Everyone doesn't even know about those channels? Lots of people just type in general. You seem to have a lot of presumptions about things having to be a certain way.
---
Linen bandages
---
anybody else have daily honor not get updated for yesterday?
---
Agreed, sounds worse watching him say it though.
---
I think it has to do with how much you contributed to the kill. If you 1v1 kill someone and are the only one to have damaged them you get the full 199 (for killing a rank 1), if you kill someone as part of a raid and 30 other people tagged and did damage to that person you’ll get way way less honour, like maybe 15.
---
even if you start tomorrow, anyone who "wants" to get their mount can, it does not require skill it requires time.
---
I feel fine. I rolled on a PvE server because I knew how this was gonna play out.
---
1 level 60 and 4 appropriate level players can get extremely good xp/hour because the speed of the clear is many times faster while the exp is only relatively lower than a regular 5 man group.
---
It is the only way to respond to someone who blatantly lies about what they know.
---
You start at zero rep for all factions as all races on a fresh character, you can only go “at war” with specific factions
---
I'm still going to gank and eat you, that emote accomplishes nothing lol.
---
Except Classic isn’t retail. You might as well compare it to The Witcher or Call of Duty.
---
It is the most bullshit thing ever
---
Too much bragging to track down the print screen button eh?
---
Found one of his mods
---
1:  Never let an enemy Mage behind you. 
---
2:  Always kill gnomes.
---
(just picture all Mages carrying a Barrett 50 Cal (&gt;!reference nsfw, guns!&lt;), are you going to trust the guy toting that around?)
---
This is exactly my thoughts. Except it wasn’t a pug raid
---
It's needed for the Crusader enchant mainly. Highly sought after weapon enchant for melee DPS.
---
The people who aren’t 60 should not be catered to. If you feel like there’s no reason to rush to 60 that’s fine, but don’t expect the rest of us to happily sit back and wait for 90% of the community to hit level cap and clear mc/ony for 2 months. The fact of the matter is most people who aren’t 60 yet won’t make it passed huhu in aq, so why the fuck does it matter of raids are rolled out too fast for them?
---
Just start your own run, ain't hard.
---
Just like go on a walk or something man.
---
I'll take drama about this guy over Asmon any day
---
/Quaking
---
Why would they? Dagger DPS is perfectly fine. Plus perditions blade is like the coolest lookin dagger in the game.
---
What are you on about??? Classic is run on retail (legion) engine. Do some research before you start talking.
---
Not sure how true this is, but the person I heard it from sounded pretty convincing.
---
During the week you earn Honor from 'Honorable Kills'. Once per week, during the server reset, you are compared against your fellow faction members. Depending on how you stack up, you are award a certain number of 'Rank Points'. Depending on how many rank points you have, you are awarded a PvP rank.
---
When you get a DHK, you receive an immediate % based penalty to your **current** number of ranking points. (so DHK hurt more and more, the higher ranked you are)
---
BUT, since we haven't even had the first reset yet, no one has any ranking points. So getting a DHK has no impact.
---
This is a special case for the first week. After this week you will have ranking points to lose, so you'll need to avoid DHK. For this week though, go nuts.
---
Faction based ques would still fix this. 
---
Only allow factions to have within 5% of online players of each other. 
---
So let's say there are 5000 alliance on server X.
---
That means there could only be 5250 horde on server X at the same time. Everyone beyond the 5% rule is placed in a que and has to either wait for an alliance player to log in and raise the threshold or wait for a horde player to log out and open a slot.
---
Factions are then balanced around whichever faction is the lowest and the numbers will never be so greatly different that most fights are not a 1:1 or at the most 1:1.1 balance.
---
I feel the same about my priest. When I’m leveling my warrior it’s like I’m staring up a flight of stairs wearing a 200lb backpack. When I’m on my priest it’s like wearing a jet pack.
---
It’s a tough life out there. Stay strong
---
That's been our experience too. Warlock stuff everywhere.
---
Next post be sure to mention your dick size and the amount if your bank account! Also maybe try looking for the print screen button.
---
If you're joining a group for a dungeon and see him in it, would you stay in that group?
---
Who in their right mind would ever team up with him again?
---
The only way is for him to stop streaming and rename/change servers. But then his income is toast.
---
Thanks so much for taking the time to explain this to me it all makes sense now
---
I think its necessary for crusader enchant
---
Well, my hope is that something can be done on Blizzard's side, but you make a very good argument. The extent of my argument at this point would be ignorant "what if's", so I won't bother with them. I hope you're wrong, but I doubt it.
---
yeah and you can read the chat , find "LF1M Healer dungeon X" and reply
---
an addon that did all that for you got entire API changed so it was impossible to use.
---
so should Spy
---
Yeah not even close. It's closer to 150g. 
---
You've described blacksmithing costs, not engineering. For comparison, blacksmithing requires over 700 thorium bars. Engineering requires less than 200. MASSIVE price differences between the two.
---
If time is a way to sell clocks, then time is money, since money is needed to buy a clock.
---
The advantage the NON streamer is gaining is being provided by the streamer,  all the streamer has to do to "even" (in your mind) the playing field is not stream. 
---
I could see your point if streamers were FORCED to stream in order to play, but they make the choice to broadcast their location to everyone.
---
Hardware has changed. Prove you’re still playing on a CRT monitor or shut up and move along.
---
Yeah but you keep making the excuse that 'its hard, lol'
---
I keep wanting to say? I don't give a shit, just fucking do it.
---
Oh absolutely, I wasn't salty in the slightest. I'm on Horde dominated Skeram, so I have no problem letting the Alli's have their fun!
---
He's annoying as fuck. The few times I turned his stream on he was whining constantly. I can understand why the little boys like him.
---
Everyone in the raid instance gets aggro'd when a boss is pulled.
---
Alright, first things first. 
---
&gt; nope. You said it would be 'more of a challenge'.
---
The "more of a challenge" was a personal guess as to why the person I replied to might not find it fun to raid with 40 people, but it's actually irrelevant to the answer I was giving. Therefore, your comment about any game can be hardcore is also irrelevant to the context. 
---
&gt; The context of the argument was that the person you were responding to did not find raiding a challenge.
---
No, it was not. The person I replied to wrote the following: 
---
&gt; Raiding with 40 people is not fun to me,
---
And then the person goes on to talk about 10/25 man might've suited the person better. The context is clearly that the person doesn't enjoy raiding with 39 other people, not that the content is loosely tuned and therefore too easy with 40 people. 
---
&gt; You then told him to use 25 people in 40 man raids.
---
Which fits perfectly in the context, namely that the person in question didn't enjoy raiding with 39 other people but would likely prefer a smaller group. 
---
&gt; It's either your lack of reading comprehension or dishonesty at work here.
---
&gt; You should work on your honesty first.
---
I'm not going to bother responding to that since you're obviously lying about the context. 
---
&gt; For someone who pretends to be busy you sure are spamming a lot of replies.
---
I only replied to a single comment in that timeframe. Why are you lying whilst accusing me of lying? 
---
&gt; It makes sense because I don't only read your posts.
---
You accused me of digging up old posts. That you didn't bother to check the context is not my problem. That you also include the part about trolling (when you were clearly in the wrong) clearly implies that you tried to use it in an effort to shrug off arguments you didn't have a valid response to.
---
Personally hunters dont seem to be a problem, it's warlocks that ruin my day as 30/0/21 ;(
---
Just pick your battles and avoid the areas with zergs. Me and 4 others roamed and farmed honor kills for hours last night. Sometimes a raid finds you and you die. But it was great for the majority of the time. If you decide to take a flight path, that's your suicide.
---
&gt; hate arguing
---
Sounds like you do shy away. Stand up for yourself man.
---
Was it this bad back then? Reserve culture I mean.
---
Nope, haha. They're more like 15-25% drop rate, from what I've seen. I've just been unlucky, as you've been lucky. If I focus farmed the boss I need for a few days, I'd get the gem, I just haven't wanted to bother.
---
Most of what he does on stream is a fake personality for all his viewers. If you watch some youtube vids of his he is much more normal / laid back. Its all played up to get the viewers donating lol.
---
You made two mistakes.
---
1) You made a post about having fun.
---
2) You made a post associated with Asmongold.
---
/r/classicwow's only redeeming quality is that it's not /r/wow.
---
Spam dungeons, all you can do.
---
Where can I see the populations of classic realms? Found some sites but seem to be lacking a lot of data.
---
Just stop pugging
---
Around 100-150g. It's pretty cheap as far as crafting professions go, not sure of another one that's as easy/cheap as engineering to level. And there's relatively few "expensive" recipes, the big ticket items are Thorium Shells and Sniper Scope, and I got those combined for only 60g. 
---
If you count the average cost of recipes, then engineering is by far the cheapest/easiest crafting profession to pick up.
---
I'm on a PVE server doing PVP a level 60
---
hes so fucking bad at it, had it not been for his group of 5 doing all the quests for him hed probably still not be 60 rn
---
As a warlock for pvp i highly recommend you use a main hand one hander weapon and then use your spellstone. Spellstone is incredibly good especially if you are doing world pvp.  Being able to wipe off all dots on you is so valuable.
---
Not my kind of music, but hey, to each their own!

I guess it's kinda possible for range classes, although still obviously a horrible experience, but for melee it's completely unplayable

I had a friend take some to write a college essay due in 12 hours. They rewrote the first sentence over and over for a few hours, never finished it.
---
&gt; Show me a game today that can handle this many characters with so much different gear pieces and spell effects simultaneously in a software this old.
---
I can think of at least one
---
That's stupid as low levels give no honor. That means they're bad lol
---
I’m about ready to take a break until phase 3 since it actually feels impossible to play the game as an alliance on Blaumeux. Every single zone at all hours just has horde camping flight masters, and no alliance to be seen.
---
He’s more of an entertainer than a serious person, so it’s not really worth being in his guild if you’re serious. I think that’s where people have issues like the guild of Olympus 3.
---
Lol it's been 3 months. Unless you play a bunch of alts (which is fine) a casual player can easily be in the late 40s/early 50s by now.
---
I truly believe off stream he’s a good dude. He 100% uses a stream persona and plays up to his audience. More often that not I can’t stand to watch him, but occasionally he has pretty great insights and opinions, especially when it comes to the streaming industry.
---
All depends on how much importance you put on solo/small group/large scale PvP vs PvE vs Quality of Life.  
---
Spriests are great in solo/small group PvP, but in Large scale you'll often feel like you make a bigger difference healing/dispelling.  Spriest "Quality of Life" is quite low.  You're not a great farming class, you have (comparatively) poor sustain, and most PvE groups are going to expect you to mostly heal.  Healers are also in pretty good supply, so you and the Dps will be waiting on tanks most of the time.
---
Warlocks are great in all PvP scenes, are a great farming class, and one of the best sustain in-game. They're an uncommon Dps class that brings some nice utility, but still compete with all the other Dps for a spot. Also, Pet AI is pretty wonky sometimes.  Also also, soul shard management.
---
try solo 2 good players

your argument is just stupid

You've probably heard this numerous times, but you should have leveled during phase 1

grief the enemy faction, go in 3 raids to a capital city, all hide in 1 building and start mass casting/buffing/aoeing to overload the local server. enemy faction capital city starts to stutter and eventually continent server falls over

His dad plays in a pvp realm

Dude is a ceo, PhD student, has 5 kids and a wonderful wife but can't screenshot...
---
Not to mention all the short cuts/spaghetti code/lack of security or who knows what P servers did to achieve it. That's not going to happen with enterprise software.
---
I feel bad for the people lvling, but if you're high enough to give honor, im killing you.
---
In my experience, I'm always out damaging the mages ten fold, especially when I'm specced for it ([example](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/-2050320152001-055000512222015) - This is what I went lvl 55-60, Sacc your Imp) so I'd say the AoE groups you've seen are either really bad and require the 4th mage or are stupid and don't know what a warlock's SoulStone on the priest, health stones, and summoning for vendoring and repairs bills bring to the farm group.
---
Great screenshot
---
Let's say as well for the sake of not locking people out unnecessarily during low hours that, the % is dynamic. So for example if there is less than 1000 of alliance the difference threshold is raised to 40% allowing 1400 horde on because numbers are so low.
---
Yes, you can participate. Click on your character portrait and enable PvP. Everybody is excited about farming honor right now so doubtlessly you will find people on your PvE server interested in participating.
---
As for why Hillsbrad tends to be ground zero: Tarren Mill vs. Southshore was a traditional hotbed of world pvp back pre-Cataclym. Everybody knows Hillsbrad is where PvP happens so everybody goes there to find other people to PvP with

I DID A GOOD THING?! WOOO!

oh did my local dialect/shitty spelling give you a laugh?

Ah bummer. Thanks for the good times though!

I hope you step on a bear trap.
---
Because his irrational principles dictate his actions. Pretty common. People get so uptight about people reserving shit it's absurd. That's there choice to make that group and it's up to the prospects to decide if they want to run or not. That's all there is to it. There is nothing morally wrong with creating a group with something on reserve...
---
It’s the casual gamers bitching and crying about not being 60, the game being rushed, content being released too quickly, etc. Do you remember the mass posts about dm being released too early? A 5 man dungeon? These same people were ok with Mara being out on release, but dm is an issue? Seriously, who cares about the people who aren’t 60 yet. They can play the game at their own pace, that’s fine, but why are we taking them in to consideration at all? They won’t clear aq, they may not even clear bwl. Getting their bis and paying tanks with orbs is a non issue for 90% of the 60 community because they have everything they need already.
---
Can confirm, Incendius was 15 min que (~450 in que) at peak last night, which was around 8pm CST
---
As a side note, I want an Italian mod for Rag, constantly making hand gestures as he speaks.
---
&gt; It puts you at a huge disadvantage not to use.
---
Any addon that you can say this about really needs to either be added to the client officially, or completely banned from use.
---
Oh the race/class options is from ChatLinkIcons
---
Large is shit
---
Small is nice and cozy but i don't wanna rank doing this shit for 3 months
---
battlegrounds is how classic is supposed to be played and never get sold
---
arenas are too small and too locked in place with meta comps and chain cc burst, it's not real pvp just an illusion
---
I think if you couldn’t whisper it would be fine. I don’t trash talk but I get a kick out of people trash talking me.
---
Some solid advice. The part about the ability delay, and being able to use more abilities than you think as the server catches up is of limited use. For example, enemy players often run out of range before you can use more than 1-2 abilities, but if you're healing or throwing up some self buffs in between attacks, that can be very useful.
---
Every time you gank a chud, an angel gets its wings. Bless you, my child.
---
They are now. In retail there are a lot of ways to speak to the other faction. It's pretty funny in BGs.
---
No raid needs to give their tank perd and aclg to avoid threat cap...
---
ONSLUGHT/Alkizer uses eskandar and something else.  Several top 10 Ony kills don't use a tank with a weapon skill weapon.
---
He gets them to clean up after him because apparently he is incapable of being an adult.
---
You’d likely die just as much at 60, it’s not that big of a difference.
---
Fuck I wouldn't care if It dropped tomorrow, the only thing people were looking forward to in P2 (after releasing DM early and not including a key ring) was vanilla wow world PvP and due to blizzards' own incompetence, we did not get anything close to vanilla wow PvP. Imo either they pull themselves up by the britches and fix the absolute shit show that is slideshow pvp by improving software/hardware, or release BGs early and just take this as the 15th learning experience that blizz/act will forget like a goldfish.
---
If he went anywhere without one or two guild raids he would just be corpse camped  every second of every day because there are more Horde.
---
I actually remember it exactly this way. Anything over 50 v 50 lagged in vanilla. Im suprised so many people remember it differently - maybe depended on server back then?
---
We'll probably get lost so far down the comment chain but I agree! 
---
Don't have ADHD, fully functioning mon-fri 8am-5pm adult, and enjoying taking adderall maybe once or twice a month to focus and zone in. Whether it's getting house work done or just playing games.

I do however have friends who use it way to much and are straight up addicted to it... just like most things in life, it's okay and fun as king as you can be responsible with it.

You dont lose any honor killing lowbs

Just being in a zone close to hillsbrad was giving me massive lag.
---
Major-domo in English is the chief steward of a household. Essentially the top butler, or one who runs all the servants in a house. 
---
From Italian maggiordomo and Spanish mayordomo, from Late Latin maior domus (“steward”), from Latin māior (“main, principal”) + genitive singular of domus (“household”).
---
So 3900 were 1 to 10. Got it.
---
I honestly thought I did, turns out I didn't. Mass raid pvp where you can't even tell your impact, with massive lag, turns out isn't the most enjoyable experience.
---
Wake me up when BGs come out.
---
ITT: People who KNOW this can be fixed, and people who KNOW that it can't. Yall are so smart
---
DHK's doesnt matter this week. They instantly removes % of your rank, and since we're all 0% at rank 0 it does abseloutly nothing. Next week they will matter ALOT.
---
That's my boy! Aftershock FTW!
---
Where do you disable this? I’ve been meaning to but haven’t looked.
---
You're not going to tell me how to play the game. If someone wants to DPS and that's what they joined to do then you need to respect that. I am making a ret and will not heal unless it's to prevent a wipe. Let people enjoy the game how they want.
---
It's just variance. 3 anecdotes don't make a rule. One guy up there said he got 2 different loots.
---
Except a lot of people don't join those groups at all, out of principle. And reserving an item actively just makes you look entitled to most people.
---
You get Honor Point from killing other players.
---
On Tuesday, the Honor Points you have accumulated are then compared against all other players on your faction for the week. 
---
You are awarded Rank Points based on your "standing" for that week.
---
1 Dishonorable Kill is -100 RANK POINTS right away (not on weekly reset). Since you have no Rank Points since it is week 1.... Dishonorable Kills do nothing. After Tuesday they will start mattering (unless you do/did no PvP this week)
---
Yeah guys, he’s just *pretending* to be an annoying piece of shit.
---
Let me get this straight... You agree that loot can be funneled to one person by way of creating a favorable group composition, but you disagree that the person should be up front about it to everyone in the group?
---
Unless you're standing outside of instances offering to tank for every group with no item reservations all of your free time, you're nothing short of a self-righteous hypocrite that is actively holding your own faction back. To me, you sound like someone who wants to ninja things and roll on everything you can. I don't know why anyone would be against being communicative and respectful of people's time, but you embody that to a tee. You're free to let that be your personal stance of course.
---
I can't imagine a warrior refusing to tank for a group that has a piece of cloth on reserve. If you cannot see how blatantly immature that is, then yeah, I guess no one is going to change your mind.
---
Everything you got!

If I need the 2 mage pre-BIS pieces in BRD: shoulders and boots, how should I set up groups? Meaning what bosses should I advertise in LFG
---
dishonorable kills are only for certain npcs tho
---
So maybe they should've capped the servers at lower amounts?
---
Once people realize that zerging in a 40 man raid grants next to no honor and getting passed rank 6 is next to impossible for the average player the pvp hype will die down back to normal.
---
Weeping Cave in WPL. It's hardly touched on my server, and has multiple rare patterns as well as the always coveted Disgusting Oozeling. If you're a miner, there are plenty of nodes. If you get into trouble, stealth to the bank of the cave where no want ever wants to go.
---
I paid 100g +orb for mine. That didn’t feel too expensive for me.
---
Oh right. The more you know ey
---
Is it any easier running to BRM from Burning Steppes?
---
Because most open world pvp in WoW is not done on a large scale.
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree that it's ridiculous that you would have to avoid doing something that you enjoy doing in a game where it's possible in theory. And at the very least I think Blizzard should acknowledge the problem, and let people know if it's something they will fix.
---
At the same time, large scale world pvp is one of many, many things you can do in WoW. Maybe that is the inherent weakness of the game, and who knows how difficult it is to fix. But I don't believe it's simple greed or laziness that keeps them from fixing it, like some people suggest.
---
The 58 warrior probably needs more time to get aggro than the super geared 60. That's...kind of how threat works.
---
It wasn't in the early versions of the original game, so it isn't in the early versions of classic. This is quite correct but they had previously stated that it would be included in P2. For whatever reason it has not been turned on with the other P2 content.
---
It's like an unpaid internship that is excused with "it's great experience for you".
---
I'm on razorgore and it didnt seem that bad to me. Maybe 0.5s delay on inputs with a small lag spike here and there. Dont get me wrong, that's way worse than it should be but not unplayable. Was in hillsbrad with probably about 100-150 on each side.
---
Yikes, there's what 15-20 of you shitters camping a flight path?
---
And the second even some competition shows up you scatter like bitches 😂
---
So edgy xD RANDOM LOL everyone goes for kills u go for DK XD
---
and then buffed to 125% later after HARP got nerfed.
---
Oh. Yeah I see what you’re getting at
---
We really proved them wrong by buying their game!
---
That's exactly what a stream sniper would say! ^^^^s
---
Is it 60s ganking there? Or is it higher lvls (upper 30s/lower 40s) questing in the same area who see an easy target?
---
And why should they put righteous orbs on res when the argument that tanks get nothing from there is moot? I haven’t needed anything from live strat for 2 months, of course I’m not joining a group that won’t give me anything for my time lmao
---
But rise, stronger and harder.
---
I can hear this reply
---
Highly agreed. I was there for this battle. Stuck around quite a while, and yes, it was fun, but I definitely prefer smaller skirmishes.
---
That said, horde completely dominated the alliance in that battle.
---
The first one *should* be going to the tank.
---
They are hardest to find and the one who can fuck up your group the worst if they leave.
---
They also have the biggest cost sunk into each dungeon due to their repair bills and they have the weakest gold farming ability of *any* class by a pretty decent bit. 
---
They are gold starved worse than anyone else and quite frankly the reason there are so few tanks is cause a shit ton of warrior start out with dreams of tanking and realize it is fucking tedious and expensive with most of the pressure of organizing and delivering on a dungeon. 
---
And then they get fucked in PVP and realize they cant PVP with paying for the expensive talent swapping.
---
So these warriors do what any sane person would do, they respec into DPS and off tank occasionally but rarely ever dungeons anymore once they hit raids.
---
So all you've got left is the tanks who *really* enjoyed their jobs despite the massive fucking money drought tanks are perpetually stuck in.
---
And people have the nerve to act like we are entitled to ask for a 15g item drop from a dungeon when our repair bill is gonna be 6-8 gold anyways.
---
I've honestly gotten so tired of peoples attitude about reserving stuff I just dont respond to random whispers anymore. I only tank dungeons for guildies and friends. Unless you whisper me with an offer for something I probably wont even counter with what I need to make it worth doing.
---
LOL
---
Carebears dont apply to PVE server. They play PVP servers but still help and /wave the other faction

How do I use the helmet? Do I have it on all the time, or do I equip it in certain situations?

Lol if they don't now a lot of streamers definitely did take gold at some point. I remember watching PvP streamers back in mop and wod just being handed gold and tcg mounts on stream.
---
Nice opinion.
---
You still working on that list? Got my paladin to 60 and ready to gear him for my warrior friends!
---
It's also a function of being "new".  It will wear off over time.  Vanilla was the same way.  Early one it was very common for this type of thing and over time it went away.  Outside of raids for world bosses or BRM/AQ, there wasn't really this kind of thing because people had already done it.  Judging something by the first day compared to people who have been playing the game for a decade is not a good idea.

That spec is wrong, this is the best holy spec to run.

You think you won't use holy nova but you will.
---
All good man I enjoyed your post, thanks for sharing mate.
---
How hard is it finding 5 mans as a rogue? Class looks fun as fuck but I feel like that part would be a pain in the ass
---
Blizzard intentionally broke the CensusData addon so I don't know how accurate the data is, everyone would need to self-report (I'm not sure how limited the /who function is to addons now but it's drastically less than before if anything)
---
The GO GO GO Mentallity is enforced in retail with the timers on Mythic+ dungeon. It is part of the game.
---
Warrios that overagro all the time are bad warriors.
---
Trying to inprove others that dont want to inprove is a waste of your time.
---
If you want smoother runs you can try to ask upfront if anyone needs any advice before going in. Alot of "newbies" are ashamed of not knowing the tactics and dont dare to speak up. If you can get these people to speak by being a nice an helpfull guy before you start it might help them feeling "save" and dare to ask for help.
---
You do sound like an asshole elitist but thats just your wording. I dont get the feeling you are an asshole. You might be an Elitist but there is nothing wrong with that.
---
Elitist: Someone who enjoy and focus mainly on becoming a better player. Likes to be efficient with his time. Like to know it all and love being a "Good" player.
---
Being an elitist on itself isn't something toxic.
---
Thats why you ask for the first two orbs? Like I said I do runs everyday with people that still need gear from Strat, and I get atleast an Orb a run.
---
I still like him for sure.  I think its hilarious when he blows up at the chat.
---
Yeah I walked away from the front line to get mana in hillsbrad. About 30 seconds later I suddenly died because damage from me being in the front finally registered.
---
man i tried this lotta times, but dont get teleported. is there a specific point to go?
---
Lol what? The fact that his shit is still a disaster proves that’s not the case. He has moldy bowls and shit from years ago. He’s a fucking disgusting human being, and yeah I’d say he’s incapable of being an adult...but come on dude, let’s not make shit up. There’s plenty of shit you can criticize him about without making shit up.
---
Ranged Dps should have their ranges increased while in towers but have their deadzone increased
---
lmao same for me... life of a druid I guess.
---
Last night crossed a 40 ganking 32s.
---
After killing him 3 times, he finally left... and considering my stealth ambushes, he probably spent the rest of the night looking over his shoulder.
---
The 32s were cheering each time I killed him, which was fun.
---
Yes but forget the blackjack though!
---
&gt; I can't imagine a warrior refusing to tank for a group that has a piece of cloth on reserve. If you cannot see how blatantly immature that is, then yeah, I guess no one is going to change your mind.
---
I don't agree with reserve, on anything, no exceptions. I'm not going to make exceptions for cloth gear just because I don't need it. 
---
You're free to find another tank, I don't care. The whole point of this post is people complaining "there's no tanks" and I am explaining why you may not find one. Some people, like me, simply oppose loot reservations and won't participate in it.
---
Zerg &gt; any coordination
---
Oj ok ty
---
I could be mistaken, but I don't think you can cast spells using scripts (which you would have to scan your inventory). Otherwise you could make crazy conditionals to press 1 button to do your perfect raid rotation.
---
I'd rather they just fix the game....BG's are no solution.
---
Gutgore Ripper, IMO. Love the look of it.
---
And with strange aeons even death may die.
---
Long ago during vanilla they nerfed priest fear because "Players shouldn't lose control of their characters."  I don't know about you, but I consider not being able to move or do anything because I'm stunned to fall into the category of "not having control of my character."  
---
Not to mention that being stunned is worse than being feared because it's way easier for other melees to dogpile you if you're stunned, but they have to chase you if you're feared.
---
I have a warrior, I tank all the time. My rogue is what I play when I want to purely dps. Nice assumption though.
---
They're not losing honor tho
---
You probably like to run in Ungoro looking for people lower level than you to find your honor, which makes you in fact a cunt.
---
No need to try to justify ruining people's experience of the game in an unfair matter.
---
can just enter dungeon get invited then leave and ghetto after 1 min of not being in dungeon. A lot easier than using all your id's
---
I would guess that it will be calculated at 2pmET/11am PT
---
Thats bullshit. So unless your schedule is jam packed with social activities you dont have a social life? 
---
I hit 60 on the 20th of October and I felt like I leveled really slowly. Devoted an average of 2 hours per day to WoW.
---
Its not bad if you cant do that, but as I said, a PVE realm would be a better place for you then.
---
This is because classic uses a prefix/suffix system. A lot of non raid items are generated by first taking a prefix usually based on level of drop which gives it a skin, armor, level requirement. Then a random suffix is rolled which determines stats.
---
Of the whale for example is always sta/spi
---
Of the wolf is always agi/spi
---
Of arcane wrath  is +arcane damage
---
Etc
---
Do you expect raids to count the number of enemies and restrict people from joining the fight as they go? That's just how it's going to be in wPvP on any high pop PvP server. Fair fights would definitely be more honorable and fun but there's still fun in fighting even if it's just a numbers game. Plus if you pull out the win against the bigger raid, it's that much more rewarding and a much better insult to them.
---
This is what I was going to say.  I remember fighting with an opposite faction guild over azuregos back in 2005 on Shadowmoon.  There were around 35 people in our raid and I imagine about the same number in their raid.  It was a fucking slideshow for an hour.  So many people logged off on both sides due to wasted time fighting and unplayability due to lag, neither of our guilds got the kill that day.  Obviously we did have fun because we kept at it for an hour, but anyone that thinks large scale battles were smooth in vanilla is looking back with rose tinted glasses.
---
See you in Redridge in a few months. Can’t promise a /wave will save you from my corruption, but its worth a try.
---
I thought they just don't gain honor -- do you lose honor???
---
So if I find a level 25 attacking a level 22, I shouldn't get involved?
---
You don't understand how brave OP is for posting an unpopular opinion
---
You didn't see a chernobyl reference. You didn't because its not there.
---
No, but ticking “show all power gains” will give you mana tics.
---
The video of Asmongold giving McConnell the Tusks of Manaroth will never cease to make me laugh. The genuine elation in McConnells voice is heartwarming
---
He’s calling you out on “per se”. :P
---
Thats why you missed the lag fest hahah later it was pretty huge about 250ish horde and 180ish ally
---
Max Honor is 199 per Kill, if people are dead or out of range they don't count.
---
So you're getting outraged and making bullshit excuses on behalf of others? No I didn't bother to read your post history or autobiography, why the fuck would I? I just saw something stupid, and called you out on it.
---
And your entire paragraph doesn't change the fact that you said something stupid.
---
I don't care how you play, or what you chose to do in the world. You can spend your days taking screenshots for female night elves feet for your blog and it doesn't matter to me.
---
The only thing that does matter is the fact that it does not take 12 hours a day for 80 days to level a character to 60. That statement is provably wrong.
---
As a hunter when I want to reserve an item, I bring a guild/friend tank and 3 cloth casters lol. 
---
I'm reserving an item by bringing people who don't compete for it!
---
You killed an Olympus member. That’s like knocking over someone in a wheelchair.
---
Grats?
---
Armor has a cap. Defense is borderline worthless as you can't get enough to prevent crushing. Stamina has more survivability.
---
Fucking hell, this is why I rolled on PvE server. I want to have fun, not be fun for some frustrated arsehole on the other side of the globe.
---
And you’re accomplishing so much.
---
You can get a +21 Shadow Wrath off hand which is better aswell
---
Literally never seen that once. Even if it was a thing it’d be ridiculous and gross. You want 2 orbs(80-100g on my server) to play a game? Fuck that. Round robin it like a normal person.
---
You know you dont have to play on a PvP server right?
---
They were gonna make me warchief for this, and I wasn’t even in their horde anymore.
---
the alliance is dead, Horde massively outnumbers them
---
QQ
---
how its alliance bad decision making? you are on pvp server becouse u want pvp and if you dont have enemyes it will result in no pvp for u or unberable queues for BGs. If all the ones you say made bad decision would swap to horde, you would have nobody to fight with resulting in dead server pvp wise. 
---
If anybody made bad decision, its the dominant faction camping and harasing small aliance which resulted in more ali players quit or leave to more balanced server which even deepened the unbalance.
---
Questie will show lower level quests on the map in the options, but the rep gain from trivial quests is pretty terrible. You'll be getting 3-5 rep per quest. Farm rubecloth instead.
---
Because the game is unplayable if your not a geared 60 right now or playing in a group. options are instances after corpse hopping a few times to the instance entrance, gather mats in low level zones, or start and alt and wait for it to blow over after a week or 2.
---
When you ask for water before a full BRD quest run and the mage gives you 17 water. 
---
Wth
---
Could always do dungeons
---
your just F'd then.
---
In one of the newer zones there is an hourly world pvp event that pretty much shuts down any and all attempts to play in that zone. There's also weekly call to arms quests to get 25 kills in a certain zone. If it happens to be Nazjatar, there'll be 40v40 on the bridge between cities for a few days.
---
I am sure i am wrong, because a list cant have a mistake on it, but i would go with Warding over Stoneshield if both were sitting in my bags,
---
Since when is sending one question through considered rude and spam?
---
Yeah the guy not checking your location is an idiot but you sound overly sensitive. If you're so happy to teach others about the LFG channel you might want to explore the /dnd option yourself.
---
So how bad are the South Shore raids for ranking. There isn't much for PvP right now at my play times since i don't have a group to PvP with
---
You spoiled any hope of reasonable discussion by being a complete asshat. No one in their right mind would have a discussion with someone like you who’s turned into a triggered turbocunt over literally nothing.
---
Reserving is BS if you ask me. Everyone in the group participates and should be eligible for the same rewards. Get a full guild group or suck it up but that's just my opinion.
---
You made the choice to play on a PvP server the only person to blame is yourself. If they waited for a majority of players to hit max level Phase 1 would have lasted a month. Enjoy your time and keep you petty squabbles to yourself or stop playing because reddit doesn't care.
---
But think of the poor Gnomes!!!!
---
People reflecting on the day: "gank squads are making leveling difficult"
---
You: "lolol pvp happens on a pvp server. I am very smart."
---
What about people that don't have a keyboard and can only play wow with a used DDR mat they got from GameStop? 
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
How would you say have you curtailed your social life over the last couple of months? Did you cancel plans because you wanted to play WoW? Did you not make plans because you'd rather play WoW?
---
IIRC, Rank 7 was not particularly onerous.  I reached at least Rank 9 during the vanilla days and I was never particularly dedicated to the PvP Honor grind.
---
Fair first point, the post did blow up.
---
However your 2nd point is only half right; of course I picked this screenshot because it has Asmon laying dead in it. How on earth does that translate to "So you hate Asmongold, yet decide to post this therefore giving him more attention?".
---
As a dagger rogue, what happens if I get both Mugger’s Belt and Aged Coreleather gloves? it’d put me at 315 skill but what is the benefit to that?
---
When you read something and you can hear how young their voice is.
---
Why didn't you roll on a PVE server lmao
---
Everyone agreed MC was relatively easy and BWL is only a step up. Guilds still wipe and fail to complete it and Ony gets tons of raid wipes
---
It remains to be seen how casuals will fair in phase 5/6
---
no it is
---
On Shattered Hand, after Relentless got one of the Horde first boss kills (forget which one, maybe Rag? I feel like it read pretty early on but could have been Nef), they organized a raid on Ironforge to celebrate. We had, at most, 3 raids. We didn't even reach the front gate before the world server crashed.
---
The Classic servers definitely perform better than Vanilla.
---
It's called fucking reality, holy shit people.  We put all this money into it, why can't we cure cancer?  Because we haven't solved the underlying issue.  O(n log n) is what it is.  There are ways to mitigate it but they all introduce latency.  We are paying the cost for increasing server caps to reduce queue times and the way the problem scales, the 300v300 battles in hillsbrad are significantly more taxing than the 100v100 you remember.  If you want it to be fixed, transfer to a lower pop realm or ask for significantly lower pop caps and longer queues.  Those are the options.
---
I remember it can also get over 199. 221+ I believe, maybe this comes into places when people actually get ranks.
---
But like others already said, you wont see those numbers in a raidgroup.
---
Wow that’s not too bad at all!
---
Nope that's when they log off and hop on an alt because that 48 was there main and is now unplayable.
---
How do you avoid the Zerg if the Zerg is everywhere?
---
Don't worry.
---
They don't count the first week because they're an instant loss to rank points and we don't have any rank points until the first reset.
---
I have yet to experience any of the complaints this sub is full of. 
---
It really makes me wonder, why on Earth do people intentionally play on full servers? They will have login queues, they will have the highest player population and therefore the largest numbers of shitty people, the biggest faction imbalances, the toughest competition for resources, and the laggiest interactions. 
---
I just don't get it. I play on Anathema and haven't experienced any of these streamer-realm problems.
---
Did you follow a particular guide?
---
Did he?  Provide a source for this claim.
---
Because what you're explaining is the entire point? I.e. if you stay on the road you'll get fucked to pieces, and if you get off the enemy rides on not noticing you. So the clips fits 100%.
---
\&gt;He didn't get mad and did the same thing all players do when they're getting ganked/camped  
---
\&gt;He's so salty  
---
The poster above has room temperature IQ methinks
---
Don't worry, it'll be ok Druid tanks rock.
---
1) take it slow
---
2) let everyone know your new to tanking
---
3) if you can mark targets it helps as other people are stupid and will attack targets you don't want them to, then complain that they're being hit.
---
4) you don't have to stop ALL the damage, just not let people die, so if you lose agro...it's gonna be ok
---
5) have fun, if everyone dies...it's only a game.
---
It also gets easier once you get faery fire, charge etc especially, if like me, you go tank spec.
---
Yeah ony gets tons of raid wipes because you got a bunch of boomers that can't understand 2 simple mechanics.
---
False. The Spy AddOn gives YOUR co-ordinates (unless you have humanoid tracking from being a hunter or a druid in cat form).

I'd just copy, paste, delete and repost at this point.

---
The irony that this post is tagged as a discussion.
---
I hope you feel better for the vent.
---
I can't say absolutely specifically, but it ends up being like 100 armor and 5 defense vs about 70 health?
---
The difference is probably not that big and perhaps no one bothered to update things?  A lot of those guides missed things which are directly superior to items on their lists.
---
It's obviously not an easy fix or it would have been done already. But if they plan on supporting classic and other expansions in the future. They should be working on a fix easy or not.
---
Nah, I didn't.  Don't try to cover.
---
Imagine crying about Staff of Dominance as a fucking shaman. People like OP are the problem with the community.
---
Basically almost exclusively gnome rogue (male) and warlock (female) back in vanilla. Now I'm Human!
---
Was it also uphill both ways in the snow to the dungeon back in actual vanilla?
---
Dude asked why people dislike him, I said why I dislike him. I have no idea if it's still the case because obviously I don't check in on him to see if he has changed.
---
Him having moldy bowls doesn't prove it has never been cleaned though. There are plenty of videos of him cleaning it by himself. 
---
I don't know if his friends still pitch in to help, I don't know if that was all just a rumor for more drama, I don't really care. Him being a slob is in itself enough for me to not want to watch him. I don't want to fund that sort of self-destruction, especially if he plays it off as a big joke.
---
cant you just turn pvp off???
---
Go back to twitch
---
rule 3 maybe? let the guy be... he fucked up, he will pay,
---
How is that relevant?  Everyone used flip phones or Nokia bricks back then as well.....technology advances at an accelerating rate....its one of the main reasons people came back to classic wow.  "Imagine vanilla WoW without the unplayable lag in 2019!".
---
Boots - Golem Lord
---
   - lots of groups form for Angerforge / Golem Lord farms 
---
Shoulders - Warder Stilgiss 
---
   - he’s in the coffers area. More rare to have groups for this, but you can advertise a coffers run and adapt to what other bosses people need in a run.
---
Yeah the discussion is about how over exaggerated people made out classic raids to be prior launch.
---
Druid tanks do a lot of damage actually. A tank warrior geared probably won't out DPS one u less they're fury prot and dw

"Maybe stop wasting time making excuses for your poor performance in a video game and get back to leveling. You play wow, you're as much of a turbo nerd as the rest of us, you're just not good at the game."

I guess he had his 5 seconds of fame? lol
---
Did kaymorae save you? You can't leave us on this cliffhanger.
---
Even setting the bad grammar aside, I still agree
---
Not to the letter, but I used Wowhead as a template. I did deviate from it a decent bit, especially when I was re-leveling (I started Gnomish then dropped for Goblin engineering), but for the most part, especially early levels, it was pretty good. Later I bought the Thorium Shells recipe and used that to finish out 300, and it gave me a sellable good at the end of the night so I didn't just lose the material cost.
---
A Rank14 will give up to 398 Honor, but right now everyone is still Rank0.
---
No i actually dont remember anyone saying it was hard just that preparation(gear, consumables etc) were time consuming and the sparse gear drops made it more rewarding. Get your head outa your ass.
---
Okay bud? 4weird
---
Why are you still levelling?
---
noob question: what does it mean to roll a class?
---
It's never been able to do the scale of PvP these people are insisting it should.
---
Felwood yesterday. There was an ally death squad in every corner. Ressed and got one shotted by two rogues a mage and a paladin.
---
Why would you do this to yourself?
---
I mean... some might be preteens? But it definitely isn't _only_ preteens. I know you know and I know I _know_ at least a good bit of people in their mid 20s to 30s that still do the OmegaLul and Kek bullshit.
---
His character's personality is definitely for a type, and those type of people are the OmegaLul crowd and those who say stupid Twitch shit like Kappa(word).
---
Nice lies, as I can clearly still see my post.
---
In my 14 years of playing this game, real life at some point takes a priority. But I guess you wouldnt know that huh......kid.
---
Bye.
---
Not saying your bad decision making is completely bad, it leads to us horde getting hk's but we also shouldn't be punished for being smarter and rolling the better faction and being forced into queues.
---
You want to be disc for mc, maybe bwl. Holy talents are in no way required for current content, so the small boost from PI is actually better.
---
lol the second i clicked the submit button, i was like ... "what have i become?"
---
Why is it good now and wasn't good before?
---
Reddit has not been it's authentic self for at least 5 years.  Subs such as these are being astroturfed by the corporations which they concern.  Shilling is very real and very prevalent on Reddit.
---
It’s actually only about 1200 damage on a 400 dps caster, but the holy talents aren’t necessary so it’s better to pick up the small damage boost.
---
Scenario 1: Why should players be punished with queue times for joining a high population server?
---
Scenario 2: Why should players be punished with queue times for joining a high population faction?
---
Hint: we are already at Scenario 1 and no one bats an eye because we CHOSE to play on a high population server. Just the same as people CHOSE to play on a high population faction.

I think op is under the impression that a Boomer is someone older than them. I doubt very many 60+ year olds are playing.
---
Some of us have jobs, families, and other life responsibilities.
---
you lost your motivation a while ago, you just needed something other than yourself to blame why you are giving up,
---
True but also it’s easy to just check yourself and takes marginally more time. Usually when you think something is bugged you actually try to test it.
---
I honestly really enjoy Asmon streams, he is somehow disrespectful and respectful at the same time, he's funny, entertains his chat, interacts with chat. He's  really good at his job.
---
They need a way to finance the free zeppelins and ships we use.
---
I am lvl 55, to high for st and Mara pretty much, to low for the spire, brd groups are non existent. Guess I’ll just lvl an alt :(
---
I can't stand name plates personally. Way to much screen clutter.
---
Don;t know if it will work in classic or even if its still around, but I used to use Altaholic back in the day.
---
One mans “obnoxious shit” is another mans “honest guy that tells it like it is.”

It’s a ymmv label.

Regardless people that watch find him entertaining. I personally enjoy the perspective he brings, even when don’t agree with it.

When I don’t find him entertaining I stop watching. You can too if he bothers you.
---
Got my mage to 60 last week. Tried to have 40 mana for every mana user every group I was in. Got abilities, might as well use them
---
I stumbled across one of his Youtube videos on the release of Classic.  Not gonna lie, if not for that video, I would not have re-subbed for Classic.  Now, I'm having a great time playing the game that Blizz destroyed in late WOTLK.
---
You're not wrong, but I see no problem with constantly berating Blizzard over their poor service, because they deserve it for not improving it over the last 15 years of development. This is an endemic issue for WoW in general, not just Classic. The only differentiating factor is that Classic more often actually inspires world activity on the scale necessary to bring the servers to their knees, while retail doesn't. Even when there is a 40v40 battle in Retail, the servers basically shit the bed. It's been demonstrated, even in a battleground instance with two 40man raids coordinating on both factions to queue into the same alterac valley and clashing all at once in the field of strife. The server melted. You can observe this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDXtut0fDmI
---
I say keep yelling about it, because it will never get fixed if we don't.
---
Meanwhile I couldn't step foot into WPL, EPL, Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge, or Winterspring without 30 horde just camping outside of the flight masters. Chances are all the alliance got relegated to Tanaris because every other zone is just a camp fiesta.
---
I always heard it used as "baby boomer" when used to refer to the actual meaning, but it could very well be a regional thing.
---
You think that's good, wait until you try Mage.
---
Did I at any point try to discourage him from playing the game? Yea, I called him shit at wow, but he is free to be shit at wow. 
---
The only thing I was gatekeeping was making excuses for being shit. Just be shit and own it.
---
You however probably shouldn't be posting on Reddit about gatekeeping as you clearly have little knowledge of the definition of the word. Yes, I am gatekeeping you from posting about gatekeeping. Honestly it's for your own good though, it keeps you from looking more foolish in the future.

Sucks it happened at 1pm on weekday, all of us with jobs had to just sit by and watch discord updates.
---
I gave a fourm psot to back it up.
---
The Hong Kong protesters probably aren't giggling as they're being shot by bullets paid for by blizzard, with your wow subscription money. Enjoy tho.
---
lol no, you can play on a PvE server if you don't want to engage in it at all
---
can you send me a picture in paint for your route?
---
similiar prices on my server but im having hard time farming herb efficiently
---
Turns out it was an alliance raid
---
While I agree that the lag is terrible and really disappointing.  As a low level character running to Tarren mill I owe my survival to it.  I ran by 2 priests who were at least 40+ (my character was only level 20 at the time so all I can go off was that they were mounted).  I watched them turning to look at me running towards my general area, they dismounted, and I watched the Psychic scream animation go off when they were next to me but it had no effect (no resist listed or anything). I pressed my gouge key and kept running, she cast shadow word pain, looked to be casting some other spell, but then gouge finally kicked in and interrupted her as I was 15+ yards away, I ran away and survived the pain damage as she fumbled around after me.  I knew a good number of horde and alliance had to be nearby as my instant cast abilities were taking 2-5 seconds to go off, but honestly didn't see more than a couple before I grabbed the flight path and flew away.
---
Definitely a huge disappointment since I did enjoy large scale PVP back in the day, and even being on dialup back then, it seemed way better than what we're dealing with now.  Most of the lag i remember from back then was some rubberbanding, slight delays, and the occasional disconnect. Much of which I presume was due to being connected to a MMO by dialup.
---
Calm down before you commit a mass shooting bro. Don’t get too worked up here. Go back to your guns subreddit.
---
Early game druid tanking is not so different from late game druid tanking, you just have a few less options available to you.
---
In terms of ability rotation, Maul is your primary source of threat, particularly on single targets. Run at your primary target (usually spellcasters, as they deal more damage and their damage tends to be harder to mitigate), start attacking, hit them with a maul as soon as possible. Ideally, dps should hold off until you land at least your first hit, preferably your first maul, and should all focus your main target. After this, you should quickly switch to secondary mobs and land at least a normal attack, if not a maul. This will help keep mobs from aggroing onto your healer. Continue with this process. Generally speaking, if there's 3 or more elites, keeping aggro from the skull for the entire fight isn't necessary - if DPS pulls aggro when it's low health, don't bother going out of your way top get the aggro back, just focus on secondary targets so that when focus changes, you will have a firm hold on their aggro and the rest of the pull will go smoothly.

Once you get swipe, this process gets a bit easier, especially if you put points into Primal Fury. The biggest issue with using maul in the early stages is it prevents you front gaining rage for that attack, and with a slow attack speed and low incoming damage, you'll often feel rage starved. Swipe helps with this somewhat by not eating into your rage generation from attacking. It costs a lot though, which is where Primal Fury comes in - each of your swipe hits has a chance to crit, and each crit will earn your 5 rage. Late game with lots of crit this can lead to essentially unlimited rage and needing to use maul just to burn through it all, but early game it just makes swipe a bit more of a tempting option.
---
Enrage is great, and should basically be used whenever it's off cooldown. If your healer appears to be struggling, it might be best to save it for just before you pull, but generally the damage mitigation you lose is less important than the potential threat you gain. After all, one attack on you with reduced armor is still better than one attack on a clothie with no armor.
---
Demoralizing roar is good as well, but not a priority. Against elites, it's just there to increase your damage mitigation, but again, that's usually less important than holding aggro. Against larger groups, it's handy for being a quick way to get aggro on everything, but generates so little threat that it's unlikely to hold for long. Don't count on it.
---
As far as early game goes, that's pretty much it. Tanking early isn't really that different than late, the major difference is in how rage-starved you'll be.
---
How have you done literally 0 testing and come to the conclusion that it’s bugged? Just get a weapon and compare your white hits to the Hemo hits. If Hemo is normalized you will notice it’s damage is based on a different weapon swing timer than your own.
---
But you're a druid, you have all the tools to gtfo

Servera were ddos'd yesterday and the day before.
---
The ENTIRE alliance on the server knows this warrior and won’t play with him or inv him to guilds due to his bad karma... he is a huge running joke
---
Faster, longer
---
Good to know, thank you much
---
What if I told you more would be there if it wasn't a miserable lagfest?
---
Unless the mage blinks forward and has extended frost nova range. The increased distance still surprises me, I rooted about 20-30 people at once by running into a group at TM last night with a pally bubble on. It’s fantastic
---
This faction queue "solution" has been posted every day by multiple people. I dont understand what thought you put into it other than seeing someone else post about it and then decide to make your own using the exact same idea.
---
Wow so you can hit 60 from boars alone.
---
Even with wotf Warlocks have the upper hand vs Rogues in a 1v1 in this patch.
---
Or you can stop bitching, buy yourself some cheap lesser invisibility potions and keep playing the damn game. Jesus, I'm sick and tired of these excuses when you roll on a PVP server. The Initial wave of this will be over by the end of the week anyways, and then we can get back to business
---
I feel like you are using the word 'adverse' incorrectly.
---
adverse
---
/ˈadvəːs/
---
adjective
---
preventing success or development; harmful; unfavourable.
---
"taxes are having an adverse effect on production"
---
It is no 'vice versa'.
---
But more on topic, I've not come across any people who'd warrant a post such as this - plenty of people new to the game, but no big issues. If it's one simple question they pose I can give a simple answer, but if it's more complex I typically give a vague or general answer and point them to some search terms and tell them to Google it. For dungeons I toss out 1-2 new marks now and then to point them in the right direction, or give bare minimum advice for a boss (healing, so can't lead the charge but can compensate for shortcomings to an extent). 
---
That said, there's a lot of sensitivity on this subreddit and other internet sources, so I kind of see the merit of this too.
---
At first I thought they handed me the wrong player name, Rank 14, Highwarlord, About 10,000 honorable kills, etcetera , etcetera, etcetera
---
He meant classic is not vanilla, which is true cause we are using updated items, etc from 1.12
---
Then don’t join a group with said item on reserve. It isn’t like it is sprung on you at the last second.
---
Prob because you’re in shit gear?
---
Idk it was a pretty decent tug of war. Idk if I would say any side was dominating. When I first got there it seemed alliance had the advantage, but it kept changing throughout the night.
---
So true.
---
It's pretty hard to get more than 1 frame a second in most w/pvp, heeeyo.
---
But rly blizz fix your game.
---
You realize how ez mode this patch is right? Completely revamped talents, better gear, and years of experience with mods that walk you through each encounter
---
None of that shit was a thing in vanilla
---
How does a dagger rogue use his stuns properly?
---
Nsfw btw
---
Yeah he got a YouTube channel where he is out of "character" seems like another person entirely
---
Important thing to note is how threat works.  
---
You gain threat by:
---
- healing (you can throw a Rejuvenation on yourself before you head in)
---
- dealing damage
---
- gaining rage
---
Your biggest threat generation is using Maul.  
---
Every mob has a threat table. This means every mob keeps track individually who they think is the most dangerous opponent that should be killed first. As people take actions in combat, they mostly increase their threat but some skills also lower it.  
---
**Taunts DO NOT GENERATE THREAT.** Taunting an enemy will *set your threat level to equal the highest threat level on that target* and temporarily force it to attack you. Taunt is best used after a damage dealer has caused a big damage spike causing the mob to attack the damage dealer. Always follow up a taunt with at least one Maul!
---
AOE taunt (which you will get later on) only temporarily forces the enemies to attack you, it does not set your threat level to equal the highest values on each taget.
---
umm I think you meant fortnite
---
Wasnt this the one where he nanjad a war tank item he lost roll on but it turned out he was the only war tank in the raid?
---
Yes. It’s an immediate deduction from your current honor
---
80vs 80 battles seem to run fine. Big enough for me, but hard to control how many join.
---
I'm sure one out of the 90 horde raids with 40 people will get Sara at some point, no need for a KoS.
---
Which unit?
---
Ive been leveling in pvp spec the entire time. Ambush, daggers. Im always trying to blow someone up from stealth, but on the rare chance they survuve the first 2 hits, whats a good rotation to het back into stealth and reset. 
---
Blind, vanish, and then stick close to them while waiting on energy?
---
Is this lag only happening on certain servers? I was in South shore all afternoon and had zero lag.
---
We're not talk to my about righteous orbs, were talking in a thread about righteous orbs. There's a difference. What were talking about is the phrase "playing 12 hours a day to hit lvl 60". And as I mentioned after showing the math, too much time has elapsed for that phrase to be valid by this point.
---
I maybe should’ve mentioned that
---
Once outside the ramp leading into BRM. Once before the jump down to the lava. Once right in front of the MC entrance. And finally once in front of the entrance to BRD.
---
It is tradition.
---
Not to mention the diminishing return.  You can battle all day at hillsbrad and kill the same people over and over again and get zero honor for them after 4 kills.
---

---
I love you!
---
As far as I know it is possible to over-grind at low ranks. 
---
Does anyone have a rough estimate of how much honor/week you need get the rank points to keep moving up steadily from rank 1 to 10.
---
For Example:
---
Week 1: 5000 honor
---
Week 2: 20000 honor
---
Week 3: 40000 honor
---
etc.
---
Exactly
---
I was there for that too. Was an absolute massacre and such a fun time!
---
I'm glad I decided to roll Grob, it seems like one of the most balanced servers.
---
1000 tosses is where a statistic starts getting reliable.
---
Other side of globe? That's not how the servers work, besides, you had loads of time to level, now deal with it.
---
Yea but you shuffle the card back into the deck after every pull. So its always 1/4 regardless of previous pulls
---
You die a few times but you’ll get in.
---
The sad part is that this is how modern business works unironically.
---
The main reason to pick goblin over gnome imo is for the sapper creation, so i'd put gnome on your main and goblin on the sapper alt.
---
shh, don't interrupt the circle jerk.
---
Or you make friends and run consistent groups. I have 3-4 tanks I can call on to come do a dungeon because this is a social team based game for the most part. When those tanks aren’t available I can just call on a warrior with a fat stick and heal him for an even faster than normal clear. I’ll quit this game before I pay someone to play the class and spec they rolled.
---
In-combat mana regen from Spirit is significantly slower than out-of-combat mana regen though, even though drinking is the primary means.
---
I was on the ship from Booty Bay to Ratchet outnumbered 10 to 1 so I thought I would be funny by using a translator to say anal kill lol to the Alliance a bunch of times. I got ganked the second the ship was about to teleport and the realm got confused about where my body was, froze my game, and then I couldn’t log on for 20 minutes.
---
Moral of the story. Dont go yelling anal kill unless you are in fact going to anally kill.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TME0xubdHQc
---
Really only 2 classes can be tanks--druids and warriors. Druid tanks are very rare, as it seems most druids go healing--which is what their set bonuses benefit.
---
Pair this fact with the fact that tanking can be fairly difficult and stressful. Compare with with the fact that (nearly) every class can DPS in some form and that priests, shamans, paladins, and druids can heal. The least common dungeon role is inevitably tank.
---
Supply and demand makes tanks highly sought after
---
how big is your dick?
---
42069 kills or nothing.
---
Yesterday there were over 400 people on Blaumeux fighting in Hillsbrad. It was great!
---
Youre a 60 tanking SM as a favor - they arent doing it without you, and you dont need it. You are allowed to make ultimatums.
---
Players even ask him to ninja stuff, if I remember correctly he "ninjad" the wrath helm but later revealed the guy he took it from told him to do it
---
I don't have enough bread for all the jelly in this thread.
---
Does that even matter? We cleared MC with ease without the 1.12 items...the whole 1.12 argument is just pointless, the mechanics, boss health is a joke, you can clear it with people in greens and level 58s...
---
It's only a 12y range, even with Blink (20) that's not enough to catch with a nova if you're kiting at max range. Outside of leeway anyway. Who knows at that point because it's absurdly broken lol.
---
Interesting. This is good to know. I just made myself a Force Reactive Disk. If I can make that go off 10 times against an aoe pack at the same time then I'll deal a ton of damage and even more threat.
---
What's your end goal here? Are you trying to justify taking advantage of other people by reserving orbs in strat live runs? That's what this feels like.
---
&gt;People run strat live for all sorts of reasons, therefore I am not a shitbag for reserving orbs.
---
Is that about right?
---
As much as it's annoying to see that phrase in chat ("X reserved"), think of it like this -- I could simply start a group and decline applications from all classes competing for my desired item. Or I could just say X reserved and give those classes an opportunity to join if they have some other business in there.
---
(Reserving all orbs is a rather cheesy/exploitative move, but you will still find fresh 60's or 58+ to join you who are in there just for the quests or want to upgrade their greens.)
---
Same her, no ques, no lagg in 80 vs 80 pvp. I had no problems at all. Every single gaming subreddit devolves into a hatetrain its just the nature of the algorithms and human behavior, doesn't mean every single game is bad.
---
Alterac Valley &gt; 2s/3s Arenas &gt; Duels/1v1 wpvp.
---
I put AV at the top just for the sheer fun it is. However, I typically prefer smaller scale pvp that allows for greater expression of individual player skill and for unique class mechanics to have a greater impact or time to shine. 
---
I'd say anything &gt;5v5 wpvp just becomes a shitfest in my experience.
---
They deff didn't play the game yesterday after 2pm est or today &gt;.&lt;
---
This needs to be higher up. So many people seem to think that blizz is just running shit servers and can slap in better hardware and everything will be fine and good when in reality the game (BFA) isn't meant to have that many people fighting each other let alone in the same zone and hasn't since sharding was introduced
---
How about some logs showing the instant deaths or core rat cast? Surgers were definitely fixed to charge properly. Rest sounds like bologna.
---
Not everyone has a tank on hand that is available to run. I see people in Trade/LFg all the time LF tanks for every lvl 60 dungeon, strat is no exception.
---
Is there a dungeon that I can reasonably go into solo as a Warrior to mine Mithril Ore/Solid Stone? 
---
I want to make more Goblin Sapper Charges without dumping 5g into a stack of Solid Stones. I don't really want to go mining in the Badlands now after this PvP update, although I could try some other zones too.
---
12 yards even with the improved distance?
---
It doesn't seem to track mail and I'm not interested in the way it changes the bag display.

---
Why would someone want to lag?
---
Prayer helps, and if you know nothing challenging is coming for 3 min you can use inner focus -&gt; prayer
---
We'll I moved and my server is doing completely fine, so keep sitting here yelling at me for being a shill or solve your own problem. Your call.
---
You've been visited by mr. jokerd - upvote and share this copy pasta 3 times or your contract with Method will be terminated
---
True, True. Thanks for your input.
---
The only time I ever saw hundreds of players in one place on Tichondrius (one of the biggest PvP servers in vanilla) was the AQ event. It was cataclysmic levels of lag. I remember having no idea what was happening with the event in Duskwood, there were some mobs glitching about and their health went down every 5 seconds and no players were moving at all. The server entirely crashed multiple times.
---
We'd have a few raids at world bosses, they were laggy as hell but somewhat playable. SS vs TM was a lagfest but of course it ended when BGs arrived.
---
BFA has already shown that their servers aren't built to handle large scale PvP any better than they were back then. It's a shame but I wonder if it's even feasible for them to fix, they've been leaning on sharding for so long.
---
Cheers, have a good Friday
---
Exactly lol. I don’t know why everybody on this sub acts like vanilla didn’t also lag it’s ass off.

Not exactly. It's like a random posting on a public forum looking for someone who's interested in letting them fuck their wife. Weird, but harmless. It's a pretty big difference.

Hey thanks, I just did! It was full of guild drama and this Reddits post!

You can break it down a bit more by searching for race as well. That census addon does it.

/who 60 shaman troll

No one can confirm if this happend in Vanilla or not, but its a side effect of spell batching that would require the ENTIRE system to be overhauled to fix... so either way Classic massively buffed 31/x/x based ele shamans.
---
My boy is wicked smaaaht

Free honor. As long as there are no BGs everyone will take what they can get.

Nostalgia maybe idk I don't want lag but I also don't care about pvp

You watch Asmon? lol

Whatever you say, squeak

Coordinating target sure, takes some skill but by the same token when 5 people can global a person's healthpooler the other 35 can be complete idiots and just roll people because of sheer numbers.
---
There is no even matchups... it's always 2:1 in hordes favor so the point is so moot.

Make sure you gkick whoever was in charge of master looter too while you're at it. Because the only thing worse than having a ninja in your raid is having someone stupid enough to give people the opportunity to ninja in your raid.
---
Mara has some mithril nodes. I think at 60 you might be able to get to them while skipping the giants, dinos, and rock ele's. Could try killing rock ele's for their solid stone as well.
---
As a discipline priest: "Thanks, but I am good"
---
Nobody ever considered rogues might be tanking as a coping mechanism for their deep seated self loathing and existential dread.
---
You're an idiot.
---
I suspect this is going to be the case for me as well. People on my friends list are either because I did some leatherworking for them or because I tanked a dungeon. Of the 8 end game dungeons I’ve already got all of the loot I want from four of them, with three others only being one piece and the other being UBRS which for some reason I just haven’t been running very often so I’ll get to that soon.
---
Nobody ever said the raiding was mechanically challenging.
---
They said the *game*, as in all of it, is less forgiving than retail is.
---
&gt; /r/classicwow's only redeeming quality is that it's not /r/wow.

Never played on a pve server but this is gold if that's how a random encounter goes on one.

Even better if he follows up with:

tell me about it, just dinged 51. Its nightmare
---
Got ganked so hard trying to get to BRD that my WoW folder deleted itself and my character respawned as a lv1 Arcanist in Eorzea...
---
Whispering people from who is a very classic thing. People did it all the time in vanilla and tbc. It's also way faster to find people; in a lot of cases posting in lfg/world gets no bites, but who can fill a group in minutes.
---
That quote... I KNOW I know that quote. Is it Army of Darkness?
---
YEEEE Fuck Asmon
---
Is ggr a good oh with perds in mh

Considering the elemental shaman can outright delete any one every 3 minutes... its really a non-contest.

Shaman blows paladin out of the water right now.

---
Just keeping the hardware up to maintain the bot wouldn't be worth the money.
---
Start heading for any out of the way quest lines you might have skipped past in zones around your level. I'm level 54 on my warrior and I was grinding mobs throughout Felwood pretty much unbothered yesterday. I found a solid group of mobs around my level fairly close to the GY in case I died. Got ganked twice in about 2hours, not too bad.
---
But besides that, it's probably best to park in a dungeon and try and grind some levels that way.
---
Double yikes.
---
I get a whisper once every few hours as a healing priest, idt it's that bad tbh.
---
Lol okay bud
---
&gt; Easiest answer is that he's extremely successful, which breeds envy.
---
I watched him and liked him too, until two things happened.
---
1.  Him defending his officer being a ninjalooter.
---
2.  Him bringing his thousands of followers to Herod, which was supposed to be a non-streamer server.  It was already super horde heavy, which he could have fixed by rolling alliance, but they went horde for the EZ PVP, fucking up the balance, perhaps irreversibly.  I know he didn't stay, but McConnel did and so did enough of his followers to fill two guilds.
---
Wow, the pre-launch Classic community had threads about this guy every day. I haven't thought about this guy in a while. It's great to just have your server and guild discord now for daily WoW happenings.
---
I thought I was a loser, until I saw Asmon's Sulfuras crafting RP bullshit on YouTube. 
---
Dear Lord
---
Well duh
---
Questie lies.
---
This. 300v300 would have just straight up crashed the world server throughout Vanilla.
---
To be fair he will use it until p6...
---
You should delete this comment, you are trying to quote 2 different people like they said the same sentence...
---
I laughed at "cloud based servers." I don't think blizzard has said anything about their servers, correct me if I'm wrong. But that aside, having a "cloud based server" doesn't mean shit. If you are getting enough resources allocated, then you are good. Cloud based just means that the server belongs to someone else.
---
Lol no I didn't?
---
Thanks guys for downvoting. Really helpful. I'll be sure to help you out next time I know something that you don't.

Upgrade your zoom setup bro, it's 2019
---
Less than 10% away from dinging 58, also a warrior. Be strong, brother.
---
Nice let the salt flow. Its part of the pvp server you have to just deal with it.
---
There is no mythic+ in classic no end game content that requires groups outside of raiding.
---
Faction balance is more important in classic because less content means there needs to be more player interaction with the other faction to keep a server relevant.
---
Everyone worries about dead servers. The first to die in classic will be the 90/10 horde servers when naxx is cleared and there's nothing left to do but BG or level alts.
---
I like world PvP though, just not 6 people jumping me while i'm picking herbs. Had a great battle at Grom Gol last night it was about 20v20 very fair fight no complaints even tho I died a bunch.
---
If you're not 60, your only real goal is to hit 60. If you are 60, there's a lot of things you can do that don't involve running around in the open world trying to kill shit by yourself. There's a difference.
---
Yes, and? There's thousands of people playing on the same realm so interaction between players is inevitable.
---
I know how it is, I've been playing a Paladin up until I rerolled a Shaman. The whispers don't bother me at the slightest. If I can join them I do and if I can't I simply say "no thank you" and there's zero issues.
---
I don't think it's nice when you get some turbo idiots whispering you in some abreviated crazy talk but at least that tells me the level of intelligence I can expect from the rest of the group.
---
Let it go Rambo. The war is over
---
Pulp Fiction.
---
Eh, you are mixing up thin vs thick clients. The wow client is definitely thick. A large amount of code in the client as well as a robust server API to support it. They wouldn't rewrite the client without first optimizing the server framework.
---
I think that's my dilemma, is whether or not the extra proc chances (believe the ICD is 3 seconds per charge but someone feel free to correct me) are worth losing out on the mana bonus/PI.
---
Shadowguard proc'ing blackout feels really good, especially on a melee that is on your ass, since post-fear I feel like I'm pretty screwed unless I'm with someone and they are peeling.
---
So really the tl;dr is, does the RNG chance of surviving off blackout warrant the loss of 10% more mana/PI or some other combo of talents from either the disc or holy trees
---
Your playing on a pvp server, shoudlve expected this
---
Any videos of this? That sounds awesome.

"Hey we need 4 times as many tanks as we have!"
---
Uhh.. opps?
---
is this fresh pasta?
---
I remember not PvPing much in classic and getting to rank 5. Any thoughts on how many hours a week you might PvP to hit Rank 10 for the full rare/lower-tier PvP set?
---
The silence by Blizzard on this matter is maddening.
---
As someone else mentioned HotW/NS will be perfect for you. You can tank or heal all dungeons and you can use cat form for world farming.
---
Fucking fuck I forgot about Pulp Fiction
---
What spergboy?
---
Do you play on Faerlina because I was talking about Faerlina specifically. It's absolutely not remotely close to 2:1. It's 1:1 and alliance is getting completely mopped while alt tabbed to asmons stream or something
---
For the record I completely agree with you that it's not "hard" to do what we're doing lol
---
Hows the lag at TM right now. It was a slide show yesterday.
---
Always remember a banana for scale
---
I know in future expansion pretty much all the guards can see through stealth/invisible, not sure on classic.
---
Dude went out with a Staff of Dominance and his own copy-pasta.
---
YES it does. LoL.
---
My brother watches Asmon and doesn't even play WoW
---
&gt; Asmongold of all people, with his top tier loot and mountain of followers should be able to enjoy the fighting 
---
TBH, this guy probably has many more haters than followers.
---
Blizzard fans are amongst the worst fanboy bases around. They will furiously defend the company's misdoings they pay money to for no reward whatsoever because they sink so much time into their games they would completely hate themselves if they admitted any fault of blizzard to themselves.
---
I agree but we are at fucking mc dude? Can  you at least wait until AQ or maybe even naxx before calling it easy?
---
No one expects the Ragnaros Inquisition.

I couldn’t find the honor vendor anyone help a brother out?
---
Every layer was 3k, they took away other layers leaving you with one 3k layer
---
Or just getting stuck with childish idiots every dungeon is tiresome. There's a reason there aren't many tanks and it's because they don't want to deal with the mages starting each pull with cone of cold, frost nova blizzard spam and pulling everything. or the shadow priest starting every single pull with mind blast on the one target we haven't gotten to with a sunder or anything else. or the rogue attacking any target but skull because they want to see if they can kill a different target faster than the other DPS. and I don't need anything from dungeons, the only reason i run them at this point is if a guildy or a friend needs a tank. if i get spammed if i want to tank something fuck yeah I want to make gold doing it. why would i do it for free if I don't need anything in that dungeon?
---
imo you didn't put enough &gt; between all other options and "large world pvp", fuck that shit lmao

If you dont have cht im pretty sure it should be perds ggr over perds bonescraper or whatever, but cht is a bit better than ggr in oh, and wont waste a debuff slot.

Corrupted ashbringer drops in naxx off of four horsemen.

I think of HoTW as the spec that let's me stack spi without mercy, or aim for heavy +healing to the detriment of int.  Many people seem to take an additional 20% int as an excuse to stack mana pools to massive overkill.  It probably works best to use it as a cushion/crutch for making up for gear that is going a different way in stats.

Switching to master loot in the middle of a boss fight doesn't work on most other realms. You need to have it on beforehand

No such thing as reserves

Not a witch hunt when its already done and over. Guys been put on blast and memed to death at this point. Just wanting to know from other servers what jerks they have on theirs.

I don't think people are necessarily doing it for fun, it's just another kind of 9f farming.

---
Lots of people were also told about this channel in the Trade channel for a long time during the first weeks as a very small percentage know about it.
---
Okay great advice!
---
Well if you're committed to going with holy shield, then you are planning to tank 5-mans and aoe grind, thus you need consecration. No brainer. Plus you get 20 points in holy so you can also heal dungeons and early raids.

Is this supposed to be some kind of r/iamverybadass material? Lol cringy af
---
I’ve seen some mixed advice in here. I’m the main tank for my guild and have done a bunch of research on gearing for warrior tanks. 
---
Defense is a very low priority stat for you. It’s main value is reducing your chance to be crit; however, while you have shield block active *you cannot be crit*. If you’re tanking you should have 1 (and only 1) point into imp shield block which will allow you have 100% uptime on shield time against bosses, therefore negating the advantage of +Def. 
---
Reaching hit cap (even if it means wearing some mail or “dps” pieces) is number one priority. After that focus on stamina and other raw mitigation stats like dodge and parry.
---
Buy the pattern if you can get it under 80g and you know reliable ways to make gold at a pace of 30-60+g /hr. Grinding LBRS repeatedly is not a good way to get it unless you run repeatedly with people you know and trust. I'm not a fan of spending hours trying to get a group together, grinding for hours without seeing the pattern, or losing the pattern to another mage, or losing the pattern to an all-need roll because people claim they "need it for gold" and mage tailors somehow don't deserve the pattern without paying.
---
It’s probably just a spec thing. Warlock is literally just apply curse and spam shadowbolt unless you’re given a debuff slot in which case you’re allowed to press corruption and shadowburn.
---
While Prot Paladin is a thing in PvP I think you're misunderstanding what they excel at. It's not damage and you wouldn't go for either of these skills.
---
Prot Paladins in PvP are walking fortresses of support. You are looking to disrupt healers and casters while peeling and blessing your allies.
---
I would use Seal of Justice or Wisdom while PvPing and switch to Righteousness when you have an opportunity to assist with a kill.
---
Your main priority should be drawing attention to yourself vs your damage dealers and blessing them/stunning enemies CCing them.
---
Rogues should absolutely be attacking on retaliation, just not from the front like a big dummy where it can proc.
---
Better hope you global that sucker or you're still gonna have a bad time.

"who called in the fleet?"

Was this on Sulfuras? If so, I had the same issue. Was amazing to see, but lag ruined a lot of it

The person, whose name is red, lying dead on the ground makes money playing video games by broadcasting live video of him playing video games.   Person here thought it was funny to post a picture of this persons corpse.
---
Hey man I’m already depressed enough about diminishing returns on my HK farm, you don’t need to remind me
---
Yes.. a lot of people dont join grps that reserve things... thats why there are so many groups reserving things... so they dont get full groups. Yea that math adds up.
---
Ofc I appreciate that this is a trolly troll, but has nobody realised that you have 6 talent points at level 15?
---
I saw this exact same thing on Atiesh the other day. Definitely happens a lot.
---
This is why being a healer is the most stressful job.    You have to babysit idiots or let them die and try and keep the tank alive.   
---
Fuckers think this is BfA and can run through dungeons.   Shit needs to be coordinated and when the dps just run and pull agro it is AGROvating.

It might literally be faster to run from Tanaris and just stay in southern Un'goro as you ride to Silithus.

I made the mistake of flying to Un'goro yesterday, and god damn that is one long corpse run.  I clicked on the flight master and clicked to fly literally anywhere else just to avoid another death and corpse run.

Ah yes, the guild of 10 that reserve/control all loot - there's no possible way this can go south. Noooope. Nah. Nada. :^ )

Boomers? How many people 60+ are playing now? How many people 45+ were playing back in the day? I mean I admit I sucked when I raided in vanilla, but I was also 12 at the time.
---
PSA: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS DHKs FOR KILLING PLAYERS
---
I’d like to take a second to point out the handicap designation...
---
Proc rate was thought to be lower, and it has better itemization than actual pre-BWL vanilla
---
I said earlier that I don’t think p2 will last very long be p3 release , maybe won’t last for a months or just 2 weeks.
---
My reason is that there haven’t been any PVE raid updates since the classic release yet. A lot people are getting tired waiting BWL. And it’s something that matters a lot for PVE content. So p3 have to come ASAP.
---
And world pvp might be quite fun a while, but it can’t actually commits much rank reward to players, and with dishonored kill at risk. People will find it really hard to get to R10 in months just in world pvp. R13 looks more impossible. And if they stop grinding, their ranks drops badly so people will get mad of this shit. 
---
Lags and layer is another problem. Blizzard wanted to make massive pvp in a single layer but they fuck up really hard with this.
---
I personally love battleground (I reached R12 in vanilla with mage) and have no interest in world pvp, I’m still grinding the gold and preparing the engineering trinkets, leveling my alt so I can make portions myself , everything I do is for the incoming battlegrounds.
---
Imagine greeding boe epics
---
Tbf there are only 2 places where prot warriors shine in PvP - 1v1 vs melee and wsg flag running.
---
In groups prot warriors tend to be ignored as their damage output is negligible.
---
If you played BFA at all there is a quest chain where you raise some guy from the dead and he meets up with his living human family and talks to them. So yeah, I see what you're saying.
---
I have a 52 Druid and haven't really messed with professions much yet. I initially had herb/alch but didn't keep up. I dropped both and picked up enchanting so I can DE on my main instead of my alt. 
---
What is another good second profession that would be worth having? I'm considering Engineering and just buying AH mats to level it up.
---
Does Engineering still have good benefits in PvE? Or is it mainly for PvP items? Any other professions I should consider? Thanks!
---
You‘re right sorry. I For some reason I mixed it up with the uncorrupted one.

There are 2 important breakpoints when it comes to the Defense stat. 350 &amp; 440, 350 will prevent level 62 elites from getting crushing blows on you which is really important and I would strongly recommend shooting for that, if you took 5/5 in the +Defense talent you'll only need +40 from gear at 60.
---
The other breakpoint at 440 is why all the lists have everything with best +Defense and that is the point at which level 62 elites can no longer get a critical hit. It is unobtainable without raid pieces currently and even with the minimum raid pieces needed &amp; 4pc Deathbone, you will generate absolutely abysmal threat in that gear. Personally I do not think aiming for 440 defense (or all +defense gear you can mindlessly) is a good way to gear currently, but it will be important later on as it becomes more attainable.
---
+Defense does also give other stats like dodge &amp; party chance that should be taken into consideration as well.
---
Lol, yeah, sounds like Pills.
---
Does nobody on this subreddit understand English?
---
I don’t give a damn about dps meter, I talk about solo PvEing
---
You shouldn't ever be suplementing with hit after prioritizing defense. Reach hit cap first and then worry about the other stats.
---
To be fair, nifty stopwatch and the gnomish cloak both get you out of a no-win together.
---
I've basically casually walked through entire horde raids with nifty + a fap + zerker rage + shield wall.
---
Do people actually take those boastings and commands seriously though? It baffles me how many people take themselves too seriously and in turn take anything Asmongold says too seriously.
---
Is anyone else mindfucked by the fact that tier 2 sets didn’t get their iconic look until 1.9? I swore it was earlier. But the official patch notes and even thottbot show people in awe at the new models at that time.

Handling 600 players vs 200 players is, at a minimum, 9 times harder. The average increase in computing power over the last 15 years is about 21% more per year. That means about 13x. So no, I'm not surprised that that shit still lags and I also recognize that it's a seriously tough problem to solve and unlikely to be resolved by throwing more RAM at it like half this sub seems to think.
---
he chooses to act that way cause it got him a big following and a lot of money.  i’d act like a jackass on stream for that much money too.
---
It was laggy, but it wasn't this bad. AQ opening is the only thing comparable to this imo.
---
Why would you save the talents?
---
Are you twelve years old or what? Blizz wont do any major upgrades if they consider the costs are too high compared to the benefits.
---
If I were to guess, npc's have lower quality models to help with the old engine?

That goes to the healers. Also as an ele sham in one of the top 20 guilds I got staff of dominance
---
I think this would be the one classic change I’d support. It sounds pretty immersive.

5 level 40s could easily kill level 60s who can’t fight back for fear of DKs.  That system couldn’t work that way.

My main is at level 26. Aw very body boo me.

nah, its part of the stream character..
---
Engineering is good but for druid I'm not sure you can really use anything in shapeshifted form so that night be annoying. I usually just pick up herbalism as a second profession on every character to make a bit of money and get mats for easier consumes.
---
Also a good point. Mages should never die from fall damage.
---
Nope, 15 sec atleast on mograine.
---
I don't believe they do anything this first week. Dishonorable kills immediately reduce your rank points, but don't affect your rank points the following week. Since no one has any rank points this first week, I don't think they should have any effect currently.

Lol, shoulda rolled on a PvE server.

I'm not upset about it *now*. I'm upset about since release.

All battlegrounds based gear is phase 3 or 4. The scout, warlord, field marshal gear is out this phase.
---
I have been in fights of a few hundred with no tidi. When you break 1000 you start to get tidi.
---
Full fleets are 256. Two full fleets can easily clash without tidi. It's when multiple allies show up that there it starts to occur.
---
Pretty sure that shield block negates any need or use for defense skill. The only reason you need defense it to not be able to be crit or crushing blowed, which Shield Block negates. That is the biggest reason why warriors are the best Vanilla tanks.

---
PVE realms right now just do the southshore/tarren mill thing
---
the same idea, sheeple just go with the band on hating paladins
---
The point in adjusting server size is that they didn’t want half a server to just be checking out the game and then quit, leaving every server with a low population.
---
I played on an RP PVE server back "in the day"! There actually was a decent amount of world PVP, just not between lower level characters. Lots of people put up their tag once they hit 60, though. I remember the plague-lands being particularly active. 
---
Ultimately I switched to an RP PVP server. So I guess you can figure out which I like more, but PVE server experience was not as boring as you might think.
---
A level 60 lock thought it would be smart to gank my Mara group (We were all high 40's)... We dirt rolled that fool.  Power in numbers :D
---
You do know we still pvp on pve servers right? It's just that you have to opt in.
---
Yes you can create a horde character and change factions.
---
What server is all this reserving occuring, because i have yet to see a LFG with reservations? Not one yet.
---
Do dungeons and get your prebis
---
&gt;  But it is a fairly easy and low effort way to make consistent progress.
---
i'll take it!
---
most of damage is not physical
---
any damage breaks slowfall, so any ranged attack really.
---
55 hunter feels bad
---
Doesn't make that much difference.
---
Holy will be significantly more efficient for you until you get some bonus heal gear, but it won't make a difference if your raid isn't short on healers.
---
We’re definitely outnumbered but it’s no skeram.
---
I haven't run MC but my understanding was that you don't need raid gear at all for AoE grinding ZF. Just some sexy "Of the Eagle" level-appropriate greens.
---
The queue could be from layering being removed.

I did mining and engineering. Mainly for PvP but I managed to find good RTV farming routes and have looted about 20-30 arcane crystals and with the thorium I’ve made them into grenades and thorium headed arrows and that works for me

Anyone else noticing a terrible drop rate from the EPL plaguebats?

It's supposed to be a decent grey farm, but half the mobs have no drops at all.

Phase 2 drops:
---
PVP realm players - *confused screaming* followed by the lower population faction complaining that the game is unplayable.
---
PVE realms players - "Well yeah, I might flag pvp for a bit every now and then for fun."
---
I play on a PVE realm so this is merely based off the posts I see here.
---
I play on a PvP server but never will I ever find it acceptable to be instantly camped by 5+ people the moment I land at Light's Hope, or being attacked inside Gadgetzan/Everlook by losers who can't roam in the open without being stomped, so they' rather take durability loss from guards just to get that one honor kill.
---
BGs are consensual PvP matches too. The "point" of PvP is not about actions that are borderline griefing. Never has been, and never will be.
---
*saps player* 
---
“Aha! you fell for my trap!!”
---
if he starts bitching on stream people will start to camp him more to get a reaction.
---
You are actually perfectly setup, any less hit and you will start to lose dps from misses and any more hit and it wont scale as well.  You are currently hit capped for yellow with a decent % extra hit for whites and with your weapon skill at 305 or above you have reduced glancing blow damage to the point its basically a white hit now (which is a good thing)
---
I personally run 11% also.  5% from talents, 6% from gear and I just let the +5 human passive and the +5 weapon skill talent to reduce my glancing blows so I get 100% dmg from them.  I usually lead the damage meters or finish top 3 in our MC runs with Thrash Blade / Mirahs and double sader.  Keeping SnD up 85-80% uptime.
---
As /u/Medieval_Turkey said already, no -- you'll need to maintain the rank to maintain that discount.  However, Rank 3 is extremely easy to maintain.  Most people will achieve and maintain that rank without even actually trying.
---
And the rest of it isn't adding up anywhere near 4k.
---
Yup. Ally's literally just camping everlook

Ohh so there’s still some wpvp going, noice

If transfer is like vanilla you can’t transfer from a PvE realm to a PvP one.

For Alliance, he's near the Rogue/Warrior section in Stormwind.

Lol so once you’re level 60 it’s okay to gank ?

Wonder what the meta is like on pve servers, only have tanks with pvp toggled on at first to get a better start?

Kill Somebody? That's honorable.  
---
Kill Everybody? That's a statistic.

&gt;  it takes a long ass time and is very boring

Tis, but a good mindless activity to watch a stream or listen to an audiobook to and still make progress on your character

No but on the flipside you would just spend 10 hours lfg as dps and never actually get to run the instance once.

Dude I'm a tank so my groups form instantly regardless of reserve so there's literally no way "my way" is slower.
---
Lets say an average an UBRS run takes an hour
---
Lets say on average you’re going to lose at least one roll
---
That means it has to take you on average more than an hour longer to put together a res groups vs a non res group. As I said from personal experience as a tank it takes virtually no time to put together a group res or not so for tanks this isn’t even a discussion. The biggest limiting factor in groups is finding tanks so even non-res groups need to spend time finding them. Is a DPS putting together a res group vs a non-res group going to take an extra hour? I doubt it.
---
The last thing about non-res groups is that they’re a gamble. Sure you could win the first roll, but you could also literally lose every single roll and never get the item. If you ran “8 scenarios and res never came out ahead” then you did a shit job at making scenarios since the one where you never win during a roll is clearly worse than the res scenario.  At least in res groups if you reserve the item you’re guaranteed the item the first time it drops which to a lot of people is more than worth the extra time it takes to make res groups, especially on popular items with low drop rates.
---
I’d love to see the mental gymnastics you went through that you “tried to type out”
---
hope you spammed x on that nerd
---
26/25/0 is better in just about every way IMO, with very select exceptions. Spiritual healing is largely overrated since it doesn't scale with +heals.
---
God damn, you act like tanks are the only one dealing with these assholes.  Healers have a harder job, dps have a hard job to figure out how to help the tank deal with the the idiot you speak of.  You're not the only person dealing with it.  Just as you generalize all DPS as idiots because of some superiority complex, there are tanks who are also dipshits, sorry.
---
The dude clearly has no idea at all what he's talking about in regards to the question. Even his apology post highlights that he is not who this question was aimed at as he has no clue, and never should have answered in the first place. If he's so upset about being called out he can always just delete the post.
---
Come to sulfuras. The alliance are plentiful here, and would love to have you join our ranks.
---
QQ on the ranks after week 1. Will there be rank 14's after week 1? (ie the top what fraction of the top percent?) or will we all just go up a rank or two.
---
Gank other 60s.
---
Weird. Nothing like that at all on our end. 
---
Sounds more like a server population issue than a PvP specific one.
---
With a full group of lowbies it actually isn't that bad. Combine that with the quests and drops and I'd definitely take runs from this guy.
---
I should have mentioned - your ceiling will be quiet a bit lower with this method.  Unless you're putting in obscene amounts of time in the SS/TM grind, you're unlikely to hit the upper ranks.  But if your goal is to settle in around Rank 7 or so, you'll probably be fine.
---
No I didnt, mods did.
---
Sure, my statement still is true.
---
Yea I bet Southshore has some kind of action on every server until BGs release.

You act like there really isnt another healer that wont take your spot. Healers are plentiful.

Had to flair it. Refresh.
---
This is really late, but in case you still care or some other person is reading this leveling a warrior... Most of your arms damage is autos, so generally this is what I do in priority order when solo in the world or when I'm melee dps instead of tanking (YMMV--develop your own style):
---
1. Charge if you can for rage.
---
2. Pop bloodrage if you can.
---
3. Battle shout if you need to.
---
4. If against more than one foe: pop sweeping strikes
---
5. Always overpower if it's up.
---
6. If against more than one foe: pre-36 or whirlwind (WW) on cooldown, Cleave. Otherwise, WW.
---
7. Execute against any mob under 20%.
---
8. Rend early.
---
9. Hit sunder.
---
I almost never heroic strike unless I can't use execute but have already maxed out sunders and have rend applied and there's just nothing else to do (generally against say a higher level or elite mob with lots of HP). Heroic strike (along with Cleave) steals an auto attack, so it means you are trading all of the rage that would generate for only a slight bump in damage. Execute and overpower aren't on the same cooldown as your auto, though, so a lot more damage without stealing rage generation.
---
Against multiple targets, you should apply sweeping strikes. It's huge burst. If you are against two mobs and cleave, it will attack 4 times immediately. If you whirlwind against 4 enemies, you will attack 8 times immediately. That's a LOT of damage.
---
The other thing I do against a single mob is hamstring. I'll hamstring first unless they dodge on charge and I have overpower up. Then after my first auto I retreat away until my swing timer resets and I can auto again. That just avoids damage. This, however, can be a tedious way to play and it's perfectly fine to not always do this (or never really). It just means less damage taken by face tanking, which means less time / money spent on regenerating HP through food, resting, or pots.
---
Also, at least on my server, leveling consumables are a pittance of money. So consider buying buff scrolls to use when doing a grinding quest of some kind solo. I can make more money in additional mobs killed and time saved than I spend on Scroll of Agility II or whatever.
---
Light's Hope definitely did crash 4 times per day. I played Darrowshire for 6+ months, and Northdale from launch through Naxx.

Anyone from Horde Bloodsail Buccaneers knows Bear and Denbu. Bear like male orcs too much and Denbu needed something just to AH it and now we use Denbu'ing as a verb.
---
I've been in BRD 3x and all 3x, there has been people in there who don't know their way around and need a little help, or a lot of help.  I still get confused, though, and I haven't had a "full run," I don't think.  At least that's what my quest logs say lol.  Sometimes I don't even know it's a boss, because everything looks so similar in there.  :)
---
Anyway, if you want to organize a group, go ahead, and then when you get everyone, ask who knows the dungeon and if they mind you giving them lead.  If nobody knows the way, no worries, just go slow, follow the tank, and hopefully someone will be able to tab out and read about fights if you have issues with them.

LPT: If you don't know your way to the dungeon, wait outside the mountain until someone in your party comes along, and follow them.
---
Agreed. I'd aim for +15 or so defense just to put you at the same "level" as bosses and then stack stamina, agi, and armor. They'll get +15 almost incidentally through items with bonus armor they should be collecting.
---
Go play an alt for a week, it'll calm down. At least enough to get into BRM without a rez timer. Probably.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
WTS Feet pics for loot
---
don't try with these people man 
---
they just wanna be mad
---
Go look at patch notes before 1.12
---
Nerfed everything
---
And replying "lol ok bud" just shows how little you know about anything youre talking about, go delete more stupid shit youve said
---
This isnt rushed, its about time, what dumb is not releasing battlegrounds.
---
Well stop paying them money. There are real hardware/software limitations that prevent a lag free multiplayer experience with 100s of people. That’s why games either don’t try it or they start lagging and rubber banding like crazy.
---
Reroll.  Leveling time from 0-44 is the same as 44-60. You should switch now.
---
The council decided to give it to me. Feels good man
---
Buddy it is totally okay. Happens alllll the time on Reddit. Don't let this ruin your friday! See you on the battlefield!
---
Definitely not. You can 100% play a hunter with bad reflexes. Try and pull from max range, have your pet attack for a bit first and go Beast Mastery spec and your pet should hold all of the aggro. May be a few instances where you pull but if you're at max range you should have probably \~5 seconds to react with concussive shot.
---
My guild gank squad of 10-20 people ended up using guerilla tactics where we leave the zone after 20-30min to avoid the large counterattacks. We encountered large numbers of Horde players landing in Felwood and WPL after spending longer than 30mins ganking. Most of these groups are a mix of guilds too so they were probably organized vis general chat. Very few non-guildies Allys joined our group despite advertising in general.
---
Leaving out the awesome dolly zoom :(
---
[His personal YouTube channel ](https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr) has a lot of vlogs, though he uploads extremely infrequently. You can just see how different he is. He’s much more genuine, and it’s quite jarring how he normal he seems when not playing up to an audience.
---
Nope. An add-on that does this would be against tos.
---
except it's not really nochanges when the realm sizes are 5-10 times the size of vanilla servers, thats the problem... not PvP being active
---
No. You don't understand. They're holding a gun to his head and his family hostage.
---
He *has* to go.
---
It's part of the horde war campaign. I don't recall which quest exactly. But you have to dive deep into the ocean and recover the body, bring it back to the ship deck, etc.
---
[pillow talk](https://youtu.be/NWWeQlXfSa0) it's pretty early in the song
---
I've said this for years and people always shit on me. "No, he's a fucking shit irl too, you can't play this!"
---
It's pretty obvious he is good at what he does, and that Asmon is a character on Twitch and nowhere else.
---
Yer dum.
---
I've heard that it is, but I haven't seen firsthand.
---
This deserves more upvotes. Great post and very well done (information, explanations, and formatting).
---
I think I’ll just start linking this post to people who ask about all of this. It’s crazy to me how many people don’t understand it but are actively spreading misinformation.
---
I hate him because anytime I search for anything on YouTube I get his horribly punchable face to show up everything and sometimes pollute my recommended videos.
---
I agree. From watching his video clips in response to being removed from METHOD he doesn't seem to care at all. Like he knows he is a jerk for ninjaing the item and it was wrong but he thinks he is somehow the gift to mankind in WoW and hes not. I think sadly, he has some suppressed mental issues that he needs to deal with first. Maybe some sort of prescribed medication would help him.
---
Was this screenshot taken in 2005?
---
Best way to learn is by playing a hunter :)
---
Is it a fap quest?
---
https://youtu.be/CguuBHC38bs
---
we spent a few hours doing over 40 v 40 pvp battles on our PvE server yesterday... up until the horde's spirit was broken because their guys kept getting caught out, and they left. 
---
PvP doesn't only happen on PvP realms OP.
---
You should sac immediately against warriors as this prevents them from generating rage when attacking you.
---
Mitigation doesn’t matter if there’s no damage to mitigate.
---
Damn you really hate the guy.
---
The same minute they realize they don’t have a blatant numbers advantage they are calling in backup
---
So killing the same person 5 times in a BG= no honor for 24 hours?
---
&gt; but in that scene jack sparrow has just jumped off a ledge to get away from people
---
No, he had just switched boats and jammed the steering wheel of the boat he left them with.
---
More opportunity to wait for mobs to respawn or more opportunity to get ganked maybe...
---
Until the servers actually die, stop telling people they made the wrong choice. If the server dies, you're right in saying they won't do a server merge. It'd be hell for names/guilds/etc. But they'll open transfers again, and I'll take it if my server dies. Just like how I transferred from a queue server to medpop.
---
\#mediumpopforlife
---
If youre on kurinaxx as horde I can show you how to do them. The runs are super helpful from 51-60. But a great place to farm gold by yourself at 60.
---
U mad?
---
Use dominoes no issues with it
---
Where are these Ally deathsquads that could potentially make it safe to quest again.   
---
Please. 
---
I'm a hunter. Questing is all I've got for leveling in a world of AoE dungeon grind world of mages and warlocks.
---
This is trash compared to orginal vanilla wpvp. There are just straight up too many people per server for this to be even close to how it was in vanilla
---
Also have a huge target on your back. Pure rogue bait.
---
No. No re-rolling, no more 100 deaths characters ever.
---
His streams are better if you close the chat.
---
Hahaha, I get it!!
---
&gt;.&gt;
---
Ah okey :)
---
You chose to play on an ultra high population server
---
I mean he was dead serious. He even tried quoting the dark knight in his shit talking rant and failed miserably. Do you think it was a joke or he was trolling?
---
Meh I just rerolled on pvp server from pve and all my deaths so far were from 10+ higher level players griefing lower players. I just added them to my list and will make most of them quit once I get geared :) all the deaths were pre honor.
---
I don't think that source is correct.  If you look at the 1.12 patch from vanilla it says 10% per kill.
---
This post is breaking the rules. It’s encouraging people to post names to witch hunt
---
I mean he might be playing a character too, either at they're both benefiting from twitch's obsession with obnoxious personalities.
---
Did you play vanilla at all?
---
There were 100v100 battles in Southshore all day, everyday for hours .
---
Literally every single day this happens. Sorry you are new.
---
Even his persona isn't really that bad, to be honest. I've leveled in classic and I've met far worse assholes, ninjalooters etc than Asmon is even on stream.
---
Then why would you waste your time writing a paragraph to slam the dude?
---
And how could you feel comfortable making such a declarative statement as this, without questioning your perspective, if you haven’t:
---
&gt;he chooses to be an obnoxious shit on stream
---
I watched him specifically because of all the bad hype. I realized that Asmon now, on stream, is absolutely not the guy people claim he his.
---
It’s like people see a highlight reel of his most obnoxious moments, and think that’s how he acts 24/7. The guy streams like 8+ hours a day, those moments are few and far between. 99% of the time he’s basically just a reasonable dude having fun.
---
Yeah, I think I will just up and quit for the next month or so.  Just not worth playing as a healer right now.
---
To get tank gear you'll either have to tank the raid or start it yourself essentially. Outside of that, chances are you'll only get tank gear that the tanks already have.
---
Someone definitely said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Are you talking about improved enrage? It's kind of a filler talent, there isn't really anything better to put the point into and it's nice to get instant rage off enrage. You could put it into improved mark if you prefer.
---
He should name it Turdmallet like a normal person.
---
Granted.
---
Sorry sir, did not notice your creative license.
---
Nothing to see here! Move along!
---
I experience zero lag on a full server that isn't faerlina. Sounds like people made their bed and now they get to sleep in it.
---
fail mage
---
Where's my father's watch?
---
They had ridiculed him for stealing the boat. Then they took over the boat to realize he stole the other boat. Then they realized he had jammed the steering on the boat they were now on. Then they said the line, after he had ensured his escape.
---
He's also admitted on stream that he really isn't that good at the game and that people primarily watch him as a personality streamer and not gaming streamer.
---
Did I say you need to give it to them? No. I said that giving your tank gear before your other classes increases your raids DPS. Since we're talking about Onslaught in general, they gave their first onslaught to alk because of what I said up there.  Perd absolutely can and will increase your raids overall DPS compared to just the rogue itw ould have gone to.
---
Same as above, would love a route to follow.
---
what's going on now, is just like all the server queues at launch. It will fade in a week or two. Honor hasn't even been a thing for 24hrs. This isn't Armageddon. 
---
options you have: reroll, do dungeons, make an alt or find a hidden-out of the way corner to grind in.
---
Who says PVE is pointless?!
---
Literally played for 15 years. Never once seen a grey mobs loot since you can't even loot it. But good troll.
---
There were more than 100v100 at tarren mill/South Shore in the first week of honor in vanilla. The lag was even worse than what people experience now. I was 16 at the time and remember is so vividly
---
Rerol on a more balanced server and you will get to 60 there before u get to 50 here
---
you probably don't use command much in the reckoning build. It can only proc once on a reckoning attack regardless of the number of attacks iirc, but righteousness will trigger for all of the attacks.
---
Also, for pvp consecration can be useful for things like breaking rogues/druids out of stealth.
---
I’d have a scrap.
---
Un'Goro was pretty peaceful, as was Azshara.  I managed to bang out a level and a half and only got ganked by a 60 2 times and I finished all but 2 or 3 of the quests in both zones combined.  
---
I am also on a heavily populated PvP server (grobbulus).
---
RFK is not a confusing layout, but I can understand someone not wanting to tank a dungeon like, for example, WC, Uldaman or LBRS if they don't know the paths to take.
---
Adapt and overcome. Were outnumbered 4 to 1 on Skeram and I'm still having a blast. When we get too overrun we port out to IF and fly to a new zone. Sometimes we have to fly to a lowbie zone and run into another zone to avoid the fp campers. Also we port back anytime capital cities need reinforcements.
---
Ganking a class with track humanoid and a pet. -200iq shit.
---
Lfm dps arena and anger runs (HoJ and SGC reserved) oh so you want us to run you for gear lol...
---
As a tank on skeram horde... I still get these messages every day lol
---
but it's 25% reduction each time according to the [official announcement](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23221132/wow-classic-world-bosses-and-pvp-honor-system-available), meaning 200, 150, 100, 50 = 500 honor 
---
Still pretty good.
---
Thinking about making this exact transfer... what’s the faction balance like? Or does it not feel like it matters?
---
I see this all the time.
---
This would lead to all sorts of dirty tactics like sending waves of naked level 1 gnomes against PvP raid groups
---
Why was there a humor tag on this?
---
So be a mage?
---
Not for inter-object communication where all objects have to be updated with the state of all other ones.
---
To be fair, I don't think that's quite what he means. You are specced that way specifically to fight in that manner. A hybrid spec that gisten mentioned likely means one that serves two completely tangential purposes, like solo PvE and raiding.
---
For instance, my Holy Priest Spec includes Searing Fire and Spirit Tap so that solo PvE grinding isn't an absolute slog, but those talents are absolutely worthless in my raid environments.
---
Send in your pet first, make sure he knows and auto-casts Growl, and count to 3. You'll be good for most mobs with just that. 
---
If you want to be extra safe, once you get freezing trap or slowing trap, drop one at your feet before you pull and repeat the previously mentioned process.
---
And bring Coffer Keys!
---
&gt; the most 60iq logic
---
It's not logic, it's called design principle.  You change one thing as big as this and then it's set's precedent that they can change anything.  They said it was a recreation and that's what we got.
---
That was me and my guildies last night. Kind of felt bad for the lv50s horde who were riding on the road in Felwood and then suddenly got melted by an Ally deathball. They couldn't even run away since most of us had epic mounts.
---
I'm glad I finished questing in Felwood before things heated up, but now I'll have to find an even quieter hour to farm the satyrs.
---
Dual wield specialization will be better than 1% crit
---
Yeah real humble post..... 
---
PHD student who takes pictures of their laptop with a camera and level 15 which takes a few hours tops. This post is such bs, can't believe its being upvoted.
---
didn't see you on last night but I added you. I'm usually online on evenings/night PST.
---
Sorry it's for the 19 bracket. What did you find the benefits to be?
---
TIL: I'm already in phase 4.
---
thats why you get your mom to make the nuggies
---
The sad reality is a large percentage of players are babies who would rather quit and cry then actually work with what they are given. Were out numbered 4 to 1 on Skeram but this is the most fun I've had in a while.
---
That is a rp server? I dont think I could relate. But it does sound odd.
---
I get whispers to run dungeons WHILE I'm running dungeons, happened in strat/lbrs. Come one guys shift click!
---
It’s probably because the people who are now in control of deciding “Game of the Year” grew up (more or less) on World of Warcraft, in all its stages.
---
DO IT. 
---
Also, That would be a significant upgrade. I'm just guessing but I'd say at least 5% increasw
---
Part of it that there is high demand and no demand for tanks. What I mean is you need 1 tank for 5 mans but then you only need 2-3 tanks for 40 mans, some exceptions. It's also the de facto leader of the group.
---
No because dishonorable kills do nothing if you have 0 Rank Points. DKs are subtracted right away from your Rank Points. Until tuesday everyone is at 0, so an immediate loss to your rank points do nothing.
---
The hard cap on glancing blow damage reduction occurs at 308 weapon skill. That’s effectively the limit for useful gains from weapon skill.
---
Nope get all the DKs you want this week. You have RP too loose the first week.
---
Whitemane too, but was only getting 1-3 honor per kill and it was very laggy. Going elsewhere with 3 40 mans got us 7-14 honor per kill with less lag.
---
They added it because it would lag and/or crash the entire continent when it was active. It was a worse situation than what we're seeing in Classic.
---
The elementals are who drop the patterns (greater nature prot and living breastplate), as well as herbs and living essence. I'll clear the blue oozes when blade flurry is up and I can kill adds faster. The Vile Slimes don't split on death and share a spawn with the rotting behemoths, who can also drop greater nature prot. Now that P2 is here, you can pick people off if they poke their head in checking the Rich Thorium Veins spawns.
---
You can only go up so much per week, i think i saw a spreadsheet here somewhere that Said you had to be THE#1 on honor grinded EVERY WEEK for 12 weeks straight to get the quickest possible rank 14.
---
Just Google it for more accuracy.
---
Which warriors even pop Retaliation? Maybe I give my enemies too much credit but I assume they’ll just not attack me. Shield wall seems a lot better.
---
While very small the horde community is pretty nice there. It's mostly Alliance. Not a whole lot of RP horde side. Join one of the raiding guilds on there that are kinda well known (Mutiny, House of the Rising Sun, Exodus).
---
Imagine lacking basic reading comp skills and still talking shit about other people's iq. Actual mong, fucking hell.
---
What do you consider to be "really bad"? He ninjas and have done loads of crap during his streams over the years. But nothing I'd consider to be so bad that I'd never ever watch a minute of him again.
---
lmao yesterday some mage ganked me while I was low health from killing mobs and then he DCed so I waited for him to come back online while shadowmelded/ pet stealthed and then camped the shit out of him
---
Each rank requires a specific amount of rank points(RP). Rank 14 requires you to have 60k RP. There is a 5k difference between each rank. (Except for rank 1-3 where rank 1 is 15hks, rank 2 is 2k RP, and rank 3 is 5k RP).
---
The maximum RP you can gain each week is 13k. In order to do this, you must be in the top bracket on your server’s faction from getting the highest amount of honor. I believe it is the top 0.2% (someone correct me if my % is off). There are 14 brackets. Lower brackets give lower RP.
---
Due to the RP gain cap, the highest rank that a player can achieve after the first week, is rank 4. Rank 5 requires 15k RP which is higher than the maximum you can earn. Rank 4 is 10k RP. There is no decay in the first week because you have 0 RP.
---
The fastest a player can reach rank 14, will be 12 weeks iirc. There is a 20% decay on your current RP every week and 13k RP is the maximum you can earn each week. Progress becomes very slow at the higher ranks for this reason.
---
Slightly better survivability and immunity to slows were quite nice.  The trade off of not being able to deal much damage though just didnt seem worth it to me.  I didnt hate it, I liked being a unique class that not many people twinked but it definitely wasnt the best.
---
Good point. I almost never use /say so I assumed and made an ass out of me
---
Well yes but actually no. 
---
You need weapon skill to reduce the damage reduction on your glancing blows against level 63s. 
---
The hit chance from weapon skill is negligible.
---
Something I cant remember from back then, does this discount stack with the reputation discount? Given that you need honored rep for the 10% discount, does this stack to 20%? Say I want to wait until I'm rank 3 to buy my mount. In currently honored with my race making my mount cost go down to 900g, if I wait until rank 3 will it be 800g?
---
It wasn't grey though, should try reading comprehension classes before posting.
---
Isn't the correct formula:
---
normalized_damage = base_weapon_damage + (X * Attack Power / 14)
---
Gladius = 11 + (2.4 x 797 / 14) = 147.62
---
I am not defendig Blizzard. We all knew, what the deal was, when we bought the game. I myself don't mind the lag. If you don't like the deal you are getting, don't pay for it. It is that simple. 
---
You just need to realise, that not the servers, but the code is the problem. Just read all the other 100'000 posts about this "problem".
---
Anyone have a guide to Lvl 19 twinks in Classic? Most of them tell me to get PvP trinkets, which none of us have yet.
---
You didn't answer the question
---
From what I've read, yes. All gear with a lifesteal proc scale 1 to 1 with spellpower. Other forms of magical procs do not. 
---
Currently leveling a spelladin but havent reached the levels to get said gear, so like I said, it's only what I have read.
---
Yes and he averages the most views in Twitch WoW, what does that tell you. He is playing the right persona.
---
Yeah, I mean I'm not making it seem like the same person said it. Are you okay, do you have brain damage?
---
Baffling to see groups placing left, and right limits on what is allowable loot when they are clearly in a lurch. Folks - if you need help: ask for help. Don't operate in a philosophy like this.
---
"Classic is gonna be dead 2 weeks after launch"
---
That's my point.
---
I’ve just got too many points.  I give gold to the underdogs.
---
Lol, this guy is fucked in the brain after that world first.
---
He was so humble at first.
---
Yes lmfao
---
Actually I had the same issue, I leveled so many alts my mate who got me into the game was quite fed up with me by the end of it. He suggested I level a paladin healer in the end as his guild was desperate for another one and I think I got to about 42 before I burnt out then went and leveled other classes.
---
There are some safe, effective spots you can grind in. For example if Azuregos is down on your server, large parts of azshara are completely empty. Depending on your class it can be very efficient too. Silithus is a good bet too.
---
Hmm, I was thinking more than that tbh.
---
Olympus has fallen.
---
I believe BGs are an exception to this.
---
You're right which means they had the tag. Sorry you can't comprehend his post. Good talk though.
---
I wish i could do definitive math on that. I'll prolly just take your word on it.
---
Marshall’s refuge was an absolute shit show on Rattlegore last night. I need to loop back around to azshara, I completely forget about that place. I’m bummed because EPL and Winterspring are two of my absolute favorite areas in the game, but this phase ruined both of them for the time being.
---
It's EXACTLY what you're asking for, faction based queues
---
What? Dude, I'm mocking the guy above because he read your comment and somehow got "asmon is salty" from it. Chill.
---
Hence why I said removing faction restrictions and offering faction changes.
---
Just wait until those rogues start finding you as you level. Enjoy warlock :P
---
Woosh
---
Its true, the reality is that far more girls play this game than people assume.
---
So how would you like him to play? Grind the levels in STV? Go grind gold in Hearthglen?
---
Face the facts, he is the biggest streamer on twitch at the moment and he wouldn't be able to move one inch in the normal world w/o 15 body guards. He'd have horde on him that is just corpse camping spirit ressers, his ress point, the neutral cities, everywhere. He can't play the game properly because people would just camp him.
---
agree
---
Yes RP server, but horde side doesn't have a whole lot of RP
---
Yeah but they would have to spend money. So no there is no fix unfortunately..
---
Oh no! Now I'll have to stand here hopelessly dazed... :O
---
Because 90% of guides you find online are made by people that only have an average understanding of the class.
---
My memory is a bit hazy, but I think it's possible to go from 0 to rank 4 in one week, maybe rank 5?  Maybe that won't be as likely because everyone is starting from the same rank.
---
Gz aftershock !
---
What's better?
---
I believe that is correct, pets do not get rested XP. It would just be too weird of an interaction with multiple pets juggling around boosting them with rested XP, and then losing the ability to level pets twice as fast once you hit 60. It'd just be a mess with people abusing it in weird ass ways IMO.
---
Just spend some time grinding and you should be fine, your pet only need 1/4 of a bar to level. I'm also guessing you are pretty low level, because you need a huge amount of XP from quests to start actually outleveling your pet that you just don't get at higher levels. Keep playing and it'll even out fine.
---
You still have to send updates to all objects because every other player has to know every other player's location, debuffs, and whether they're currently casting a spell. It doesn't matter whether those two players are attacking each other or not.
---
Yikes, one of these kids
---
What nameplates are those?
---
I bet there's gunna be *way* less people interested in that now though. Will be interesting to see how it goes
---
yeah just delete your character and you can make a horde one. you can't do paid faction changes though.
---
Stop being fucking weird dude. It's just...fucking weird.
---
That's fine, I think it would be cool if it forced the flag on at 60
---
I think I’m in OP’s screenshot, and in that battle I got &gt;800 hk’s in about 2 hours lol! It was so much fun!
---
The 13 AP will be more valuable early on, .3% crit will be better later
---
Possibly yes, likely no.
---
Flight master's aren't civilians. They're mostly low lv quest givers.
---
I'm a fan of 8 piece on a Shaman, but realistically only a few Shaman will get 8 pieces of tier unless you have ungodly luck. If you have more than 3-4 Shaman you need to give some of them off-set pieces or they will be wearing blues for a long time.
---
That said, the clashing of several raids worth of Horde and Alliance last night was pretty fun. The 2min Rez timer was not as fun, but hey.
---
Time to respect disc heavy or just tweak your build to have a bit more survivability haha. Everything's going to be ok /pat I feel your pain friend. It's hard out here for a heal bot. It's a tough job but someone's gotta do it lol
---
I don't think it's an addon, I think it's just a glow effect you can turn off.  There's a command that does it.
---
Dead game
---
My time is infinitely more valuable than yours, because you can be replaced at the drop of a hat. 
---
I love it when groups literally boot morons like you when you  say no to 2 orb reserve for me, even though you've been sitting in the dungeon spamming lf tank for 30 min. We then replace you in 2 min flat  and i send you a /w saying "next time know your place".
---
I hope you're at least holy with that lofty attitude of yours.
---
Same thing happened to us last night. Glad to know we're not alone. I made a post about it last night. It was super whack. He casted 22 "core rats" in 2 minutes
---
I know and I’m just pointing out that I’m proud it didn’t lag on mine cause apparently it has been for others
---
We brought a Boomkin to raid MC once. It had absolutely no negative effect on the raid...
---
Cuz, its MC. Shit, we could bring 10 Boomkins and still clear it easily.
---
Correct, they do stack, 10% honored plus 10% rank 3 making 20% off 1000G, so 800G
---
From my experience my guildie healers usually use 60-80 water for a full MC clear. Chain pulling trash mobs means they have to drink whenever there's downtime, even more so after they've just buffed people up and we are already starting to pull the next pack.
---
Oh damn
---
You can't receive *crushing blows* when shield block is active.  You need 440 defense to be crit-immune.
---
In what way? Go watch his videos on his second channel he speaks very well and lays out his thoughts better than most the people on this sub who jump at every chance to hate him
---
Doesn't matter. 92 healing.
---
As in a pug group? Sure theres usually pug groups going on. Its usually better when its hosted by a guild youre usually able to get further in my experience. But even normal pug groups you should be fine.
---
Spots?  It's not like your mining for ore ;) 
---
Just find out where large groups of alliance and horde are gathering on your server and join a raid.   SS and BRM are the two likely candidates.    Expect to get 1-5 honor per kill as honor is spread across your group/raid.    
---
I've found it's better honor to just form a small group and track down solos/other small groups.
---
Not really no.
---
Shall I carry on about the state of the video game industry, from the perspective of ... the actual software industry?  :)
---
I was there and I was also in your group :D signed, your dead Druid friend . Lmao.

&gt;And without that powerful hardware they'd be waiting on that software of theirs to complete for a long time. When viewed from the perspective of your average end user, neither the software nor the hardware is of any concern, as long as the thing does what it's supposed to the instant the user desires it. Whether it's achieving that via software or black magic is of no concern.
---
&gt;You can't just remove hardware from the equation because the end user is shortsighted.
---
Of course the infrastructure matters but good infrastructure is the kind that's never acknowledged or needed to be troubled with because ultimately most people don't care. Unless something breaks. 
---
People will(and should) get far more upset about a change to the code base that affects their experience than a change to the infrastructure it's running on.
---
How tf do you have 1000 kills. It’s been a day
---
Horde on westfall. Hillsbrand wpvp was great yesterday no lag and tons of fun
---
As a Moonglow resto Druid in addition to healing everything I also tank everything outside of MC/Onyxia. I only run dungeons for OS gear at this point as I cannot upgrade MS gear outside of MC. I make it clear before the run starts that I’m running for X gear though, in general though I pass if a guildie needs for MS.
---
Leatrix Plus has an option to disable death effects.
---
Eh, my TBC guild was about 30-40% female in vanilla.
---
GW2 can do it 450 players in a 3 way battle and lag is usually quite minimal except for when 2-3 large zergs of 120+ players meet, and even then it's nothing like the slideshow in WoW.
---
Obviously, anything over 2-300 players lags in any game. But we should be able to easily do 80 v 80 or so. Pls blizz.
---
You don’t. I meant people will be camping farm spots until battlegrounds are released. Those people will then be in battlegrounds instead of killing people in the world.
---
Yeah this is confusing me. Before this blue post I’ve always thought it to be the 10%. Afaik it has always been 10%. 
---
It was working like this on the private server that I got rank 14 on (obviously take this with a grain of salt as it may not have been authentic).
---
This is also the source I’ve been using and it it details the 10% as you originally explained in your post. 
---

---
Keep healing, brother.
---
Parry, wingclip snare chance, stamina, deterrence, FD resisting, and counterattack.
---
Lastly sure-footed for 3% hit in pve.
---
&gt; exceptions being AQ and Naxx
---
AQ40 specifically, I recall AQ20 as being super easy.
---
&gt;they might eventually be cleared by pugs.
---
I'm sure they will be. That said, pugs still wipe regularly to fights like Onyxia and Baron Geddon. Getting the appropriate group comp to handle things like The Four Horsemen, or enough pugs with NR for Huhuran will be a significant roadblock.
---
BATTLEGROUNDS.
---
WPVP: I was excited for world pvp because I remember it from vanilla, but it was absolutely boring. It was either 100 vs 100 and no skill involved (basically if you lagged behind you died) OR its a completely one sided engagement and zergballing across the zones.
---
BG's: BGs are balanced teams (for the most part) with set rez timers (you don't have basically sit and watch because you died in quick succession QQ for those of us who did not roll a rogue) and there are objectives, which adds a goal to PvP. Dying can actually mean something (like if you make the horde chase you so that your team mate can ninja the flag).  There's strategy. There's defense. Even 2 people can turn the tide of a battle. Hell, even 1 person can turn the tide in WSG. (druid flag carrier) 
---
Arenas: Arenas was always a dice roll. There were certain classes that are just better against other classes. (I did mainly 2v2) If that night we got duos we could beat, we could go 10-0 and it wasn't usually skill, but just class combo. This was the same in 3v3 (I think dominant team was RMP right?) 5v5 was definitely more balanced, but we couldn't consistently field the same 5 man team every week. (That's not really an issue about Arenas, thats just our own IRL situations).
---
Duels: I hate duels. Mainly because for most of Vanilla I was a holy priest, and I can't heal you to death.  Also, my rogue BF made me duel him ALL THE TIME so he could practice full stunlocking. So maybe I don't have the best experiences with duels.
---
You can. 
---
Source: am wolf riding Tauren
---
Yeah. I agree. I watched the clip where he admitting ninjaing the item was wrong but wouldn't admit he was in the wrong for doing it. He basically said he didn't need method and people follow him because he is the first level 60. Since when is that something amazing? I mean, cool yeah but other then that?
---
Please no lmao
---
Ah true, I just meant it's still possible to pvp as a small roaming group as long as you're smart about it. I tried to avoid the huge zergfest but not always possible.
---
If anyone thinks that ANYTHING is unique to one faction you're nothing but a d*** that things you're better than everyone else
---
Asmon mythic raids?
---
I went an upvoted a page of your comments. You do great work.
---
My guild must have had insane luck then. 9 of our 10 mages had it drop in one of their first LBRS runs, some even before they hit 60 (me included)
---
But I play on a RP realm, people like dungeons more than farming here.
---
It’s a lot of preference I believe. Humanoid slaying, Dragon Slaying, savage strikes, entrap/wing clip (your preference), hp talent, deterrence, clever traps. Kind of preference really for a lot of the surv talents I believe. Just switched to this myself for raiding, DM:T runs, and to assist in world pvp. 
---
I have 3/3 human, 2/3 Dragon, 2/2 Savage, 5/5 Entrap, 1/1 Deterrence, 2/2 Clever Trap, 3/3 Surefooted, 2/2 FD (for DM:T). Depending on hit you could drop surefooted and put those in BM tree on Imp Hawk
---
I don't know who this person is and have never watched his stream, but the quote "if streaming was so easy, why doesn't everyone do it?" ...
---
It's not that simple. No matter how good of a streamer you are, it takes a considerable amount of luck and timing in order to become successful. There's a reason why we see people like Jokerd with a ton of viewers, and it's not because they're good streamers.
---
Normal raids and M+0 dungeons are mechanically more demanding than the highest level of PvE content currently in Classic. Classic is a much better game in a lot of other ways, but we need to call a spade a spade on how complex the actual gameplay is.
---
*laughs in Frost Mage*
---
I know of at least one node location in orange side. I think they may be throughout the dungeon. Not sure how viable solo'ing the mobs/bosses is as a warrior, you may be able to make it work. You should also be able to run by most of the mobs.  
---
I know of one way to reset which requires you to have a buddy. You do something along the lines of inviting a buddy to the party, giving them party leader, logging out, they reset the instance, then you log back in. It places you inside the dungeon with the dungeon reset. Not sure if I got the process quite right, I've only done it once and didn't quite understand it. It would be faster than dying and corpse running.
---
Given that blizzard hasnt released any info on the population of servers per faction its just a guess on what the faction balance actually looks like when you pick a server.  
---
Now  that classic has been out a while there are numbers on it across the board its 52% horde to 48% alliance on pvp servers. But a lot of servers have a balance closer to 40-60 in one way or the other. I dont see how its players being at fault since blizzard dont show these statistics.
---
IDK about your LFG chats, but ours is utter aids... Like barrens chat level aids.
---
just in case anyone was wondering. The chance of missing a 23% chance 20 times in a row is 0.5%! Math Pog
---
I've played since release and played more then 1 hour straight under 5 times. Currently level 39. If something that's an upgrade for me I would roll even if it's better for the warlock or mage to use it.
---
Aoe farms aren't about dog, they're about controlling large packs of mobs. Locks can't do this. They're easily replaceable.
---
mediocre
---
Yep. People really like to tell people how to play a game they pay for but don't want other people to tell them how to play. So proud of this community xD
---
Agree to disagree, man I'm obviously not gunna dissuade you and you me.
---
Ahh the Horde special.
---
So, the hit cap at 300 weapon skill to not miss your yellow attacks is 9%. Dual wield or two handed.
---
At 305 it is 6%
---
Report to Blizz
---
You make it sound like a bad thing
---
I'm not normally one for the "BLIZZ BAD" train, but anyone who tries to defend Blizzard on this is a chimp.
---
This is a complete tangent, but at this point MS had effectively rewritten Minecraft from scratch. It actually has a very large team continually working on it. It's years past being something a racist loner wrote in his mom's basement.
---
Dont tell the people above but theres a reason I made a druid and a frost mage. The duality of life can be very overwhelming.
---
I call it the alliance suplex but ok
---
In vanilla I made my alt a lock because it is a fun class that easily farms. This time around I'm going for a mage for the sheer DPS numbers.
---
RIDE NOW! FOR RUIN AND THE WORLDS ENDING!
---
[Truly is a mystery](http://i.imgur.com/GHXh5Ou.png)
---
It's imaginary dude. Azeroth isn't real. There is no war. Fucking retard
---
It was not cleansable
---
Can confirm it's true. Happened to my raid last night
---
Yeah, but a DDOS would affect all realms coming out of Chicago or California, not just Herod or Faerlina. 
---
Any why do they only have DDOS attacks on big launch days lol?
---
I’m call BS on this DDOS excuse.  Their servers were overloaded.
---
Same! I maged in vanilla, am tanking now &amp; I base my decision not tanking with reserves off of what I knew in classic. People asking for things seemed unfair, like loudmouths got what they wanted, gold beggers in Stormwind, but the quiet, polite people who shut up and did the grind/dungeon got the shaft. I’d never ask for a reserve &amp; I’d never parcel one out!
---
I mean yeah, but I think it’d have been neat to have to decide if you want that smaller quick fix now, or forgo any upgrade for a bigger one later when you’ve saved up a few points
---
I expected to hit 60 during phase 1, but due to complications out side of the game that didn't happen. Also getting corpse camped by 10 bis geared level 60's will piss anyone off while they level, like seriously?
---
God this guy just looks like a big douche
---
Also add in this is vanilla and we have "causes extra threat" on abilities that no reads the tooltips for
---
It works on earthshaker
---
You can't get counter attack without 21 in survival and I am assuming he wants TSA for pve.
---
Users don't scale linearly in the burden on connection and servers, sounds like you're  getting in on the big sweet spot :)
---
Getting 3 minor upgrades vs getting the best swords in the game. It is a bad thing.
---
It just provides a much more authentic experience and thoug don't feel like the game is just coddling you.  In PvE encounters everything is already scripted in the code, there's no surprises,  literally a program could be written to just play the game for you since there's nothing dynamic about it.  Adding in PvP means all of a sudden things aren't so predictable,  there are surprises and twists and turns that could change your entire gaming session.  I would suggest that anyone who is getting bored with wow try a pvp server for a whole new experience where everything isn't just running through the same bits of code again.
---
We just are hardcore roleplayers that's all. Not hard to understand lol
---
And the developers weren’t idiots, they were overly amazing professional developers that did a lot of the pserver community.
---
PT Sans Narrow
---
Ironically in Wc3 when allying to fight vs the Burning Legion, Tyrande/Malfurion, Jaina and Thrall understood each other in perfect [Common] (English).
---
Unfortunately I only got around 250 HK's as I was only there for about an hour, but the battle was going on for a few hours, and I am sure there is going to be a lot more this weekend.
---
Tag reset. I mean the next group shouldn't be able to see loot (plus they got the gold but not the items, so 100% bugged) unless they got it.
---
No, not til phase 5,iirc
---
I think you want 2/31/18, which is the traditional surefoot PvE raid spec that is also pretty damn good in PvP.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/2-05251030513051-33202004103
---
You get hawkeye and scatter shot for PvP in marksmen, which are absolute staples. You get a little bit of parry and the extra crits on melee to help with people getting on your face, plus the 3/3 in human slaying. Suvivalist and deterrence are both great for PvP as well, and surefoot gives you the +hit for getting hit capped in PvE while also giving you the 15% resist chance on movement imparing, which is basically a PvP requirement.
---
There's nothing great for the last 2 points in survival, so 2% chance of a haste boost is usually the go-to.
---
I didn't expect blizzard to pop phase 2 so early
---
Everything. Everything is wrong with them lol
---
Without lightning mastery and elemental fury you’re quite worthless for damage output.
---
Money trumps morality! Fuck yea I love capitalism.
---
I expect we will get at least wsg as a midway update like they did with Dire Maul.  I would love to see AV too, but am not hedging my bets.
---
Dude we all play wow.  Don't act like you're some chad.
---
Chance for you to not see the ring is 77%. 
---
Having 20 runs (if that is actually what you ran, and not an exageration) will give you a 0.77\^(20) chance of not seeing it, which would be 0.5%.
---
So you are just the lucky person out of (an average) 200 who do not see it at all in 20 runs. Considering the amount of people playing this game, I'm not surprised. 
---
I'm more interested in the person that see it drop 20 times in a row, which would be a 1 in 58 billion (9 zeroes) chance, but I guess they don't make posts on Reddit when they do.
---
I knew a hunter turned successful game dev who always considered the inability to mana drain shifted druids while they regen mana in forms to be terrible design.
---
Not sure when but battlegrounds will be released before BWL.
---
Paladins can tank too, very well in dungeons even, but they have a negative stereotype attached to doing anything other than heals so people also dont play them tank.
---
Most underrated comment of all time.
---
&gt;If you don't go with a group as a Warrior to let's say UBRS because a Mage item is on reserve, so it therefore takes longer for you to find another group and kill Drakk and get the Draconian Defender, you have made an irrational decision.
---
Lmao, exactly this. This guy's only point is that he can 'make' the group wait longer for a tank because he won't join groups with any reserved items. He of course completely leaves out the fact that it works both ways, and in many cases is literally only hurting himself for a stupid 'moral' stance.
---
Left click to replace your right trinket, right click to replace your right trinket =) 
---
You can also queue a trinket to swap after combat - if you click a trinket while in combat, it will automatically equip as soon as you leave combat.
---
Joining a regular guild as DPS means you will never have priority on tank gear.
---
Right click on the item :)
---
Wow that never happens to me lol, I always get hit by collateral damage
---
Coz
---
He never releases immediately after a death the same way models strike a pose at the end of the runway.  And yes, I'm comparing him to a model because he is beautiful (insert obligatory "I dont watch asmongold statement here)
---
I used this route for P1 because it was *significantly* safer, but I'd wager it's become much worse now. That said, I'd still recommend it over searing gorge.
---
I'd also recommend having invis pots, and jumping down from directly overtop the MC NPC rather than the lava ramp, if you can manage it.
---
You are a monster.
---
Yes that is surprising. But I think in vanilla very few guilds were clearing BWL at that time anyways. 
---
90% of guilds couldn’t get past Vael. Forget what patch he was finally nerfed in.
---
I'm thinking of respeccing my priest to holy/disc. I essentially have no use for shadow anymore since questing is out of the question.
---
You're right but you'll get downvoted for "defending Blizzard." It seems the only argument people want to hear on this sub is "They have billions of dollars so they should FIX IT! A billion dollars can fix ANYTHING!!"
---
Laughs in Paladin. 
---
Bubble... accept quest. Die.
---
I'll guess I'll be the devils advocate. You can't tell someone what to be mad at , if they are already mad at something. You make it sound like anger needs to be justified.
---
And many things you said have already been spewed plenty of times between reddit and the official forums. Your post pretty much is just a collab of it all, with some of your own opinions thrown in. 
---
Telling someone that being mad at A is wrong and they should be mad at B is almost egotistical. That's like someone stubbing their toe and getting mad and you saying "dude, you should be mad for how much you spent on that coffee table, this would all be preventable".   I know people like being heard, and they feel they have the solutions to these *problems* but in reality they aren't problems. The game is meant to be this way. Blizzard may tweak some things or they may not. It is what it is. Just play the game.
---
Two questions about Perl unit frames: how do I set a focus target? /focus doesn't work
---
What's the easiest way to highlight my own debuffs on a raid target? There used to be an option to make my debuffs bigger but I don't see it there now
---
I'm also open to suggestions on other unit frames but I don't want to spend a lot of time setting it up. I tried ElvUI but that's just too much, man
---
Phase 2 has finally given me the chance to experience the life of a named quest NPC
---
From what I understand, Grid had way less features and was more based around the idea that you would install plugins to add the specific stuff you need.
---
Grid2 instead does most of that stuff out of the box so it's trickier to setup but also just more usable.
---
As a result it seems like Grid1 kinda got abandoned and Grid2 took over as the main.
---
The worst is when I’m fishing and I get ganked, doesn’t help being on a server that feels like 10/1 outnumbered
---
I mean where does this information come from? Is it from beta, pserver, or vanilla? Because blizzard could easily change how it works subtly by persay making an honor deduction in the current week.
---
Im not saying you are wrong im just asking if there's proof of how this works in CLASSIC.
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills...
---
Drop rates in WoW dont just randomly change. Wtf
---
[mmhmm](https://i.imgur.com/5CrTE0w.png)
---
Unless they're ele though, then they'll just crit you to high fuck
---
I dunno, I think it's more about the new generation of gamers. All the old people that I used to play, and still play with hardly ever bother to reserve shit, we invite competition for gear we want. We just enjoy playing.
---
Arena/anger/golem runs have something for everyone. HoJ and SGC for melee, Ban'thok and Omnicast for casters, Second wind for healers.
---
Fish naked, if you're a female character they might be too busy ogling the pixelboobs to kill you.
---
But me big-large numbers, yes-yes
---
So, is your head up your ass for the warmth or what? I have multiple monitors. I can watch streams while I play WoW. But apparently you don’t have the mental capacity to do both, which isn’t surprising after perusing your profile. Have a nice day.
---
&gt; unless nobody else is nearby and you also think the target isn't going to run away, I wouldn't bother.
---
I'm on one of those horde-favored servers, so virtually every fight I'm in turns into a 1v5 anyway
---
A question for anyone that uses healbot, is there a way to remove the arrows over each persons frame/ name showing their detection if they are out of range. I feel like I’ve looked through all the settings and can’t find it.
---
Daaaaaang. See if there's any window settings affecting this? This should not be happening. Maybe even the game itself too. I'm sorry this is happening to you
---
People still act differently when there's a camera on them. Might be closer but probably not anywhere close.
---
Terrible idea. If you don't want world pvp roll on a per server.
---
I hope your CS professors fail you. This post is so incredibly wrong I sure hope you are still in Intro CS.
---
"I'm a good pvper yes I am."
---
Imagine reaching this hard to find a way to personally victimize yourself about server lag. The mental gymnastics are fucking astounding.
---
Anyone know when diminishing returns for killing someone is reset? Does it happen for everyone at a certain point at server time, or does it reset 24 hours after your FIRST kill of that target?
---
So figure a place out and lets have a dialogue about it.
---
The mana issues don't bother me too much. I've just learned to always drink.
---
As far as Pvp gear, I'm just using 5pc from t1 cause its got heavy base stats with a few +Spell Damage pieces. 
---
Raiding Gear, I can't figure out if the reduction in +Healing is worth the mana I'd be able to sustain with 5pc
---
Then quit.
---
I've taken to grinding deadwind pass as nowhere else is safe. I'm level 53, and it's really difficult.
---
Sorry some of us can't play longer than 1-2 hours a day.
---
well I'll specify that most times it is tame, but there are a few trolls on the server that take world chat to LFG chat and troll the place to high hell. Tons of shit talking and politics.
---
Yeah but apparantly Statholme is hard content.
---
You just do not have an understanding of the definitions of the words you are using. You are confounding the two ideas of "irrational" and "wrong (morally)". Simple as that. You also don't seem to like the fact that I have shown your principle is based on emotions and morals. Which is weird cause people do this all the time, SO DO I, IT'S OK!
---
"I don't like it" "seems unfair" "wrong" these are opinion-based thoughts. They are based on your on POV and subjective reasoning. 
---
Rationale/Irrational is based on logic, which is most broadly associated with the idea of utility. Getting +10 Str in 1 hour vs. 2 hour is an objective concept, the 1 hour is rationally/logically better for a player.
---
This isn't an argument and I'm not an arbitrator, I just understand the terms I am using and you do not. 
---
Here's a link that expands on what I'm talking about: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory
---
Bear is not even his real name, just what he calls himself. Legendary, not infamous. Everyone loves Bear.
---
Whats that addon for unit frames?
---
What kind of shitty logic is that?  You absolutely can grief people on a PvP server.
---
It's probably just a coincidence and not the case, but was the post you saw mine a few months ago? 
---

&gt; Wish they could get rid of it without removing other addons.
---
They could. Just block add-ons from reading combat log entries of actions of other player-controlled characters unless it impacts/damages/targets someone in your party/raid group.
---
Never played WoW before until Classic. I fucking love it. It’s my first MMORPG experience and I feel like I’m really getting a solid feel for that genre through Classic. 
---
I tried retail because one of my buddies wanted me to try both. I hit lv50 on a Pandaren Monk. My friend and I leveled in the Pandaren starter zone then did a few BFA (I think) quests then moved to dungeon finder. I leveled up so quick - but I don’t remember a damn thing that happened. Like the questing felt childish almost. It was way too easy. We didn’t have to look for help or postpone quests for later levels. I feel like everything was just spoon fed. Dungeon finder was cool, but it felt like I was just entering a lobby with random people. It wasn’t as personal as finding a group in trade chat and heading over to the dungeon entrance. It just got kind of boring after a while. Not to mention, we’d be at BFD at one point and then Deadmines the next. The world just didn’t feel connected - if that makes sense.
---
I’m very happy with my Classic experience so far. I’m only a level 44 Fury Warrior, but the journey to get to this point has been AMAZING. I’ve met so many people and have found a great community in my guild. I’ve had a few dungeon groups that were fucking hilarious to play with and made the days I spent in SM way more memorable (sneaking into SM the first time as like a level 31 warrior was fucking awesome too). I didn’t have the money for my mount at 40 - but friends loaned me like 50g. Recently , I leveled my Alchemy to 300 and I feel like something has clicked on the AH for me and I can actually make decent gold now through my profession and carefully selecting what to vendor and what to auction. The economy feels way more meaningful in Classic so far. Having 50+ gold at level  40 feels awesome. I feel rich! In retail I just bought a wow token and I made like 200,000 gold right off the rip. I don’t even know the value of that. 
---
So far, Classic = MMORPG. Retail = Diablo-esque RPG, instant gratification type game.
---
I’ll try more retail in the future, I’m just having so much fun leveling to 60 with my IRL friends in classic.
---
Foreshadowing of the future. Time to jump ship.
---
How long did it take you? I’m getting a lotttt or down time with resists. Super unlucky streaks where I only get 4 mobs before a resist. Thinking about going sub for a week and just pounding it out
---
Personnel
---
I didn't have PvP in mind at all when i linked that build. I'm curious what makes you say it's a hybrid build. If you're talking about Imp Sprint, well those two points were just filler to get to the fourth row of talents. 
---
The build I linked is almost exactly the same build recommended by wowhead, and they claim it has the potential to be the strongest Rogue raiding spec in later phases of Classic with appropriate gear. The only difference between theirs and mine is they took 1 point in dual wield apec whereas I put that point in dagger spec.
---
Shit, they had an expansion recently, maybe this is the answer.
---
Almost nothing.
---
You could get a macro for turning into bear and bashing (if you have 5/5 in Furor).  
---
Vs rogue you need to survive his opening burst damage in bear, then bash, cast roots, run away, spam Moonfire/Wrath/Heals.  
---
Use travel and cat form to keep distance, refresh roots and kill him from distance.
---
oh that explains it. I didn't realize that brokentooth was 1.0. I thought he was also 1.2. But 1.2 is still unique right? Most pets don't attack that fast so even The Rake is pretty unique and viable until brokentooth?
---
(x) Doubt
---
They obviously never completed the quest for defensive stance.
---
&gt;That's not really true. You can almost always throw money (ie hardware) at software problems, but it may take a lot of money to make an appreciable difference, and that strategy won't necessarily work forever.
---
So, to summarize, you can't just throw hardware at problems.
---
Yeah everyone who ain't 60 yet acts like whoever is 60 had it easy. Like you could willy nilly go wherever you want and no one would bother you. Victim bias is a thing in Classic.
---
Ok but if you're playing a character of a complete scumbag then it doesn't excuse you for being a complete scumbag.
---
That's how I was able to get to BRD in less than 10 deaths lol. Stay off the road in Steppes. Don't go to Searing Gorge.
---
:( are u ok
---
[deleted]
---
&gt;Why do you view it as punished?
---
... Seriously?
---
You think literally not being able to play is not being punished?
---
Yeah...not enough backlash when they say it.
---
"All class gear reserved." Is another line I see.
---
A fist should come out of the monitor and beat people who type it.
---
He did for a very long time, until like ToS I believe
---
dummy
---
You might be right. However even on 100% one faction server you will still be able to pvp in 3 bgs. And I have no idea what would I do after naxx has been out for half year. Probably I woul just play retail or TBC. You do not have to play a single game forever. 2 years of fun are alreadly a lot.
---
Agreed especially with the number of people involved in this fight yesterday. Computer would've esploded
---
Far from a superiority complex, more like just years of playing WoW and classes that can only dps just like to mash buttons to see if they get a high parse. Maybe it's confirmation bias but most DPS are idiots when it comes to WoW classic. They've grown too accustom to how every tank class has mass aoe threat on retail. Sorry I hit a nerve since you seem to fall into one of those categories, but maybe you are one of the ones that try to help out the tank?
---
Kromkrush represent! -Kukukachoo
---
if you are going to pug, why not try to find a guild and just raid with them?
---
Haha those two flight points are particularly bad. I'm a 52 priest and I'm thinking of respeccing to holy/disc to accept that questing in the world is no longer an option so I have no use for shadow anymore.
---
There’s an add on (maxzoom I believe?) that lets you zoom out a bunch
---
We don't cooperate with terrorists sorry.
---
😂😂😂
---
It's a reference to the South Park episode about WoW...He's comparing Asmon to that no-life player in it.
---
If you understand the meaning of the sentence, the language was conveyed.
---
Fuck youre grammar, and the apostrophe too. :-P
---
Correct, I'm Dazen. Was in that group!
---
Well, in spanish he says: "que el fuego te purifique"
---
Won't these massive wPvP battles gain you more Honor points than a mere 10v10 match like WSG though? Will it solve the problems for the levelers?
---
Imagine shilling for a multi-billion dollar company this hard.
---
Some silly logic here.
---
4 days, two of the days I was in brd for 5-6hrs. Just put my head down before pvp came out.
---
Ewww
---
^ This is the Classic community in a nutshell
---
He ran in alone and instantly died haha
---
Anyone with a learned Lionheart Helm recipe.
---
Sounds like if you didnt want to be punished for being on the overpopulated faction you shouldn't have gone to the side with a PVP handicap because you're a try hard casual.
---
You made your decision, you get to deal with the consequences both good and bad.
---
Thats what i was thinking.
---
&gt; for multiple weeks. Not sure on the exact number of weeks, that's probably findable with a Google.
---
IIRC it's 14 weeks of top 0.3%  
---
And 5 of them is just to go from 13 to 14 :)
---
All fun and games until you get stun locked by a 5 man group of rogues. I take pride in knowing I caused 600 damage doing nothing before dying thanks to lightning shield. Now to hopefully rez in the right spot that I can mount and, if I'm lucky, get away. 
---
If only I had rags hammer. Then at least I could try for a 1 in 5 chance to 1 shot one of them before dying anyways.
---
Pretty sure defense reduces chance to be hit with a crushing blow, and increases parry/dodge as well.
---
If you're worth honor, you got a target on your back atm. It's just how it is, especially with no BGs.
---
And if you’re a male character...?
---
I run my own business and work 50-60 hours, 6 days a week - and got to 60 in less than a month.
---
Get thunderfury and pray.
---
Funny how some people think doing something in a game that requires nothing other than no-lifing your spare time is an actual accomplishment and something to be proud of, using it to try and flex on others and act as though you're superior in every way.
---
Pretty interesting mentality to have for that kind of low-life, loser-compensating technique.
---
Yeah he’s very good. Dude is a showsman!
---
No, crushing blows and crits are very similar things and I just named it crits so the guy knows what I'm talking about. "crits" = big fucking damage.
---
Less people to share kills with = more honor
---
I think you mean alliance
---
The community at large is the arbitrator of what's reasonable.  A tank rolling for cloth gear? Unreasonable.
---
how do you not kill rag before first submerge lolol
---
Blizzard hasn't said that.
---
Will do that now!
---
Rude &amp; pretentious, don’t need simple concepts defined like I’m a child. 
---
To topic, your opinion is just that. We have the right not to tank for reserves &amp; your lil opinion is no better!
---
Based on the description, it appears to be 24 hours from the first time you killed the person.  But I cannot confirm 100% - I'm only drawing a conclusion based on the wording.
---
The confusion arises from the addition of *your* in the sentence.
---
You intended "your posts" to mean "the posts from both of you", but it can also be read as "the multiple posts from you".
---
English is a fun language.
---
Words of wisdom. If people don't watch, he loses all relevance.
---
I think he means grief someone on the opposite faction
---
Is there something that you can link to show this? I’m not saying it’s not true, but my memory from vanilla back in the days is different.
---
That’s what you get when you don’t want horizontal scaling. On one hand you hate layers and phasing, but on the other hand you want lag free environments. 
---
Guess what. There is a limit of how much you can scale a single machine. You can go from 4gb, 32, 256, 1024gb ram. But what then? You can go from 2, 4, 16 core CPU’s but then what?
---
As an engineer it’s so frustrating to see these discussions.
---
I just want to say, I play Horde and honestly I've been sticking to Hillsbrad because other PVP just seems like its gonna drive people away.

I read you gave as an example not drawing a Spade from a deck of cards for 25x. Consider putting the card back each time after you've drawn it and reshuffling will give you the same chance of drawing a Spade (25%). Draw a card 20 times (with reshuffling each time) and record the amount of times you will draw a Spade. You'll probably have drawn some spades. Will it be 5 times a Spade exactly? Probably not. Could you have drawn 20x a Spade? Sure. Could you not have drawn 20x a Spade? Also sure. 
---
Drops in WoW work exactly like this, because it is a chance. That's how I know.
---
Yep, the 2019 gaming gen that still think *kills* matter. Cant wait for all the tears when it resets.
---
Grid is what I’ve used for years, unfortunately it hasn’t been working for me, healbot was my back up which also didn’t work. I probably downloaded the wrong version. So I just use the in game raid frames. I suggest either healbot or grid though.
---
I fell off a griffon after a huge server spike. I didnt even know that was possible
---
I think if it flagged you in open world areas that would be cool, or if there were more designated arenas that forced the unflag. Then you could just go there if you want to pvp.
---
But like, camping with your buddies in front of a dungeon so nobody else can have fun? I'm sorry, that's just rude. I don't think less of people that disagree, but I can't bring myself to farm people at a significant disadvantage in any way. For people that like it, I'm glad that you're having fun! But I don't want to experience dying at the entrance to a dungeon or a raid. I just don't.
---
Like gank squads in duskwood? Really? You're just removing the danger aspects of pvp.
---
Nothing weird in our run last night, we even did our fastest clear
---
People always say this will be solved by BGs when people stop world pvp, but there's always the outdoor raid bosses. Sigh.
---
ragnaros and spanish have a special connection from retail
---
40vs40 is very, very ineffective in terms of honour. Honour kills themself doesn't really matter at all, its the honour you get from them that matters. Say you raid pvp in hillsbrad and get 2k hk's (each giving you 1-5 honour, probably less since you're bound to kill the same people over and over, giving less honour over time).
---
You'll end up with perhaps around 5-6k honour, while if you were in a WSG group you'd get the same honour with a mere 150-250 hk's, not including the honour bonus for winning the battleground.
---
Yeah apparently more controversial than the EA post...
---
What a toxic little entitled shit lmao. Talk about small man syndrome, it couldn't be more appropriate coming from a dwarf ;)
---
Pretty even, I’d say a slight advantage to Alliance. 55/45 at the most but could be closer. Horde are always out fighting so there are no problems finding battles.
---
New to the game doesn't mean bad player first of all.. and secondly, if you don't even try to make friends, are you suprised you don't have any?
---
I don't know what level you currently are, but there is always people chatting somewhere.. start joining in  chatting in a zone channel or one of the world channels. Try being more social in your current guild, or find one that's more of a social guild (not sure if you are in a specific type of guild or not)
---
The game is only as social as you want it to be!
---
I blame all the warriors who refuse to tank and only want to dps.
---
As a 59 Mage in Winterspring, same happened to me. I’m just going to be fishing in the Rachet for awhile
---
Yikes. This guy *doesnt* fuck.
---
Yep - on Stalagg - the Alliance got smart and end the party when Horde push into Southshore. 
---
Actually one good thing about being on a horribly imbalanced server is we get to control how much honor the Horde get.
---
Ahahaha Kukukachoo thats my boy! Fancy meeting you here! -zuggo
---
My main is a Druid not a warrior
---
TY. SOMEONE FINALLY FUCKING SAID IT.
---
Hey I just switched servers as well and am only 34 atm lol. What is your nameplate addon??
---
I take that as you playing in a guild with lolrets BoFing themselves?
---
What's a Paladin? Is that some kind of healer?
---
Bgs
---
#Hordegang but I’m gonna assume he’s somewhere in  org. Thanks for the feedback though
---
But he asked a broad question, about enemies even 4-5 levels below. You are still wrong. The hit cap vs enemies 4-5 levels below is not 5%. 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%
---
I expect that we'll get BG's earlier than the rest of phase 3.
---
The honor system without BG's is wasted on everyone on pve realms and realistically especially given faction imbalance issues wpvp isn't going to keep pvp realms happy for long either.
---
Get your guild using consumables and learning to play their class. Even the melee having to run in and out should be managing well above 300 dps. Ranged should be going balls to the wall since you can't pull aggro.
---
This is by far the least skillful and most mindless PVP that has ever existed. It is further compounded by the servers inability to handle the amount of players involved.
---
Good riddance, now if they could just pump out these phases even faster so we can get to TBC arenas &lt;33
---
tl;dr: faction balance just means it sucks for everyone.
---
Every time I see someone apologizing for correcting someone it makes me sad, it’s okay to be wrong, people shouldn’t feel attacked when being corrected. But at the same time I wish people wouldn’t correct others out of spite, or in an attempt to make that person look stupid (not that this is the case here); I just wish people had more grace I guess hahaha.
---
You still have to run it, not like they just appear in your inventory at 52. Second wind is 9% drop and Ban'thok is 40% but off a boss that's only there 1/6 of the time. That means on average they're going to take 11–15 runs. Angerforge also has some nice healing pants at a 3% drop so healers may well want to run it even more.
---
Shadowcraft shoulders. 6pc edges out the commonly regurgitated BIS set.
---
"LFM MC PUG : gold will be on ML and divided up based on performance at end of raid" 
---
I actually saw this in general chat, Herod : Alliance and it was not a joke
---
Yup. As a Rogue you really get into the role. I love my Mage for PvP and I do well with him but now that phase 2 is out there is a calling...
---
The comment wasnt made pre-DM.
---
Are you not using free action potions?
---
I mean as my server says "this is the least blizzlike server we will ever play on"
---
That's when you peace out and let them deal with lying to you. Gotta have more self respect. Also see UBRS and my Devout Shoulders.
---
Form a group of low levels and storm areas forcing high levels to run away. I could see them adding a MUCH less punishing system for this though but DKs are far far too punishing to put on low level players.
---
This is assuming steady crits and excluding back to back crits, ignoring that soc hits right after a melee and I am sure there are a lot of other mistakes I can't think of
---
Nope!
---
Phase 2 basically dropped at 2.5 months after launch.  Early February is 2.5 months away.  This might be a good guess as to when phase 3 drops, but if we get an early WSG and/or AV as OP is predicting, this seems very late.
---
Dire Maul was released basically 1.5 months into phase 1.  By that logic, I would expect at least one BG by the start of January.
---
no. "Today" is pretty arbitrarily defined. at least, I have no idea what the rollover time is supposed to be. just wait, it will update when it feels like it
---
Decay is capped at 2500 a week tho
---
Free Hong Kong
---
It's literally a blue post from Blizzard, how is it incorrect?
---
Plus one for Kromcrush! I thought everyone was having an experience as balanced as us until I started reading the new threads 😂
---
Well surely his massive surge in viewership has *something* to do with it...
---
You just get one advertising email from a company for a product you have no interest in. Is that not spam?
---
Spam is defined by the sender, not the receiver. You are spamming people because you are going down a list sending messages to everybody in X demographic. That's the definition of spam my guy.
---
christ look at this guys history lol
---
Innervate should go to the healer who is healing the most / most effectively balanced with the necessity for the innervate. I tend to innervate myself because I’m usually much higher than the 2nd highest, THOUGH, it’s uncommon that I actually need the extra mana at this point, so innervating a worse / less efficient healer could actually be better. It’s very situational.
---
It really isn't a problem though, if someone takes reserving to far they just fail to form a full group.
---
Fuck reserving truefaith for a priest. It is a BOE pattern, the same as arch mage and void.
---
I have been levelling alchemy with Free Action Potions right now, they are selling pretty nicely, although it involves a lot of fishing to be really profitable.
---
I have the same question at 200 alchemy, what is best (meaning, turning a profit) levelling on around that?
---
Random question. If you track humanoids and the rogue is stealthed, do you still see him on your map?
---
Yep!
---
Wait,  is this real? Link and stuff for lols
---
Poor guy got sent straight to retail...
---
I think this might be part of your problem.   Normal guilds are more team oriented.  Streamer guilds are streamer oriented.
---
It's not anti streamer, its anti elitist fuckbag which thinks he can fuck over whoever's he wants and get away with it.
---
It's a PvP server. Suffer the consequences.
---
Hard disagree. Had a few great Strats with Paladin Tanks.
---
I am a rogue lvl 35, sword specced. In my mainhand I use a blue mace, offhand a green sword. I love the slow mace with its high crits but I ask myself if I should switch it to a faster green sword with lower base damage but ok dps.
---
What? I havent experienced lag in 100v100. The slideshows are happening w way larger numbers than that. The Classic servers hold WAYY more people than the vanilla servers.
---
it has always been this way and its not going to get better anytime soon
---
Believe me I know quite a bit about IT ;)
---
Just compare the amount of RAM, Cores etc modern servers have with Xeons which were state of the art in 2005.
---
So they must have messed up something with there server software, or probably the cloud solution they moved on isn't as performant as bare bone was...
---
And yes sure they won't be able to do provide a quick solution but they had how many years time?
---
There is simply no point in defending Blizzard here.
---
Video gave me a seizure. You sure rekt the prot paladin and holy priest you decided to clip in there. Needs more skill plays, not just plays.
---
The only way it’s possible to over-grind is if you’re already the #1 standing player for the week
---
&gt;for hunters they are the exact same thing?
---
Except for your occasional melee attacks, this is correct.
---
Is healing the nameplates the best paradigm for you? The alternative is to use unit frames [thusly](https://imgur.com/5hWEDxg) and an addon like Clique to create mouseover commands.
---
#**RULE 7 POLICE**
---
Can't wait for his attempt at scarab lord. All these announcements of which you knew they wouldn't "work out that well" xD
---
Search the subreddit for 'jokerd'
---
Nothing against PvP.
---
What I don’t like is 10Pv1P
---
Yeah cause dps never take damage. They're immune to everything, right?
---
I never thought about that before, but you're right.
---
I don't think it sounds like that at all. We don't even know what level he is. You can't just join a guild and expect them to coddle you. You gotta make your presence known, be the person to offer when other people need help, put yourself out there. Especially on a mega server like OP is on, you gotta stand out somehow.
---
Oh ok, no comments of approval?
---
&gt; but **most** of you don't seem to actually be enjoying it the way it is now
---
That right there. The assumption that you lost me at.
---
My guild will in about 2 weeks make specc requirements for healers weaker so they can heal while DPS specced. For one because by then we will have the gear necessary to put out a good amount of healing. And for the other because by then our DPS will be so much stronger we should not go OOM in these short fights.
---
Gotta FAP harder bro
---
We ain't brothers
---
Other way around bud. Come to Whitemane and view the several 30+ min lfg's with first orb to tank.
---
Honestly they should retroactively tag items to class specific and do away with the master loot system and put in a secondary  hard check to see if you have that item already or not and it just either prompts you with a need greed roll or it doesnt, period.
---
Dal Rend Swords : Tagged for : Rogue / Warrior / Hunter : if they already own this item even if not equipped or in bags, it wont even pop up for them to roll on it, if you are a mage, lock, priest, pally, druid, it also will not even appear to be rolled on, only the rogues warriors and hunters who have never possessed that item will it appear for, clearly you all roll need.
---
Hit the enter key and type messages to people and get to know them. Hop in discord with people. If you need tips on social interaction look up the YouTube channel charisma on command.
---
Rogues are not shunned away because they are rogues. I’m a tank and two of my good friends I met in game are rogues. If you want to learn how to play better, look up guides and ask other rogues on your server. You gotta be persistent and not give up man
---
What is the name of the enemy frame?
---
I'm on the "winning" side and I agree, it's not really fun watching 100 of my allies now down 15 dudes and then camp them to death.
---
My first few kills felt glorious and now I feel like I'm punching children and calling it "a fair fight."
---
Like, there is no challenge. They might as well be NPC murlocs due to their lack of numbers. I pvped a few times before P2 and a ton yesterday and its just...  I dunno, not that fun.
---
I'd be happy to fight a 40v40 battle. But this 150 vs 40 crap isnt really enjoyable, fun, challenging, or rewarding.
---
I'm probably gonna start raid logging and play Halo when it launches, or go back to some other shooter or something with a little bit of balance, challenge, and actual competition not just me running around with a huge handicap.
---
It's like playing a game with cheat modes on. It can be fun for a while but "Godmode" starts to get boring.
---
Vanilla pvp is:
---
\- Who can gather more players
---
\- Who can pop more consumables
---
Idk why this is some shock to you
---
Is every odd numbered comment in this line getting gold?
---
Yes, exactly, complete and utter dogshit and non existent in any form.
---
Well, yeah. That's the only time it matters. Nothing else is going to be hitting you hard enough for a crit to matter. Bosses are pretty much the only ones classified as lvl 63+
---
I bet she cheats on him
---
Leveling a lock, 34. Have a staff but could switch to dagger and offhand. I'd get more int, but trade some sprit for stamina. Also have another offhand that just gives me a flat +10 to Shadow damage, but I'd have less int and sprit. Thoughts?
---
I'm really wondering if you play on Faerlina because it's *super* duper obvious that it's not horde-favored.
---
I'm not talking about "the vast majority of PvP servers," I'm talking about Faerlina.
---
I swear it's always Alliance getting owned.
---
If sword spec'd, you should really be rocking dual swords.  You're coming into the levels where you can get good quest rewards, so do those chains.
---
Tanking is pretty complex, and limited to only a couple of classes (3 on alliance).  That makes the demand generally high, and the demand for a good tank *extremely* high.
---
I seriously think the fears over WPvP are overblown.
---
Yes, people will be camping flight masters, cities, quest hubs, etc, more than they were in prior weeks.  You know what they aren't doing?  Farming gold, materials, BiS, alts, guildies, etc.
---
People essentially took a holiday to pvp yesterday.  And it will probably continue through the weekend.  However, this will not be the status quo going forward.  The playerbase simply can't support it.  Camping cities and hubs when no one is willing to engage with you is extremely boring.  Yes, you get kills from the unaware but people won't willingly throw themselves into a fight they have 0 chance of winning over and over again.
---
Over the next few days, most people will stop camping and go back to their old patterns.  Quitting for a month to avoid pvp on a pvp server is just silly.
---
Funny. This reminds me of several weeks ago. We were waiting at the entrance to ST and a group member who was still running to the dungeon said there was a group of about 10 ally running into ST. Eventually a group member says “I think we should get off the road.” Moments later we see the group of ally and he yells “GET OFF THE ROAD.” Was hilarious with perfect timing.
---
Right except this is a video game not the 1300's lol
---
100% agreed, its fun to dream though :)
---
Sounds like you're lying to yourself.
---
Yea it really sucks that people want to play a specific way that is different from you and maximizes time played vs effort /s
---
Nothing stopping you from forming your own dungeon runs and doing what you want. And if you can't find a guild of people willing to run dungeons, then you have more problems then nostalgia goggles
---
They failed the vibe check
---
Had a skull troll priest walk past my level 25 humie. I waved and we continued walking, then an undead mage one shotted me. The priest did /cry until I soulstoned when the mage ran past, then the priest MC'D me and gave me max buffs.
---
Good vibes
---
Yeah, I'm giving the GL an ultimatum tonight in front of the guild. I either get the first set or I quit. 
---
And if I quit, they are going to be out of the only tank with full fire resist set.
---
Is it really that much of a stretch to imagine that a developer mentioned this could be a problem and someone else higher in the hierarchy told him it would be fine? Doesn't feel that far fetched to me. Shit like this happens everywhere really, not just in game development.
---
For pve raiding it's basically just ambush/backstab until 4cp then evis, cb evis at 5cp if threat allows. Also vanish + ambush mid encounter.
---
Expose armor is just for pvp, used as first finisher against plate and bears.
---
TROPPO PRESTO EXECUTUS

\[removed\]
---
It's not that I'm crazy interested in PvP, I just feel like I can't survive a 1v1 if I want to go out herbing or just a random scrap here and there. I plan on talking to them regardless. Thanks
---
Any link as to that comment on spiritual healing?
---
I would still think even if it is base healing only... I would still think it would be more beneficial for when you have to use a max rank as opposed to more mana. 
---
You can augment your mana pool with pots, runes, and flasks. Raw healing is harder to come by.
---
The logic is the same.  Numbers are a big advantage.
---
If you're lucky and have your succubus out you might get some dots off, otherwise you're not getting much space at all without a dagger in your back (will of the forsaken)
---
&gt;for those nights that DPS are somehow in short supply.
---
You mean never?
---
^single ^arrow ^loose
---
Undead suck
---
It was never this bad because the servers would literally crash before getting to this point, but by all means feel free to keep applying that rose tint to yer spectacles my boy.
---
They definitely had it easier. Like it's not even comparable.
---
you can't.
---
This whole conversation is hard to follow.
---
Metabo is either messaging the Pally from a pre-conversation that isn't shown, or he is confused and thinks the Pally is tanking.  Either way, Metabo should be put on ignore.
---
What server is this?  I recognize that guild from Kirtonos... I'm sure there are multiple guilds with that name though.
---
Yeah, the TM/SS mass combat is good because going anywhere else risks you spending a bunch of time running around trying to find people.
---
Can you give more details? Are you Horde or Alliance? Are you questing or grinding? What's your class? Which zones did you finish and which didn't you? Are you using Questie addon?
---
That's a good point to bring up, I plan on talking to our GL soon about it.
---
What level is the average person?
---
Wallowing in your own ignorance and then labeling others as "simpletons" isn't the approach I would normally suggest. On the other hand this is Reddit.
---
Expecting people to not be fucking trash is just too high a bar to clear I guess, but you do you.
---
Nah I made the switch as soon as I got shadow foot shanker at 52. I'd do it as soon as possible to get decent with the spec and have a priority on a good dagger (gutgore is pretty easy to get) from MC over the sword rogues.
---
You will pvp just fine and get plenty of kills.
---
No judgement if it was your main haha...better off staying in Mulgore for a while!
---
Gave up on HealBot for Grid2. Very happy with the change.
---
Yeah, I've tried that! It's hard though now since it's 1 layer on gehennas and pvp feast is everywhere.. and I might have incredible back luck, I've gotten like 1 crystal from over 50+ nodes :(
---
There's no ego trip. Why don't you try rolling a tank and leading every group. See if you don't want to reserve something on your 20th run of the same dungeon with new random people.
---
Dude's asking if you want to be part of a team and kill some shit in a game you're both playing. He's not trying to convince you that you'll become Chris Hemsworth if you buy the new Boss perfume for fuck's sake.
---
Just say no. And if you're so offended by the whispers then take the preventive steps to not see them anymore. A lot of people don't want to wait over an hour for someone to raise their hand and volunteer to round up the group. People like to assemble the group and start clearing the dungeon asap especialy since it takes over an hour for most dungeons to complete.
---
Disagree. Improved eviscerate &gt; murder in MC. When most of your damage comes from 15 second cleave fights, and with AR and thistle tea, you can get 2 or sometimes 3 5 cp eviscerates which do a huge chunk of your DPS.
---
Come BWL+ murder is better
---
What are the good discords for Classic WoW? Some for recruitment, some for dungeon farming, ...etc.
---
I think the biggest mistake Blizzard made was underestimating how stubborn people would be. There was rampant sunk cost fallacy going around on the week of launch. It was pretty amazing to see how many groups of people would rather deal with 3+ hour queues for their level 16 character rather than re-roll on a new realm.
---
Some of that could have been alleviated by having more realms initially before launch, but my guess is that they thought people would be more willing to move to a new realm.
---
That record is about to change my friend
---
Whether it's competitive or not having the idea in my head that I could either randomly get killed or kill somebody is much more immersive for me than seeing someone who has been described as the enemy be completely unattackable
---
Congratulation? Everyone's responsibilities are different. You have a business, but maybe no family. Some people may have a family, but no business. Some people, both. Some, other hobbies. Everyone will spend differing amounts of time on different responsibilities. There is also the vast difference in how long it takes to level a character. Leveling a mage is very different than leveling a warrior, as mage can quickly AoE grind mobs.
---
Just because your business can be run while it's owner is playing WoW enough to get to level 60 in a month, doesn't make gatekeeping any less elitist and toxic.
---
Are you enjoying the pvp despite the lag, and if so, would you enjoy it more if the lag were gone?  Or are you on a server with a low enough pop that you're not experiencing the lag?
---
Dude get over it. Pvp server is for pvp. Doesnt make someone a cunt for trying to rank up. At least thos dude isnt joining the massive zerg parties that roam around.
---
At least the barrens and silverpine will be safe too #friendlyterritory
---
Just make your own group! Quit complaining!
---
I don't think 1% crit is ever better than 43 AP.
---
Yes the 10% on healing spells affects the base spell only, not your +heal.
---
&gt; Has nothing to do with punishing and more to do with maintaining a health playerbase that encourages both factions to play.
---
Call it whatever you like. But the fact remains that this *punishes* a large portion of horde playerbase who are now forced into a queue instead of being able to play the game.
---
Are DKs also affected by raid size? Or is one shared by 40 ppl as bad as solo killing civilians?
---
It can be a huge bonus for rogues but generally it’s just garbage. I can often kill someone in the middle of the crowd and I have enough time for stealth to finish cool down and combat to end before anyone can do damage to me. 
---
It’s really fun when you get to hit someone with an “omae wo shindeiru” as you sneak up behind someone, ambush + backstab, literally rp walk out of the crowd of enemies and just stealth again when it’s off cd and then by that time the damage procs from your ambush and backstab and the guy dies.
---
lol. I tell you what. Most people didn't play "vanilla". Most people started in "vanilla" in a later patch where BGs were already a thing.
---
As a rogue, for last night's large scale battles I was most effective on the sides taking care of flankers and stragglers that got too close.
---
I also only offer the run-through when I see someone using LFG for awhile trying to find a tank.  So if I didn't run them through, there's a good chance the dungeon run wasn't going to happen any time soon for them.
---
Is there a definitive combat sword spec for rogues? I feel like I've seen 2 or 3 versions posted.
---
Perfect for grinding boars all the way to 60
---
Then why would your experience from a medium pop server be peak vanilla numbers?
---
Oh no! Your condescension was answered with condescension! *Whatever will you do?!*
---
Again, the interpretation wasn't wrong -- you just wrote a sentence that is able to be parsed in different ways. Yay!
---
I totally agreed with faction queues and faction transfers. Blizz should have implemented something awhile ago though. I had an ally alt on rumored 8 horde to 1 ally server. Pretty the ally was transferring in droves.
---
Aww shit, son. Hopefully things will calm down in a few days and we‘ll all be able to get to 60. 🙏🏻
---
but i heard every time you're ganked you're supposed to kill a kitten? hmm
---
I’d kick you. 
---
Fire resist sets are easy to farm... and being the guild lead is more work.  Imo they should be prioritized for legendaries as they are less likely to leave.
---
I thought so too, but it does happen. Usually for less-popular runs, like BRD emperor
---
Good luck finding any meat on the bone.
---
I've been running BRD non stop trying to get the hand of justice trinket to drop. I've resorted to using royal-seal-of-eldrethalas. Is the HOJ that good? Is it really worth farming brd until i go crazy for this trinket, or is the royal seal good enough?
---
You can try to check if your server has a sub for itself or maybe a discord. That's probably one of the best ways to look for people. I haven't one that is catered for all realms.
---
&gt; Felheart is 80% raw stats, of all T1 sets it's the most PvP focused one out there, 5/8 felheart is PvP bis no matter the spec.
---
Yeah, I'm glad. Your PvP focused set will earn you 0 damage in the gankfest because until BGs are out there's no conventional PvP :D
---
It's still PvP don't get me wrong, but not the type I need a warlock when I'm buffed up, in the back, getting contribution on kills.
---
Not to mention you still lose in a 1v1 with 5/8 "bis" :+1:
---
Well, they didn't say which year, so...
---
That almost happened to me, 2 horde 23 Shammy and 23 Hunter see me, 29 pally with all Cooldowns,and I /Wave at them and bam they start attacking.  
---
Needless to say you do not try to take a Pally with full CDs...
---
Or, if you're in trade chat:
---
ANAL \[Banana\].
---
11/13% hit being your goal is going to shaft your DPS... your goal should simply be to get yellow cap and then equip the best gear possible. If 13% hit is a byproduct of that, so be it, but you should never prioritize getting more than yellow cap.
---
Its the only thing to do in classic wow untill P3 so its only going to get worste lol
---
I think I got to blood guard in Vanilla, and I didn't go out of my way to spend time PVP'ing.  Just for some fun with the guildies some nights.  The honor decay is easily negated by a few hours a week pvping.  Though, this was with BG's, and it was pretty easy to get a game if you chose the extra honor pvp of the week.  Don't know how it will work in a wPvP only world.
---
Either way, I can't imagine rank 9-10 being super difficult to obtain, if you actually work towards them.  I hear rank 11+ is the real grind.
---
If and when a solution is implemented, it will undoubtedly be Blizzard that addresses it, since we cannot.  But it will be the players who have to deal with whatever the aftermath is whether that's layering or extreme queues or forced transfers or just the status quo if they decide to leave things as they are.  Therefore, there is value in discussing which options the playerbase thinks are better or less painful anyway.
---
To be fair, everyone needs to stock up a million of those for PvP, just saying.
---
I started before launch day, and I remember when honor came out and I thank god BGs are not out yet to spoil the launch of honor
---
CANDLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
“OOooookay, okay duuude!”
---
Ah I always forget about undead, that definitely helps. My experience is getting deathcoiled into fear then aggroing two mobs with full dots on me and fear still lasts full duration.
---
Yeah, just a matter of time.
---
Although I mostly do instances and not world questing, so that minimizes the ganking.
---
I 2 box a tank/healer and pug virtually all my dungeons and in my experience you're generally wrong about DPS. Most of them are pretty good at following directions or not being too bad. As long as someone in the group is giving some sort of direction (Doesn't even have to be the tank, I've had groups where a DPS direct the group and it works perfectly fine). 
---
Yea you get some bad apples but the vast majority of dps in the groups I've run (And I've run hundreds) have been alright
---
Well sword rogues 100% get priority on viskags since warriors have the option to get deathbringer which is WAY better for a fury warrior. Only time I could see this arguement changing is if you are competing with human fury war who gets +swords as racial.
---
Actually there isn't. When I joined as the OT, I was let known by an officer of the guild that the Binding will go to the MT first. 100% okay with that. 2nd week with the guild, the MT doesn't show up, so I'm MT since I have fire resist set. Our MT never shows up again so I'm the MT. 3 weeks ago, our GL(who was a mage) power levels a warrior, spends 5k to get gear and "tanks" alongside me. Last week, binding drops and its rolled for instead of what I assumed would have been given to me. Also, there was no talk about the GL being the tank amongst the guild or even me. So it came out of no where.
---
Damn bro yea wtf are the odds I remember cuz I too played nost, never seen the push up idea anywhere else, small reddit world I guess lol
---
In vanilla raid size didn't matter, it was a static drop in rank progress on your rank. If you were gunning for the higher ranks you kinda didn't group up with randoms in world pvp since it was a big risk to take.
---
For context according to the UN it will cost about 30 bilion to end world hunger, so yeh.
---
You’re probably right
---
I'd love a mere 4-5 second of lag, I landed in tm clicked mount, ran on foot all way to South shore, cast 4 blizzards (well clicked them) suddenly mounted, got 2 kills and Mana disappeared.
---
Fair enough, and I guess my intention wasn't to say that you were full of shit. I guess I just wanted to make sure that people didn't think eve could handle 30k people in a fight, which is where my mind went when reading "tens of thousands".
---
I missed wwb, being a summer child of 2016, but the fights where both sides showed up, there were sub 10k. I remember there being around 6k in the x47 keepstar fight and there being talk of record numbers.
---
At the end of the day eve is pretty unique in that respect.
---
You can't read I guess.
---
As a tank this isn't my experience. Most DPS have been alright and don't blame me when wipes aren't my fault (And even when the wipes are my fault they usually don't say anything)
---
naw now its magetard till proven innocent imo.
---
i've played a 38 warrior, a 46 warrior, a 27 warrio and a 37 shaman (yes i keep being forced to reroll new servers, one of the free transfers was the worst choice in my wow career.)
---
I will 100% take nearly anything over a mage 99% of the time. they're my last choice for dps.
---
Well its not I have time to convonve anyone. If they are stupid enough to boost him while hating him they deserve him honestly.
---
And you've shown you could barely understand either. I'm not sure what your point is.
---
I dont get it. Didnt know being born in 80s made me a boomer.
---
If it's fearable, it's killable.
---
I became a warlock because I wanted the Infernal and Dreadlord.
---
Enslaving random mobs in dungeons is a lot of fun, too.
---
Definitely not disappointed.
---
Seeing asmon dead is very satisfying
---
You might want to find a different guild? 
---
I have only been in my guild for maybe 2-3 weeks (and it has a lot of people that have played with each other for years) but last night anyone that wanted to PVP was tossed a Raid invite regardless of who they were or even to some extent what level (we had some 54 or 55 level people rolling with us).  It's possible they were running only 5-man groups maybe to get better honor but even then you might just have politely asked where they were so you could join the group.
---
I also find it better to have a guild with discord as that would still allow people to be in 5-mans yet still communicating with other groups.
---
I don't know ... just sounds like maybe your guild has some pre-existing cliques or groups that aren't super welcoming from the way you tell the story.
---
not on Grobbulus.
---
&gt; Yes PVE is an option but PVP CAN be fun once you've hit 60 
---
You're gonna cry the same.
---
Good doggo!
---
Dang you got 5 AC in a morning? I feel like this was the dice rolling god getting back at you.
---
Truth hurts? That's unfortunate. But you're welcome. You can be a better person next time!
---
2 pvp related questions. Lvl 24 orc rogue.
---
1) is combat maces any good for pvp? The RNG nature of it is a bit of a turn off, but another chance to stun is attractive. Should I dw maces or run a dagger offhand?
---
2) is it worth it to switch to crippling on my off hand for pvp? Or should I still be instant on both?
---
It has nothing to do with crushing blows at all. And yes it does increase dodge and parry, but it’s a very small amount (.04 per point if memory serves) compared to other pieces that offer just straight dodge/parry. 
---
You shouldn’t avoid defense by any means, but it’s generally overrated
---
Kirtonos is right, and no he knew I wasn’t taking, no prior conversation. He just really wanted to let me know that I wasn’t worth his time.
---
SEARINGPAINSEARINGPAINSEARINGPAIN okay good fear spam
---
Check if your focus frames are enabled. /focus should work.
---
Check the target options for buffs and debuffs. The option you seek is there.
---
I'm about 90% I've seen HoJ drop from both of them in phase 1
---
isn't your rank increase capped tho?
---
I understand you always get some benefit but if I'm semi-casual and 200000 honor week 1 still only gets me to rank 3 i might at well settle for rank 2 at 10000 honor
---
Or maybe the Rogue is passing over the chance to be welcomed.
---
Did jokered actually say this?
---
Pretty much yeah. I FD when horde point/wave at me and they always kek at me.
---
fun times
---
You never beat a warlock, you just tie a warlock.
---
The dots usually kill you ;)
---
Yeah sorry I missed that part of it. And I wouldn’t say I’m portraying his name in a negative light. Just a screen cap of chat, any light portrayed on him is one he lit himself
---
Twinks are gay dudes
---
Welll there’s pretty much two phases of world pvp. 
---
1. The Walls. Huge aoe battles with mages and locks forming a “wall” at max range to prevent enemies from crossing. 
---
2. The charge/dives. Eventually there will be a hole in the walls where your melee can run through, or your faction will set up a large flank maneuver, or a shirt on of people will say fuck it and charge. This is the part where everything is a clusterfuck of close range and everything else. 
---
Warriors get to do #2. If both squads are content with turtling behind their mage/lock walls then the warriors job is to sit there and protect the squad from enemy divers or you can choose to test your luck at diving into the enemy for disruption and getting out
---
I'm a PvP server guy, but back in the day I rember quite a few complaints about bluewalling on PvE servers (not putting your PvP flag up and attacking enemies flagged for PvP by surprise) .
---
Almost but not quite.  There exists an addon that does flag items that are well below the median market price.  The user only has to perform a click to buyout said item.
---
However, the point people miss is that this is one step removed from botting, having a computer script to know when the event is triggered and clicking the pop up the microsecond it appears.  So from a programmatic stand point, it is incredibly easy to create a window clicking script on your computer to bot AH transactions and I would be shocked if no one has actually done this.
---
I mean, I paid money to reserve my name on my first choice.  Then I rerolled to my second choice. The I landed on a new server that wasn’t in my choices, and I still got 5 hour queues. I wasn’t rolling again.  
---
To me, I think Blizzard thought more people would quit.  So did us players.  So we think the realms will have half the players after 3 months.  That doesn’t seem to be the case
---
Yeah, this is why I said it's variable.  If you're on a low/dead server, you're gonna probably have to hit up the TM/SS lovefest.  But if you're on a high pop server, you can probably roam around and find plenty of targets.  It all depends on the situation on your server when you're playing.
---
It's just not necessary.  People often write quickly/shorthand and you'll always understand per the context of the comment.
---
It's like hearing their, there, and they're in conversation.  No one specifies which word they're using you understand it via context.  Imagine people explaining which there they're using...
---
THIS GAVE ME A HORDE-ON ;)
---
Yeah cause the reddit hivemind is always right. That's why its held in such high regard lol.
---
It's funny how triggered all of your are with me making fun of your stupid chump groups.
---
I hate this answer. Why?   
---
It created a culture obsessed about it. Which:
---
1. Makes it harder to find a group not reserving. Not joining means waiting longer. 
---
2. Is a reflection of the BiS-obsessed culture which makes the game less enjoyable.  
---
I still love the game but those aspects do reduce the enjoyment.  
---
This is why people complain about min-maxers and BiS. They come to dominate the meta and the expectations surrounding the game as well as the culture of the players. They're a loud and influential minority to the point where "ignoring" their effect is basically like not paying your taxes. Sure, you can decide to not pay your taxes the same way you can decide to not join groups.  
---
But the inconvenience has become monumental.
---
Man you made a comment that got quite a few pvp try hards mad huh?
---
But yeah pretty much, Westfall had like 100v100 battles all over the place when honor dropped.
---
But when I was done I could go back to farming in peace
---
&gt;Lol I've had a few tanks trying to blackmail my group into giving up loot. Hmm I wonder why they cannot find any groups in /lfg.
---
If I see someone looking for a tank for strat live I'll message them that I'll tank it for reserve on first orb. 
---
9 times out of 10 I'm instantly invited. The other 1 asks the group first then invites me.
---
Ya he’s actually good at mechanics. Best example is him reading/talking to chat while doing call outs for termination sequence in Mechagon while also tanking. Also if you watch him do the recent anniversary event in retail, he immediately knows every single mechanic of all the raids from years ago
---
I'm glad you learned to use periods rather than commas in this short exchange. You're welcome as well!
---
Your argument is literally "Blizzard have money, fix networking problem plz." I'm working on a project right now where top end capabilities are bottlenecking our current repo. Get back to me when you have dealt with   EC2 limits.
---
There are plenty of PUG groups that roll at certain times so you will probably be able to find a PUG that fits your schedule and once you show up a few times they will prioritize the usual suspects over new people.  Just look around a bit.

---
What a great way to reframe the issue. 
---
Everyone understands that a dungeon or raid isn't made off of one player, you need a group. That isn't at issue. No one is arguing that you can solo strat live or scholo. 
---
The issue is that tanks don't need really any great out of those places. DPS do. A tank would much rather run strat undead for gear/scourgestones if they had the chance. So, you not paying them is effectively you hoping that there is some fresh 60 tank out there who needs to get the quests done from those places. 
---
Otherwise you are competing with opportunity costs. The opportunity cost for a tank being, "I could be running strat UD right now." So you either compensate them for that, or you are wasting their time or your group's time because of the 30+ minute wait for a fresh 60 tank that will tank twice as long to clear compared to if you got an experienced tank and you compensated them appropriately.
---
That was a bad move, without layering you have no hope in avoiding  the 500 man raid that's going to hunt you down and crash your server, sorry, I mean "pvp".
---
Tanks won’t struggle to find groups? I have a lowbie tank alt and I have a hard time finding groups bc everyone now is high level while I am here in my server playing casually. It is just dumb and frustrating.
---
Sorry, I forgot to provide the time the bidding will go live.  It will begin at 10p.m. tonight MST. The link should work then.
---
Message the person who bought it. Sometimes they’ll sympathize and understand it was a honest mistake.  Don’t be passive aggressive about it or anything. If they say no, move on. It sucks but it’s not the end of the world.
---
Of you want to keep vengeance up more, use SoR and lifestealing enchant and faster weapon. Dont use seal of command.
---
Reasoning.
---
1. SoR does more damage over the duration of the fight and it's always gonna go off.
---
2. SoR tics count as a weapon swing, thus allowing on hit abilities to proc.
---
3. Lifestealing can crit. With SoR it effectively procs twice as often and gives more chances for it to crit.
---
I'm not gas lighting. The poster you replied to said that week 3 was just as bad and you agrees with him. When it's not even close.
---
Right! Its almost like when they have to answer for their ganking and bullshit over the past couple of months, they all turn into squeamish sheep and complain complain complain.
---
So this person must be sitting in front of the auctioneer and when the popup comes up he clicks it? That is what you think occurred?
---
Your best bet is to message or send an in game mail to the person that bought them from you telling them of your mistake.  There is a chance they feel bad and sell them back to you for what you paid, although probably unlikely.
---
Try this combo against a cloth/leather/mail/fury/ret:
---
Cheap shot - backstab - 4 point kidney - white damage hit  MH - cold blood vanish ambush 
---
Probably the most fun rotation 
---
Also if you catch any of those guys off guard, do:
---
Ambush - vanish - ambush, feel free to cold blood either or of those ambushes. 
---
Typically a 1 shot. 
---
Play daggers friends:) you will have more fun
---
I meant put some actually though into it, mentioned elsewhere in this thread is sticking a lowbie in your party to force people to leave your group alone, that's just one reason.
---
If you have a complaint then say it with a solution(one thats actually reasonable) if not then its just more crying on the internet.
---
should use addons like auctionator to do it automatically for u
---
But this still isn't even really a soft crit cap, because crit's value isn't functionally impaired by surpassing the value.  It's the point where vengeance can be sustained.  No one ever talks about a soft crit cap for warriors where they can keep flurry up indefinitely because the value of crit is still significant.
---
Soft crit cap would be the point where white hits can no long crit while hard cap is where abilities can't crit.
---
This guy is talking about the ability to sustain vengeance which isn't really a cap, but a floor.
---
Yet pservers did this with 0 lag.
---
&gt; A druid starting in bear or a priest getting to put up PW:S should not significantly affect your chances to kill them
---
Rogue class is built around getting a good opener and Spy effectively takes that away from them.  Pretty simple to see how it's bad for rogues.
---
Better to just keep quiet, get loot, and leave for a better guild when the opportunity arises and cite this as why you're leaving. The gl is clearly taking the next binding and questioning will result in a gkick. Play the more satisfying long game.
---
Feral tanks are great tanks. They're not meme like Paladins. Watch the Skarm guides, he tanks Naxx as feral. It's quite good.
---
For alts, you can never go wrong with hunter or mage. The ease of leveling and farming potential is insane. Hunters are better if you master the DM North Tribute solo runs, but those are a bit hard and RNG.
---
Overall, I'd say hunter is a great alt.
---
Off topic, but salt being unhealthy is a myth.
---
The dude made it very clear he took the helm on purpose and doesnt see anything wrong with it. I hope you are trolling and not this stupid.
---
What are you even talking about? You literally said 
---
&gt; I am glad to see that you haven't gone for T1 Felheart (I assume) and/or min-maxed shadow sp at the expense of raw stats and sp in other schools.
---
Now you're making it sound like raw stats are bad.
---
PvP focused stats earns plenty in the 'gankfest' because you're not running around with 3k hp and getting 2 shot. You cant contribute anything if you're dead.
---
5/8 is pvp bis. Look at the set bonus. Look at the stats. Your uptime is incredibly enhanced compared to stacking SP like some glass cannon that doesn't really contribute much more even if you stay alive 100% of the time.
---
And what do you even mean you 'still lose in a 1v1 with 5/8 bis' - against who? Another lock with SP gear? Definitely not. It also makes you able to beat rogues even if they open on you. It makes you able to deal with warriors even if you fuck up.
---
You don't know what you're talking about, at all.
---
It's not really hurtful that's a little bit too sensitive.
---
If you want sheer DPS numbers, fury DPS &gt; mage.
---
&gt; I'm using it because I would lose out if I didnt
---
You and everyone else.  Which is why it shouldn't be allowed.
---
It's always imbalanced. And the huge battles people are posting pictures of are just as bad if not worse. The lag is ridiculous and it's just a zerg fest.
---
I didn't say peak numbers.
---
What server
---
He did
---
They have a one spell rotation and go oom very quickly.
---
I don't join those groups just saying my thoughts.
---
You thinking people shouldn't pvp while leveling is why you don't understand the appeal. Pvp servers are about pvp breaking out anytime and anywhere, not just during the max level meta, but anywhere for anyone. Pvp even in the 20s can be fun. Had a blast on my warrior in ashenvale.
---
Jesus didn't even notice that lol.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT5Y4xJ_IeQ
---
Well
---
&gt; The F1 game is much better and requires skills.
---
The F1 game?????
---
My guild cleared through Majordomo on Tuesday, and we're heading back to take out Ragnaros for the first time on Monday. I've been told we'll have to clear through all of the elemental trash packs and right Majordomo again before we can summon Ragnaros. Can anyone confirm?
---
Don't be silly. It's in no way tryhard. It's the standard farm for priests. While it did make more on private servers, it still makes 40-50g/h and is by far the best and most consistent solo farm for holy/disc-priests. You are only gimping yourself and being stubborn if you ignore it as a priest.
---
Well as for the speaking Spanish lines thing, that's kinda binary, it's either in Spanish or not. As for the frequency of attacks, any attack that has a voice line attached to it is in hundreds of not thousands of raid parses with time stamps so it would not be hard to figure out if it's different or not
---
So... Find another guild secretly and leave? Fuck that shit MT is the most stressful position in a guild and you should definitely get bindings over a mages alt.
---
This just confirms my theory that dishonorable kills don't matter this weak since nobody has earned rank points yet. Thus this is the only week for all of wow where you can safely raid enemy cities to kill faction leaders. Yet so many players are afraid of DKs that it's not going to happen. What a tragedy.
---
While it is a show, its reality TV. Not regular TV. He interacts with real people and "its a character" doesn't change that.
---
For example, Olympus lost some very good members(like Grenades) because Asmon would value stream content ahead of proper guild and raid leadership.
---
They can change the information that the combat log provides.
---
Because it contradicts the state of the game in 1.12 which is the state of the honor system we should be getting.
---
You act as if Blizzard implemented the game exactly how they intended.  Raid dungeon farm xp was way off and Blizz admitted it then corrected it.  It's quite possible that blizz will correct 25% to 10% as it was in 1.12.  But it's also possible they're making an intentional change.
---
Man's teeth look positively frightening
---
Oh, I completely misunderstood how that worked. So you're never punished for killing a low level person of the opposite faction. Damn I was hoping phase 2 would stop or at least slow down the ganks from the skull level
---
Just reroll pve. I cba having unbalanced pvp thrust upon me when I dont want it. When I do want it I can enable pvp/do bg's when they come out.
---
Then you should know how marvelous BoF is for large scale PvP. Assign a holy to each mage and you can push every 20seconds. 
---
You can do that as horde every 2minutes for 2g each.
---
thanks for the quick reply. I guess I will just keep on running BRD
---
Agreed listen to this man!
---
You don't need to kite. You have a pet. For the first ten levels, just open with shots and melee when the target gets to you. It's easy.
---
Even for your epic bow quest, which does require kiting, you can always pay another hunter to do it for you.
---
As a last note, I'm also old and it took me like 3 days to do the hunter bow quest, but it felt amazing when I finally got it. And I notice my overall skill with my hunter has improved significantly after it.
---
Hunters and priests dominate the 19 bracket
---
Well then, I would leave. 
---
But short of starting your own guild, I wouldn’t bank on being first in line.
---
I've never been involved in a derpy one-on-one holy priest vs. holy priest fight that lasted less than 2 minutes.
---
What an insightful rebuttal.
---
What a little punk
---
Cat's out of the bag. If this had been implemented day 1? Sure. But right now implementing balance queues like that transfers the unhappy players from alliance to horde. It's not solving the problem.
---
Faction transfers aren't an option, plus who would want to transfer to the losing side? Battleground queues don't *really* solve things because they're combined so being on a super horde dominated server isn't the end of the world as a horde player.
---
Server transfers are possibly an option, but we just don't have enough alliance players on pvp servers to fix things by moving people around. Capping it at 55/45? Still going to be ~4 alliance per 5 horde and it'll still be bad.
---
Bond with your mates over tough times, and wait for Battlegrounds. Most people think it'll be a piecemeal introduction and that at least one will come out somewhat soon.
---
Imagine lacking this much perspective.  Holy shit ur dumb.
---
Instead we can't complete quests because they're camping us. /shrug
---
You can grief them but not by killing them in fair pvp. Getting killed 3 times and then crying about it on forums doesnt make that griefing if you signed up for a Pvp realm. 
---
I mention fair pvp, because abusing guards like people were doing in gadgetzan pvp is absolutely griefing.
---
Most of these things are decided a week or two before the announcement.
---
And I thought it was awesome last night! 100s of people in battle and just a 2 second delay for commands was a blast!
---
Have you been subject to this treatment, /u/dave4443?
---
Capital city ganking as a rogue seems like one of the most effective ways. I’ve been kinda AFK playing and farming HKs in Ironforge (around 50 HKs or so) and I’m probably way ahead of my friends who’s been raid/group farming in EPL/WPL. Even though my effective time played is probably 20% of theirs.
---
Whoever coined the twink term in WoW is a legendary troll
---
1)yes
---
2)slow mh fast oh
---
3)Very fast wep, even a dagger
---
Yup. In the absolute most general sense, tanking is basically two jobs. Make as much of the total incoming damage as possible directed at you, and make the actual amount of damage you take as small as possible. If you can't keep aggro, you fail at the first step so the second step is irrelevant. If your DPS is too threat capped to do decent damage the fight takes longer and the total damage you take is higher. You want a good mix of both, but hit is probably your best priority to start with.
---
What about the #nochanges? Not so important now that you don't like something eh?
---
Mostly the ones in the south, but i've seen that problem across the board.  Anyway, i quit doing that and started farming herbs, much more profitable today.
---
Yeah HoJ is Bis till phase 5 lol, sorry man
---

Morals lmao. Its a video game dude.
---
Really hardly any time. id argue since you're on reddit anyway, you aren't wasting anymore time than you already would be. People dislike him because of the way he interacts with other people. Luckily hes got you on his side
---
Know what I love about real life people and makes me want to be around them? One-up-manship, bragging, and dick wagging. Miss me with that.
---
satyr bow isnt good for hunters, for head blackwood helm is much better
---
Fiery is procing vengeance atm.
---
I don't mind the world pvp personally, but it is pretty obvious that not having any kind of consequence for killing low level players is bad for the overall game health. Or are you just ok with the prospect of driving new players off of your server.
---
Again, this is just me. I never recommend the keto diet to anyone.
---
I don’t get the post meal insulin spikes that slow me down, I feel much more level headed, and performance in games tends to go up slightly.
---
But the social aspects of it suck. Have to be careful of eating out, cake at work for bdays = no go, holidays REALLY suck.
---
But it works for me and that’s all I care about
---
why is you wanting a balanced server more important than the player on the other faction that wants to play on a server + on a faction with a massive advantage? ( i main pve so just playing devil's advocate)
---
It's one thing for the TANK or HEALER who formed the group to reserve the FIRST drop.  It is an entirely different thing for the DPS to reserve ALL the drops.
---
As a tank myself, I don't play bullshit like that.  I want to relive my vanilla experience, I make groups, I make no reserves, everything is free roll MS&gt;OS.
---
Brutal.
---
Or have a long debug that increases ur casting bar
---
I mean, technically he wasn’t wrong and it’s ok to question blue posts too.
---
As mentioned in other comments already, sources from patch 1.12 confirm the honor DR was -10% per kill, rather than 25% as stated in the blue post yesterday. 
---
It’s possible that blizzard has implemented an older version of the honor system, rather than the 1.12 version. Which I guess COULD be stated as “incorrect” unless they are going to update it in a later phase.
---
Which server was this all on?
---
The experience every time.
---
He also has been playing the game for awhile and has great insights on its design so I know myself and other watch him for that as well.
---
Yes actually the highest grade I ever had in college was in a statistics class and my professor recommended me to the statistics department. I kinda wish I had taken his advice... I digress...
---
I don't think you understood the idea that I was proposing. I know that the statistic is from a large amount of data.  What I am curious of is whether the drop rates get tweaked from time to time or there is more in depth programming than just plain 23% chance on each kill. Maybe one week the drop rate is 35% and the next it is 15%. Maybe I'm wrong but the extreme outliers seem too common. Just a hunch.

Nostalrius world boss release, hundreds vrs hundreds and no lag at all. nice job blizz
---
As someone who switched to combat to try and hit 60 faster your making me wanna go back to my Ambush spec!
---
I’m a level 34 Lock, I popped over to TM and watched the Alliance hide in south shore because nobody wanted to get DK’s. Was still a spectacle for sure, one I enjoyed reflecting on as I hid in Scarlet Monastery for the next three hours.
---
The term "twink" for decked out, lower level trust-fund baby alts has been around since at LEAST 1999, when I started playing Everquest. It definitely was a term well before WoW. I'm not sure about the other meaning of the term. No idea when that came about.
---
I really enjoy being able to fight people off of farming for the same stuff as me. Without that, it just comes down to "who clicks on something the fastest".
---
Phase 2 is also much more interesting. You don't get people sitting around unflagged waiting for you to engage a mob..
---
Leveling is nice on a PvE server, but I spend much more time at max level.
---
You need to raid.
---
Lightforged gear and pvp blues for pally are good for a ret or reckoning hybrid build, and competitive during this phase, but you will get DEMOLISHED against T2+ geared people later. The power gap will only grow over time.
---
Lawbringer is strong in its own way for holy pvp and you can get some judgement pieces.
---
Hunters are great in T1, then you're done for the rest of the game if you want. It's very strong. Pvp blues probably have good stamina and stuff, idk. Compare the stats yourself and be the judge. But gainstalker is big damage.
---
Im assuming you aren't getting pvp epics because you don't even want to raid and probably have a life. 
---
In vanilla, raiding is how you get the best gear. In 2006 you could get away with not raiding because everyone was a scrub. Today in classic, you need to do it to compete.
---
1.6-1.7 per stack, 3.000+12.000+21.000=36.000 rep needed. 36.000/50=720, so 720 stacks, 720*1.65=1188 gold. Was rough.
---
This is honestly the best time to level an alt. Lol
---
Wow lol. Didnt think that you are this stupid. I am talking about fraction based information
---
I was that rogue last night.  I aggro'd Wyrm because my finger was still on the forward key as I dozed off.  My head bob woke me up in time to vanish and all was fine.  IIRC I aggro'd a group of mobs earlier as well but it's all a bit hazy.  Ha!
---
May just be a coincidence, I'm on Whitemane.
---
Also, I agree with the late night groups.   It's easier to get into groups as a rogue in those late hours too.  Less "reserved" items as well.
---
i switched to a cold blood hemo spec and it’s really fun. unfortunately will have to switch back for raids since most these abilities are useless in MC, but i’m currently using dal rends MH and scarlet kris OH and it’s working well
---
No changes not so important anymore right?
---
You prioritize mp5 on a shaman. MP5 is more useful to you, spirit is more useful to priest and druids. It's not completely useless to you, but it's dumb to give  a high spirit item to a shaman over a druid or priest.
---
is speccing into SV a good choice you think?
---
Yea, I've thought about trying it before, but I was raised in a household where there was a loaf of bread on the dinner table with every meal.  Hard for me to stay away from that stuff entirely.
---
As for the trash there are a couple of big skips you can do to save a lot of time, they're pretty easy. The first one shouldn't be risky at all
---
you should never need to vanish after blind unless ofc theres multiple people or hunters mark / pet something like that
---
For the Horse!
---
I honestly thought it went pretty well. I played vanilla back in the day and the world pvp lagged in what I imagine was maybe up to 100 vs 100. 
---
What I saw yesterday is the servers easily handling that amount of players and really only bog down in excess of 200 to 300 on each side. I still had a lot of fun and when I got frustrated I hearthed home.
---
i can do u one better :  [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/623240087337172993/637055673783549974/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/623240087337172993/637055673783549974/unknown.png)
---
Well once all the try hards are done with pre-raid BiS that should come to an end.
---
Vanilla was an awesome game... Classic is mixed because of the mass amounts of shit heads.
---
rogues rarely get through my sac lol
---
What's the one thing separating two opposing groups? A shitload of traps and blizzard. If you BoF it's so much easier to get your mages into position.
---
But if you only play alliance, you probably don't know the pain of R1 blizzard spam for horde warriors. No easy BoF gap closer for them.
---
I honestly liked the tri-spec , but I didn't think like it would be able to hold up on the pve side.  It's not gamebreaking, but I'd still like to not be terrible in pve.
---
You're right though, in an ideal situation I'd have peels.  I think because peels are so necessary though (for priest especially), blackout gives that little bit extra of survivability in a very mana-efficient/instant-cast way, which is a nice bonus in pvp.
---
Blizzard's statements are fallible young shill.
---
I'm willing to bet he was toxic about it on stream.
---
Sure.
---
ok boomer
---
I'd forget the idea of putting that many points into the elemental tree. The real value from elemental comes from the cast time reduction at the end. If I were you I'd commit to a resto pvp build, with improved ghost wolf.
---
It’s probably because current games are loot-box-pay-to-win-hyper-inclusive-zero-effort-no-skill trash games.
---
That's most of why PvP servers are a thing. People didn't join them to start fair fights.
---
Most of it was fps lag. I got a gforce 4 card at the time and was able to charge in and ww then back out without getting hit. Most people just had shit pcs.
---
RR from the get-go is the only fair way. No one needs gear from strat live, everyone is there for orbs. If you join a run where you are guaranteed a lower chance at getting one, you're a chump who's wasting their time.
---
"Smurf" rolls of the tongue, "twink" tongues off the smurf
---
Seemed like you got the full WoW Vanilla experience, my man. Good on you, glad y'all got Rag down.
---
Here's the thing: Did you have fun? Of course you did. You didn't play "Optimally", and why would you? It's your first time. You're kind of expected to explore, make mistakes, fuck around etc. It's thrilling. 
---
Not to defend the assholes you partied with, but I went through the same shit when I first played 15 years ago, and honestly it just made me want to be better - I didn't go online and cry to gamefaqs at the time, I just worked hard to learn more and have a good time, and eventually I got to where you are now. It's kind of part of the experience, as I see it.
---
You have to find a group of people who are like you - not every guild is a good fit for every person. Glad you found one you like and they like you. Is your wife still playing, too?
---
I was definitely roaming with a group of guildies finding whomever I could to gank. Came up against a group of horde doing the same thing. I don't think Azshara is safe
---
Fair enough!
---
I don't have any link for it, but that's how pretty much all spell damage modifying talents work in classic. They're all base, as +healing and +spell damage are applied last in the order of operations. It's a simple test you can do yourself next time you respec.
---
Yeah, it's not a *bad* talent, and it's probably preferable at a lower gearscore because it IS just flat efficiency and you're using a lot of pots to augment your mana pool. But I've done a lot of math on it, and the extra mana is *generally* better once you're in halfway decent raid gear.
---
This is because it gets added efficiency off both +heals, as that gives you more healing per mana, and the mana boost it gives you scales off int. So with better gear, that 10% mana is getting double efficiency in terms of total healing output since it stacks off two different stats, whereas spiritual healing stacks off nothing.
---
Now, a lot of this is because you're downranking. Downranked spells have very low base heals, which means even less healing off of spiritual healing. So you're looking at like a sub 5% boost to heals, whereas 10% max mana is going to be *at minimum* a 5% boost to total mana since you're unlikely to double your mana pool just off regen, pots, and runes when you're around 6k mana buffed.
---
The situation where I'd still go 21/30/0 as a geared priest is if you're the dedicated main healer. They're there to put out big high HPS heals on the tank, and spiritual healing affects HPS. But for anyone else, the added cushion of 10% mana just offers a lot of factor of safety and higher theoretical healing output in 90% of fights.
---
Dear gnome mages... F*ck You.
---
Sincerely, every single person 10+ levels lower than you minding their own business.
---
Uh he's not really playing a character even according to him. He hams it up a bit im sure but"it's not like I'm playing Dr Disrespect or something." Those were his words in response to Taliesin saying he is playing a character.
---
The horror.
---
Have gut gore ripper and distracting dagger OH.  Should I spend dkp on getting a CHT first since I already have a solid MH dagger or should I just go for perds and rock the two 1.8 daggers till cht later on?
---
Warlocks are very boring to play against. You get feared and most times die before it breaks or it breaks with 10%-20% hp left.
---
i love it, feels like classic first release day queue!
---
The Bucket of Money EA dumped on their doorstep wasn’t big enough to offset them actually voting for a good game...
---
Hardware has. Code, data, it's structure and handling have not. Why is this so hard to understand?
---
Don’t edit your post thanking it’s so fucking vain.
---
Yeah I had this exact experience today on my Mniteshamlam :(
---
As a vanilla tank and owner of the first ubrs key on my vanilla server for atleast a week, and a tank in classic....... I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR POSITION.
---
Literally said peak number for vanilla. Are you okay?
---
yeah ill try to get (or buy) the shoulders. So that's 6%. Then probably either spec into SV or get those additional items you mention. Thanks!
---
I feel like pointing out server types is just a futile gesture at this point.
---
go back to them then , smart ass
---
Idk if that outweighs the inconvenience of needing to run back to your body from 30,000 yds away 15 times and then just logging out. I’d rather just do another quest while I wait. But that’s just my preference.
---
Yeah but once taunt wears off you don't get to keep the threat
---
im like half honored with each faction and 1/3 with uc as undead without donating almost any runecloth, so i guess its not that bad
---
Once you get those boots are you going to get improved ghost wolf? What does that look like?
---
That is the generous interpretation.
---
The less generous is where a player programs their computer to click the pop-up while he is at work.  The way the addon is set up is almost comically easy to bot.
---
A++ meme
---
That seems really rough. Maybe its a server culture thing? I haven't been corpse camped once yet with like... 9 days /played? I have avoided STV for the most part, though, so that could be it too. That zone brings out the worst in everyone haha.
---
Apparently you'd rather the sloppy seconds when it comes to the drama making it's way to reddit
---
The copy pasta of legends
---
With phase 2 out, I really want to go Sub...but doing so completely throws any chance of raiding for gear out the window, right?
---
Respeccing back and forth is going to bankrupt me.  I'm so conflicted
---
Hmm, just seems out of context.
---
Did you ever find something for this /u/ActuallyReadsArticle
---
In Archeage we had 2 raid groups (~80 people. 50 in one full raid and overflow) face off against a smaller force from the enemy faction (maybe 60-70) on a neutral island. This does not include the ships and carts/wagons both sides had summoned. That fight ran perfectly with no lag.
---
There was also a regular open world battleground event with participation easily in the 100-150 person range per faction. It got slightly laggy there, but not enough to be very noticeable. 
---
Man that game was amazing. If they didn't make so many terrible decisions the first time they released, they could've had a huge following.
---
Why does this stuff get posted here?
---
I was just stating easier items to get that are in the 30%+ drop rate to close the gap for the short period. Satyr is still decent, little to quick since it's a 2.6 spd I believe? But def something before moving to the carapace crossbow
---
Far fewer organic events though.
---
On my server, people force big battles all the time by just taking over BRM and attacking anyone trying to enter. On PvE servers, raid groups can just ignore you.
---
cheers
---
Guess the extra 700/150mbs make a difference.
---
I am! I just stay away from the 200v200. It’s just not fun to me. It may be fun for mages or people with sappers but overall it’s just a cool screenshot. I can see the issue with world bosses tho.. that’s a problem. I play on Whitemane and not one time have I encountered a slide show in BRM. I simply stay away from hillsbrad and everything is gravy baby.
---
because then everyone would just play human and that's boring
---
Depending on the class it could take a good amount longer to level. Also if you're doing quests, don't know them, and arent using questie that'll certainly add on a lot of time. Also a lot of other factors like leveling professions, messing around in cities, etc. If you would just grind mobs youd have hit 60 by 11 days played. I wouldn't rush it but just kill everything in sight and dont bother with quests that make you travel to the opposite corner of the world. If there arent any quests left, dont bother searching for more and grind until you can enter the next zone easily
---
Agreed.
---
nope.
---
Ahh yess. Dancing in the middle of a pack of enemies because you aren’t flagged and blowing kisses to them. Being able to choose when to initiate a fight every 5 minutes. Truly the best of world PVP
---
I initially rolled PVE in Vanilla and ended up dropping my 60 and rerolling PVP and never went back. If PVE is your preference that’s fine and more power to you. But don’t kid yourself m8, world PVP on a PVE server is nothing like a PVP server
---
Not everyone can stealth and this part of the game is absolute garbage for a large portion of the people on unbalanced PvP servers (like all of them)
---
I raid every week as hemo/cb. Do what you enjoy man. You can easily find a guild that's not worried about min maxing dps parses. Unless its loot counciled everybody gets the same roll on the same gear anyway.
---
Every player gets everything he wants. I wanted a quest, and for my sins they gave me one.
---
Lmao what a narcissistic loser
---
I have never seen this before and it's hilarious. People always ask me in groups if I'm really a girl or if it's just my character. My favorite was when someone said "Guy or girl?" I said girl and they said "Better that way" I was confused and asked what they meant and they replied "I'm sexist" I was cracking up
---
I find it super fucking tacky to reserve multiple things in a run. I reserve shit occasionally, but I only target one piece I'm looking for and run for JUST it at a time. I'm also a super geared warrior so I get alot of leeway in those peopke who are just thankful to find a tank.
---
Mining silithus hives, it's been very lucrative
---
EVE does it by slowing down the time in game around the battle. It's kind of what it seems like is happening in WoW except not by design. Server can't keep up so it only processes actions every so often.
---
If you can afford the enchant, go for it, but I'd say spec into SV over it, unless you have Rhok in which case you are using that for a while.  
---
Though I suppose it depends on the material costs, because on my server its around 350g to craft it.  
---
Really depends on how much gold you have to spend.
---
mainly because you can use rake in bgs for 19 &amp; 29.
---
Flasks...wtf
---
Possibly! I heard y’all were tearing it up out there ahaha
---
Dishonorable kills don't effect anything for the first week. No one has any standing so it can't decrease.
---
Dishonorable kill. If you kill a AI MOB that is marked as a "civilian" you get a DK that removes honor points. It's bad.... really bad. 
---
The concept is fine, but the implementation is stupid. Currently, you if anyone in your party/raid kills a civilian, you ALL get the DK...
---
It's really, really dumb.
---
Actually an enjoyable read (yep I read all of it lol).
---
The days of friendly cross-faction relations in the wild are over. You're a resource now, you're just one more thing they need to grind out for better gear. You're a mining node. Don't take it personally.
---
BG's was never an exception to this in vanilla, and I assume they won't be now either.
---
Well if you google your 'classic wow + realms name + reddit' with it you might be able to find something. If you already tried that then you might be shit out of luck.
---
I'm guessing he's referring to the retail realm Ragnaros, which is known to be heavily populated with Brazilian players who speak Portuguese, not Spanish.
---
Nah, ty tho
---
I received a DK last night and was pissed. It's such a shitty feeling to have that 1 dk mitigate a lot of grinding. In saying that, I was too close to the graveyard, and if I would have stayed further back (like the raid leader and people in general were spamming to do) I would have out-ranged the DK as it's proximity based.
---
Some has to inflate those black lotus prices
---
It is necessary.  It's wrong.  
---
If we stop caring about stuff like this, we normalize it being wrong.
---
[Killed them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GSMdgoWPY8)
---
I’m rolling a Druid in a week (I haven’t started classic yet as I wanted to let bgs come out first)
---
Since there’s no tanks should I roll bear tank 🤔
---
Its based on how much other people play. Rank 10 is top 8%.
---
Not crazy, but will take effort.
---
Yeah I guess I should of clarified when I said dishonor. I didn't mean you necessarily receive a full dishonor kill, just that you would lose some amount of honor. I fully agree it shouldn't be a full dishonorable kill's worth.
---
It's so dumb... taking over towns is so much fun, and this discourages it.
---
No - everyone in a raid is bringing something to that raid even if they are just standing there afk (as a deterrent at the least and if they happened to cast any buffs before afking or have any auras running they are helping that raid kill stuff).
---
Also healers are 100% immune to DKs in your system and tanks very rarely snag them.
---
&gt; https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20628/deviate-growth-cap
---
No half-decent guild is going to take Mish'undare from a DPS and give it to a Holy Paladin.
---
Deviate Growth Cap is a good alternative, but it really boils down to 28 healing vs. regen stats. Given how Paladins don't really have mana issues, the bonus healing is stronger.
---
44-47 wont be 44-47 forever though
---
Super excited to be a 46 mage right now
---
I think you should just get what comes first. You might pass on CHT to not see Perd drop for several more weeks and then you might still not win it. Since it’s all a gamble and both are upgrades I would get whichever drops first. RNG can be quite annoying. 
---
That being said Perd is going to be a much bigger upgrade than any other dagger.
---
People who play wow all day everyday are not the most reasonable people. The haters are fucking crazy. I honestly think it's a mix of jealousy and anger that he banned them from his chat and/or kicked from his guild for being toxic assholes. He really seems like a nice guy who doesn't take himself or the game too seriously (the no lifers hate this).
---
Perfect example: Recently some idiot was calling people racial/homeosexual slurs in guild chat and Asmon kicked him. The guy raged and started getting hate. Then he starts whispering Asmongold calling him toxic and saying Asmongold was responsible for people harassing him. That's how I view the haters. I mean if you just don't like him ok if you froth at the mouth at his mere mention you're fucking crazy. The best are the "Asmon who?" posters. You know who he is.. you think about him way too much.
---
Crippling is op in pvp
---
I lvled my lock to 46 and just started the get really bored with the rotation. Rerolled into rogue and haven't looked back, just passed my lock in lvl the other day and now I have him at 48. Somewhat regretting not starting off as a rogue as now I'm quite behind where I could have been and now Wpvp is a lot tougher. Still having a ton of fun though and plan on lvling the lock again at a later point.
---
Buy it from a hunter solo farming
---
Dont go to STV cause I will be awaiting in the dark. Waiting to eat your dreams and sew in nightmares.
---
Www.boviicetheninja.com
---
Did you just miss in PvP? Bro get some Hit.
---
It discourages it on a large scale, but if you are playing with a group of players you trust it's a non issue. Just don't AoE!
---
I mean, you actively chose playing on a PvP-server which have elements of PvP in it. Even if it's unfair.
---
Decay is maxed at 2500 per week.
---
At 8000 RP a week, factoring in decay you will get to 60k by 10 weeks
---
I'd say that's a problem with your guild. Ours has a druid tank as the OT. And he tanks basically everything.
---
Let me ask, are you tanking a lot of 5-mans for your guild? That's how people start understanding that you're a good tank. Also, make sure that you have your pre-BiS.
---
If it seems hopeless, just find another guild.
---
So what? If I don't kill a civilian why should I be punished for it? Cuz some rando in my raid who doesn't care about honor does it to troll means I should be punished. It's bad, and it discourages PVP.
---
This one is pretty good, good explanations as well  
---
 [https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-rogue-leveling-guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-rogue-leveling-guide)
---
A couple things,
---
First, Cap implies a point where the effect of crit is no longer beneficial.  You can say "This is the point crit is not longer beneficial to keeping up vengeance", to that I will respond with
---
Second, this is the statistical FLOOR to maintain vengeance, not the cap at which point vengeance will be up permanently.  You can argue there is a cap at the point where you crit so much it is virtually unlikley vengeance ever falls, but this isn't that.  I am a rogue and I attack far more often than a paladin does and even I have spurts of 5-8 seconds of when I don't crit.
---
This would be the Vengeance floor not the vengeance cap.
---
Sweet I was thinking about this yesterday and came up with something very similar. Good to know that its actually viable. I love me some improved ghost wuf.

Killing blow is a bit too narrow IMO.  If they were going to change it only the people that damage that civilian should be penalized.  In your OP I (as a Warlock) could DoT up a civilian and take 95% of their health and then a Rogue comes along and one shots them and I would be off clean... that doesn't make sense.
---
&gt; There’s been some evidence that people breaking keto to “carb load” how they do on a CKD is actually more damaging to blood vessels than if you were to just stick with carbs.
---
Then im definitely out considering this means no pizza forever haha.
---
It's just not my cup of tea, but I understand that it's a big part of WoW so I like to have it on as part of the world since we are at war. But is it really PvP when you get 1shot repeatedly while killing mobs, and stand literally no chance of survival even if you could even fight back? This post was more of a vent of frustration more than anything, it'll likely get deleted anyways
---
Yang 2020
---
I meant "of course he would".
---
Or change it so it's not poorly implemented and discouraging MMO in an MMORPG...
---
That's an exploit of game mechanics not griefing.
---
lol even better. I'm glad you recognized who it was before it was too late.
---
Warriors goes dps for raid, then you can't use said dps gear outside of raid cause it suck for pvp and no one ever invite war dps to dungeons
---
We're going to purposely allow Rag to submerge next week to practice the phase. Doing it in preparation of splitting our MC raid into 2 25 mans.
---
No it removes contribution points not honor points. You do not receive CP until Tuesday. A DK has no effect till next week.
---
What a boring pointless post.
---
Make your own run! Problem solved!
---
Thank you for the clarification! I wasn’t sure when it had changed but I though it might have been when they made bgs cross server toward the end of vanilla.
---
Fine. Damage works for me.
---
don't you just aoe farm in an instance all day long? you cant get ganked in an instance dude.
---
Or join a guild!
---
Uh.. what? Of course you can grief someone on a pvp server, what i mean is you can't grief someone in pvp on a pvp server. So if you kill a low level alliance as a horde it's not griefing.
---
Or you can just make a group and not worry about reserves?
---
Oh, sweet summerchild. Why do you think we all farmed gold and horded items after hitting 60 until 2 days ago? You may see less 40 man raids, but there will be enough 3-10 man groups and solo rogues ruining your day, that you won't notice a difference other than dying 2 seconds slower.
---
The diminishing return for killing the same player is 10%. So, 10 % less honor in patch 1.12.
---
Luckily for you DKs don't matter until next week.
---
Weird, that's the only way I've recruited tanks. Send them a nice whisper and sometimes they're happy to tank.
---
I don't really AoE farm unless I absolutely have to. Yeah it's quicker but it feels like rushing to 60 and mindlessly ruining the leveling process
---
The fuck? 
---
It's not about need, who said that? 
---
It's about profit. If you're already playing 10 hours a day you might as well get paid.
---
Nice "well aktually" thoughts. 
---
The point is clear, you get less honor.
---
Well here's a couple of pics. . of just getting ready for the fight. (no tidi in this system btw)
---
https://imgur.com/ogN1q8X - Each of those groups of "specks" around the titans are full fleets of 254 (1 spot left over for the titan pilot, 1 for the cyno.)
---
https://imgur.com/QZn0oYE - Two fleets bridging out (to two different locations) with the 3rd still on standby to react to whatever change in the fight. For the WoW player. .think of it like a mass Warlock summon.
---
But just in context that's over 750 pilots in just that one system getting ready for the fight . .no lag.
---
Except how would the healers get DHKs in that scenario?
---
I ran full 9% hit gear till I started to get dps upgrades for the gear itself. Eventually replaced the mask of unforgiven with the DM West quest helmet. Bracers of the eclipse, also DM west, replaced slashclaw. THEN I specced into 2/31/18 for the extra hit. Have not bought the scope yet even though I have Rok'delar. That scope costs 250g. Long story short though, I'm huge, and I got huge by grinding out all my hit gear before swapping it for dps gear.
---
DHK's are not a thing week 1. They immediately diminish your rank rating, not your honor. Since you have no rank in week 1, you can farm as many DHK's as you want, while still gaining honor.
---
I want to do this too, however I have 0 daggers...how do I tell my raid I want to roll on dagger drops in MC, but still be effective
---
Your best option is to reroll as the alliance underdogs instead of pushing the ratio in favor of the horde on another realm.
---
They don't release this information because contrary to popular belief if makes the issue worse. Look at retail where everyone has flocked to servers that are 90% in their favor... now retail is a different game and I agree there is merit to wanting to be where everyone else is. Classic needs both factions to have a living breathing world. Without it the game is kinda dead in the water.
---
For a level 57 Druid, which helm would be better for my Feral DPS armor set; [103 Armor, +10 Str, +11 Agi, +10 Sta] or [117 Armor, +17 Sta, +1% Crit Strike]?
---
Decay is limited to 2500 RP each week. So you can do it much faster than 12 weeks.
---
what do you mean... Your honor value is shit compared to another 60...
---
I’m not really sure how maxes perform in PvP but I’d likely gravitate more towards daggers for the ambush + backstab huge crits or a hemo build if you want swords. 
---
For the poisons, during PvP at a higher level you should keep crippling poison up and you are going to want to use a combination of others depending on who is around you. For instance if it’s a ton of casters, then mind numbing is likely to be useful, to limit healers capability wound poison is good, deadly poison can have its used as well. 
---
At your level I’d use crippling on main and instant on off, until you get some of the other poisons.
---
I can’t imagine tribute even being worth the time without improved pet rez
---
Tanks are by far the worst players in Classic though, because everyone is afraid to criticize them so they never lose bad habits.
---
Meanwhile, I'm over here with my thumb up my ass, level 46 toon, and waiting for Blizzard to release a kinda World Of Diablo game and WoW 2.0.
---
And when he does Transmogs or anything. He knows almost every item and location it drops. But yeah, he sucks...? These kids are just jealous.
---
This is the most respectable mentality from a Mage I've seen in a while.
---
I wouldn’t pay for true strikes. Get the wyrmhide from the quest which requires turning in black dragon molt then killing bael’gar in BRD and using the molt on his corpse. True strike has 28 AP I think. If you’re running ubrs and you get em great if not I wouldn’t stress it.
---
DK's directly impact your RP, and you have none in week 0.
---
We just struggle finding warlocks, well have 2 max in a raid and are always desperately searching for more. They've been scarce
---
Because then people spread out over the servers, reducing server lag and at the same time improving faction balance which is a core critical component in the game. It's hard to argue because it is litterally killing 2 birds with one stone....
---
Then a PvE server is a great place for you
---
Everyone hates gnomes, everyone hates mages, and just high enough to give honor. Feel like nobody is passing that up
---
From my understanding, in classic there is no focus target. I could be wrong though.
---
What if you buff someone or your Aura is affecting them? What if allies would fight back but there aren't enough of them and your mere presence in the raid is preventing a counter attack - so you are acting as a passive defense/deterrant for those doing the dishnorable killing?
---
There is a (good) reason everyone in the raid gets the DK.
---
It’s just Power Infusion.
---
&gt; World pvp events still happen in pve. You just don’t have the griefing.
---
Yep, I came to post this. I dislike PvP so I just walk past it, but I have seen countless small and large skirmishes since the Honor drop on Pagle.
---
I just /slap /rude them for tagging my damned quest mobs with their freaking AoE and keep leveling, lol.
---
But WPVP is there if you and the other side want it. You just cannot force it on people. 
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, you win. XD
---
Boy he went looking for a fight in Theramore
---
Sure, how dare we to complain that a major part of this game now got screwed over an idiotic decision to implement the honor system in that way.
---
"bUt iT'S ThE ClAsSiC ExPeRiEnCe!" - No, it  isn't. Vanilla PvP wasn't anything near what I've experienced these last days.
---
This is the type of content I like to see!
---
&gt;When I played Vanilla, large scale PVP battles lagged all the time.
---
No shit, that was 2004. Just accept the fact that private servers are better optimized.   
---
I mean it's honestly not even surprising, most open source software tends to be better optimized. Just look at Linux vs Windows.
---
Currently combat mases (cb over ad) and it's a bit disgusting, can toe to toe warriors, other rogues are a joke and you hit like a truck. I don't pay attention to the stun procs, it's a nice bonus that will straight up win you a 1v1 when it does. Im running bashguuder in my OH, nice quick and it's a mase, otherwise stat stick or something fast in pve.
---
Ueah its  pretty bad on my server. I raid log on my shammy and dont do dungeons unless my warrior friend is on. Leveling up a war currently 45 and its piss easy to tank. Warriors in general suck on my server.
---
I recently got the full defined set, and am leveling as a dagger/hemo spec. At what level should I start replacing those pieces of gear and loose the bonus gains from it?
---
Mana potions are frequent sellers, too, esp. the superior and greater mana potion.  You're not going to get huge piles of gold per potion, but you'll sell stacks and stacks of them.  Healers especially need to chug mana potions during raids.
---
PI would increase DPS that would then decrease time spent in Molten Core.
---
Found the guy that never touched a pserver before yet likes talking out of his ass about them.
---
Which is what I said in my comment. I hate how powerful a lot of addons are. Just like that shit in retail that shows you where to stand and tells you about every boss ability at all times. Absolutely annoying. 
---
Boss abilities are made around it and the game feels more like "Simon Says" with DBM than anything else.
---
I love the smell of Firearms and Freedom in the morning
---
Us lowbies should just refer to it as the *Horror Patch*
---
On my main's server gems like moss agatas and star rubies etc. are vendor trash, even though the server population is still high. The prices on AH are just marginally above the vendor price, making it not worthwhile to sell.
---
Meanwhile, I made an alt on Firemaw EU. Probably the most populated server in EU. I am absolutely floored by the AH. I managed to sell a moss agate for 1 gold, and that was even massively undercutting the competition. I got 2 course stones from RFC and sold them for like 20s each. Also stuff like linen cloth make a nice profit, whereas I would vendor it (or made into bandages) when leveling my main on the other server.
---
My question: Can it be expected that the prices for these kinds of lower level materials will increase in the future? Just walking around on Firemaw I feel it is massively flooded with mains who are now trying to level alts or just their new professions. Is it worth it to stockpile these kinds of materials now while their prices are low?
---
So healers don't get DK's in that system? nice. And I can buff you and give you my aura but I'm not actually damaging the civilian so I don't get DK's? nice.
---
It’s not that deep, and it makes you come off as a smug pedant. This is a random thread on the internet and people are joking and talking about a video game we all play. It’s not serious business. Hell, it’s possible it was a phone autocorrect or simple typo. Did it just ruin you’re day to see somebody use the wrong version of a word? Their fine, leave people alone.
---
Literally the same honour as 1v1ing someone once lol
---
I suppose Garrosh was correct in his actions then.
---
yea for sure, im just sayin they will ban over loot shit
---
hahahahaha! come here
---
Information as to how the PvP system works has been out for 15 years. Don't like it? Don't participate.  
---
Don't want a dk? Don't join a group where it can happen.
---
Time to pay extra attention to hunters then (I'm a hunter). Honour pinata!!
---
Just providing the link brother. It's all for content but Adertise is legit pissing these guys off.
---
The hatred for Asmongold started well before classic launched.
---
Swoopty on Rattlegore is a bad ass mofo, he may be a dwarf, but he helped me do an escort quest in P2 and I'm a 37 orc warrior. Mad props homie.
---
I've read in certain places 21/30/0 is better starting out. 31/20/0 becomes better for your group and raid once you have \~ 500+ healing, which you'll get once you're about pre-bis.
---
Oh shit feral Druid rolled on ur cloth chest wow
---
Yeah let me just leave work right now. Don’t be a dick, I was asking a simple question. You could have cut out everything before and after the actual material answer you provided, which is, “go do a grey quest.” Fuck off cheeky cunt.
---
&gt; 40v40 AV or 40v20 city raid was the peak numbers for Vanilla PvP.
---
Is this The “Jeff”?
---
I don't disagree, but i mean... if you don't use flasks for the final boss of the game, then what DO you use them for??
---
hope those where clean cunts, have you checked for any std?
---
I've never seen extremely egregious MC reserves, usually it's a couple of big ticket items or cores. And the reason people will join these runs if you aren't in a guild run your choices for MC are join another guilds pug runs and have a small chance at raid loot or don't do any MC run and have 0 chance at loot. The lack of Pug MC's will basically dictate how greedy guilds can be with pugs.
---
Just hit level 55, and with Phase 2 out now, I feel like spamming dungeons might be the best route to 60. Feels like the 50-60 zones are getting hit the hardest.
---
Any recommendations? I’m a bit overwhelmed by the options (Temple, BRD, Scholo, Strat, etc). Also, are there any must-do quests associated with any of those dungeons for a rogue?
---
Thank you. Oh, and how could I forget, a hearty ZUG ZUG to my fellow Horde!
---
I did not. I would imagine a custom addon to Details would be the easiest way to calculate this - even something advanced going along the lines of the remaining boss life divided by the average of the last 10 secs of raid dps (maybe even factoring in some execute multiplies, etc).
---
A dagger rogue is more likely to use gouge to recharge energy for another burst and blind as a way to jump back into stealth for another ambush open.   As for kidney shot or cheap shot they are mainly useful if you don't think you can quickly take out the target.
---
Or if they're determined they use Soul Stone and finish the job lol
---
If anyone actually typeS the word fool in any conversation you have... GTFO. U already know the type of person they are.
---
Come Zandalar where first day pvp was Azahara even, BRM ally 130 to 90 hordes, and tarren mill outnumbered by alliance as well. Now I think about, please don't, or roll an horde.
---
Then gank away, my friend.  Let them know that there is still one rogue with breath enough to fight.
---
Yea and I think that’s why I don’t like him. I watch streams to watch skilled players and he isn’t very skilled compared to others.
---
To be more technical we don't actually know what it is because it hasn't been tested and verified.  If they use the 1.12 reference the mention constantly it would be 10%.
---
I'll believe its 25% once someone does a test.  If they use the actual honor calculations from the patch the game client is stated to be running on its 10%.
---
They have stated they would be using the updated breakpoints for rank point assignments so I don't know why they would use one part of the patch but not the rest.
---
Is this a definition or an opinion addressed to people?
---
As the alliance reduces in size the people remaining will be the hardcore masochists that love being underdog. This happened to me in original WoW and it was some of the most fun ever. We'd guerrilla raid random horde zones, kill everything and everyone and then move on. 
---
It's going to take a lot more effort and initiative on your part than, say, the horde have to do to participate in a brainless zerg, but with the right mindset it can be really, really fun. 
---
If it's preventing PVE which to you is your core reason for playing, I honestly thing you'd be happier just playing on a pve server.
---
There’s no reason to spec full holy right now. Even average guilds who take 3-4 hours to clear mc should have pi specced priests for this raid tier.
---
Even below
---
Why are you posting on a post about someone posting a comment on a post where someone humble bragged?
---
Jk
---
Well, it is really too much to expect from Blizzard to figure out how to get some decent servers in 2019. And its completely out of the question Blizzard could have spent those 2 million they ninja'd on some decent servers. \s
---
Plus 31/20/0 will help you a lot with Lasher farming in DM:E with PI. FYI you'll want 6k+ mana before attempting to farm gold with lashers.
---
Its forbidden to sabotage players of your own faction. If you create two guilds, one alliance one horde, as buddies and meet to kill the enemy faction of each other, organized and everything, thats exactly the case ^^
---
If you're interested in pvp and out getting honour, you don't just sit in Southshore fields as 40 looking for people to walk into your blizzard - you roam epl/felwood/Winterspring and ungoro as a group of 3-5 killing individuals. You clear a spawn of horde and move to the next hotspot, then rotate out of the zone. You're rarely getting camped by a raid like this, you're not suffering from 'but horde just call their friends'. Your getting 50+ honour a kill instead of 1 and causing real problems to the horde.
---
based off what? Some words on the internet?
---
You are actually braindead you know that?
---
Damn where do you get all this insider information? I'm really curious as to how you are so familiar with both the technical implementation of Classic's servers as well as Blizzards financial plans. You sure you aren't breaking an NDA here? 
---
It.. it could not be that you're completely talking out of your ass right? I hope not..
---
It's funny because it's true!
---
Yup solo’d a lock in a 40 man got the full 199 feels Goodman
---
There is another alliance on DD that is infamous for reserving stuff in groups and ninja looting but for some reason people jokingly worship him. I doubt horde have had any interactions with him because I think he spends most of his time farming reserved epics.
---
Crushing blows hit for 150% damage.  Crits hit for 200% damage.
---
It's also possible to skip Devilsaur and go with Gauntlets of True Aim from LBRS. They are 4% hit (and a bit of crit) on one item against boss targets. With Mask of the Unforgiven from Strat live (2% more hit) it's easy to get to 9% with a mix of some of the other items (trinket, bracers, rings.)
---
Better option- make friends with a holy paladin. They'll give you heals and blessing of freedom, and you'll actually do damage. Teamwork!
---
Damn I already had my angry response typed before I read through this post.
---
From my experience, you're better off *early early* in the morning server time.
---
You’re absolutely correct. But people are upset that it’s not *better* than 2005. The people who are claiming it’s worse than 2005 are just plain wrong. 
---
The problem that the whiners cant wrap their heads around is that aoe attacks against 100 players are a massive drain on resources. Adding more and more aoe attacks on more and more targets grinds the game down to a halt.
---
This can’t be fixed without limiting the number of targets that can be hit with aoe, and you can bet all the ice mages would come complain if Blizz did that.
---
I'm not trying to argue with you if it's a good idea or will/won't solve the imbalance issue.  Simply just saying that being forced to sit in queue and/or transfer off the server feels punishing when it happens to you...
---
Yeah, I see so many horde players say that, yet I keep seeing groups of 10+ players corpse camping one or 2 dudes for sometimes half an hour. You guys would suck the 1-2 honor points out of his dead dick if it was possible.
---
Zug Zug my guy
---
That sucks, but at least you and almost every other class has decent solo farming capability, lol. I do what I gotta do and I didn’t force anyone to run with me, it was all voluntary. Haven’t done an orb run since I got my mount either.
---
I know right?  That's almost as bad as asking a bunch of strangers to come help you kill bosses so you can get the loot.  Why should strangers go to the effort of killing stuff so you can get loot when you could just form your own guild?
---
I played on a pvp server back in the day can confirm this happened a lot. If it's anything like it was before as soon as BG's are put into the game World pvp takes a turn for the worst. 
---
This time around I am on a pve server. It's sooooooooooo much better. World  pvp is fun for about the first year after that it just gets annoying.
---
Bubble + MC???
---
I've only played Holy on Retail, haven't had much of a rogue issue there. I mean... I'm usually at the back of the pack, so if I'm getting attacked, it means we're flanked and it's over, doesn't matter what class.
---
This should be the top comment on all of these threads.
---
Herod in a nutshell
---
&gt;I hope you're wrong
---
I hope I am wrong too.
---
It's what you signed up for. Best scaling in the game. Highest DPS. Best healbot buddy. Worst 1v1.
---
Does it work for you personally? All the information I've found says that focus frames are not available.
---
Yeah there has been a lot of world pvp happening since yesturday. Most people in my guild have hundreds of honor kills at this point. The difference is we can turn pvp off and go do a dungeon or a raid without worrying about getting ganked on the way there.
---
Pvp servers are super overrated.
---
I believe CensusPlusClassic gets around the restriction by triggering /who on camera movement (ie click and drag).  It takes some time to accumulate a full scan at peak hours because it's waiting on you to move the camera and the regular /who cooldown.
---
But here's the thing: unless the Classic team does a total 180 on this, cross-realm battlegrounds will be enabled right from the get-go. So its quite unlikely you'll see the same people unless you're grinding as much as a High Warlord.
---
Look on the auction house for what is selling.  Go farm that.  If the prices change, go farm something else.  
---
If you don't know what to look at on the AH, find every single classes pre-bis and find all the materials for that.  Farming gold is hard and most people don't understand it.  If you put in a lot of time into learning what to farm, you will get way more gold than you currently have.  By no means, if you think that is too much effort, you will have to come to terms with your current gold farming being the best you can get.  
---
Mining is a roulette, most of the times you get nothing, sometimes you get a crystal.
---
HAHA I know that mage
---
Seems like 10% to me, I got honor credit for a specific guy last night more than 3-4 times and the honor was still decent after that
---
I don't use the action button either.
---
I can’t believe so many people still don’t understand this.
---
I used to play on PvP servers, and corpse camping was pretty common. I can't put up with that shit anymore, having some epic open world PvP battles was a lot of fun, but I just can't put the same amount of time into the game and people can be huge dicks
---
How is that different than watching other human beings play football or basketball on television, when you could be playing those same sports yourself?
---
Cool. So... make basic invis effects  not show up in the combat log at all (maybe aside from vanish since that will be used WHILE fighting), and Spy is fine. Yes? No? Seems pretty cut and dry to me.
---
Ah thanks. I almost didn't get my daily dose of pedantry.
---
&gt; lowbie tank alt
---
Wait till you hit 60
---
Best you can do is prevent shouts with the silence.
---
I'd actually completely forgotten about the Heart of the Wild factoring in to make each point of stamina more valuable. Thanks for the reminder.

How do your examples demonstrate that?
---
If someone is reserving hunter helm and im a warlock? EZ lets go. If someone is reserving the helm of your class join another pug with a different reserve that doesn't clash with you.
---
Tanks reserving orbs? In no way influences your ability to get blue bop items. 
---
Just join the groups that reserve items you don't want, it's not rocket science. If a strath group is reserving the baron cloak it's basically a no reserve group to all casters/healers or people with the cloak. If they reserve the Gandling wand, join the fuck up as melee or healer - it's same as no reserves.

Maybe it's the 200 ms spell batching you're noticing? I play feral and people will usually still get 1 attack off after rooting due to spell batching.
---
&gt; . It comes down to utility and rational decision making, which you are not using. You are choosing to make an irrational choice, i.e. you are forgoing the utility of a given choice to make a choice that has less utility.

Jesus, it's embarrassing hearing you use this language and be so incorrect about it.

6-8g in repairs every dungeon? That means you're wiping a lot or are simply exaggerating the repair cost.
---
It’s legit marked as humor and it’s 100% true that everyone is gonna have a bad time leveling lol relax man go gank some kids and have fun
---
You horde them for BWL.
---
You still get a lot of prebis items from there so it's not time wasted.
---
/r/wow
---
:p
---
You know, bloodrage is an instant pummel rage generator thats off gcd...
---
Not hard if your tank is a good lvl. Only zul farak onwards is where more  wipes happen.
---
I agree to disagree.

Also, you lose argumentative credit when you curse.

Honestly, a fury warrior. Ik I'm 5 months late, but if you still don't really understand the classes and their abilities, fury warrior is the most similar to BFA Enh.
---
Enh is an offensive support with many offensive abilities in their rotation and utility to go with all that. 
---
You would not get that same playstyle playing enh in classic at all. It'd be boring as heck for you to play an auto attacking, totem throwing, 20 second CD windfury spec.
---
Assass rogue in classic is very similar to BFA assass. You're mainly using 2 attack abilities as a rogue in classic, though. Rogue in classic is very lacking in the offensive ability department because it has utility to control a fight with. Really, combat isn't much different. The playstyle may be a bit different, but the core of it is pretty similar to assass. Just switch backstab with sinister strike.
---
Fury warrior has several abilities to attack with, some mobility, not much utility in a group fight aside from intimidating shout. Melee in classic aren't super mobile spellswords, unless you want to play a paladin, but that's auto attacking defensive support, and you don't want that.
---
Now that P2 hit, leveling is basically impossible as an alliance high 50 on Fairbanks since our A:H ratio is ridiculous unbalanced. What dungeons would a 57 mage be invited to? Really tired of BRD.
---
Tanks are harder find than Healers, sorry to burst your bubble. I duo a tank/healer anyways so I reserve shit fairly often and have 0 trouble filling.
---
Spellbatching and melee leeway, necessary evils to recreate the laggy vanilla gameplay experience since we don't have dial up anymore. Also fuck nochanges.
---
Where can I possibly quest without getting absolutely steam rolled. 35 alliance
---
Does defense really have DR? I always thought the only DR it really had is at thresholds, like when you hit 460 defense or something you can no longer take crushing blows from 63s, and so more is useless, but below that it's basically a linear improvement.
---
And besides, if it did have DR, that would actually be a boon in this case - so little druid gear has defense that DR would suggest getting a little bit is worth it, while getting a lot isn't.
---
Armor certainly has DR, I won't argue with you there. But just with the Dire Bear form armor bonus, it seems like it makes high armor items that much more valuable.
---
Why Rogues Dont Struggle in PVP and why you should have just rolled a rogue otherwise this entire massive wall of text does not apply to you because you cant stealth or get out of jail like rogues can.

Those old hamsters are doing their best, okay? They're not young and spry anymore. Their wheels are rusting.
---
I don't think it's appropriate to penalize Horde retroactively like that but faction-specific queues or sign ups should have been implemented from the start. 
---
That said, the complete absurdity of yesterday mostly destroyed my interest in playing Classic and, if they did introduce balance, I'd be quietly thankful and reinvigorated.
---
Yeah that's true, it really comes down to who gets the jump on who from what I've experienced.
---
well 10% tidi is better then the blackscreens from before that. althou you can have fight op to 500-1000 without tidi. dont play wow but i hope blizzard tries to fix this shit for u guys
---
Fair enough, its n\^2.
---
Yeah I agree. I was thinking mostly in terms of BiS for mitigation.

OP I have no idea how many of these dudes got wooshed on your post about this shit so hard lol 
---
Respect to you for wanting To quest and explore the world. 
---
Just gonna have a rough ass time doing it buddy but once you’re 60 it’s game on!!
---
It really is complicated haha. A ton of misinformation constantly being spread around too.
---
It also doesn’t help that:
---
1. Most people didn’t understand it back then
---
2. It was adjusted during vanilla
---
3. It was gone when tbc launched
---
4. Old sources explain it in different ways using different terminology so now everyone is confused

I would say the mount system presented in game is incorrect. but they were like, "vanilla was mostly paying a large amount for the mount and a small amount for the skill, so we are going to screw players that want to have multiple mounts and make them pay ass loads of gold.  Even though the other way would be true to 1.12"
---
I'm glad someone said this. There's so much said about MC being easily pugged.. but it's only true when a guild has 20 people that know the fights and pug the gaps.

Guy is a absolute cockwomble. Arrogant, self righteous prick who thinks he's gods gift at the game and people should bow down to him because some sheep think he's funny and encourage him to be even more of a cockwomble.

The only point I was trying to make was that the Crystal Adorned Crown is not bis for all healers for all of Classic. There are better items, specifically for holy paladins. Whether your guild/group would allow you to roll on those items is a different discussion.

Not saying the helm is bad by any means. I would totally roll on it since it's way better than what I have now.

I asked for you to throw me a bone because, like I said, I’m at work. Me asking for you to provide some info that backs up your statement of it being a 10% rep gain isn’t a cheeky cunt move, is it a cheeky cunt move to ask for sources in a scientific paper? Is it a cheeky cunt move for someone to bring in some information to another person and ask them to cite a source (even the smallest bit of information) to put my doubts to rest when I’m NOT ABLE to do it myself right now? 
---
Had the OP asked me to show him something to prove that he/she would get full rep gain, I would’ve responded with, “well it just from my memory so I could also be wrong” instead of “fuck you I don’t have time for that go check it yourself.” You were a dick, don’t pretend like you weren’t and don’t pretend like me asking you for some additional information to back you up was a dick move, either. Stop being a cheeky cunt, that’s all you gotta do.

not every class has every tool, its about synergistic combinations here in classic

"It's how it is"
---
Great answer.
---
I mean I guess, you do you...
---
Why is it not worth pursuing?
---
do you know why they could do that?
---
Prioritize hit until cap. It's not fun missing a shield slam or that first sunder after pull. Hit cap will make your threat way more consistent.
---
As others have stated for pre-bis, get some defense but no need to shoot for cap. In purples you'll get a lot of mitigation just passively, which let's you prioritize more threat items.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that you really only need to generate 1 more threat per second than your highest DPS to hold aggro. If you're already getting a huge lead on your TPS, you might as well gear more mitigation to save healers a bit of mana.
---
Specifically with Strat Live, there's *very little* there of value for tanks. It's basically a caster dungeon, with an occasional rogue/hunter looking for Mask of the Unforgiven. Tanks getting orbs means that tanks are running it.
---
lol, healers want truefaith pattern, dps wars want bracers off timmy and casters want the hit neck off the last boss. There's shit there for almost everyone except tanks but keep living in your dream world where no one needs gear from strat and healers are as sought after as tanks.
---
Depends on what you are farming.  Sometimes, Locks are needed for eye pulls, other times (like Gor'shak spam), it's better to have all mages.
---
Quality shitpost, 11/10

Did you know that Blizzard sold the old serveres they had in storage as collectables?
---
Asmon a few weeks ago: "We rule this server", "The horde won't be able to raid or farm without our permission".
---
After p2 launched:  [https://twitter.com/Asmongold/status/1195174191760363520](https://twitter.com/Asmongold/status/1195174191760363520) 
---
&gt; I think if Blizzard wants to emphasize better Horde:Alliance balance on PvP servers, they should make the queues for the less populated faction faster  Thoughts?  Seems like Alliance is heavily outnumbered on nearly every server
---
Can't say I experienced many server crashes on sargeras or Bloodscalp.
---
Feasibly you could do any endgame dungeon at 57.  Any.  Just up to the group whether they want to bring you or not.
---
Well for pvp, you have to have tactical mastery. If you really want to pvp as fury then probably a normally fury tree into arms with tact mastery/impale. 
---
It’s not worth it to pvp as fury tho, only for certain duels in 1v1s and such. Arms outperforms much better with mortal strike / needing much less hit gear so your not stacking hit as if like PVE
---
Dishonorable kills results in less honor, how it does it, wasn't the point.
---
🦀Asmongold is dead🦀
---
[This version specifically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipaw1OUyJCw)
---
1.	Somebody else already answered this, but the actual speed does not matter. You want to use the weapon that does the highest top end damage.
---
Taunt forces the mob to attack you and puts you at the top of the threat table.
---
Hahah yes! this is what I was going for. Cheers mate
---
Right. Point is still the same, you lose honor when it calculates at the end of the week.
---
It basically means over like 25 years old now to kids .. and means its actual meaning to everyone else
---
Yeah I'm sitting at 55 can't quest, and can't find dungeons, so I rolled on a RP server. I like to RP, and I can chose to get ganked or not by flagging for pvp. Pve servers still do pvp aswell, so if I want to pvp I can get my fix.
---
I'm going to take a break from my pvp toon untill phase 2 dies down a bit.  Good luck man.

Hence flight being a misquote.

if you are using 2 weapons then you will miss about 24% on white attacks

I believe lbrs gives the best xp but Brd has a ton of loot and a full clear can give a ton of xp. I wouldn't worry about ST as groups dont generally run this as often. Scholo and strat are gonna be tough finding a group being sub 58. If you google quests by dungeon you'll find a good list of quests you'll wanna pick up.

I hit the desolace one as alliance right after I made the run from Ashenvale. With a heavy heart, I deleted my hearthstone and used unstuck to kill me (uses hearthstone first if off cd) and spirit ran back to get the flight path after

You're still just arbitrarily abstracting away one part while ignoring that the other part is viewed in an identical manner. Just like the user doesn't care about the infrastructure, the user doesn't care how good your code base is, nor how well it performs. The user sees neither your hardware nor your software. All it sees is the end result that is displayed on the screen. And whether that screen is displaying something the user doesn't like because of software or hardware, the user still does not care. He just wants you to fix it by whatever means necessary. And I've seen plenty of companies that decide to fix performance issues via hardware rather than software, since programmers are expensive and delaying other features is unwanted.
---
You can literally see it in this thread. People don't care whether the problem is that Blizzard cheaped out on server tech, or whether they just have shitty programmers and need to improve performance. Software does not stand on a pedestal above hardware.
---
&gt; Faction specific queues are really needed.
---
This is such a strange, sudden request these past few days. Have they ever even implemented this as a system? Why are people asking for it in Classic of all things?
---
Precisely!
---
If you're not into PvP/BGs, sure, I totally understand why you'd care more about a bag space than min/maxing globals.

"Best in slot" doesn't mean there is always 1 item that is far and away the best. There can be a few items that are close enough. And given how rare raid loot is in Classic, if someone wins one of those items you wouldn't let them get another. 
---
For practical purposes, Crystal Adorned Crown is best in slot for all healers for the life of the game. You will never replace it if you get it.

Don't need to. I'm factually correct. Stop splitting hairs Mr. WellAktually guy.
---
Anyone who thinks this is going to ruin his career is pretty naive of twitch culture tbh. If anything this is only going to help him with exposure. I don't think he cares about his Method partnership that much either, it was just something he thought was cool that happened.
---
Blizzard also can't really do anything about it because it was ML and he was the ML. 
---
With all that said Jokerd is an absolute loser and a joke of a streamer and I hope he does get some kind of repercussion from this but I just highly doubt it.
---
Pretty sad that you dug back to find this
---
I plan to play this spec in pvp while I heal my friends. The chance that blackout will stun a rogue who opens on you is completely worth the 5 points
---
It's the weirdest thing. These pirated server players don't like retail, but they exploit the every living shit out of classic. Anything they can do to cut a corner, they do it. You would think they would be happier playing retail for welfare epics, but they don't.
---
I think what it really comes down to is they just want that unfair advantage. They want the unfair advantage they get from exploiting the game. They think that makes them more clever, and deserving of that advantage.
---
Long story short, they're just bad people. Entitled assholes that you should avoid like the plague.
---
Enemies below lvl 60 give less honor, they arent fantasy kills. The fantasy kills are the really bad lvl 60s that you can kill solo.

Now we have come to an understandig. It sure would be nice, if they would do that. But they certainly don't have to, just because we pay them 15 dollars a month. We aren't entiteld to that, it is their property. Only thing we are entiteld to is to decide if we want to play the game or not.

Is it possible now to level 50-60 playing 11pm - 3am on high population realm? Just how much slower would it be compared to doing it before P2?
---
It's just the same person.
---
Yeah, that's why you always see them spamming... Because it takes a long time for them to find people. 
---
Also many of these people reserve BoEs and other vendorables, meaning they will by definition get less traction from people who don't want to be mugged off. The math adds up perfectly, buddy.

Right, because guilds help their dps run shit all the time...  Oh wait, that basically never happens.
---
If the server transfers were open for you originally then it’s your fault for not taking it. Toughen up or reroll
---
You are just making an excuse for their douchebaggery.  The fact they can get away with it doesn't make it okay.
---
StaySafe..I just lost a lot of respect for you...
---
Really, I feel like it'd be all from that huge crit bonus from Elemental Fury

Yet you offer no explanation, no expansion or counter-points to what I am say. You guys are so fucking triggered it’s hilarious. 
---
The core of my statement “not joining a group because something that doesn’t effect my class/roll is on reserve is irrational” is a undeniable fact. And it is contrast to some of your moral beliefs about what type of groups you should join, so you are freaking out.
---
Yea I believe so it happened to me when I logged out while flying to TB and ask a friend and he knew about the issue. I sorta remember it happening back in vanilla too. I’m guessing it’s something they can’t fix without a ton of work and it doesn’t happen that often.
---
I heard bench pressing school buses are bad for you lungs...

I may be the only person out of the loop here, but in case there is another... From googling and the context of this thread, apparently the dead character, Asmon, is a popular streamer. I wasn't able to tell on which realm. [Here's his channel](https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold), but his info only mentions his retail guild/realm.
---
Not sure if this helps but honor gets tallied once per week on reset day (tuesdays in US)
---
Unfortunately there is no x/x/~31 build that could work. Trust me, i’ve tried and looked into it a lot. In order to make any sham tree work properly you need to invest in it. Elemental? 30 points. Enh? 31. Proper resto i’d say is 37/39.
---
Shaman seems to be an “all or nothing” hybrid, which is a bit meh imo.
---
It’s really not, but you can bet your ass he’s still upset about, even if he decides to act like he doesn’t give a shit.

When you get more practice at it, your pet shouldn't ever die.
---
&gt;	The lack of Pug MC’s will basically dictate how greedy guilds can be with pugs.
---
Which is why I love Mankrik. My guild runs MC on days that I raid in retail, so pugging is my only option. Mankrik pugs are organized by a handful of people, but they are so detailed and planned (discord, sign-ups for raid dates and slots, etc) that the weekly pug group I go with had downed Rag earlier than many guilds on our server. 
---
I feel our server is spoiled by how well thought out and organized our pug groups are.
---
if you remove asmon's name, and change yours to a different color, it looks like cool album art
---
Unless you're horde and rolling with a big 2h fury build. Considering how hard it is to get hit gear, it's pretty viable right now.
---
You bet your ass I'd act like any kind of idiot my audience wants me to be if I was making the kind of money he makes. That's showbiz.
---
As an exclusive PvP server person since vanilla, I started on PvP servers but just realized they're not what they once were.
---
There's no honor (no pun intended) in wpvp anymore.  Griefing is seen as "fun"(wtf?), even for hour and hours on end.  So many tryhards, neckbeards, and twitch wannabes wanting notoriety and not to mention the actual streamers who have a swarm of cult followers with them everywhere like a swarm of insects.
---
I think it's less we don't like wpvp, I love it and hopped into wpvp first thing yesterday with two raids going at it even on my PvE server and it was amazing, and more it's not the same semi-reslectful wpvp it once was.
---
That being said, after 3 pvp servers and 4 level 40ish chars that I've now abandoned, I'm having a blast on Windseeker as horde.  World defense is lit up with towns being attacked and wpvp is available whenever you want it.
---
BGs, arena, and no more world bosses were the solution they came up for this
---
they never solved this issue properly.
---
Why are you asking people here? We're not Blizzard.
---
Whatever you do, don't search for all the racism and homophobic antics that went on in his Discord.....
---
This ignores the fact that drops are random and almost every tank out there is gonna end up with Def gear before they get hit gear just as a byproduct of RNG.
---
So yeah, Def is good to build if you dont have a hit cap item available but you should be farming items for hit cap.
---
if you wanna go dagger do it, Barman shanker + Distracting dagger get 6 piece shadowcraft and you will top dps in every raid pug and perhaps also in your guild runs you really dont need the epic daggers, and it is a lot easier to get the bis blue daggers than swords
---
PVP happened on a PVP server. These are the same sentiments expressed back then. Every one of you knew what you signed up for.
---
You had me laughing out loud in Subway.
---
We have a lack of rogues and shamans. We have 3 rogues and 2 shammys. 7 or 8 mages, lot of warriors and locks and priests haha. And BOE wrist and belt from MC only dropped for rogues and shammys. Last time we had like priests, 1 warr and a dudu I think. But still shitty loot. A lot of bosses dropped that mail healing helm 2 times we raided. Multippe items. It was horrible.
---
it's also a different experience from vanilla so don't feel too bad.  vanilla servers weren't as populated and afaik none were as lopsided as we've seen in classic
---
I love it when the air force rolls in. reminds me of Warlords preflying. good times. nothing greater than seeing a squadron flying into the flight master.
---
Why would I organize and form my own group, tank it, and then invite other people in who can take the ONE thing that I'm even there for to begin with? If I'm farming arena runs for a savage gladiator chest, and I know it can take me something like 600 runs to get it, why would I invite some random in to take it?
---
Exactly. You can walk through Mara picking herbs and make more than one orb in an hour easily.... I'd rather watch YouTube videos and do an easy farm than stress out trying to carry some dumbass arcane blast spamming level 59 mage dieing on every pull, and I'll make more gold.
---
lol because i told him go back to retail?? wtf yall crazy
---
Update: I installed the spy addon and changed my almost pure resto spec with the tips I got. I even tanked a dungeon again today and with 2 sets of gear and this spec it’s still possible. (I’ll change it again when the raiding starts) 
---
I Fokus on dungeon grinding now and try to avoid the worst areas. 
---
I also stick to groups when going to a dungeon. You can get wiped, but people tend to think before attacking a group more than a single person. 
---
I got a level up today and I’ll continue the grind while hoping that the hype will slowly die out.
---
Generally, which poisons should I be using? Mostly just keeping with instant poison on both hands since fights dont really last long enough for deadly. I keep crippling in bags for dungeons with lots of runners.
---
Should I bring deadly as well for boss fights or is instant okay
---
They should give you the ingots the arcanite bars are pretty much on you, it's not a thunderfury, it's not going to help the guild/raid out in any significant way so if you want it you gotta work for it yourself.
---
Why?  I don't personally do it but I can understand the reasoning behind encouraging it.
---
Speeding up clears and more importantly ensuring clears is a worthy goal
---
Okay buddy

What’s your spec?

I hate to be that nerd, but... Hamsters only live like 3 years max...

Slap like NOW (do it)  
---
Leg reveal at 12 million subs.

I think when a server is 80:20 Horde favored it stops being "just a little unfair" and goes to being literally unplayable.
---
Maybe top 5 dps in ubrs. No ele shaman is topping charts in any raid... period... unless you’re playing with bads
---
The zergfest in Tarren Mill right now - are the horde and alliance actually trying to win a war or are they just essentially honor farming each other? they just go back and forth all day.

Make yourself a team of up to 5 players. Roam around the world and find targets. Hopefully they will bring friends
---
I have not tried it, but Perl works for me fine. I'll try /focus when I play to see if it works.
---
Yes it is extremely possible. People are vastly over estimating how bad honor will be. You will get ganked prolly 50-100% more then you did before it in no way will make leveling impossible.
---
Yep. If you can't play in the world might as well do it break up the monotony
---
Azuregos killed today for a 2nd time on judgement EU after 24 hours. Wtf

What do you mean? Being killed as soon as I land at a flight point and spawn camped is the most fun I've had since launch! /s
---
According to wow wiki, ony’s mom, lady sinestra, actually outlived both of her children.
---
you can easily heal all dungeon content as shadow. just heal the dungeons and collect your heal gear. maybe try to avoid inviting locks so that you can also pick up "offspec" shadow gear
---
So would rather have an actual job
---
Yes using just about any ability or item will break invis.
---
Great idea man
---
On NA servers in retail Ragnaros is like 90% Brazilian/Latin American.

You can always take the effort to make your own group

---

---
At 57 you can do any instance in the game, people will be less likely to invite you over a 60 but you definitely can do any dungeon.
---
That's fair, I see your point. I rolled a deep-prot warrior, so I definitely have it a lot easier than most on the underpopulated realms since tanks are in such a high demand. Even on one of the lowest pop realms (Arcanite Reaper) I get 2-3 whispers every hour or so about someone needing a tank. I also don't plan on doing a ton of raiding endgame unless it's a casual pug, so I fit that stereotype. Also, I had not considered the issues of them adding transfers to a dead server, I give you that... I'm probably stuck on this realm for the long haul. Good thing I enjoy leveling.
---
I guess a better way to make my point is; high-pop isn't the best opportunity for everyone. I find a lot more benefit to being on Arcanite Reaper than I ever did when I was Whitemane.
---
i dont remember it being like this, nor do i remember so many pugs.  the overpopulated servers basically make everything like LFG except the UI is text based.  end game feels more like a pserver then vanilla.

Call my crazy but "no changes" would be to leave the game alone and let us enjoy the benefits of a faster internet. Instead of trying to mimic the original game, they've made a change just to try and mimic the crappy internet speeds of yesteryear.

Seems quite the opposite of "no changes".

Everyone needs 1-2 items for their pre-raid bis.   You are not special.

He was clearly joking when he said that first part, and he’s objectively right about the second part. Every estimate for PVP server populations has alliance outnumbered 10-40%.

I get that he can be entertaining at times but I dont like him as a person. Someone donated to him once and I think he was in the middle of acknowledging it until something else grabbed his attention and he basically told the donator he doesnt care. I think he did the same thing except he just told someone to F off. I only rarely check out his streams, the last time I did someone gave him a link to a sea of thieves halloween update or something which ended up turning into him ranting in 5 minutes.
---
If you came up with that solution why you still complaining about it, obviously you havent.
---
That’s nice to hear. It’s amazing to me that there are people that can’t distinguish a streaming persona from the real person. Like watch the clip of him stomping around his room after he got disconnected when Classic released. No one really acts like that, but it was hilarious to watch.

Always want to use overpower and execute when its up but if want to keep down time between mobs then don’t execute to save rage for next pull  but I always execute. Overpower has and insane Crit with the talents for it so if you have more than 25 rage use whirlwind or MS then change to battle stance and over power. Here is what I’ve found out.
---
Begin in battle stance
---
- charge
---
-battle shout if not active
---
Change to berserker stance
---
-blood rage if available
---
-berserk if available 
---
-always overpower or execute when its up, overpower requires change to battle stance and go back to berserker stance as soon as you use OP stance dance gives you max DPS and negates the %10 damage increase on you
---
-surrender armor x2 with increase your damage output more than HS
---
-MS
---
-whirlwind
---
That’s basically the priority order you can use hamstring on mobs that run typically I kill them before they have a chance to get anywhere but if they are higher level than me I do it between MS and whirlwind.
---
I’ve read a lot of guides and this was the best DPS output I’ve had. Make sure battle shout is always active as I’ve seen too many warriors not use it while leveling and it’s a big mistake to forget about it. Learn to stance   Dance before you start raids it makes a big difference in DPS and doesn’t matter if your fury or arms you’ll still have the OP talent or should.
---
Not killing enough mobs. But honestly probably nothing some classes level fast others don't, you may afk a lot in major cities, spend to much time looking for dungeon groups etc.
---
Love when people tell me to go back to retail when I haven't played retail since TBC.  Such a deep and hurtful insult.  The ok boomer one is funny too since I doubt anyone playing this game is a boomer.
---
So the guy rushed to 60 and he’s only just now acquiring a pedestrian raid weapon... lmao
---
Just use the RFD one till mirah’s bruv
---
I don't have internet access at the moment
---
&gt;I have a lowbie tank alt and I have a hard time finding groups
---
&gt;bc everyone now is high level
---
Problem and solution in the same sentence. Just level through questing and get as many dungeon runs as possible (as long as they provide a good amount of XP).
---
Once you're 60, you'll understand how awesome it is to be a tank.
---
I'd advise seeking a leveling guild with a ton of members  (500+ with at least 60% active ones). Those ease the pain of looking for groups.
---
You can gain 2 ranks per week. 1 DK is equal to about 0.83% of a rank so 3 will essentially erase your weeks Honour. GL and God bless.
---
We had something free that worked perfectly, now we have to pay $15 to experience it at a much lower quality than should be expected.
---
Thanks, I know you can turn parts off, but TSM is a bit expansive. I found [BankItems Classic](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25399-BankItemsClassic.html), which seems to meet all my needs.
---
You don't know what your talking about... Spirit is very useful for a warlock leveling up thanks to imp drain soul. At 60 it's a garbage stat but good for leveling
---
They're supposed to spawn once every 5 to 7 days (120-168 hours) from when they were last killed.  
---
That's messed up.
---
&gt;Mirahs song 
---
I can't get that at lvl 45 lol
---
more OP racials so they have a 60-40 advantage on alliance on almost every pvp server
---
I was literally questing in Hilsbrad away from everyone and had huge delays on using abilities. It’s absolutely absurd how bad it is.
---
i guess we'll get a hotfix next week for this, was also bugged in beta
---
Honestly what really needs to happen is all you reservation whiners need to shut the fuck up and let other people play the game how they want and boycott any groups that reserve stuff for your stupid ass misguided principles.
---
 Might take 6 days to get there at this point.
---
Glad to share :)
---
Spirit tap is mandatory
---
Okay then what is the problem. You can run your own groups and let others reserve what they want and put them on ignore.
---
Yikes

hey bro we pay blizzard a fuck ton of money every month to do this for us, dont come here strawmanning about hardware or ”if its so easy do it yourself” type shit. i can be entitled and expect some effort on their side because blizzard takes an absurd amount of money to play their game compared to any other one on the market.
---
Youre not doing anything wrong unfortunately.
---
&gt;	You don't need a healer or dps to help you out? 
---
Did I say that? I don’t remember saying that. 
---
&gt;	Why are you running a dungeon you wouldn't want anyway
---
Because some random whispered me asking me to run a dungeon I have no reason to run.
---
Are you under the impression that you’re responding to the guy that initially said that?
---
Has reserving gear gone too far? Absolutely. But the source of it makes complete sense. 
---
Primarily reserving orbs to tanks in Strat Live side. 
---
Tanks struggle to farm anything. Mages by contrast can farm gold at 10x the rate or more no problem. This leaves tanks needing gold. Strat live is a caster instance. No reason to tank it. Welp, magically we formed the idea that tanks can be bribed to come for orbs. It gives tanks a way to actually compete on gold w/ casters, and a way for casters to actually get tanks. 
---
There is nothing wrong w/ that. Supply and demand. Dont like it, dont join. But is it stupid we see casters reserving shit and raids w/ only 5 guild ppl reserving ony head? Absolutely. **DO NOT JOIN THOSE RAIDS**
---
simple
---
warriors will always get their orbs, but if ppl are smart those shitty 5 man onyxias looking for pugs will never form.

Also randy explicitly calls himself a human hunter while wearing all the default human warrior equipment, including the sword and shield.
---
One thing that a lot of warriors get wrong is wanting to be the guild's raid MT straight off the bat. That doesn't happen usually.

You get in as an OT, then slowly get gear drip-fed to you while building your reputation in the guild. Tank shit for them, engage with them, don't be an absent member even if you attend all raids.

I heard from a guildie that Firemaw was prett balanced, 55/45ish or so. Don’t know where they got that from, though.
---
Try to go early in the morning if you have the time.
---
Do you realise that horde will have bigger queue. And what can they do while waiting in queue? Go out and gank more alliance to get a bit more honor.
---
*blinds player*
---
“I DIDNT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO DIE!”
---
Thank you for this.  How appropriate is it that allies can say boomer and horde can say zoomer?  It almost seems to perfect to be an accident.
---
how much honor do you give? 12? I killed 7 hunters yesterday that gave 150+... Id prefer to go after the level 59/60 hunters. you are not the fantasy kill.
---
The level 60 botters or china gold farmers are
---
My god you are fucking dense
---
So apparently it shouldn't affect week one since we are all rank 0
---
If it does though I'm definitely coming back to QQ
---
eyeroll
---
I don't like dbags taking advantage of others.
---
Gotta hand it to him. He was fastest to 60 and fastest to get dropped by his sponsor.
---
Me too!
---
So i was using the “Master Hunters Bow” and found the “Needle Threader” Just now. The attackspeed, BASE DAMAGE, DPS is all stronger on the “Needle Threader” But when I use it, on the character sheet I do less damage, and when I attack the same monster, my hit markers are doing less damage too. No one has been able to explain the reason for this… Why is this the case? Are all bows inaccurate on damage?
---
Why would you need to send a hidden combat log? What's the purpose of that?
---
I'm aware it might be more stress who knows, that's no fuckign excuse to not fixing pvp
---
according to a different post i saw, 8 weapon skill is about 3.4% extra hit, so you’d wanna go with trueaim to get closer to the 9% hit cap
---
We asked for no changes
---
Perl works for me too but the focus frame part does not.
---
The mount on reserve get out of here
---
So the organization Method is not related to Classic WoW?
---
More than likely this healer probably sucks too but think they are top shit so they deserve the orbs.
---
I'd really love to have seen the thought and design process behind creating the honor system. With how complicated it is, it was almost surely designed in reverse. 
---
I'm guessing they started with "we want the max rank to represent the players scoring the most on their server over the past &lt;x&gt; time periods".
---
Same happened for me in wetlands
---
How? Furor is 10, wolfshead is 5 iirc. Am I missing something?
---
Did not how notice this you?
---
Math checks out to me. The bow on the right is faster.
---
nope
---
Just wait till we get the instant BG pops and horde have 1 hr queues.
---
&gt;	You don't need a healer or dps to help you out?
---
&gt;	Every person that puts rightful effort and time into the dungeon or raid deserves his or her need roll, that's it.
---
That’s now how a free market works. Think of tank/DPS/healing roles as products. Tanks are in low demand (1/5) but even lower supply so that drives the cost of getting a tank up. Either in time spent spamming LFG or in incentivizing them to run, usually in the form of reserving something for them or flat out gold. 
---
Because some random whispered me asking me to run it.
---
no deadly on raid bosses though because it eats a debuff slot
---
Who is taking advantage of anyone? Just ignore all the people who want reserved instance. Then they won’t find people. And others can make their own group without reserve.
---
More poeple more spawns?
---
If you want this bullshit to stop, then we as a community need to do it.   We need to go into these runs, and roll need on the items that are "reserved".
---
Wouldn't people just start eventually camping that area as more people learn about it?
---
Awesome, thank you -- I've yet to raid on my rogue
---
"Farming DME lashers is too hard as priests! Cant afford orbs" :(
---
You are thinking of mocking blow, the 2 min warrior cooldown
---
Straight up super glue works just fine :) since this will be a permanent mod i dont mind it but you could model in mounts for screws :)
---
Your post is not
---
yes rend is for mobs typically 2+ levels higher than you. Zerker rage comes after because you want to start ww's cd asap and there is a stun from your charge where you are basically getting nothing from it.  
---
Thunder clap and demo shout are also for higher level mobs, basically if youre finding that the mob isnt dying within 2 wws and 1 ms 1 execute thats when you start playing around with your abilities to get an optimal kill. Like if you find yourself taking a lot of damage and having more downtime, demo and thunderclap might be necessary. But depending on the mob, you might just need 3-5 sunders to get more damage in.
---
Ah I'm sorry. I didn't know your lvl45. Tranquility Blade from the razorfen downs quest will be your best bet then
---
One of the worst parts about being a fat nolifer is when you order takeout and the delivery dude shows up with three pizzas, 3L of soda and realizes you're just sitting in your apartment alone in the dark.
---
Streaming a video game is literally his job. He sits in front of a camera for hours at a time, and plays a game. His fans pretend that he’s also acting out a role. So do you just like assholes or people who pretend to be assholes?
---
Need that to get that chiseled chest of a Greek god somehow lol
---
What does the S on DPS stand for?
---
There's your answer
---
Good. Fuck rat-man.
---
Improved Enrage.
---
I hope your finger is sore from teabagging that meth-head-looking filth.
---
Defense doesn't affect crushing blows after 300.
---
Attack power increases your damage per second. On a slower weapon the increase is proportionally higher per attack
---
FYI invisibility is different than stealth. Paranoia from the fel hunter gives stealth detection tho.
---
Probably because retail has systems that diminish the importance of balanced server factions, whereas classic has no such mechanisms and the main PvP content available right now is contingent on balanced factions.
---
This has been discussed a lot on the rogue subreddit. 30/21/0 simmer the most in the calculations. The spec is pretty straight forward, make sure to pick up imp. Evis.
---
Current calculations say that SF will never outperform combat daggers, but it does become viable when you have AQ40 gear. Until then you’ll lose a substantial amount of dps.
---
Nice. Stats was kinda fun to learn about. I've forgotten most though.
---
Don't you think it's more likely that your personal 20 runs, and a few other players you've heard complain about bad luck, is just bad luck, and the drop rate isn't changing constantly? 
---
You're hearing about extreme cases because those cases people are more vocal. "I ran Mara 50 times and didn't see the ring once!'. No one is going to announce  "I ran Mara 3 times and saw the ring once" because it's a very average experience.  So you're going to hear the more extreme cases more often
---
Ah.
---
Except horde has always historically been known as the edgy teenager faction, so it would actually be more fitting of stereotype in reverse?
---
While leveling you'll be expected to heal or tank. Even if you're not specced for one specifically.
---
At max level, your default expectation is to heal. You'll get geared super fast if you get into a raiding guild (because there won't be many druids).
---
Tanking will be a second option, but you have to do a ton more work to get gear that will convince your guild to let you tank.
---
DPS druids are weak and require even more work to pull off any good DPS at all. Don't put yourself through that.
---
any proof?
---
Im conflicted about asmon, ive seen a bunch of his clips and depending on the matter at hand his opinion warrants some thought. He has been playing for ages and has considerable (not infinite) knowledge of the game and the way its mechanics works. However, on other matters hes very sketchy. I mean that in the sort of way where he'll take a stance on something and flip flop depending on whether it benefits him or not and he does let the fact that hes a big streamer go to his head a little bit as well from what ive seen. But at the end of the day its just a game, i enjoy seeing him kill and be killed. A+ work bringing down the guy, im sure his army will not like you though.
---
JokerD has had a character in power for like a month now.
---
That's what I am led to believe from forum posts regarding this too, but the calculator on Wowhead is showing lower miss chance for the GS gloves than for the Trueaims, so its confusing me a bit. *shrug*
---
DEFINITELY worth crafting, its bis top end and orc racial
---
I'm glad its good for someone because it sure isn't for me. 
---
Cancelled my sub tonight can't even play the game over an hour of being ganked and mind-controlled back and ganked and mind-controlled back before just giving up. I'm sure as a stealth-er it is merely annoying but as anything else its just entirely game breaking. 
---
When I started my realm was roughly 50/50 and it slowly tipped a little to about 60/40 and then they allowed free transfers surprise surprise the underdog faction just abandons ship like rats now it 85/15 on a full server its just pointless even trying to play.
---
One would think how the most famous WoW org is treating players would be of interest to the WoW community, even though it's about players from another game in this case.
---
Bald headed trash. I want to see what his blood work is like, all he eats his fast food and soda
---
You used to be able to frost nova and start casting polymorph.
---
If the druid got caught mid-shift in humanoid form it was stuck in polymorph.
---
No idea if it works like that anymore.
---
"rErOlL tO a PvE sErVeR"
---
Why do people have such a problem when anyone makes a joke about how it's gonna be rough leveling in phase 2...
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
We're all winners here.
---
As opposed to thousands of people who find the game unplayable because they spend 30mins of 2min rez timers to get anywhere or do anything.... seems like the lesser of two evils if you ask me.
---
I haven’t dared go, 54 hunter... bigglesworth
---
Did it work perfectly the entire time? Or were there just not 100v100 groups pvping in phase 1? Cmon dude
---
Was there a hard server reset? 
---
If my memory is correct, the 5-7 day respawn timer gets reset and voided if the server is restarted.
---
That's just over an hour a day, think about how much time people spend playing call of duty.
---
I would rather not gank my opposing faction into not playing anymore, but since I want to rank and Blizzard is refusing to release BGs in favor of this stupid shit, I have no choice but to camp them into the dirt.
---
This is what im trying to figure out by my post lol. it deals about 22 flat damage more than the blue one still i dont know why. no one can explain me why it is
---
As a Holy Paladin/healer main, I've always wondered about how effective critical strike chance for spells is for Paladins. It seems like it weights with itself when considering sustained health restored over time. Consider some shitty napkin math:
---
For easy numbers, let's assume a Healing Paladin has 1000 mana, casts a healing spell that costs 10 mana with a cast time of 1 second. If they cast non stop, they'll be able to cast 100 times (1000mana/10mana cost  = 100) and will be OOM after 100 seconds.  
---
If you had 1% spell crit:
---
1000 total mana
---
100 casts, 10mana per cast, 1 second per cast, after 100 casts, 1 cast/10 mana refunded, room to cast 1 more spell, so 101 seconds until oom.  
---
If you had 10% crit chance:
---
100 casts, 10% mana left (10casts /100mana refunded)
---
Room for 10 more casts, 1 of which will crit, which means you should be able to cast 111 spells total = 111 seconds until OOM
---
if you had 50% crit chance:
---
100 casts,  50% mana left (50 spells refunded, 500 mana refunded). You should be able to use that same 50% mana pool to cast another 100 times.
---
200 effective casts until OOM, 200 seconds until OOM  
---
1% crit chance got us 1% more casts, but 50% crit chance got us 100% more casts.  
---
if you had 75% crit chance
---
100 casts, 75% mana remaining (75casts/750 mana refunded)
---
25% mana cost per 100 spell cast block
---
400 seconds to go OOM  
---
75% crit chance gave us 300% more casts until OOM.  
---
99% crit chance
---
1000 mana
---
100 casts, 99% mana remaining (99 casts/990 mana refunded)
---
so you'll use 10mana for every 100 casts
---
1000mana / 10mana cost per 100 spells = 100 blocks of 100 casts
---
100 x 100 = 10000 seconds until OOM  
---
And of course going from 99% to 100% would make 10,000 seconds turn into infinity. Obv 99% crit chance is not feasible, and no fight lasts 10000 seconds.  I'll have to do some more shitty math later on to compare HP/S by stacking crit/int to get more 50% effectiveness from crit heals, compared to stacking +healing. It may be a moot point anyway since Pally Tier 3 gear has both. (+healing, + int, +spellcrit)
---
For the price,  no lol
---
Prioritize your gold on cloudkeeper legplates and lionheart helm
---
Then use dreadforge retaliator from emp in BRD or Demonshear.
---
After you get the head piece and legplates if you still have thousands of gold lying around,  sure get it lol but those two items add much more to you than arcanite reaper would
---
Plus PVE server players don't tend to PVP as much as a general rule. Just my anecdotal feeling from experience, but I think most would agree.
---
Where can I find the greater arcane? I can def turn a profit on that, but I can't find the recipe.
---
Yeah, that’s insane. 
---
I don’t even feel like logging in. Might resub once WSG launches.
---
everyone who busts out the wikipedia entry to find out the exact dates of the generations **really** dont understand the meme/phrase/saying/whatever you wanna call it
---
Yeah I don't know why everyone is so concerned over faction balance since at least 1/3rd of the population on every pvp server is about to drop dramatically.
---
You can't make a choice between potential additional lag and spy. It could make almost zero difference for all we know, it could break the servers. That's for blizzard to find out, but I refuse to ignore the spy problem just because we don't want to add more load to blizzard shit servers
---
&gt; the green bow.
---
THANK YOU, now to find out the reason why.. lol
---
Are they still a good place to gain exp at 54? I am an alliance warrior and world PVP is making questing tough
---
Ok so you mean actually in practice it does more damage.
---
I’ve encountered more kids/teens on horde. I have been in many guilds since 2007 (alliance and horde) and have used teamspeak, vent, and discord. The 3 guilds I’ve been in on Incidious, since classic, have had zero kids/teens. I have met more alcoholics on alliance though lol
---
When I pvp I usually put crip on mainhand and sometimes offhand too. 70% movement slow is HUGE for a rogue in 1v1s, instant poison is usually not needed.
---
I wouldn't say pennies. But cheaper yes.  Want to say it cost me about 500g all told? 300 min on 3 arc bars and the 150g for an item from vender plus all the random mats. Then I got a guildy to use his mats for my mount.
---
You should program that
---
Retal can be a better option vs melee as if your opponent has a brain, it reduces damage taken by 100%.
---
But yes, shield wall is far better in 95% of scenarios.
---
Nps, that's what I thought. You led me down this rabbit hole. 
---
Look at these two together lol:

**They are a set!**
---
&gt;you will be so freaking happy you are playing for the less populated faction. You will get instant invites, and you will love that.
---
This only applies if you're playing in a premade, if you're pugging it's the opposite.
---
Sorry to inform you but the same shit happens in BGs. If people don't accept invites they get insta replaced on the queue side. 
---
People also tend to leave quicker when things don't go the optimal way because there's insta-Qs anyway. The deserter buff doesn't weigh as heavily if it's just 15min instead of 15m+10-30m Q.
---
I welcome the queues for BGs, I've seen enough people just rolling over because it's 7vs10, 11vs15 or 29vs39.
---
Yeah the weaker stated green one is still hitting harder in practice, I used both bows on the same target. no extra buffs or attack power involved so even testing.
---
No, he has Obsidian Edge Blade, the guy behind him has  Demonshear
---
Thanks i responded before the description was written
---
Thanks this is a good to know 👍
---
If you act a certain way for long enough it will eventually stop being an act.
---
You will only catch the extreme noob druids with something like that. And you will get punished hard if the druid is somewhat decent.
---
Warrior and a windfury totem
---
I bellioeve too boomy, me too!
---
Devilsaur set is the best until you get T1 though. Trueaim is ok but lacking in comparison.
---
If you're struggling with hit and want to wear your upgrades, I'd suggest going 2/31/18 (and take points out of Surefooted and into Imp AotH if you exceed 9%).
---
is it against the rules to play more than one toon at the same time? i dont mean having alts.. i mean that ive seen now two groups on my server where one player is leading, and then there are three mages and a priest following them. they are all bunched up because its auto following. the second case ive seen the guy was just going around uc, which seemed like they wernt worried of being seen. but the first time ive seen it was a cave in tarrens mill late in the night like 3 am server time. they were really weird about me being around and i talked a little to him but he mostly ignored me. i said how many characters you got and he said "all the characters" then he just ignored me. i did see him fight a few mobs and how it worked was the mages all spammed a move that burst out a purple bubble (idk i dont play mage idk what the move is called) but they really killed things fast. i reported it but also added them all as friends. i can see that they always get on at the same time and its usually late night/ early morning. they are almost level 60 now and just find it unfair. also the name of the leading one is a name it seems like someone chose and likes, while the 3 mages and priest are all names like xyxyxyx or ysysysys or something like that. are these gold farmers to sell on the websites that get messaged out all the time?
---
I hate-watch his videos lol
---
I suspect this may be the answer
---
Mass pvp is theoretically interesting but notice how the best esports are 1v1 or lower player counts.
---
Nice man, keep it up!
---
The legs from DM are very close to cloud keepers, barring the fact they cost an arm and a leg. With the amount of stats +1% crit it should be considered an epic item imo.
---
I’d rather get an arcanite reaper if I was an orc than cloudkeepers that’s for sure.
---
Thanks, your rotation you wrote in the earlier comment makes sense. I've tried it and mostly if i have berseker rage up I don't have any use for sunder armor there. Would you at any point ad sunder armor to that rotation? thanks!
---
What bug are we talking about specifically?
---
My virtual depth perception is terrible apparently because I thought Asmon's name was floating over the guy with Demonshear. Thank you for clearing that up for me :)
---
Faction imbalance will be the death of classic. Pvp servers anyway.
---
Will be fixed tomorrow. 
---
I think its the comment about your attack power someone made. Your attack power has a greater overall contribution on the slower attack maybe?
---
it's dudes all the way down, dude.
---
I’m well aware of how to reset instances without zoning.
---
My concern is the extra 30-40 minutes spent trying to get 5 non-60s into Blackrock Mountain in the first place. Or god forbid replace a single player.
---
This wait can become indefinite if the tank or healer gets MC spammed by priests, sap-locked by rogues, perpetually polymorphed by mages or chain feared by Warlocks.
---
( I know what diminishing returns are as well, but they don’t prevent a 7th or 8th swim out of lava back to the same priest using MC)
---
235
---
Some mons can see stealth so it doesn’t drop you from combat, vanish puts you into an improved version of stealth, it’s working as intended man
---
I know we should expect better but let’s be honest Vanish was/has been bugged like forever. 
---
Was bugged in vanilla,TBC,Wotlk, and Cata. Stopped playing a rogue so much after that but it was bugged in each of those expansions.
---
Yes that's... how it works?
---
they do average damage and go oom very quickly. Thankfully, they have a spell for that... that everyone want they used it on someone else.
---
They are damage dealers that d'ont deal a lot of damage. They have fantastic ways to compensate that : nearly as much armor as a tank, battle rez, healing abilities, great mobility but most of those are irrelevant in the context of a raid where your role is just to do as much damage as possible on a single target.
---
Also, two of their spells use debuff slots, so they usually can't use them a loose a bit of damage because of this
---
*you’re
---
It can definitely be rough at first.  Undergeared rogues aren’t always great and unfortunately the nature of the class brings some less than desirable players that I think have left a bad taste in some players mouths.
---
But it all comes down to practice and knowing what role you play. Don’t be afraid to offer your CC, between sap and blind you can be pivotal in preventing a wipe or helping to control large groups with a mage-less group.
---
Hands down,  rogues can put out the most single target DPS in many pugs, once you understand how to push the limit of threat, cycle your vanish and feint, you’ll find that groups are more than happy to have you there for those tough boss fights.
---
Obviously know your class isn’t some secret tip for only rogues, but I find that because of the burst capabilities of rogues, the bad ones stick out much more because of how quickly they can wipe a group.
---
Someone doesn't get statistics....
---
It’s not directed at anyone, it’s a meme
---
Do you want to spend ~1k gold just to compete with 3 people rather than competing with all the other DW warriors? If gold is worth that little to you then don’t let us stop you, but that seems pretty silly to me.
---
Could you convince the GM/raid leader that you’d just raid as DW but roll for only 2h, and if you get a good one you would swap to 2h spec permanently?
---
The joke is that they aren't referring to literal boomers, just anyone who "acts old" or is even slightly old compared to a teenager/young adult. And now anyone who "acts young" is a zoomer
---
It's all just one big meme, don't read into it too much lmao
---
It's more like there's only need for 2-4 tanks in MC, but you'll end up having much fewer tanks than DPS or healers. Strat living is also notorious for being a dungeon where warriors have next to no loot from (along with LBRS).
---
Classic was released to keep people subbed between retail expacs
---
Imagine going to bed at or before 10pm because you have work the next day lol. Thats a childs bedtime mate.
---
Shadow Priests are a complete waste of a spot and gear through the entirety of vanilla in PvE content.  
---
If you really want to help the locks, you bring a Disc priest specced into Shadow Weaving who keeps it up with r1 SWP spam.
---
Spriests are good in small group wpvp 1-3 x 1-3, and in TBC.
---
Lovecraft’s works are too long for you to read
---
Used to watch Asmongold before he started exaggerating everything so much to the point it's no longer funny. Only saw clips of Jokerd.
---
If you are a solo player,  I have a 60-70g/hr warrior solo farm. I plan on posting it soon, and it's very easy and does not involve open world. if you want to know about it message me. I made 2,000g in the last 8 days from it.
---
I've yet to have any lag during giant world PVP brawls with at least 50-100 on each side.
---
What about 40?
---
Top bantz gentlemen!
---
Long queue times only piss off casual players though. As a ranker, long queue times are actually nice as they give you time to do other stuff. After a bg the downtime until next bg allowed me to go farm the mats for Arcanite Reaper, Stronghold Gauntlets, and Lionheart Helm through mining. I actually got stronger in pvp faster by not being stuck in bgs all day. And the queue times didn't harmfully affect my ranking at all because every horde has to wait in the queue too
---
Rogue depression buisness is booming with that spy add-on in play
---
I’d legit never heard of the guy before this post. Not EVERYONE who says “Who?” Is faking it or living under a rock. Some people just aren’t into streamers/vloggers.
---
People are talking about 300 v 300 but even a simple 20 v 20 tends to feel quite jittery in Classic, you can just feel the lag creeping up.
---
This is where you ask for gold in exchange for tanking. The price of one orb would do lol.
---
This is part of why I chose to stay on herod after finding out it was east coast (The other reason is because bigglesworth is a stupid name and it was the only west coast PvP server)
---
Having slightly easier access to that golden 4am~6am sweetspot is a godsend. It's the only time AoE grinding and open world gathering are actually viable.
---
Currently, I'm getting between 1-2g repair after every UBRS runs where I don't die. Every death is slightly over 2g repair for me. But then again, I'm 5/8 might and 2/2 wrath so i pretty much never die in dungeons unless someone fucks up badly.
---
I'm a 52 rogue, it seems those of us who didn't hit 60 are going to have a rough time with it.
---
It's the garbage base race version of AV that's getting added. So no pvp in that BG
---
Classic is a big money maker for them, they’re not going to let it die. Many of us find it likely that they will release a BG early like they did with Dire Maul. It probably won’t be long before we have AV or WSG, and with Christmas coming up, it wouldn’t surprise me to see AV as soon as next month.
---
Well, yeah. But since it says "no honor for 24 hours", if you happened to encounter them in another BG, they'd still give no honor.
---
The chance of this is significantly lower with cross-realm BGs than it would be on a private server.
---
Go eat a hammer. 
---
Like the Dave Chapelle skit - "Uh, duh. Hey! Durr! If you do anything wrong in your life, duh, and I find out about it, I’m gonna try to take everything away from you, and I don’t care when I find out. Could be today, tomorrow, 15, 20 years from now. If I find out, you’re fucking-duh-finished."
---
Are you one of my mage friends? :D
---
I don't get the impression at all from the message that the GM specifically checked somehow to see if that particular tome contained a Foror's. As I read it, they just checked to see that *if* it did contain a Foror's that the warrior would not be able to see it. My guess is the GM wasn't aware that tomes could be empty.
---
I don't think the modern GM staff have anything remotely like the depth of knowledge of WoW game mechanics to be able to correctly figure out what went on in this case.
---
Hahaha that's actually awesome. Keep going brother. We're going to be buff as fuck by the end of phase 2
---
Sorry, I meant the demon you fight. What if you fail that quest, must you re summon or abandon the quest? (Talking about the demon on the quest for the trinket ) 
---
Thanks !
---
Oh yeah
---
Be in a guild that uses all consumables, world buffs, and wait for all cooldowns prior to bursting down each boss.
---
Yeah of course not EVERYONE who says that is being insincere.
---
I sea what you did their. Good job
---
You don't like DPSing but with different icons on your buttons?
---
The moment you can run a full scholo quest run I'd advice you to do it to get Mirah's Song which is a very good sword offhand :)
---
If they were going to do something they should have at the start, now it's too late, they could probably stop new character creation for the overpopulated faction.
---
It sucks for both sides, my vanilla server had more horde, they had pvp queue times, alliance was insta pop. It's a double edged sword

There are people that still think Wrestling is real too, so not surprising to hear all these people think he's actually like that off stream.
---
We all knew this would happen. Not sure why people are acting surprised about the amount of pvp on a pvp server.

It will die down in a week.
---
The hardcore rank people will still be doing it but the roving bands of murderhobos will dissipate out of the usual areas (obviously avoid BRM or Southshore like the plague).
---
I've never seen a giraffe IRL, only on pictures. That must mean they dont exist? Right?
---
At least with your dumbass logic.
---
You steal Devilsaur leathers in Un'goro.
---
thats not true though. my server is not locked yet -- give it a few hours, and it has a little over 6000 people online right now between horde and alliance.
---
Just make them swap.....I'm sure they would love that.....
---
It will be difficult to level regardless. Have a friend at lvl 51 on Herod Horde, (in theory Herod is very horde dominated). He could not level outside instances yesterday.
---
I always run round robin with guildies (even when we have randoms in them). But when I'm getting whispered about tanking from a random who just happens to see me in IF? Then i demand the first orb.

Oops.

No one is ever going to want a ninja of that caliber in their guild.
---
His only option, if he wants to play the game, is to reroll entirely to somewhere no one knows him and then pray that no one in that guild's Discord ever recognizes his fucking voice.
---
All these servers where Horde is steamrolling everything and I picked one of the 2 pvp servers that favors alliance.  Smh
---
If you want to be a pill, no one in the world has the power to stop you. You know this. I'll see you in there partner
---
Mine too, but they are counted in lifetime, are yours?
---
Do you mean the "only my debuffs" target option? I assume that would just hide everyone else's debuffs, not really what I'm looking for
---
&gt;Thats how I got 7 time lost proto drakes

Id say give it a week and see if the blood frenzy continues. I suspect that it will die down significantly as people realize wPvP is objectively kinda trash gameplay, and that the honor system is a pretty garbage system.
---
At least have all the melee pop a mongoose for rag. It's a huge buff and costs only 3g50s on my server that has black lotuses that sells for 120g. It's a worthwhile investment to beat the submerge timer.
---
the dude is an edgelord, why would anyone respect him?
---
Funny thing is, there's next to no warrior loot in there at all. There's the bracers from Timmy, but it's worse than the UBRS ones from rend. There's the mask of the unforgiven, but that can be done when doing strat UD which has many more pieces, chance of mount AND way more scourgestones.
---
Solo you always get the killing blow and never go on because of spirit tap.
---
In parties and dungeons I make sure I can cast mind blast to finish the mobs off so that I get the killing blow and activate spirit tap and never go oom.
