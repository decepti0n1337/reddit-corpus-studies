Except that RP servers are a safe haven not a gated communities. RP is encouraged and defended, not required. If you argue that non-rpers have every other server; then the counter is that anyone who is caught rping should be forced to move off "normie" servers. And then we get into this whole eye for an eye thing.

---
The best we can do is provide a safe place while defending it from obvious griefers and trolls. Without gating an already small portion of the community.

This is the entire internet chat in 1 picture.  It’s art.

That no rage/aggro black hole is my personal hell. 
---
 It's like,  I'm here to do one job, just let me do it.
---
 Another thing I'm noticing as I'm tanking my way up is that even if the run starts off smooth (because I've done my introductory macro with "Hey, I'm your tank for this run! Please make sure you let your fat little tank get aggro before you go yeehaw!" as we start) folks will start to relax and get back into the retail mindset of "He looked at the mob, time to blizzard/rain of fire my guts out!". I'm sure it's probably due to the run going/looking smooth and easy but, as a tank, I assure you that we're working really hard to make it effortless for you guys.

I can’t get the epic mount???? Level 53 lock here and this would be very disappointing if true
---
Just watched the movies^^ Thanks for information
---
I mean they can be the most sought after dps but that's like being the tallest dwarf when there are 30,000 other dwarves also your height. Getting a non-spellcleave group as a mage takes me, on average, 90 minutes. That's spamming world and LFG looking for multiple runs. Tying any benefit of being a mage to anyone but yourself is asking for disappointment, because I'm not sure if you noticed by also reading this thread, a *lot* of people out there do not like mages, and it will affect you. I love portals, I love making my own water (sometimes), I like having Ice Barrier for running through shit on my mount, but thus far it hasn't been worth the vitriol that I get in response. Mage's strongest point right now, to me, is that playing my druid &lt;20 is miserable.
---
Dunno I'm just a mana pool that shoots sparkly light to make people feel better.
---
No this validates the "idiots will be idiots" saying. You'll find them everywhere in classic, often as mages in my experience, since so many are rolling that.
---
Mostly everything is dirt cheap on my server though about goldthorn and purple lotus. Im past using those for leveling alch so maybe Ill make some money selling those.

!Remindme 2 days

Do quest chains that lead into dungeon quests, get carried through dungeons. Also, depending on class, give yourself awesome gear and just mob grind.

Kinda r/FellowKids cringey, but kinda fun
---
Tier 1 honestly isnt really that good for anything. Tier 2 is judgement yeah. It's got a good mix of everything youd want for pvp. Not really that good for raiding though which is why you still need to manage 2 gear sets
---
I guarantee paladins are the best AoE tanks for 5man dungeons currently. It's not even close. You just need to sit down and ask about the mechanics and practice holding aoe threat with a buddy.
---
Thats where ur str and stam gear can come in.
---
The only spec that is average atm is Ret. Its only use is for leveling. But being average isnt necessarily bad.
---
Just know we shine for single target healing, and aoe tanking.

If you’re new to wow rogue is going to be a lot to take in at first, but trust me get him past level 30 and if you haven’t already you’ll fall in love. They’re a little bit of a challenge to get used to and adjust your play style around, but rogue was the first class I ever played back in BC and I mained it all the way through cata and am leveling a rogue alt in classic. I struggled a lot at first too but once you get the mechanics down and start using your cooldowns all the time, rogue is IMO the most fun class to play, and is very good. Don’t get discouraged because of the low level experience, it will get much much better.
---
*Especially* replacing a mage.
---
For 1v1 you’re better off as shadow.  Disc is a support spec.  Also if it’s preraid BiS you’re missing a lot of potential stam in exchange for healing.
---
If you paired up with another class, you guys would be unstoppable.
---
Oof was hoping they would flush out earlier because im trying to find a class i enjoy. So far been playing mostly hunter because i was told its one on the easiest classes to play for noobies so while i make money playing that i wanted to find out what class i wanted to be my real main. Combast rouge and arms warrior looked by far to be the closest to what i normally enjoy in mmos.

What I meant by good is like spells, your mount, or even hitting max. Something you need. But that is a good way to put it. my main goal is to hit 60 and get my mount.

That did the trick! Thank you so much for the help! I really appreciate it.

Yeah i just learner slice and dicr while leveling is not great so ill stick to sinister and eviserate. I know now also that 14-17 felt so bad because my main hand was a fast hitting wep rather than a slow hard hitting one (didnt understand fully how sinister strike worked). Its getting BETTER but so far still feels rough to play.
---
My current character is 14 and has 6 gold. I've been trying to sell and spend wisely.

To this subreddit, the tank can never be in the wrong. Ive seen so many tanks tab sundering everything but what they mark as skull

It doesn't work. Crusader procs on weapon hit, not melee attack.
---
Lol wow. Animal
---
Skipping any boss is retail like behavior and very casual. You should have told them when you play vanilla you gotta eat the whole scoop.
---
Also everything I’ve mentioned, you’ll learn along the way while leveling, just google some basic tips and practice using everything in your toolkit, rogues have the largest toolkit of utilities, and a skilled rogue can easily handle just about every other class, a skilled rogue against anyone who doesn’t know their class well enough is basically a guaranteed win. Edit: trust me, it feels rough now but before long you’ll feel like a vicious killing machine
---
Haha nice joke
---
Unless you stopped mid dungeon to post this, i really doubt thats true.

It's common courtesy to only need on off-specs if the main-specs don't need it either.

You can do that?

No idea why people downvote you. It's faster on pc.

WPvP is a whole different ballgame as well. If you're caught off guard, the chances of you winning the fight are drastically reduced. I don't know first-hand, but I've heard spriests can nuke people in pvp... I would look into it if you're not enjoying disc.
---
Thank you, I was hoping something was out there and that someone would be awesome and let me know.
---
I certainly hope so and have heard from others that it should be since it existed prior to 1.12 but no word from blizzard on the matter yet.
---
Didn't notice any bad info, any items in particular? I can check on my server to see if its similar.
---
I should not have chuckled, but I did.
---
As long as I don’t have to rename my mage allahu akboom as he blows himself and everything around him to pieces!

I don't care whether it 'should' stay or not. It is staying because it's Blizzard's best approximation for how spells worked in Vanilla.

&gt; Since we first announced World of Warcraft Classic, we’ve seen questions about spell batching. While we never really eliminated spell batching in WoW, we did change how (and how often) we process batches of actions coming from players, so you’re less likely to notice that processing in today’s game. We’ve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It was relatively common in the original game to see a warrior Pummel a mage who simultaneously and successfully Polymorphed the warrior. The mage suffered Pummel damage but no spell-school lock, because the mage didn’t get interrupted. This could seem paradoxical, but it could happen because the Pummel and Polymorph were both in the same batch, and were both valid actions at the start of the batch. For the most part, things like that don’t happen in modern WoW, but they still can. We’ve made improvements to batch frequency, and the game is much more responsive than it used to be. Still, if you manage to get both a Pummel and a Polymorph into a tiny processing window in modern WoW, you’ll experience the same behavior as in original WoW.
---
&gt; As with many other areas of WoW Classic, authenticity is our primary concern. It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
&gt; For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other’s original location.
---
&gt; We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.

Ninja is when you steal it like changing to master loot right before the fight or opening a chest while raid is still fighting.  As far as I can tell he simply needed it.  Did I miss something?

On Hydraxian Waterlords I feel like it's Priests. There are so many Dwarf Priests around, I swear they all rolled the "easy" class for guaranteed raid invites. I've been playing since release and I feel like there are more Priest than Hunters around, at least half of them not knowing what the hell they're doing. On the other hand I know full well that i'll probably never see the insides of a raid because I'm not a Dwarf.
---
Yeah as I thought it’s mostly all +healing, well, all of it is actually. I think a warrior or hunter + me healing would be an unstoppable combo but I don’t have a hunter. I do have one level 22 but unsure if it’s even effective for gold to level it
---
lmao
---
Im actually approaching the level to do DM, even though I plan to be a healer, should I pass on Ember staff from Greenskin if I'm tanking to fill the group?

Effort and listing fees, mostly.

How did you reply so fast? Lol 😂

Press the corresponding number for attack.. congrats no more right click

You're not wrong, if they wanted to skip it I would have bit the bullet though and not keep going on about it, then make my own run. Maybe the tank would have helped you

Its copypasta from a real comment made by a scumbag guild called "Surprise" on arugal.
---
I cant believe youre dumb enough to think killing a guy fishing is worse than camping someone 11 times and making a new account just to whisper them on their faction mean things. Idiot.
---
This is exactly what I predicted (and got voted down for it). I am absolutely amazed that so many people did not see this coming,  or at least refused to see it. World PvP in WoW has always been a shitshow.

Nothing, the guy must believe this is TBC

Not true at all, you're just a huge nerd who likes to watch streamers. You can't assume everyone knows him. Watching streamers is still a niche interest.

Shadow Priest is arguably the best 1v1 class in the game

But yes, I’m gonna day you’re used to retail. You can’t just spam heals in Classic, you need to CC and peel effectively

This is great bro,im definitely saving this for later
---
Well it’s their decision who gets the loot based on who they think will be with them for the “ *longrun* “
---
If you’re having trouble selling items just list them lower or vendor them. Auctioneer is great for regent items that have lots of listing but not as great for BoEs that have few if any. You’re either gonna list those items for mad profit and wait a while for them to sell, or price them just above vendor so you can move them quickly.
---
Looks like you took this with your phone.

I think it just is what it is.

Ohhh you got me GGBigChungus you feel better.
---
It’s a good pointabout the alts. Once an expac comes out, it gets hard to find low level dungeon and quest groups. But my guess is that the deadmines runs will slow down but always be active. Perhaps leveling guilds will be a thing.
---
My original server was 4:1 alliance to horde and I was horde. It just taught me how to be prepared for a gank and how to pvp. I went rogue and honestly, it taught me a ton on how to deal with all the classes and also taught me how they try to win or escape, making me even more effective.
---
Of course I'd be fine with that. Just because they are DPSing now doesn't mean they don't ever heal.
---
Now if a Mage is needing on a melee weapon or a warrior on a cloth armor that's absolutely bullshit. But im not gonna get mad if someone needs for an item that doesn't fit the current role they are fulfilling in that particular dungeon run. Like I said, I heal usually but I need shadow damage gear for leveling and PvP.
---
For me there is either need or greed. Need meaning "I am going to use this" or Greed "I am going to sell this"
---
Bro. How are you so lacking of common sense? Come on now.
---
Never felt bad, but okay.
---
Might take a bit to set it up but it's free so you can try obs (open broadcaster software). Its what many streamers use but it can record to computer also (or both at the same time) 
---
Just set up a hotkey to record to a local disk. Long recordings can use alot of disk space though just keep that in mind.

Seconding this. And if you're a good mage, people will take notice. A good mage is in very high demand, so if you can fight the stigma, you quickly become a very popular person.
---
Tried over master Pyron earlier, did not go well for me
---
The graphic artists from 2003 might get metoo’d.
---
It's not the group's responsibility to advertise what bosses they're skipping. It's your responbility to make sure, *before the run starts*, that the group will kill the bosses you need.
---
Besides, better shoulders drop off the last boss of Strat Live anyways.
---
Which is why I always make sure to mess up the first two pulls a bit. Don’t let them get too comfy...
---
You can raid on RP servers why not join an RP server and find some pve. I bet the raids are way cooler.

I report em all for spam
---
I started putting "No spellcleave please" on my LFG posting, because maybe 1 in 4 of those groups actually held together through 1 solid run, and maybe 1 in 10 would do 3+ runs and not be awful at it. I honestly probably leveled faster just going through normal groups over and over rather than do spellcleave in SM and ZF.
---
Says the guy that implies rushing means not having fun.
---
&gt; Now were they way worse players than him? Sure, but thats kinda the point.
---
He was a Frost Mage with Engineering and most of them had no Engineering, weren't PvP specced and didn't have the proper Engi Reflector.
---
Years later he really wasn't that good. Again, he never shined in arena, which was you know, the actual place to show PvP skill.

Youre trash op

It seems like Esfand was having a similar issue. Wish I knew more but its probably a display bug. Using any addons that change the tooltips?

There's your problem.

Don't trust it for high turnover stackable goods. People throw in 1 of something at a super low price for this reason, then watch for new listings
---
I like stv because it's generally not too difficult to get some backup and get your revenge.
---
More frustrating is for example badlands, where other alliance are much more rare than hordes for some reason. On top of that, the low number of mob spawns for certain quest items means they'll pretty much always attack me.
---
I much prefer the two sided mayhem that is stranglethorn.
---
Well I usually only play afternoons, like 2 to 7 est and then late night or early mornings on weekends so when I log off you'll be logging on :/
---
As for your profession questions. Eng is the best prof endgame for pvp and pve, but you'll want to level tailoring to make your pre raid BiS chest piece. Plus tailoring can give you your bags and some gear upgrades along the way. So I would go tailor/skinning while leveling and just vendor all the skins for added income. Then after you hit 60 drop one of them for engineering and use the other to make the money for leveling eng.
---
ITT : People jealous they aren't mages.

The default key is t

How is rushing to 60 in a game that’s Grindy as FUCK. Considered having fun
---
We were all heading to bed after the run, so not likely. But I was planning on just finishing the run, but I also wanted them to realize that they were in the wrong and that it was kind of a dick move, instead of going on and on about how the shoulders aren't "bis" so they're pointless to kill the boss for. 
---
If no one tells people when they make mistakes, how will they know? 
---
Because they were acting like I was crazy for bringing it up, not realizing that they might be in the wrong.

&gt;As a general rule of thumb for leveling purposes, you want the low end damage of your main hand weapon to be equal to or greater than your current level.
---
Your Phytoblade, having 25-47 damage range should only be used up to L25, indeed, this site has it in the 21-25 bracket.

Might depend on the server, I see far more mages and warriors.
---
I'm being serious. This is what a lot of people do. Especially serious PvPers.
---
Oh yeah sitting at my computer chair for 12 hours to get maybe 10 levels. Sounds like a great time
---
Downranking is huge. And, I have two gear sets as well but don't really needed. I have a lot of Strength and Stam for Ret and Int/Strength for Holy. That's just how I am going about it.
---
Yeah he gave me a hug and said goodbye when he left at least, that part he loved the Rock hurt a little
---
Free transfers were offered off my server, and it was alliance minority. Guess who moved off the server in droves? (Hint: it wasn't the horde)
---
Bold to have that name.
---
Sooo in the end they did in fact hurt you huh?
---
It looks like Rudolph Giuliani took this photo.
---
Is missing Classic also the reason this picture isn't a screenshot?
---
Not to mention no mount which makes you have to walk everywhere. That’s fun
---
Stats of dagger? / current wep?
---
Most groups I’ve been in just tell me to take everything that I lockpick. Does this change later on? I’m lvl 32
---
Since you're dps, your BIS is Manual Crowd Pummeler from gnomer. And since that one is 3 use only, you can forget about weapon enchants.

If I tried that my gf would smack my ass for.m the fact that I’m gaming in the car!

Iceblock is F, Blink is my g-shift button

My stacks sell for 45s easy, which is a very small profit after fees. You could probably creep up to 47s though.
---
Antivaxxers are the only creatures worse to deal with than Huntards.
---
I try and judge the player and not the class, but there’s a lot of dumb warriors I’ve seen since launch.
---
Tradeskillmaster
---
Look into a Feign Death + trap macro.
---
If the Warrior does close the distance, you can hit the macro and drop a Freezing Trap at your feet, freezing him in place and allowing you to regain your range advantage.
---
There are some bugs with it right now so it doesn't work 100% of the time, but Blizz is looking into and it should be fixed soon.
---
Also, Warriors can only Charge out of combat, so if you see him before he sees you, pop off a shot or sick your pet on him to put him in combat ASAP.
---
Warriors also have Intercept, which is like Charge but can be used in Combat. Ideally, this is when you would use your FD/ Trap macro or Scatter or Free Action Potion.
---
Once you gain distance on him after he uses Intercept, he shouldn't be able to catch you again during the fight. Do as the other poster said and learn to kite and jump shot. He won't have any more gap closers so Aspect of the Cheetah and run circles around him. Just be careful he doesn't get cheeky and shoot you with his bow/ gun while you are using Cheetah.
---
I got an item that was going for 125g on ah. Got an offer for 40 g said I'd take 70g and he said no. Later sold it for 100 g on ah so I'm happy the guy offering to buy was so poor
---
where is this?
---
Oh because I’m using the Bartender addon. I can have multiple bars instead of switching pages.
---
Does the level 40 mount really need a farm tutorial? I quested to 40, didn’t buy anything stupid, and sold the stuff I couldn’t use on the AH. Hit 90g just after hitting level 40. 
---
And once you are level 40, the money from quests increases a lot. So.. this is just way too much effort for getting the mount. Just play the game, and you will get your mount pretty fast.
---
Lastly, Noggenfrogger Elixir is only useable when you are lvl 35. So if you are a race/class without underwater breathing, you will have to farm the Hydrocane, which can be a lot of work.
---
Hellfire at 1hp
---
The 40s ofc an rofl about it.
---
Why the fuck are they always so toxic? At least when I played Huntard in TBC(Topped DPS always), my fellow huntards would be sheepish and admit any wrongs if they were guilty. Nowadays seems like every mage who causes trouble(not the good ones) has a huge ego and denies any wrongdoing. Wtf man.

All right mate I guess we'll see how you feel at 60.

Yeah I absolutely stand that logic. Plus it sucks for some specs, as their Tier pieces could not be more disparate from that spec's desired stats / set bonuses. Enhancement Shaman is a great example of that!

One of my issues with that is usually that by the time I can get enough distance in, the Warrior has already massacred half my health somehow.

When twinking becomes a thing again then yea, that'll be it's own thing, but boosting a character you're still actively leveling by carrying them is dumb beyond words.

I swear, this guy is for real. This wasn't the first, ehm, strange thing he said. After causing a wipe or two last week, he up and left the guild this week because there were like 60 people signed up and he didn't get picked. He had this idea, out of the blue, about how he was supposed to be picked because he didn't roll for stuff last week, like that was some rule. He just stated that as fact. But, no rule like that in our guild. He'd just made that up for himself and that meant he was supposed to get a spot. He may seriously suffer from some condition, I dunno.
---
Yeah I know, but my friends don't want to and it would be much more convenient this way :D But if I have no other choice, I'll do that.
---
Can you do this with the default chat, or do you need an addon? I couldn’t figure out anymore how to make a separate whisper tab, but it shouldn’t be that difficult, or?
---
WTB knowledge how to do this. pst
---
You will NEVER get someone online to admit they were wrong. Rule number 1.
---
the ratio is close on Sulfuras
---
Test subject for goblin engineers
---
Is it faster to Tram or Fly between Stormwind and Ironforge? I'd guess Tram!
---
I guess that depends on what your goal is. But it will probably be a major pain once phase 2 hits if you're still trying to level.
---
Not classic. Mostly not more. Try again.
---
Depends on how you want to level tbh. Frost is the most efficient spec in the game for leveling due to it's aoe farmability. Fire is more fun to play (personal preference), especially in pvp.
---
What’s your internet source? Phone?
---
It happens if both players have extended character stats I think
---
This guy is either lying or the biggest boomer in history. "Become a weapon myself." Bruh no one says that unless you're just talking shit or you grew up calling people "macaroni head"
---
You'd think a futuristic cropping method wouldn't have the problem where the end result was always grainy, angled, and off-center. Alternatively just drag your mouse to crop after using a hotkey like you already do for everything else. Or do you play wow classic by pressing icons on an ipad?
---
Thank you!
---
is there a profile for this setup that can be shared or a step by step thinggy you have made?
---
Hamstring slows for 15 seconds. I can only get so far away and then they'll just Intercept me anyway.
---
Nah this was a couple days ago. Don’t remember the name though :(
---
I believe the ratio on Bennediction is also close.
---
Someone needs to take a picture of a Polaroid picture of a CRT screen for the nostalgia...
---
I would say the fault lies in the lack of communication before you even start the run. Your not an asshole and honestly they should be clearing everything it's vanilla it's what we do.
---
good info on setting it up in this post
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czpn6n/my_personal_classic_wow_mobile_different_networks/
---
Can confirm it works as advertised!
---
For me it's Shamans. They need on everything that gives INT (for their healing set) or AGI/STR for their dmg stuff.....
---
Thanks !
---
Always good to have a Gnomes Per Second in your group.
---
 No problem man. It’s a LOT easier with AR so that’s probably not gonna work at 39. But if he bet allows you to be 40 lol I highly suggest it. Rogue skillz pay billz!
---
Lmk how it works either way, 39 or 40.
---
Warriors aren’t far behind. At least they can tank.
---
Anything under fifty pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless.
---
Honestly idk I haven’t made everything yet lol. I just know to do it in that order.
---
You didnt press a button.
---
 Seems consistent to me.
---
No. But only a blacksmith can attach them to your boots.
---
Auto attacks reach further when showing your back to the mobs (or players). Facing the mobs is best for kiting. However I dont exactly know with what kind of angle you need to strafe in, in order to trigger the leeway. Could be that sometimes the strafing does not trigger it at all if you keep your face towards the mobs by even the smallest margin.
---
I rolled a warrior as I want to tank at 60 but tbh while levelling tanking is such a ball ache, before i have even reached the mob with charge the hunter is multi shotting and the mage has cast blizzard, im then running around with very little rage trying to get agro from the dps who are running all over the place leaping around like wild salmon
---
So good they give them out for free.
---
Louder for the people in the back
---
It helps to make friends that will party and quest with you. 
---
My main had gotten around 35 a few days ago when I joined a random party to share mobs for a quest. We stayed together to complete more quests, and eventually I friended them.
---
It's really helped me continue questing and leveling my main with them dragging me through stuff. Otherwise I'd have started to feel somewhat overwhelmed and aimless.
---
 I can remember the day they patched wall jumping and how heartbroken  I felt. It was a ton of fun jumping up mountains and exploring areas  you otherwise could not get to, though of course I understood the need  for it to combat terrain exploiters using it to kill NPCs and other  players while free from harm.  
---
Now, as result of the "fix",  certain terrains are just incredible slippery or sticky. Way back when  this fix was implemented, it wasn't too bad, but it seems with the  release of Classic and it being on the BFA client, things have gotten  tremendously worse. As an Undead player, I constantly get stuck trying  to run up stairs that are meant to be stepped on. My body gets lodged  into the step and my feet keep running, and because I'm lodged, I can't  even jump. I literally have to stop moving entirely, step back or  strafe, and try again. In the video above, towards the end when I'm completely lodged in the stair with my feet moving, I'm mashing space bar and...nothing.  
---
It's absolutely infuriating to feel like  you don't have control of your character for even a few seconds,  especially when you're trying to escape from combat because you pulled  too much, a patrol aggro'd in, or a multitude of other reasons.  
---
Please,  for the love of god, fix clipping on stairs and other things that are  meant to be walked up. It seems to happen much more often to me as Undead than my  friends who play other races, but I'm sure it's a problem of varying  degrees across the board.
---
Can u link it? I got this feeling that i need to see that thread ..
---
Hunters rolling need on everything.
---
This is my surprised face.
---
I highly doubt he can provide any proof that people have been banned. There is also a blue post that says they have no problem with you remoting in to your own PC and playing.
---
You are still giving me too much credit. To be honest, I had a 40 priest in vanilla and I don't think I ever used dispel. I just hit 20 on a priest in classic, so I can start out spamming that shit.
---
I'm luna settings you can turn blizzard UI back on
---
These types of people were all over once guild banking released. They'd guild hop and steal everything from the gbank to sell it for a profit, then leave guild. Guilds smartened up by locking their bank behind member ranks but it was rampant for a while.
---
It still rains ?
---
Oh man if i got this message i would have gone off on that ass wipe rofl!! Maybe one day :)
---
Hunter is a harder class to play well imo. Gotta play the WST rhythm game and manage a janky AI.
---
Their frame will have the skull, the mouseover window will say ‘Level ??? Race Class’. It’s the same thing.
---
I don't know what message you divined from my comment, but I was simply and exclusively sharing a fun video that your comment reminded me of.
---
That sucks. Definitely worked on pservers
---
I don't know, it was my first dungeon as a hunter yesterday and j accidentally went full huntard. We jumped off the ship after Van Cleef to kill Cookie, I didn't dismiss my pet because I figured it would teleport next to me, no it took the scenic route and aggrod what was left of the mobs and caused a wipe.
---
imagine making long term decisions based on short term circumstances
---
I leveled a max female dwarf monk in legion for this very reason
---
I definitely did Hyjal in BC and never killed Kael or Lady Vashj
---
Quite the conundrum. Most of us Alliance just want to finish Stranglethorn Vale.
---
It's not fair that the government bans the plebs from getting bis ranged weapons.
---
I know a mage who has Hand of Justice. Before too many people get up in arms over that, everyone else in the party had the trinket.
---
Is this on Yojamba? I recognise some of these names
---
You're right. But a few things could be done quite quickly. For example, next expansion: disable dungeon finder for the new content.
---
I’m mainoholic. Level 49 mage and three lvl 1s alt lol
---
Well, i am reading that mana tide is considered a wasteful talent given that it regens at what, 800 mana? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So If i spec'd out of Lightning Mastery and went for purification, aside from going a totem build for melee wouldn't I be getting the max out of my spec regardless?
---
Mages literally cast 3 spells and kill. 
---
Hurr nova, cone of cold, fire blast, ded
---
You can do Engineering. It will allow you to Vanish + resurrect the healer in case your group wipes. Goblin jumper cables is what allow this.
---
Mages fault. Learn 2 not get into melee of a shaman.
---
Thanks for the info.  I followed everyones advice and did those quests this morning.  I went from bottom of my groups DPS to them being blown away by the damage output I was providing.  Today was a good day.
---
Pretty sure tram.
---
Dat some gay-ass furry shit bro
---
I'm guilty of this. I healed ZF probably a dozen times before I saw the wolf mask drop and I didn't hesitate to need on it despite being probably 5 levels from being able to use it. Some of us just have bad luck with rng so you have to grab stuff when you can.
---
Only in certain zones in retail, they removed weather effects and day/night awhile back.
---
At least on my server (Windseeker), mats are reasonable. If it holds, wait until that end game gold.

&gt; Feign Death is failing because the spell-cancel on turning is more sensitive in WoW Classic than it was in 1.12. We’ve tracked down why it’s more sensitive, and we’re testing a change now that relaxes the spell cancellation to make it less likely that you’ll inadvertently trigger this if you’re trying to stop turning to cast Feign Death.
---
I always let go of RMB before using it so never had this issue
---
Excuse me but wtf
---
But...I NEED it... just not yet
---
Because the idea that people would spend more effort for lower quality is just a baffling mindset. Does it stop at just inconsequential stuff like screenshots, or do these people's whole lives consist of obfuscating problems and making excuses for doing poor quality work?
---
I am mage also and had enchant and tailoring. Enchanting cost a lot money in early stages so I dropped it for skinning and made so much more gold
---
Idk about farming 40 mount. I used to farm essence of air go get my 60 mount back then.
---
will be cheaper now compared to later where no1 is farming low level mats
---
Woah, you assuming the tank is a warrior (and maybe a bear?)^of^course^you^are^^meme^^spec^prot^pally^:(
---
old brain sucks :)
---
Thanks! I guess I found my night read for today :D
---
The warrior in my guild just hit 2k Gold and hes not even 60 yet. Excuses!
---
I like to pick things that sound plausible when read in a PvP log.
---
"You were killed by *Diabetes*."
---
I know you died to that elemental on your left...
---
Wow insane luck and stupidity by mage.
---
Amazing clip thanks for posting this! So funny!
---
This is a weird timeline we are living in.
---
Just got mine a few days ago too.
---
Have you tried setting it up in weak auras? It's a buff isn't it? So it should be able to track it.
---
I just dealt with a hunter needing on a 2h polearm over a warrior in ZF. The polearm had no stats but the hunter insisted he needed to level his polearm skills.
---
He then kept jumping on ledges and causing shit to reset.  Just absolutely worthless
---
Rogues can pick their fights while warriors have to sort of take what’s thrown at them. Also rogues have the best stuns of any class while warriors have very limited potential there. Both of these things shine through in PvP more than PvE but rogues really aren’t too far behind in endgame PvE either.
---
Consider his jimmies rustled
---
Lol yea hunters need that melee attack power ya know
---
In what world does it take longer to post an image with a computer than a phone? Screenshot or snipping tool, ctrl + V into reddit, done.
---
I feel bad for Hunters. They seem to have a lot of "easy forget" mechanics, for some reason. A lot of them due to the "set it and forget it" nature of things like their pet growl, unsummoning/resummoning pets when jumping off things (something probably rarely done outside of dungeons), or which aspect they're in. They have massive quiver/ammo bags too,  it takes a while to run low/out of ammo. Leading to another thing that can be set and forgotten, until it's too late. I'm sure when they're out farming, using multi shot just becomes part of the muscle memory rotation at some point. Second nature, until oops. Add also the ability to use so many weapons and equipping so many while leveling. They probably just naturally think if its good, I can roll! Until people are suddenly angry.
---
Of course excellent players will think about everything, but absent minded people have a lot of easy opportunity to be negatively impacted quite quickly with Hunter. I'm not sure what the deal is.
---
It’s funny, I’ve seen a lot of groups legit just refuse to invite hunters, I’ve seen tanks that would refuse to tank for hunters, now I’ve healed a fair few dungeons and I’m starting to see why.
---
All I want to know is how does he have his camera zoomed out so far!?
---
you have two things to think about:
---
1. Natural gold inflation as more people reach max level. 100g now may be worth 500g a few months down the line
---
2. How much value your twink item has, is it for a popular twink class and is it BIS?
---
You were so flabbergasted your bottom jaw fell off!!
---
opposite end of the spectrum for me today. going through sm cath and our warrior tank is obviously hot garbage. cant even hold threat on 1 mob let alone 2-3. Several close calls with mobs running all over the place and one actual wipe because the tank decuded it was smart to try to tuck away in the corner of the cathedral. one stray mob turned into about 4 more. Tank then goes and pulls mograine without clearing the side wings. When we finally kill em mograines might and the healer mace drops. 
---
warrior: "wow both are an upgrade"  
---
and needs both. luckily he lost both. Told him he should get ravager instead and the healer mace was absolutely not an upgrade. luckily as a warlock I needed neither.
---
Grats
---
I’m on that realm, you also tried to attack Darnassus about 2 hours ago - until we murdered you all.
---
For me, the shoulders and weapon don’t match. The chest piece is a little odd with the chest plate, but it isn’t terrible. Other than that, I think it looks nice
---
I looked at that and could only wonder at how an employee at Blizzard thought that was a good picture to choose.
---
If you tank a dungeon that doesn't mean you're ms tank,many times I joined a group as dps only to be asked if I can tank because it's hard to find a tank.
---
What pet should i use for leveling? I’ve seen differing opinions
---
Fucking ded!! 😂😂😂
---
    #showtooltip Freezing Trap

    /cast [combat] Feign Death

    /cast Freezing Trap

Combat tag so you can use the same bind out of combat and not waste feign CD
---
Just play the game, dork.
---
They are weapons with the class "fist weapon". Druids in cat and bear form do not attack with their equipped weapons.
---
The meme is good, even if the title is garbage.
---
i never even knew that quivers existed in vanilla and some of them are so pretty wtf lol
---
Yeah the Uruk Hai are created in those sacs. It would be odd for orcs to do that as well since they're twisted versions of elves and not creations per se.
---
&gt;i would love to see his face irl after that. i know i would just be like wtf just happened and sit there for a few minutes without releasing.
---
WF is bullshit.
---
Leveling my Shaman I love fighting mages. Most don't know the shock needs to be deadzoned while in Frost Nova and you can pretty much ruin every single spell cast.
---
That is a very good tip, take initiative!
---
&gt; WF is bullshit
---
WF is awesome.
---
regardless of whether first people accused on being loot ninjas were or not doesn't matter here. The OP just left the group, then put together their own group at which point the original people accused attempted to destroy their reputation on the server, they INSTANTLY lose the benefit of the doubt solely for being that butthurt over someone else putting together a group to do the same content. This is 10 year olds starting slap fights over wow levels of stupid coming from the people trashing the OP's rep.
---
Can confirm,  leveling a mage alt.
---
*at the start before I've begun healing that way if I'm removed like in the OP I still got my damage in
---
In before there is r/aitaclassicwow
---
You should have left with them.  You literally just said no one you knew was 60.  Implying all the people that you do know, switched servers.  Sounds like you are exactly the type of scenario that would have benefited from free server transfer....  and you didn’t take it.....  and are now bitching about not taking like it’s not your fault.
---
Vlad Dracula Tepes was Wallachian
---
These mages, man. An undead mage 4 4 levels below me attacked my paladin when I was low on HP. I was confused, but just popped divine shield and healed myself. Mage just stood there watching me. When the shield expired, he frost bolted me, which I instantly freedomed, but then he kept trying to snare/slow me even though I still had the BoF buff. Anyway I just smacked him a couple of times while he just ran away and eventually killed him, all the while wondering what he even expected.
---
In what world is it faster than opening up the reddit app, choosing picture post, taking a picture and posting it?
---
That's debatable on a leveling warrior with deep wounds. 2h sword spec procs are funny as shit though because every once in a while both will crit and a mob just disappears.
---
&gt; poor ~~naive~~ **unlucky** lad.
---
That's funny cuz I took a couple trip from UC to Sepulcher just to post in /1. That is a good tip though. .
---
Only bear and aquatic form have quests, and they’re both different depending on faction.
---
I have one so it's defintely available
---
I don’t know how to help but I can totally relate. I didn’t learn that this thing I had actually had a name until like 5 years ago.
---
Thank you for the answer,i didnt know that !
---
What realm?
---
Some bosses only deal melee damage, so can help to throw this on the tank.  It's very situational though.
---
I'm a mm hunter and even I hate bm hunters. You think you're gonna duke it out with them and see who can cc the pet and get a cheeky scatter into aimed shot 1st but then they pop beastial wrath while Facerolling their keyboard and theres nothing you can do.
---
!remindme 4 hours
---
Soooo the guys who got ganked mercilessly get punished with a longer queue... And those who transfer from the imbalanced and outnumbered faction to a new server making the previous server more imbalanced get rewarded with a shorter queue...
---
Was doing an UBRS yesterday and the mage refused to sheep pull or even sheep as the tank pulled.  He would always sheep once the trash was all grouped up, then when I tried to explain to him how to sheep he said "then stop cleaving everything" and dropped group and left 2 pulls before the last boss.  /facepalm
---
Num keys 1-5 for your basic rotation/ DoTs.
---
Modify those with Shift, CTRL, and ALT for 15 more keybinds.
---
I also use Q,E,R,F,C,X,Z.
---
Those with modifiers gives you 28 more.
---
My mouse only has 2 buttons, but I use modifiers for those as well, so that's 8 more.
---
My hands are big enough to use F1-F4. You can modify these too, but I don't.
---
I also use the tilde key "`"
---
That gives me 61 easy access hot keys which is usually enough for me.
---
Undead warlock. Any tips on fighting a Dwarf shadow priest? Or do I just die every time, lol.
---
Yes lmao
---
Why would you crop it? That's what the snipping tool is for.
---
Was a Mage during vanilla through WotLK. Glad I rolled Lock this time.
---
I'm a hunter main haha but I decided to try healing on a priest. Me and 2 other friends decided to try Deadmines and I had only really healed in RFC 2 times before it. Invite a tank and mage to the group and we start, the mage proceeds to pull mobs one after another and thankfully you get different ranks of heals now so we were scrapping and I had enough mana for rank one spells. I was basically spamming drinks right after fights and the mage would just keep pulling. No idea how the tank felt but I definitely was on my toes the full dungeon
---
rip
---
All that is needed is for them to bring in the new character models. Will be 100% perfect then.
---
Not really no. If they're being slow, or constantly afk'ing, or wiping, or being toxic, fuck no I'm not gonna suffer that group through the whole thing. Feel free to not invite me in the future.
---
Try the add-on "Immersion". It helps A LOT to actually enjoy quest text and it's easier to get through
---
I'm looking for a class to play that I'm just going to be levelling and then pvp/bgs when they are released, using rewards from that for gear and also trade skill if needed 
---
I'm not interested or have the time for raids, pvp is what I enjoy the most
---
What class would be best for this type of  gameplay?
---
Who did organise it?
---
I’m 25 and seem to lack this... oops
---
F
---
Hunter in guild has 1, can confirm its 100% in the game. I think where the confusion is coming from is because it’s also lootable from Kazak in phase 2
---
unless he's in england he should be lol
---
Play what you enjoy.
---
We dont speak to each other anymore. Its all Toasters fault.
---
the link isn't working for me :( Do you have another?
---
I mean it's Strat live not a large dungeon such as BRD, I too would not assume they were skipping any bosses unless they told so beforehand.
---
Uhhh how the hell is is even allowed to kick people in the middle of a fight
---
Your comment on how long it takes to perform a certain method definitely seemed like you cared. Even if you didn't you invited discussion. 
---
Delete your comment, you won't get anymore replies, lol
---
im guessing hotspot from phone, pretty decent these days
---
Still a step ahead of me. I hit 42 last night and still only have 30g
---
How does it feel knowing you said those words to someone because of a disagreement about a video game?
---
Yeah I know the feeling, I was like why does this sword look so unique for the lvl, looked at it again was like that's the quiver, been so long since I've played wow I forgot they had nice quivers oddly enough.
---
Just hit em with a no response. Then it doesn’t really interrupt shit.
---
In his defense, it doesnt really matter if someones in a guild. Especially right now, most people are planning to gquit anyway
---
It is I, Hurtme!
---
Yeah but I might remember you and if it's between you and another player for a group, I'd absolutely choose them over you. 
---
Happened to me the other night and I'm never grouping with them again if I can help it.
---
there are far more, but people want them in groups.
---
rogues suck for dungeons.  No aoe.  Cleave ever 2 minutes.
---
Also, warriors like to avoid rogues so they can take the leather/weaps/trinks w/o competition.
---
I'm not sure how this is controversial.
---
How haven’t you been flagged for a name change yet?!! Lol
---
Dps wants to tank, let them tank :P
---
I’ll admit watching people getting so worked up over something so trivial was interesting
---
Nah mage is just that easy to play, I just killed two warriors while driving 80mph
---
You probably are SOL, but it’s worth putting in a ticket with Blizzard to see what they might do for you.
---
He's right though it's useless to cloth/leather wearers. How is this a ninja?
---
Some low effort shitpost I like it
---
Warlock here. I encourage you to abandon the light, and join the dark side. We have cookies, and the succubus keeps us company all night long ^_~
---
Typical millenial thought process. They instantly play the victim and pass blame the second they are called out or proven wrong
---
Aren’t Savanah Patriarchs just about as good? Attack speed 1.3.
---
Or rolling need on some shit you don't need
---
I am using the tmobile test drive hotspot I got for free this month.
---
Druid and Hunter are great classes in PvP and don’t need much gear to compete. Druid’s PvP set is great too. You can get by with dungeon gear in PvP with both of these classes.
---
Yeah until they have a kid and quit WoW, or their work schedule changes, or they go on holiday for a month, or a dozen other things.
---
Your main tank should indeed be reliable, but so should at least two other tanks who you rotate in regularly. I’ve seen tons of raid groups fall to bits because they lost their main tank and didn’t have any other options.
---
Yeah it's a rough grind but you'll get there eventually!
---
Yeah depending on why the wipes are happening and if the player at fault says sorry.
---
Usually if we wipe 3 times I'll announce that it isn't working and go find a new group.
---
Still better than half the players on my server most likely
---
The fuck you talking about? Spell Cleave groups with nothing but mages locks and priests is very much a thing all the way through SM.
---
Pretty sure it's: "launch a 90kg object over 300m". Nevertheless, r/trebuchetmemes is leaking
---
Typical alliance scum.
---
I have no idea! The people on my server are really laid back though so maybe that's why. I really regret my name now though anyways so I've been hoping to get reported for a name change but I guess it's meant to be.
---
i think that whatever class OP is are all idiots
---
What's with this attitude? There were guilds formed years after original release that became top guilds.
---
Using mph so I think we good
---
I had it easy. I just whispered “have key” and that was it :p Doesn’t work so well anymore of course but 3 weeks ago boy let me tell ya!
---
Depends on whether the player at fault is conscious of and remorseful for their mistakes.
---
I can deal with some wasted time but if you waste my time and act toxic about it that's not cool.
---
Guy gets burned out after having 20 days played on a single char in 30 days, no lifer to the max
---
Just throw a Shadow Word:Pain onto the boss at the start before anyone needs healing. Job done.
---
Sounds like a place to check out that might suit my needs. Both that and Earth Fury are two of the more balanced smaller PVP servers. What times EST do you guys usually play?
---
Only remark that makes it all worth it though!
---
Just stop doing anything and stand there when they do that. "I'm waiting for you to finish your pull" is the correct response.
---
If they talk any shit, uninvite them from the party. You can always find DPS. Or threaten to leave if you're not party leader. They know they'll spend far more time looking for a tank than DPS.
---
Oh don't be so obtuse. People are less likely to listen to you if you exaggerate like that. The ret is probably doing at least 40%, up to 70% or more of a normal dps. Less yes, but not by the factor you suggest.
---
Is it more horde or ally or a bit even?
---
Yeah, become the diva tank.  They can't run the instance without you.   Even if you mess up, you're learning a new role, it's OK to make mistakes and wipe sometimes.
---
This has been an informative post for me. I've hardly ever used multi-shot, and I had no idea it behaved like this.
---
Vaccination isn't politics, lol
---
Actually the correct term is Nurglite Cultist
---
-guy struggles getting people to join/stay in his guild
---
-decides to spend a lot of time and items in the hope one guy will stay(this is just an elaborate way of bribing someone into staying)
---
-Gets irritated when said person keeps asking for favors, and confused when said person leaves when the guild is of no use to him anymore. 
---
Like I described, bribing people this way will only attract one type of player and they will only stay as long as you keep giving them favors.
---
I’ve never skipped cannoneer in strat live. Pretty dick to skip out on it, don’t group with them again for sure.
---
Bruh millennials are like 40 years old now
---
People who hit 60, what spec are you rolling for all the preraid BiS dungeon farming?
---
I grinded there from 38-40. Could only manage about 5-6 gold per hour.
---
They definitely can for early game, now towards late game I can only see myself being capable of doing it if literally every single point was spent in enhancement and resto and I wore full stamina gear, which means I would struggle soloing. 
---
I definitely have NO issues holding aggro, though, compared to warriors it's actually far easier in fact.
---
another question for today, sorry. So when you reach thresholds in your class- level 20, 30, 40, etc and need to get your class quests to unlock, for example, the succubus, can you do it from any main trainer, or does it have to be your factions? for example, I'm an undead in the barrens now, do i have to go back to the undercity to get my level 20 quest or would i be able to do the one available from the orc trainer?
---
What type of BRD runs are available to me as a lvl 53? and which one gives the most xp?
---
Might be a kid
---
.
---
I'm on Atiesh &amp; have gone to make dinner without being kicked.
---
It takes about 5-10 minutes of no activity in-game before you're even flagged as AFK. Then it's another 5-10 min or more before the server kicks you. 
---
If you get kicked for AFK, the system will just send you back to the character select screen. If you get disconnected for any number of hardware reasons, it will usually have some kind of message saying so or you'll be back to the login screen. 
---
If it's kicking you faster than that I'd say something is wrong with your internet.
---
Technically it was the Cataclysm pre-patch.  
---
Level cap was still 80 but it was the 4.0 game client.
---
I'm level 38 with 75g and all skills trained. Shadow prey village shellfish quest is the only way I've done it
---
Rolling on Dal Rends as a hunter is awful. I’m a hunter myself. Peacemaker gives 6 more AP overall. Have it, and wouldn’t trade it out.
---
... wait ... So your solution is people abandon their character in the underpopulated faction and this will create balance ...how do you tie your fucking shoe laces without needing a visit to an emergency room. Your parents legitimately must have kept that foam shit on house corners because of you.
---
Play the way you want. Racing to 60 is folly.
---
If the realm transfers are still running, I think a polite ticket to support has a chance.
---
It is ok to need on things you will use in a couple of days. Not ok to roll on things you never will appropriately need.
---
There's nothing classier than laughing at anti-vax quacks.
---
Auctioneer the OG addon
---
Yep you sure got the whole story. Here's part of it: if anybody had left in a wave of free transfers, I would have been going with them. That did not occur.
---
i never did, still don't ;)
---
You misread my post completely and lashed out about it.
---
Don't need to say anything.
---
Ignore. Report, move on.
---
one of many reasons i'm not having any of those. respect to ya. :)
---
Yeah I also saw a frog
---
We went on the complete the raid, I was not booted because no one saw it as ninja ing
---
Shaman is love.
---
Shaman is life.
---
Hmm this is a hard one, give her something like a paladin and she might find the game boring, give her something like a warrior and she might find it too hard
---
Druid might be a good middle ground
---
2.5 hours ohhhh my so long
---
Holy shit that's troll
---
Oh that's another easily solo'd boss for stealth classes. Too bad my druid already breathes underwater. He hits softer than the elites nearby.
---
He's only off by 2 years on the top end.
---
Remind me! One day
---
Harder than any of the bosses to be sure.
---
I'm pretty sure skull level is actually like 63 or something like that.?? Is 10 levels higher.
---
Skull doesn't technically have a level, it's just boss, but I think it's equivalent to around 3 levels higher
---
They all roll on our crossbow. Which is also totally fair and okay
---
Hunter, chicks love pets
---
Pocket healer, duh.
---
If you're doing the traditional affliction vw dotting and wanding method then vw is fine.
---
For drain tanking succ is best for dps and mana battery. If you want you can also use the vw for tanking whilst in drain tank build, you just have to push him to his little blueberry limits. Due to the aoe taunt ability he's particularly useful whilst questing.
---
Even on my low population server this is a waste of time at best, and utterly futile at worst. 
---
There's maybe a dozen spots these spawn at &amp; only 1 in 3 odds of getting the quest item. 
---
I'm a druid &amp; even with aquatic form I can get only one cage per 1-2 minutes, even slower if the mob spawns from it. 
---
The first week this might have worked. Today I made 2g from 45 minutes &amp; moved on to questing. 
---
Plus I'd rather buy my spells than a mount. Mounts are rarely used vs how much you need your skills.
---
Your music selection is bad.
---
GRAY FOX!
---
For me the biggest problem is the inconsistency of what layer I end up on.
---
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
---
Or it is stocks and every mob disarms or stuns. Didnt matter if you had rage. You cant use any abilities anyways.
---
I mean.. no.. but what are you going to do when you're 60 if you don't run dungeons? If you don't like dungeons you probably don't like raids either.  
---
So you just level to 60 and quit?  
---
Just do some dungeons. They're one of the most fun things to do in wow.
---
Yes 
---
Warlock here....
---
Imagine thinking this is funny or in any moment worth doing. You’re a toxic individual for not only “blacklisting” but for griefing to this extent and YOU should be banned from the game 
---
If that guy did anything to you, ignore and move on
---
Or nvidia GeForce experience has screen recording. Also I believe win10 has something built in
---
And what if the Warlock calls the pet back when you're running away?
---
So just to confirm. Youre saying make one macro for
---
/sit
---
/stand
---
And just spam it when you are about to get hit? Ive been sitting and trying to time the stand.
---
Do you repeat the aimed shot as well? Or does it depend on if the weapon speed is above 3?
---
But what if I enjoy high quality posts?  I'm supposed to stop using Reddit to avoid your low effort posts.
---
I started having the same issue. You may have an addon causing issues.  For me I removed titan panel and all good now.
---
For this VERY specific situation, it worked PERFECTLY. I was so confused. I knew AAP was still "there" because I was still auto-accepting quests and stuff, just... no arrow and no window telling me where to head next. Thank you  deeznutsCX! It worked perfectly! =)
---
Go to stranglethorn Vietnam and slaughter the opposite teams LVL 35s that seems to be the go to on my server lol
---
He’s like the navy seal pasta honestly
---
Thank goodness its not fortnite
---
Those things don't happen spontaneously, and unless that person is a complete egomaniac, they'll begin shifting to whoever is going to replace them early enough to prevent it from causing problems.
---
Idk I haven't had too many bad mages yet. Some are def overaggessive on pills because ae all the things. However they usually are the first out of mana. 
---
I did have a hunter make me quit tanks and healers though. Fucker left his pet on aggressive and would constantly pull as well.
---
Keep in mind that the ah has a listing price that isn't refunded, so if you put it up twice you end up losing quite a bit, I think it is 40 silver for a full stack. So if you put it up for 1.79 and it doesn't sell then put it up for 1.59 after, you would have been better off putting it up once for 1.2g.
---
  
---
Ensuring the sale is the top priority
---
I constantly have people tell me this when they find out I use QWES instead of WASD and I don't understand why. 
---
I have been playing like this for over a decade and it works really well for me due to the size of my hands and how much reach I have with my fingers. Every other game I play that used WASD for movement, I end up having to rebind to QWES because the "traditional" movement keys simply do not work for me.
---
Why do other people FREAK OUT about people having different keybinds? I once apped to a raiding guild and they said that I "could not be taken seriously as a raider" due to my "bizarre keybinds" in the screenshot of my UI I was required to post in my application.
---
... and by the end of it you run a small business!
---
Lots of people of all classes need stuff from several bosses. You're gonna have a hell of a time finding a group farming darkmaster.
---
Feel that!! Love being on 50/50 grob
---
I AM WHEEZING
---
Priest, Druid, Hunter /s. Sit with her and go through the classes one by one until she finds one she wants to play.
---
For levelling.
---
Affliction
---
Immolate
---
CoA
---
Siphon Life
---
Fear
---
Drain Life
---
Drain Soul (rank 1)
---
Shadow Bolt
---
Life Tap
---
Those are your best spells to level, avoid everything else unless you find a use.
---
I loved every second of that.
---
Why are there always military vet people arguing in barrens chat? It’s insane how commonly this happens
---
I'll be honest I have no clue what pallys do. I just leave em alone when I see them.
---
Ensures she’ll quit by level 8.  Have her roll a hunter.
---
Reddit would have us stay in that group and wipe another 10 times.
---
mage imo
---
1) not melee, avoiding all the annoyances of positioning 
---
2) will not be asked to heal, which can be frustrating and annoying
---
3) convenient AF with town portals, food and water
---
4) ~~gear doesn't really matter for leveling up~~ a basic cheapass wand is amazing
---
* fireballs in p2 reset aggro of their target
---
* fireballs target the person with the highest threat
---
* 99/100 your MT is not going to have aggro when she lands, it's almost always going to be a warlock or mage
---
* Your MT can sunder her while flying to build back some threat
---
What’s your average ping doing that?
---
Does it require Tiger riding? Wondering if I need darn rep too.
---
There are some hickups every now and then but mostly I've been fine on Gehennas as an alliance.
---
I am enjoying the game. I'm only 42. You're making assumptions and making an ass of yourself.
---
You have aggro from dpsing the entire time.  Tanks basically generate zero threat to her while shes in the air, so everyone passes the tank on aggro table.  She lands and starts murdering everyone who passed tanks.  Should have everyone with a taunt trying to get aggro when she lands. Then stabilize and have MT take taunt.
---
It obviously depends on the individual. Personally for me (rogue main), I would never roll against a hunter for a ranged weapon that is BiS them, even if it were BiS for me. My reasoning is that they are going to benefit exponentially more from the item, than I would.
---
People can recognize when we're being good mages just as often as when we're being bad ones. Just keep being a good one. I am having a great time with it and I haven't played since 2008, and I've gotten many compliments on my playstyle and helpfulness. But maybe I've just retained some of the classic mannerisms and behavior that newer players   lack
---
I highly recommend making a macro instead of dedicating an entire key to just autoattacking.
---
\#showtooltip *abilityname*
---
/cast *abilityname*
---
/Startattack
---
This will make you start autoattacking whenever you use the ability, you can do this for all of your offensive abilities.
---
Go Frost and grind on green mobs. 
---
Your level would probably help people suggest spots.
---
Someone's never walked into the dwarven bunkers in AV I see.
---
That was an empty space exhaust is sides and back intake top and front I donno if it’s the best but it keeps cool
---
Thank you so so much this helps more than you could imagine. I’ll be taking all this advice . Really appreciate you taking the time to help! Hybrid classes can be stressful but really fun and obviously versatile it seems !!! Hahah  thanks again
---
I feel bad taking things from people like I don't deserve it or something. You need to start just mailing them things lol, thats what I've had happen a few times, logging on to mail that's like "WHATEVER YOU ARE TAKING THIS I DONT CARE"etc lol
---
I am playing my 4th mage right now and considering respeccing fire till I get ice barrier. Everyone is frost for good reason, tho. Fire is excellent but extremely reliant on cooldowns for the big Pyro macro burst, which is only really great at higher level, plus it's mana heavy, there's less survivability and ability to kite which mages really need, and huge fireball and scorch crits make it harder to control aggro. If you're raiding, fire is useless. However my current mage is only level 22 and I'm seriously considering a fire respec so I can get some sweet Scorch crits with ignite plus it's very fun to score some huge criticals like this, probably highest crits in the game are from Pryroblast and fireball. Single target dps is still viable and aoe farming is only really worth the time after we get the mount at 40 and some better frost talents. In pvp, it's amazing to unleash a huge pyroblast macro burst every three minutes on some unsuspecting fellow in the battlegrounds, can easily one shot people this way.
---
Invrease your max camera distance and zoom out. It's in your interface options somewhere.
---
I'd have just left fuck em
---
Ahh yes. I'll buy it at a high price
---
I can see why ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Do you pop shield block at all?
---
wild steel bloom, the price shown in tooltip is less than half of the cheapest ones in AH, has been like it for a couple days too, ive reinstalled the mod and it didn't sort it
---
Cannonmaster is quite commonly skipped. A lot of extra trash that use bubbles and afaik doesnt drop prebis for anyone
---
It’s more than just that, is a mindset of maximizing your gold every step of the way. Only buy the spells you need. Figure out what herbs are valuable and keep an eye out for them. Find under crafted tailoring items and sell them for profit. Look for items that you can buy for cheap and resell for more, etc.
---
What's life like in Azeroth?
---
Right before your raid
---
His rebuttle is to act like your a virgin with no life because your sick of retards posting the same shit over and over 🤣😂😅 fuck off wooden spoon
---
You need some chill mate
---
Did any RP guilds progress to Naxx? Don't mean to insult, just legitimately curious, I figured with how late in the game and how few pvp/pve realms went through it the raid was barely touched by the RP realms. I know nothing of RP realms other than that hilarious post from a while back where a guild was upset when their dwarf GM was insulted.
---
Wow that’s super helpful to know. That makes a lot of sense since there is so much time between casts. So spirit allows you to basically level without needing to cooldown it seems . Are there items that drop that literally say mp5 on them?  I haven’t heard the term
---
Used much when I played vanilla in 2005 but I also was a total noob .
---
Lost the Jed trinket roll 8 times so far. I'm not destined for this trinket.
---
&gt;It's not the group's responsibility to advertise what bosses they're skipping. 
---
Yeah it definitely is, or bad times will ensue. Nonstandard behavior needs to be mentioned in your LFG advertisement. Skipping cannon master is nonstandard as fuck. It's not FF in UBRS, or gargoyle in scholo...it's an expected boss.
---
In $year.
---
i mean it's 15 years on and stuff is more accessible, I don't doubt naxx will be raided by rp guilds
---
Nothing better than being like 2 hits from death and you see parry Dodge miss miss and corpse run.
---
There is, but it's few and far between till raids
---
No I think he doesn’t agree that it’s just unlucky. He agrees that unlucky was a part of it tho. Damn warlock. Always defiling the light.
---
&gt;Gotta keep those repair vendors in business... and on my server, those alliance vendors business is a boomin.
---
*laughs in gnome rogue*
---
Same here. Been in 8 guilds already and they were all pretty lame.
---
They don't die, don\`t slow down and autoattack you to death. And their stun lasts approx. for a week.
---
Nice
---
Indeed
---
I would find out if this is a guild that’s been around or if the “loot council” is a bunch of RL friends. 
---
As many people have said, in classic Master Looter/Council is very common and focusing gear onto specific people is often beneficial to the raid’s overall DPS and it is particularly important that these players SHOW UP to every raid because they are the carries of the raid, hence why officers/GM are typically first to get gear.
---
On the other hand it could be a bunch of friends just trying to gear up quickly, use your own judgement, it’s usually not hard to spot a scummy guild.
---
People tend to leave me alone as a feral Druid. For what I assume are the same reasons I don’t attack Pallies. Ain’t nobody got time for that. Sure you might kill them... but it’s gonna take 10 fucking minutes. 
---
As for killing a feral Druid, chances are I’m just going to shift, HoT, clear poisons, warstomp, regrowth, root you, and run away.
---
A complementary one based on her choice, I’m really open to any. I main a priest, and have Druid and warrior alts.
---
It's so cheap right now.
---
I tried following this but once you get the controller and setting up config, how are your adding keyboard buttons on there? The only option I get is for my controller
---
Yup. I hold everyone to the same standard as I would hold myself. Even guildies.
---
stfu. that's how I'm making money now
---
Bigglesworth is a close ratio
---
Yep
---
I mean, people can be dicks... 
---
&gt;Tigglebitty on the server Mankrik: if you see her, put her on ignore.
---
But this? Yikes. From one anecdote..
---
I just don't see how I wouldn't, if i got down to purification instead of taking lightning mastery I would be pulling decent HPS no? As long as i obviously carry 2 sets for each situation.
---
He had zero grounds for reporting the Mage until that last colorful insult. Don't call people words you can be reported for if you don't want to get reported.
---
*Whoosh*
---
Omg this! This is what the game is about!
---
IIRC the first time they opened up more race/class combos was in Cata.
---
We stack SP :)
---
Undercity rise up!
---
getting rid of wall climbing sucks it was part of vanilla for world exploration
---
Shadow priest or level the hunter
---
THANK YOU! Didn't realize I had missed out on 5 years of history here
---
This is the plan honestly. If there’s an overwhelming majority leaning to one specific class I’d nudge her in that direction.
---
&gt;5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)__*.1%__
---
Yeah this seems legit
---
Get improved blizzard
---
Nice. 
---
Could you tell me the name of the addon that makes your actionbars look like that? The darker theme looks great.
---
Which one lol
---
No my solution is xserver bgs with matching horde and alliance populations.  Bliz have already said they are doing the xserver part
---
Gordo is my boi
---
Of course wiping endlessly sucks, that's different from measuring in x/hour. The post you replied to said the mage complained they could aoe farm for more xp/hour. Really the only way to get that is a perfect fast run and/or an aoe/cleave dungeon fest.
---
Lorti UI
---
Oh okay that would make a lot of sense. My favorite time playing was still, and might always be, between WOTLK and Cataclysm. That's also when I had the most time dedicated to playing, so that might be a factor.
---
Maybe I should go back in and get one then, it'd still be a great upgrade for me at almost 40.
---
Lol is a 17" Asus ROG scar II. GL704.
---
It's my work laptop.
---
That's one of the moves that give us a bad name. Just make sure you have dismiss on your bar and summon key bond. If there's any jump just dismiss the pet. 
---
As well as running out of arrows in instances, the pet chasing fleeing mobs pulling other mobs, multi shot hitting other groups or breaking CC or pulling other mobs. Leaving growl on in instances ect. Oh and leaving aspect of the pack on when in combat, another classic.
---
If the pull goes wtf and the tank dies or is close I'll activate growl to pull some aggro off him.
---
What I've always done to stand out, is if the tank doesnt request a ice trap I drop it on front of the healer. If the healer aggros it traps the mob or if someone else does I'll tag it and pull it to the trap. This alone helps you stand out and every instance I'm told nice trap or something along the lines. 
---
There are a lot of uses for our tool kit but also a lot of ways for us to mess up and turn pulls into wipes.
---
I ran a instance 4 times with the same tank and healer rotating DPS the last run we added the healers guildy another hunter and the run was rocky as all get out. He was breaking all CC pulling aggro by msing on c/d, breaking my traps the tank was pulling mobs into. The mobs would go all over the place. Hed then FD once they got to them causing the tank to chase them the mobs to split the healer. It was a prime example of how one player can wreck havoc. Of course other classes can do this as well its just wr have a stigma so it stands out.
---
70
---
FB,CoC,AE... NAH LETS CAST A FROSTBOLT AT 50 HP. Kinda glad he did though, that was hilarious.
---
Also he said “Like 40 years old” which implies “about” or “close to”. I think it’s fair to say someone that is 35-38 is close to 40 yes? Not sure if you know how english works so I thought I would enlighten you.
---
But then the lock uses felhunter dispel on themselves
---
There’s no such thing as luck with a shaman. The elements decide who lives or dies. We just click dem buttons homie.
---
Honestly from my experience, people pre-30 have no idea how tanking works and WILL wipe you and blame you for it. Don't get discouraged by this since most dps have no idea how to play in groups at low levels, just keep researching and be confident. My first deadmines I had this hunter keep pulling before me because we were going too slow (""only"" 3 mobs at once like bitch our healer is a paladin in greys and whites). Then he made fun of me for having spirit on my gear. Lol.
---
So goofy
---
All I’m saying is the rng of that wf proc was **by far** the deciding factor in that mage dying.
---
Paladins acting like they’re better than everyone else smh...
---
There's an 8s CD on that tho, and possibly ate a stack of chilling.
---
Ohhh, makes sense. As long as it keeps cool that's the main thing. Your setup gives me an idea. Might give it a try for some lazy gaming. I feel like if I smoked a bowl sitting in that, I'd probably pass out. Haha
---
Or like you can stop being a vagina
---
We would hear about them far more.
---
Dude go to 42. Also only group with people doing 5+ that shit will be done in the blink of an eye
---
Good luck. Don't stress too much. Know how to Los pull. Watch your healers mana. Don't be too worried if you lose agro on a mob.
---
People will be very forgiving of a new tank. Tell them it's your first time tanking.
---
Also... be on the higher end of the level range for the dungeon. This isn't strictly necessary but it will make for a smoother ride.
---
Don't be. OP paid for a boosting service and got caught.
---
Dont feed the troll ladies and gentlemen
---
i guess this is the Alliances "Barrens chat"?
---
What lvl does my alt need in order to lvl tailoring up to 170?
---
But what keybind is drain mana??? Bottom left bar first icon.  Bound to 1/2???? Lol
---
*laughs in warrior*
---
From the point of how the mechanics work weapon speed doesn't really matter much as long as you do not use a dagger, because that one will lower the damage of instant attacks. Aside from that it depends on how you manage your rage. Faster weapons will give you smaller bursts of rage, while slower weapons will give you larger amounts but at longer intervals.
---
When you get thrash blade and any other decent OH
---
He is dead again? I assume it's the same orc, since he has similar armor, which I saw dead a few times in reddit's screenshots.
---
I don't think frost is garbage. But to me. I prefer fire. 
---
Every time someone says a fire mage can't kite I literally show em how. Sure I don't have as many long lasting slows but using ur knockbacks, sluws, and snares correctly, you can mage tank quite a bit. Those moments ur relying on a cc to slow an enemy, I'm just burning thru them
---
The one and only downside to fire is the mana. I drink a lil more often. But it isn't much more and I make my own drink  ofc. I will be doing what dungeons and quests I need to be geared up as i level but I feel like my fire mage has taken out quests easier than my hunter , rogue, or druid has. Each have aspects they excel in but as a fire mage I can melt twins in pvp without being one, i can be on add duty or boss, i know later some will be immune to fire but until those raids ill  be fire spec. I'm not the horn tooting type but I feel like fire mage are downed a lot. I've yet to see a frost mage get near my recount in 5mans. And I've seen myself surviving easier than they do in quests a few times now . 
---
Mass dmg is better than cc, sometimes. Not always.
---
Paladin and warrior are the most straightforward.  Right click attack, maybe click something else.
---
Mage is the easiest range, just pick frost or fire and stick with it. 
---
Hunters are easy to play but have a lot of small taxes that you have to be aware of.  Train your pet, get ammo, feed your pet, etc
---
Warlocks have good dps but demons can turn people off, for newer gamers. Class is literally about demons, eternal damnation, and toturing your opponents.  Not a good choice for a fresh gamer not used to lore.
---
Druids have a lot of elements to them that can be fun and has a very high ceiling if she wants to go deep into how to be the best.  Also has a lot of options for leveling and end game, if you both make it.
---
Rogues are straightforward but again, you know, murder and assassination and all that.  Aside from that lore aspect, fun class, high damage, always needed. Also good for a pvp newbie if that's your server.
---
Shamans are good but remembering your totems is a pain.  Still, cool lore.
---
Priests have two options, healing or melt your face.  Lots of tools, but very fragile in groups.  Dps priests are fun to play and one of the best levelers.  Healing is fun too, if you like it.  Just don't level your priest without a wand.  Most important piece of gear.
---
\*\*Druid Thorns\*\*
---
It appears that it does not scale with spell power or bonus nature damage equipment. But i cant find anything online that flat out states that it does not scale. What i have read online is that it "does" scale with spellpower at a small percentage but im now a level 38 balance druid stacking int gear and have not seen the numbers change except when a new rank is purchased.
---
Is my Int too low still? is it only the final rank of the spell that scales? Or is it flat damage unaffected by stats during 1.12 patch?
---
i want to be a big "very" prickely chicken. if anyone knows for certain how it works please let me know.
---
Thanks!
---
yes it was
---
I bet you needed on them
---
Agree, always play mage with a druid alt, it's upsetting that mages are considered noobs, it's just the retail kids giving us a bad name, surely.
---
Scarlet Monestary Catherdral farming. When you get so bored of that you wanna die go farm RFD.
---
If you spend levels 35 to 40 spamming SM cath you'll have plenty of gold for mount.
---
Also. You do not need to buy every talent! Starting at 30 cut back on buying talents, only upgrade the bare essentials until you get your mount. 
---
And this goes without saying but NEVER buy gear, and dont level up professions unless your just collecting crafting iteme and selling them.
---
But if he wouldn’t have ignorantly blinked in range the rng wouldn’t have taken place. So wouldn’t the reason he died be mainly because of his choice to blink in range. If I put a button in front of you that had a 50% chance of killing you, and you press it l (resulting in your death) would you blame yourself for pressing the button or rng for killing you? Paladins are better than everyone else ;)
---
Yeah as a Hunter I've been consistently out-DPSing mages in dungeons lately. I'm super proud of it but I don't think it should be that way. At least that's not how I remember it being. Then again, this is my first time playing a class other than Warrior.
---
This statement is super true. I stay away from tanking instances until I’m 1-2 comfortable levels above the recommended.  When maintaining aggro on multiple mobs it’s super important to manage your time—misses/resists or idly waiting to get rage all compound into a snowball effect.
---
Okay so I just looked at the full path to get there.

Big picture mode &gt; settings(cogwheel) &gt; base configuration &gt; desktop configuration &gt; now hit the X button to bring up configs &gt; templates &gt; keyboard(wasd) and mouse. From there it’s all up to you what to do. I assigned mb1-mb8 to 1-8 on keyboard and assigned the ABXY pad buttons to R, B, C, space but you can assign anything really. It’s very customizable
---
Long time shaman player here, that mages death was 100% on the mage. That blink killed him. He could have walked into range and wanded the shaman to death. Save silence for the healing attempt and hit em with whatever instant cast spell is off cooldown. 
---
WF goes off all the damned time (20% chance) so if you choose to get into melee range when you can easily avoid it, that’s on you.
---
I hope retail corrects itself (in many ways) and gets rid of transmog!   It’s ok to look like crap and it’s even better to look amazing when you get the gear.
---
I remember crapping myself when I’d see a high warlord geared orc warrior coming my way.   He earned  the look!
---
I’ve lost the Jed trinket 10 times and my last roll was a 95, I’ve given up at this point
---
Only due to easy choke points.   Silithus is more akin to STV.
---
["And this...is to go...even further...beyond..."](https://youtu.be/5vWqnKhQhUM?t=48)
---
Especially since there’s newer transfer servers getting figured out and as more people hit 60 people will try to shop around for a different guild.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Anybody else wish their night elf could have eyebrows without facial hair ?
---
100% agree
---
is that one on the left an addon to watch twitch streams?
---
Screw alts, I can't even figure out what I want to level first. I've got 6 characters between 10 and 17, and a level 30 priest that I've basically abandoned because I wanted to go hit things with a pointy stick.
---
Health regen items are a complete waste of item budget. Consider having a level 60 char with 4000 hp and an epic Lifestone that regs 10 hp/5s: it will take almost an hour for that gem to regenerate the whole life bar.
---
It's crazy how no matter what you say about vanilla raiding someone always comes in to talk about how it is not as hard as mythic.  It was literally the second thing I said.  NOBODY IS SAYING VANILLA RAIDS ARE AS HARD AS MYTHIC
---
My 3 year old always asks me to press the spacebar and has a blast when I allow her to. She will sit there and wait for me to say okay press”insert key” now. She recently discovered the hearthstone and has on a number of times clicked it while I left the room for a minute and I’d come back to my character in a different place.
---
Agi/Crit &gt; AP/Str &gt; Stam/Int for Enhancement until at least 33% Crit chance, then AP/Str &gt; Agi/Crit
---
Nope, i disabled the addon that shows stats in character info.
---
I love loch modal at that time of day, Bob Ross would be proud if your well timed screenshot. It’s art!
---
That\`s why you run either lib+arm or arm+cath, never just arm.
---
I thought this was a joke, does this happen often?
---
“Can you help me find my dog?”
---
(Yes I know it’s BC, gank me)
---
whatever class she thinks looks fun.  dont pick for her or she might not like the results and get turned off from the game
---
Just Eagle gear or geared for that much hp/mana?
---
/u/H82xw9faeudp5AZfty9u how does it make you really feel
---
It's that big orange ball of pixels at the top of ur screen. Doesn't really do much just there for fun.
---
Ravage requires stealth, shred doesn't. If you intend on dpsing dungeons as a cat, you'll want shred in your rotation, seeing as you can be behind the target!
---
Shred is the druid equivalent of the rogue's backstab. You can use it when parked behind mobs, even when you're not in stealth.
---
Shred doesn’t require prowl to use, so you can use it while DPSing if someone else is holding aggro.
---
I laugh when I see these.  Just saying “fast run” doesn’t mean it will be one lmao.
---
Yes
---
Interesting, guess it's a setting to have them unmarked, I've played with Bartender for too many years then...
---
And you actually press 8 for Blizzard and 9 for Poly?
---
No problem, I forgot to mention you can shift click abilities in your spellbook when writing macros; helps with formatting and avoiding typos.
---
And if you have abilities with varying ranks then simply writing the name without specifying which rank should make it automatically use the highest available, so you dont have to update the macro every time you learn a new one. Im not 100% on this though so test it out yourself to make sure.
---
Yeah, Blizz customer service has traditionally been great. Just a simple:
---
"Hey I realm transferred on X but accidentally clicked the wrong one, my guild that I've been with since release went to Y but I went to Z are you able to transfer me to Y so I don't have to start all over again? Thanks for your time." would solve it.
---
Bobby b?
---
God damn legend
---
Fuck yeah.
---
WASH YER BACK
---
It wasn't a stigma with hunters, it was earned.
---
What lol? Lock/Mage/Rogue is an amazing combo for dungeons and I tend to out DPS them on smaller packs (and bosses) or at least keep up throughout as Rogue. It's also really not hard to find a tank that doesn't need that specific piece of leather gear. At this point I'm just missing Truestrike/Dal'rend because you have to roll against so many people in UBRS. Other dungeons are not an issue as Rogue if you plan your party properly.
---
Same.  Went rogue and never looked back
---
Awesome, thank you. I'll definitely give this a try!
---
Maybe they just want to earn their own stuff? There is a pride in making your own way in the world and not taking handouts.
---
You dont understand that every server is full. They offered server transfers already. Mine is mostly 50/50. You are under the thinking that server balance means no one will raid. You have never played vanilla.
---
I've loaned over 100g to guildies for their mounts, usually 10g or less.  Every one of them payed me back within 48 hours, often with extra gold.  People would just rather get their mount ASAP then go back to leveling.
---
Yeah the thing is if they get any charge off they’ve already hamstringed me, so you’re saying drop trap literally as the charge ?
---
Hypnoitic blade is a really really good weapon, its only a little worse than the best weapon you can get before raids, i've been grinding pre-raid bis for weeks now and i still use the Hypnotic blade
---
Blizzard liked Horde more.
---
You can see it leash to its original spot after the mage died
---
I am a hunter and I approve this message
---
I play on Deviant Delight and it's so much friggin fun
---
Role Play based world PvP raids on the Barrens and Hillsbrad are so fun. I play in a Dwarf and Gnome only guild, just imagine being some poor lvl 25 undead leveling in Hillsbrad when a Dwarf army rolls over the hill and evaporates you.
---

---
Hunter/rogue and out of those two id go for rogue since they have an advantage in open world and in pvp in general with the stealth/vanish, its also nice to open up on your target and stunlock it until dead. 
---
Ofcourse i chose a hunter.
---
I've seen (and been ganked by) skull level players. Doesn't mean they're over 60, it's just the level difference between you and them.
---
Don't know exactly but i guess its just lore. Do some research on it and you'll most likely find out 🙂
---
To be fair, whoever at Blizzard designed Multi-Shot's new animation in 7.2 was clearly under the impression that Multi-Shot was a cone attack.
---
Mages and their routine of pulling in loads of mobs is what makes me scared to level a tank.
---
I like slow dungeon pacing.
---
I feel like a lot of players will take his name as a challenge
---
Mine are very basic. Just the core kill rotation, abilities that aren’t bound I use the touchpad as a mouse to click (gross I know).
---
You can configure your keybinds and their layout using the settings in Steam Link on desktop
---
yes, the best pre-raid weapon only have 5 more Spell damage, same int and no spirit, so its a VERY good weapon, even at 50
---
His philosophizing is not beyond reproach, but he's a pretty good villain, though. Plus he cosplayed as Satan for a while there, so that's neat.
---
Best EU server to start a new horde character on with pvp as only focus? Kinda concerned about the one im on will be dead or very low pop in 2-3 months so might as well start on a new one.
---
Would be nice to have some screenshots. Not that I don't trust you, but still.
---
This is pretty much how I got it to work on my 2014 Acer C720: 2GB ram, Intel Celeron, with WoW installed on an SD card.   
---
It took like 16 hours over 3 days and I only get 1-15 FPS pretty much all of the time, but it's sufficient for checking the AH and solo questing!   
---
It doesn't take much experience or brains, I'm a total novice with Linux; it just takes exceptional patience and willingness to keep trying different things when it doesn't work.
---
You’re still able to get under Stormwind jumping a wall, but wall jumping seems different still than vanilla
---
"I'm not a furry" okay buddy.
---
Not in Classic.
---
So many retards in this sub posting dumbass posts about how good the graphics look for a 15 year old game when they have graphics maxed out. The slider tells you what setting classic was you dumbasses.
---
Ok but why would a mage be behind the table?
---
Haha same thing happened to me. Very sad
---
&gt; TBC was super fun time to be a hunter.
---
Yeah pressing 1 macro for all your DPS from start of the expansion to the end was very fun.
---
Except your initial comment crossed out 'naive' in favour of 'unlucky', making the clear implication that you thought he was *not* naive, and merely unlucky. The other poster pointed out how it was a case of both.
---
If you're going to play semantic games at least make sure you know what you're doing...
---
I have my Whirlwind Axe and I'm looking at the quest rewards for SM. Bonebiter is 3 more dps but I'm still using the Crescent of Forlorn Spirits from Duskwood as my tanking weapon so the Sword of Serenity is looking pretty tempting
---
What prices have you been buying at?
---
Hahaha method rejects
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Idk man.  It was so long ago that it really became more of a meme than anything with real validity to it.... that was until a month ago.  The only people on my ignore list are hunters that just destroyed runs and then were toxic on the way out.
---
Sorry should have /s apparently
---
:(
---
Cool thoughts, thanks :)
---
AFAIK there’s no way to see what an item actually sells for - to a 3rd party who isn’t the buyer or the seller, there’s no way to tell the difference between a sold auction and a canceled auction.
---
Happy cake day to me!
---
They also seem to be the new rogues, is the general consensus amongst my friends. Have been ganked by one rogue while levelling, and countless mages. Sometimes they just do dickish things like poly you and then run away for laughs
---
Does the scan data in Auctioneer expire automatically after a while, or is there someway to configure it to?  I would hope that it would weigh newer data much more heavily than older data...?  But I don't know
---
You don't need to be in melee range to shatter combo tho.
---
If pally stun lasts a week, warlock and rogue cc lasts the heat death of the universe
---
against warrior:
---
sw:p, shield yourself then start casting mind control.  nobody wants to get mind controlled, so he's probably going to interrupt the cast.  now you're free to cast your holy tree for 10 seconds.  rinse repeat.  keep your dots up, renew, and bait him into interrupting your shadow school.
---
This seems like he was saying he didnt use it on that pull.  
---
He clearly didnt use it 78 times in one pull.
---
Half the people who blame hunters are the ones who did the dirty.
---
Sheep them when they pop freedom. Warriors and Pallys are food to mages.
---
I’m not so worried, when I played on private server BWL was already out and many people already 60 but I didn’t have much trouble finding groups for dungeons except the longer ones, ST and such.   Seeing as how classic is more welcoming to casual players than private servers I think there will be groups for most dungeons. It might take a little longer but the groups will still show up.
---
While I agree I’ve always been pro alliance so I know I’m bias. I was just wondering if any of you guys who played back in the day knew.
---
The guy who died in OP's clip learned this today.
---
Yeah I showed them hard!
---
What you should do is lose that leveling guide and take a look at a map with all the zones’ level ranges. It’s a big world and there’s plenty to do outside of the very limited scope of one of those speedleveling guides.
---
Jail, Baelgar, arena.
---
Ups, i edited the mistakes. Sorry English is not my first Language.^^
---
Instead of making 2 chars, are there other things to do solo? Like grinding for gear or money?
---
&gt;you should appreciate the offer
---
Buddy, guild invites are a dime a dozen. We know you're asking everyone you can so it's not exactly special
---
Yes it does. Fear and death coil are affliction spells. I believe you only need two points for pvp hit cap
---
Conveniently
---
what a fantastic question!
---
If you have an unhealthy grudge:
---
* #shit_list_macro
---
* /cast spellthatiusetogrind
---
* /target assholeplayername1
---
* /target assholeplayername2
---
* /target assholeplayername3 (you get the idea)
---
* /script SetRaidTarget("target", 6);
---
You're not entitled to my time. I'm not running the dungeon because my group members want me to, I'm running it because *I* want to, and if that stops being the case I'll leave the group. 
---
Imo asking people to act against their own best interest is the real asshole behavior.
---
me not that kind of orc
---
Keep questing and combine it with some brd runs for better gear, once ur 57, if u have a guild of friends to play u can do the last three levels in scholo/strat within a day.
---
Kind of reminds me of Guts' Berserker armor in Berserk
---
Resist is to spells what Miss is for melee attacks.
---
Ya. I'm level eighteen in all greens and looking to practice on RFC. I always played Ally too, so new role in new dungeons. Thanks for the encouragement.
---
ohhhhhhhhh...frig.... So ive had gear with +spell damage but it was such a small amount. Ill do what you advise, thanks a ton!
---
Your other left.
---
That would have been a perfect segway into asking how satisfied he was with his long distance service provider.  You're never gonna make it as a telemarketer at this rate.
---
&gt;Whilst you can clear MC with a PvP build, you might want to consider this: mage is the most popular dps class in the game right now.
---
Guilds are happy to take many mages into a raid. You'll have no problem getting a spot. Loot competition is the real issue.
---
It won't make enough difference to matter. Just pick whichever you prefer
---
I think they made it clear that they don't care to group with you, honestly.
---
Yeah but totally true. Had a tank in scholomance pull the 2 mobs to the party and leave the poly-ed one where it was. Everyone can still dps as per normal then kill the poly later
---
Just dueld my whole group as a HOLY priest and two warriors and a hunter were getting MAD cause they couldn’t get my health to move.... u must be doing something wrong.
---
they are cloth though
---
People gotta learn somehow. Not everyone is an expert, and they certainly weren't the first time this game was released.
---
No
---
Well, there's a video above that breaks down how it works. It is basically chain lightning, it just hits your target, the nearest one to that, and the nearest one to that. So yeah, it can go around LoS.
---
Ha do you also have an ! above your head?
---
Just the warlock one
---
Why do you have 8 (or 9%) hit lol
---
Sheep us and we'll just sit and heal through whatever bullshit you throw next
---
No? What no? Can you be more specific 🙂
---
horde not knowing left and right kek
---
Just had a mage need roll on the sm Cath head piece that he was already wearing...seems like a hunter thing to do
---
Does Agility affect the chance for spells to crit?
---
There's really no reason to swap until you're heading into raid. If you've got the 6% hit or whatever it is for DW, then you can swap early, but otherwise just stay 2h.
---
Rogues are usually expected to kick over warriors pummel.
---
Getting Pet and feign death
---
Fortunately wow gms will actually take action and return your mats/gold and ban the scammer. Make sure you report asap.
---
She's not blonde.
---
Reee.
---
Maybe if it was my fault, but it's a 5 man group and it only takes 1 goof ball to ruin a run
---
The point is I can reset you till your oom over and over. A paladin has no ability to kill a mage.
---
Freedom? Sheep.
---
Bubble? Ice Block
---
HoJ? Blink
---
Heal? Counter Spell
---
Fake Cast? Sheep eat drink till you're oom.
---

Locks understand threat mechanics.

YOU HAVE BECOME THE VERY THING YOU SWORE TO DESTROY.
---
5% fee so anything you can sell above 42s 11c is more than bandages... also you don't have to sit around and make the bandages.
---
I'm not into caster classes nor pvp. Who can explain me what I just witnessed
---
Or because you openly admit to watching anime, one of the worst abominations the human race has created.
---
Nice.
---
Learn how to take a screenshot
---
Putting in my ticket for the mage. Ports and food conjuring make the game more friendly for a newcomer and even if she is poor at playing the class she can still get by.
---
While walocks and hunters are fun, managing ammo/soul shards may turn her off in the long run.
---
At some point there's a break even where having the mount actually lets you farm faster by enough that it's a net gain to you.
---
1/200 drop rate. Rare but in the game.
---
Ok. So it is expected that the transition will be a bit chaotic and a couple DPS will potentially die. So the failure in the PUGs is probably more to do with people don't run to the center the group isn't good at handling that bit of chaos.
---
Perfect, just had not seen one posted yet, so was not sure. Thanks
---
Al dungeons are 100% worth for the quest run. The quest run usually take a loooong time but the rewards from the quest + the rewards are usually very high compared to open world quests.
---
I just wanted to make sure before time investment. I assumed it was. I had not seen one posted on the AH either.
---
Uhhh...noo?
---
Rogues and mages using CD's still lose to just fury using bloodthurst,heroic strike. The only reason they aren't winning right now is Warrior early/pre-raid is weaker then Mage/rogue. In like 2 months Non-warriors will be forever 2nd/3rd
---
They wouldn’t take action in the past. A trade agreement is a trade agreement.
---
I don't think he learned anything tbh lol. He coulda CoC, Fire Blasted, or AE to kill the shaman...but he frost bolts and dies to a mob walking at him. Dude played like a bot.
---
Even after the Shaman RNG'd mage shouldn't have died.
---
&gt;warlock and rogue cc lasts the heat death of the universe
---
Don't they?
---
I suggest you go to a website like classic wowhead and search the quests name, then on the right side of the page it should tell you if it is part of a Series or chain quest line.
---
I did not play anything besides troll mage since 2005. 
---
Please don't judge me.
---
Good for you man. I’m just letting other people know you don’t have to do that if you like using the default keybinds.
---
Honestly, I found the picture of sitting Jaina and just rolled with it.
---
"OK tough guy... what do YOUR long cooldowns do?"
---
"Every 30 minutes, I win."
---
When I reset in SM the first PVP flagged horde I tab to gets a hammer stun. 
---
No particular rhyme or reason other than fuck the horde

Would this work:

Ok, just because asked nicely, but hey I hear you mommy callin, I think it's past your bedtime, time to get off.

I found this Spotify playlist on another thread some time ago. Listened to it. It's honestly perfect for me. 
---
Lofi bishop radio. First time I'd heard of something like this.

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1KXnEIACMJ83lEdgmIh9wt?si=LNikAX1kSByDL_0k_38aXw
---
In the same way that outside snacks aren’t allowed in movie theaters
---
No, it does not hit enemies behind you. There is still some sort of aim/cone check.
---
Repost
---
For Pvp id recommend soul link which is the final move in Demonology. I spend 31 in that and then the rest in affliction to get increased resistance to casting knockback on life drain, instant corruption and nightfall. Demonology just allows for you to really be one of the tankiest classes in pvp. In one v ones demonology is considered to be the best by a lot of people.
---
Only need 2/3 improved blizzard too because of cone of colds slow effect!
---
Lol yes, I'm going to let children insult me without repercussions when there's literally a "repercussions" button right there.
---
This is why banish is the best cc
---
Athene is actually a pretty good dude considering all of the fundraising he has done over the years.
---
No, it's a chrome extension called "picture in picture" so far I've only ever tried watching YouTube with it, but somewhere in these comments someone posted another thing that does is and lets you watch twitch in a little picture mode like that
---
Nope that wasn't in until wrath.
---
I will tell you this, as a pvp fanatic and having played a hunter, rogue, and paladin to 60+
---
As a hunter this go around in classic, I fear no man.
---
But that.. *thing* [Sacrifice] scares me.
---
Especially sacrifice into demonology instant summon another voidealker second sacrifice. There is almost nothing I can do.
---
Judging from their history you're spot on.
---
Did you spec prot 52-60? Im arms atm and i can tank a little bit but im tempted to just go prot and smash
---
Link me proof that the logout timer is 5 minutes. I’ll wait.
---
Doesn’t have to do with the video I’m looking for.
---
Well I can tell you that I took this screenshot and have the saved file on my desktop xD
---
I learned recently that the way around this is that you can sit down and eat even with DoTs on you, if you've killed the warlock and left combat.
---
I just got my pet and it seems like it'll be doing most of the tanking for me, are the potions still worth it then?
---
As mage who played from wrath to post cataclysm, now a new mage in classic. Sorry for the rude mages, Fire mage here
---
There now you don't see it, its deleted just for you, now you can go about your night/day without seeing it. Have a nice whatever time of day it is for ya, scrub.
---
For version 8.2 but for all i know it might work
---
When in Stealth, use Ravage.
---
When outside of stealth you use Shred obviously
---
Hunters are great because they have a learning curve and it feels good to rise above it. Then you can look snidley at people waiting to call you at as you wreck face.
---
It is a bug, healthbar.lua has code in it to detect RMH and adjust accordingly, if it's not working, it's a bug.
---
What I find strange is you've advised to change lines 79 and 80, these lines are supposed to only be executed if RMH is NOT enabled.  
---
This is 76 - 81:
---
    if RMH then
---
        f.state.health_cur, f.state.health_max = RMH.GetUnitHealth(f.unit)
---
    else
---
        f.state.health_cur = UnitHealth(f.unit)
---
        f.state.health_max = UnitHealthMax(f.unit)
---
    end
---
Lmfao the windfury was like I'm not having this shit happen today
---
This is good stuff, thanks!
---
Tool reference!
---
Wait, they decided to block you over this?  Woooooooow.
---
Eh, just because the druid is tanking that dungeon, doesn't mean they are leveling with that spec.
---
I myself have been tanking more than healing in the dungeons, and I'm Balance spec. I need that INT gear.
---
what's a good starter pet for hunters? im mostly looking at pve. im playing horde, am level 15. in loch modan but can move if needed.
---
Doubt it’s my internet. Have like 24 ping and I never get kicked while questing. Only when afk. I’ve gotten kicked 30 seconds after I moved the character. I know because I was reading someone on my other screen. 
---
It’s not once or twice either. It’s consistent. And it’s def under 10-20 minutes.
---
Pretty hilarious
---
Imagine a wf proc with hand of justice Jesus christ
---
My buddies told ne they were having a really bad time in several of the zones after stv.
---
I'm waiting for my crimson whelp to sell :)
---
or time. what’s the difference?
---
if you want pvp, it is usually better to be Alliance since most servers have more hordes, meaning you will get more targets as Alliance than vice versa.
---
I'm going to rp as a deaf mute on your server.
---
So you just won an auction, haven't even collected it from the mailbox yet, and some random person messages you asking to buy something they don't even know you have...
---
If you hover over a stat in your character window the game will tell you exactly what that stat will do for that character
---
Yea.. about that, what has happened to all the mages? I've always mained a lot during the "classic" era, vanilla up to wotlk and on several servers. I have always seen mages as a threat, especially as sm/ruin on vanilla, and without felhunter it's a straight up loss. 
---
Now during classic they.. suck? I've been jumped by so many mages at max level, they CC my fire spells, iceblock after my first fear, always try to get close and they just seem cocky. I got jumped by this one mage and I could kite him with dots, if I went too close he tried to polymorph me at max range so I could just step out of it, reenter and throw more dots. I haven't met a decent mage so far, hell, one even silenced my succubus seduce so I could freely fear him.
---
You got room for AK racing chairs?
---
Just like any other, yes killing stuff while multiboxing is a lot easier, but if you're questing, you want to keep them all at the same level, so you also need to find all the loot items on each character, I was messing around with multiboxing a couple weeks ago, was just doing 3 mages, and yeah everything instadied, but those loot quests were rough, so for professions I imagine the same, but the good thing is, since they are all you, you can easily trade money and mats to whichever char needs it
---
There's a better blue staff from a wc quest btw. 7 int, stam, and spirit. 
---
Starts with the quest to explore the oases up in northish barrens. Then you plant a seed in a different oasis. Then you kill turtles in the oases. Then you run to tb to turn it in. 
---
Worth it imo. Better than the staff in wc and bfd so it'll last a good few lvls!
---
Level 10...  it's an amazing leveling spec.
---
I’m the same way, warrior, and only buying talents that I need rather than everything. 
---
I’ve also been levelling my trade skills and first aid as I go and not been doing a lot of grinding, mostly questing. Didn’t get my mount til level 43 where I actually grinded for the gold.
---
Known bug. https://www.wowhead.com/news=295171/wow-classic-hotfix-for-buffs-falling-off-before-cap-and-aura-problems
---
They seem to still work on a Hotfix.
---
No, people didn't wait for jokerd to know this class was great.
---
&gt;  Wearing a casual 3 piece T1 
---
You aren't a casual.  There's nothing casual about being 60 already.
---
At 43, you should be able to start running Uldaman and hope for The Rockpounder. Next up after that is Zul'Farrak and its Chief's Enforcer, if you don't get a The Rockpounder, which probably won't happen since it has a pretty low drop rate. You can also go back to Cathedral and work towards a Mograine's Might, or even Armory and try for a Ravager.
---
I wouldn't bother buying a weapon unless you can get it for exceptionally cheap, since you'll likely be replacing it within a few levels anyway.
---
I am a level 12 Rogue and my LW skill is level 68 it wont let me go to 75 because all of my crafting items are green. I am dumbfounded and don't know how to get the apprentice leather working skill. I also tried the other trainer and even skinning but they won't work either. I honestly don't know what to do any help would be appreciated.

edit: formatting
---
edit 2: never mind i have down syndrome i had checked ones i already learned and not the available ones.
---
No if u change TAB to attack, it will lose its ability to switch target
---
We're all recruits in Barrens chat
---
Usually they are, I was more suggesting this be restated once group is formed in case people were recruited elsewhere. You are definitely correct on the point about reserves after a group has formed though, I would be pissed as well.
---
I have nothing to ask or contribute but as a person who only started playing in Cata and quit in Legion but DAMN vanilla warlock is fun. In retail I was belf retri pala and warlock kinda has the same feel to me? Very easy to play as solo so I love that. Been leveling 90% affliction build with succubus.
---
That sounds nasty.
---
I mean like because none of it is BiS and considered 'not great' gear but I switch it up to get my 3 piece. Im not min maxing everything l, i wear the loot I get. Feels pretty casual to me.
---
I, in no way, referred to myself, the player as a casual anything, sorry for offending you.
---
Horde in loch modan? There's nothing there for you, you should be in the Barrens.
---
As for a good pve pet: cats or gorillas.
---
It will be. It was answered in the AMA they hosted on this Subreddit I believe.
---
Messed up 45 levels ago by picking rogue! Now im a priest and I can level without bandages and potions when I fight 2 mobs
---
Tfw you are a Druid tank and get no one asking you to tank.
---
We have better access to BRD
---
Yeah that's fair
---
Every healer's main spec is a DPS spec until they're 55-60. Most people only run each dungeon once and barely spend ~15 hours of /played in their healing set, compared to the 7 days (or whatever) of /played in their DPS set.
---
If anything, anyone else with an interest in healing should be free to roll on the healing gear.
---
classic
---
permafrost and improved blizzard are the most important ones. A point in improved frost nova may help just for making the cool down a bit shorter. Improved cone of cold, frost channeling, and arctic reach are all good for more damage, less mana usage, more range. Pick up ice block and ice barrier for oh shit moments, and the talent that increases damage is good too.
---
Also important thing to remember, Blizzard can't crit, so Shatter is not good, and winter's chill is not good.
---
Whereabouts was this taken? The signs look familiar
---
Yeah but what are you doing with your other points?
---
Did you kill anyone in game?
---
Ehh.... I keep seeing this parroted opinion pop up. I've never been a fan of judging someone by their class. Its... a stupid thing to do. I've never liked how people mock hunters, and I'm not a fan of people starting to mock mages. I like mages. I like hunters. 
---
I've not replied to these posts, but this time I am. I think the answer is that.... most people are stupid, and if given the tools to make mistakes, or obviously bad decisions, they stand out more. Its hard to tell when the healer is an idiot. They have one button to press, usually. Its hard to tell when the warlock or rogue or warrior or paladin or priest or any such class is an idiot when they have 1-2 button rotations. Mages are given lots of choice, lots of abilities, and for whatever reason..... lots of them are opting in to using arcane explosion... This is ancient memory, but back in the day I remember thinking that mages were a bit dumb who spammed arcane explosion. I also think its pretty dumb when they just throw up a blizzard all the time. 
---
Mage is a class that demands intelligence by the person playing it, for them to not stand out, yeah, even with a 1 button rotation (frostbolt), this goes for hunter too. The hunter that multishots CC'd mobs.... you notice them. The hunter that leaves growl on well past the entire group raging at them to turn it the fuck off. You notice it. The mage who stands in the back and spams frostbolts? They go unseen. They're unremarkable. The hunter that stands in the back and doesn't fuck up? Same thing. Its easier for ranged classes to make mistakes, so their mistakes stand out more, but I have seen plenty of melee go nuts and spam aoe near CC'd mobs.
---
Stop with the "Huntard" and "Mages are the new Huntard" nonsense. It just encourages people to not play the classes they actually want to, all so that you can feel... something? In how you've helped start some weird kind of e-hate movement against a fictional thing.
---
You and I will meet many terrible players, be they a Priest, a Warrior, a Rogue, a Warlock, a Mage a Hunter, etc. Most of us will play more than one character, and you know that the Hunter/Mage you automatically hate without reason likely has another character they play. Its just... stupid. I know my post won't change anything. Hate is a thing that cannot be changed until 100% of people decide to stop doing it, and that just never happens. The fact that these posts exist now, means they will exist forever. But, there's nothing wrong with saying its wrong.
---
Bunched over? I sit up straight in my chair and have plenty of back support I donno why some people think this is going to hurt my back ...
---
indeed
---
That Tauren watching the back...
---
oh yeah. fury is great. pain in the ass to start leveling though, at least my experience.
---
fuck off nuboomer
---
Are you fire spec? because after last night my loins are still burning.
---
Imagine being able to play in the glory days when windfury proccd off of windfury
---
Lmfao what? Casual players don’t ever google for information about what to do in the game? They’ve never hit the end of a zone and said “hmm, I wonder if my time would be better suited somewhere else?” This is some hardcore player mindset? Is “casual player” now reserved to mean someone who doesn’t use outside help for the game. Just gets stuck on quests endlessly and wastes their own time? Some people only have a limited amount of time to play the game, say 1-2 hours a day, because of life. Work/kids/etc. There are tons of casual players who figured if they’re gonna play they should get the most out of their time.
---
Seriously what the fuck dumb ass logic is this? “The game has been out for over a month if you’re level 60 you’re a try hard player.”
---
Mfw warriors think they aren't tanks
---
Imagine actually teleporting into melee range of an enhance shaman wearing cloth.
---
firemaw
---
Just ask him
---
I’ll wait until the mob is at 80% or so and throw a SW:P and a few wand attacks.  Once the mob gets to 20% or so I just wand it down, use Clique and mouseover macros to heal.  No need to target any parties members.
---
”... Unless someone use cc.”
---
And basically anyone that is a dps that wears mail
---
&gt;warrior pops recklessness
---
&gt;blind into re-stealth
---
cute
---
i mean you dont have taunt? no bloodrage and mocking blow? you didnt charge in to build rage? what were you going to do if you got healed and the two mobs made a beeline for the healer?
---
a tank should be able to hold aggro on 2 targets at minimum through anything and 3 targets - especially if you're the one who pulled in the first place - shouldn't really be difficult either
---
But that makes it about as fun as retail...
---
A shockadin won't break Ice Barrier and Mana Shield till AQ40.
---
i don’t really have this problem on grobbulus. much more mages than rogues.
---
I've been spamming sm (started at gy, now in cath) for the last week with healer/shaman/2hwarrior/2hwarrior/2hwarrior with the warriors all being in battle or berserker stance and the shaman having aggro a lot of the time with zero issues.  Warriors in berserker stance may as well be rogues without dodge.This is flat out wrong.
---
Quick question, how are the controls? Are they laggy/unconfortable/not responsive?
---
Not pretending to be the same as pc just want to know if they work properly
---
Thanks
---
Yup, it'd be better for realm health to roll alliance on kirtonos, not horde
---
The guide on wowhead doesn't answer my questions at all and everyone already follows it. Does DBM show who is actually going to get attacked when she lands in P3 and in what order? Because all the common threatmeters sure as hell have no idea.
---
No.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13515/ramsteins-lightning-bolts
---
As many have mentioned, hunter is one of the easiest classes to level and the pet aspect is fun. I’d recommend leveling as Beastmaster. It’s not very gear dependent and can easily take on mobs your level and a bit higher.
---
Not saying all the time. Just to get you some gear.
---
It's fine. But if you pass on a piece you need to help a teammate you're likely.to get invited back.
---
I was just saying something in discord about a higher level character only killing me because I was out of cooldowns...  
---
I feel personally attacked right now.
---
Shaman killed a gnome (rightfully so) and the mage sees it. Since the shaman is wounded, mage starts unloading frost bolts. Shaman is reeeally low (any damage source from the mage will end him) but just barely escapes the range of the mage's frostbolt. Then the mage blinks into melee range of the shaman and the shaman swings a WF proc (three hits in one, basically) and a shock to bring the mage to one-hit range while the mage frost novas to keep the shaman from getting another would-be-deadly swing.. The shamans only option is a lightning bolt that may or may not kill the mage, while the mage is charging up the death blow frostbolt. But !! The mage angered a nearby water elemental during the chase of our protagonist and as the mage casts this death blow, the elemental smacks the mage which ends the cast that would have surely killed the shaman, leaving our beloved orc just barely alive, beyond reason.
---
Yea, you can pretty much request party lead when you agree to tank. Then you can replace all the shit dps you want. Especially for deadlines or wailing caverns. The dps for that place is all just sitting outside waiting.

i like things like this when people push their potentials. nice grinding

\*sensible chuckle\*
---
+1. played mage in vanilla. Picked back up in WotLK into cars. Picked back up in BFA. It’s been my main class whenever I pick the game back up over the last 12+ years.
---
So I played a mage again.. the stigma makes me want to reroll shaman or something
---
“god class” LULW
---
There's absolutely no reason to go any points in prot before you start tanking endgame stuff.
---
Most of the "established"(lol) guilds are literally just the guilds who formed first and started spamming chat/invites early. The majority of members joined 'just because' and are just waiting to hit 60 and or find the right guild before they leave. Probably even more pvp focused players in this camp than pve since there's zero reason to be rushing to 60 or joining a pvp focused guild in phase 1.
---
I just find it so bizarre why anyone would talk shit to tanks considering how sought after they are. It's one thing to give constructive feedback to help them improve if they actually are doing something wrong, but just telling them they're terrible only discourages people from tanking at all, making the tank shortage even worse. 
---
Anyways, I appreciate all the tanks out there, you aren't given enough credit.
---
Though in most vanilla dungeons at least until near level cap you can just bring another good DPS and not use a tank.
---
What does a disarm do against a tank?!
---
Just use your bear hands ;-)
---
How do has dog when is dog?
---
I got yelled at for not turning off growl during RFC. I hadn't taught it growl.
---
Better yet. Be the party leader
---
1 blind, 0 vanish. I see you like to live dangerously
---
Locks are great in PvE and wanted for their utility and ability to keep a group going again and again with healthstones, soul stones, and summoning.
---
The reason people don't go crazy playing lock is because, at least in vanilla, they're crazy gear dependant and are limited in groups because of the current debuff limit on mobs and players. Nobody is going to want more than 3 locks in a raid or else you're losing out on other debuffs from mages, warriors, rogues, and druids.
---
On top of that, we're never going to top DPS meters in anything other than occasional single target scenarios because of how much mana we use putting up debuffs and refreshing them. Mana tapping mid-fight KILLS your dps.
---
I enjoy playing Warlock. I see how amazing they can be,  but they're not something I can see as a complete necessity in a DPS dungeon run or early wPvP scenarios.
---
Most players aren't good
---
Er, definitely not facts. I mean, don't get me wrong, this guy's guild isn't the one, but you can totally put together a top notch PvP guild... oh, I dunno, around the time the actual PvP phases start, rather than now, when there's nothing? Especially on PvE servers. Who the hell is forming a PvP guild on a server where only BGs matter (PvE) when there are no BGs yet?
---
If your connection is decent, then it feels fine. Resolution drops from time to time, but FPS does not for me at least. It is great for grinding mobs or doing gathering/fishing. But I would definitely not recommend doing any sort of grouping with it. At least from a healing perspective lol. But idk as I get more and more used to it I may try out more stuff
---
What a beautiful boop.
---
I don't think u can know, it's just random. I did Onyxia with a pug no discord and we killed it without wiping once.  All I know is that once she lands u don't even touch her until tank gets aggro.
---
This.
---
What a suicidal move
---
Imagine if there was constant ticking damage from heat exposure in Molten Core.
---
type /luna config or just go into the luna options. At the bottom left hand side theres a section called hide blizzard just uncheck the cast bar.
---
I don’t really see why you would
---
You'll just be asked to change your name, not a big deal. But I do love the sensitive nerds that get offended by names.
---
... no lock that's good would let their pet get zoned.  Y'all comin at me like this is supposed to be pro advice.
---
dont think so, you're not exploiting any bugs. It's already been done a few times and no sign of bans
---
Not sure if it's a reference I'm not getting but I'm TyDurden, Dwarf Rogue with a kitty who follows em on Kromcrush.
---
what about scorpids? cats are offensive pets and have lower health, so wouldnt i revive it a lot?
---
This pleases me.
---
Their Just a bunch of over sensitive children, although if you have enough people report you I think you get a forced name change and upto a 3day ban.
---
Your name has no profanity unless you imagaine it so you should be good
---
Mage blinked into melee range of the shaman and got one hit almost, elemental came up and finished him off while he was casting a frost bolt that would have killed the shaman.
---
The mage could have easily finished him off tho with cone of cold or fire blast. 
---
Basically, the mage is trash lolol
---
They will just force you to change it before logging in. Not a big deal I feel like. Obviously depending on the name...
---
Intelligence does that
---
Mostly because once they get aggro its curtains for them. Mages can blink,  aoe slow,  aoe root,  and be immune for an eternity. Mages are some of the most overconfident fuckers I've ever seen.
---
Here comes the money.
---
Also facts^^^, think about rivalries whilst roaming on a PvP server though. I know damn well I’m going for any Horde on Grobbulus.
---
Pretty sure that when I went to London it was mph and it confused me a bit
---
Is BIS for ferals
---
get some thrown / a ranged weapon
---
Are you 110% sure? This is a low level alt and not a big deal to delete and reroll. I just don’t want any trouble later on down the road
---
I had juust dinged 45, bought a princess run for 10g to get thrash blade (run took 11 min from zone in) then dumped fiery on it and it tapped me out on funds.
---
Nothing preventing you from doing so but you do look like a loot goblin if you do this and other people also need the loot and they're unlikely to group with you again
---
If I roll a Human Priest, am I gonna catch a lot of flack for not being a Dwarf?
---
Yeah totally amazing, goofy, and fun…
---
That costs money
---
The name is ‘OnlyFxckMoms’
---
20 years of military life? Is that so he is ready to accept being homeless?
---
Sigh... What?
---
Bobby B is short for Robert Borathean
---
Looks like he dodged a arms warrior.
---
You should write a book - this was quite enjoyable even though I watched the video lol
---
Dude nobodys character has been deleted because of their name. You just have to rename it trust me.
---
I still think it's kind of paladin like to dress in skulls and stuff.
---
Reminds me of warhammer 40k chaplins.
---
This ain’t the 60’s old man, we eat ass for fun now.
---
Ah okay so I was right saying I need to make my tab key a macro for switch target and Auto attack in one button push
---
Sooner or later,  you'll be forced to change your name.  No bans, no suspensions, just one day, you'll log in, and you'll be forced to change your name.
---
When should I start looking to replace Verigan's Fist? Any easy upgrades for pallies?
---
It's a neat event. I ran right around the battle with a noob character and managed to get all of my stuff done.
---
just fyi make sure you are replying to the specific comment using the little arrow under it. better chance to be seen and get a reply with context. saw a couple of your replies just randomly in the middle of the thread. :)
---
Right? Fire resist +100 was required to even be there haha. This guy obviously farmed his gear before showing up to work
---
Huntards are too but it doesn't make them a good team player.  Says the person who played a hunter as one of her mains on and off since BC.
---
It's only misleading the person you're talking to doesn't know basic math
---
What's a raid slot?
---
Just stick with arms and tank. You'll generate much more rage/damage/threat.
---
That last hit made me laugh hahaha
---
&gt;say 1-2 hours a day
---
Nobody who only plays 1-2 hours a day is 60 yet though. Fastest /played to 60 is around 4 days played, that's 96+ hours. At 2 hours a day you're only 2/3rd of the way there. And that's if you're playing with the efficiency of hardcore speed levelers. If you've spent enough time in the past month to hit level 60 then you've spent about a quarter of your waking hours playing wow. That's hardcore.
---
Yeah I am not offended, I think its funny.
---
Anything but warrior. Also, ask if she wants to be on a PvP server or not.
---
Not in my case. I played Vanilla, never got to raid though, BC came out around my level 40. I continued to play for many years. However, I stopped playing WoW after Max level in MoP. I just had enough. The day I heard about Classic coming out, which was only 1 month before release!!, I resubed and got ready for classic. I knew of no hype, no story, Just Classic.
---
Bit offtopic, but another thing i see thats not healing is priests shielding the tank as he pulls, dmg gets absorbed, so no rage gained.
---
For raid dps, you're right, Warrior does everything Rogue does but better. 
---
But where Rogues really shine over Warriors is in just about every other aspect of the game. A Rogue tends to have far, far better match-ups in pvp than a Warrior will, and gets to pick and choose when and where to fight on top of that.
---
At first glance, while the Warrior toolkit is pretty extensive, it has absolutely nothing on what Rogues have. Rogues have multiple stuns, a slow, a couple incapacitates, and various defensive and offensive cooldowns that let them stack the odds in any and every fight in their favor. 
---
The Warrior toolkit is largely limited to hitting stuff harder, but the Rogue toolkit not only has about as many offensive options, it has significantly more defensive and utility ones on top of that. All Warriors can really do is break fear. 
---
So yeah, if all you care about is end-game raid dps, then Warriors are pretty much better Rogues in every aspect. But when it comes to just about every other aspect of the game, Rogues have a pretty big edge over Warriors.
---
Ran Cathedral with a mage today that used only his wand for all pulls less than 3.  He even wanded the bosses..
---
Tbf, you can just /t the name on any server. Either it exists or it doesn't and has an equal chance of being the wrong guy on every server
---
The lockout for MC resets every tuesday, so we're getting close! Alot of new groups will be looking on tuesday and the following days
---
If you can LoS then you can just durdle around until either player gets bored. Idk if this works for warrior though without cleanses. Then again los in classic is famously unreliable.
---
You must be new to being a woman on the Internet if the NO GURLS ON WOW circlejerk still bothers you... Gotta rise above it lol.
---
So you want to speed up the best part of tbc (the initial grind to 70 and rep grinds), so people can rush to endgame and have nothing to do?
---
Sorry man but this is a terrible idea.
---
Because alliance get the wintersaber.
---
r/whoosh
---
I went to type in guild chat today and it said I didn’t have permission. I pm’d a guildie and they asked in guild chat and no one responded so I just left the guild. Why would a guild have members that can’t talk in guild chat?
---
Shaman dispel enemy magic instead iirc. It's very useful in pvp and you can just rip through shields (although it's less useful if someones stacking loads of buffs).
---
No idea how useful it is in pve though.
---
I’m partial to boars as tanky pets. They have good health and armor, can charge to quickly move in and start building threat, and they can learn bite for extra threat and damage (though I don’t think they come with it - you have to tame another species to learn it). This site is a great resource:
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Edit: and boars eat just about anything, which is convenient.
---
To what I've been doing, using Immolate &gt; Corruption &gt; Siphon Life &gt; Drain Life / Curse &gt; Drain Life.
---
Affliction is your best main spec then dip into either destruction for bonus fire damage or demonology for the bonus stamina and demon damage for succubus. 
---
Drain tank is your best DPS option for grinding and doing dungeons. Even around 60.
---
Woulda loved to see his face
---
People wont play with someone again who won items they needed? Sounds childish.
---
I’m talking about ur mom
---
I just haven't been in gaming communities in a while
---
That sounds fucking awful
---
In azshara, there should be some swirly areas that are called patch of Elemental water or something along those lines. you can fish globe of water, Elemental water, essence of water.
---
haha it happens, dont worry about it
---
Pretty sure we’ll be on normal server. But she’s feisty so maybe she’ll prefer pvp lol.
---
I would consider myself a casual wow player I have played every chance I can since classic released and am only level 19. Due to work (working 14hr days 6days a week) am only able to play for a few hours on my 1 day off.
---
If someone is 60 already I wouldn’t consider them a casual. Also I have not looked up any speed guides for quest/leveling, I’m just doing quests around my level maybe a few levels higher in the barrens and am enjoying it.
---
From what I've seen there is 0 threat reset for anyone in the fight. Gnomish cloaking device for engineers completely resets threat so that's an option for anyone with engineering. Otherwise if you are a caster just don't dps in phase 1 only dps in phase 2 and when phase 3 rolls around you'll be fine.
---
P1 Ranged, tank and melee are all generating threatP2 Only ranged is generating significant threat on her
---
P3  Now your tank has to contend with mages and warlocks who nuked for 2 phases worth of threat while the tank only got to build any meaningful threat in P1. Melee can have agro here too especially if they decide to hit her while the warlocks and mages are dying instead of waiting for the tank to get threat. The tank isn't going to generate any decent agro until they take damage so if melee doesn't wait for the tank to get threat back they'll end up tanking after the warlocks and mages.
---
Solution from what I've seen is to have ranged do 0 damage in phase 1 ( its still fast and a complete joke) and only do damage in phase 2. Onyxia can be hit by instant melee attacks, but not auto attacks while in the air so the tank can build rage on the whelps and then shield slam her if they stand under her while shes in the air.
---
Ideally you should kill the thing before it kills your pet. Pets are durable, you also get Mend Pet to heal them.
---
I'm using a boar but should switch to a cat soon. My boar has only died twice in the 6 levels I've had him. The first time I was chain pulling and didn't look at his hp, he died after about the 8th mob. The second time I accidentally pulled 3 mobs, and sacrificed him to escape.
---
The cat should be just as safe or safer, since more dps means shorter combat, which means less damage taken.
---
Maybe not in vanilla or retail, but classic is littered with female dwarf priests.
---
Interesting, another main reason I chose warlock is that the core of my guild leadership is mostly made up of diehard hardcore players who spend way too much time on private servers and all that and THEY are the ones telling me that having a warlock is essential in your 5 man dungeon speed clearing group. Have I mentioned that I feel like an absolute monster in wPvP. Without pvp trinkets or bis gear I just faceroll most people who get in my way.
---
im in the same boat as you (minus a few tough to get pieces of pre-bis), theres really nothing to do if you dont want to make an alt, pvp despite getting no honor rewards, or stock up on gold before phase 2. most everyone in my guild already has alts for split runs, many 30-40+
---
ignore em
---
consider joining a guild or make some friend to play with
---
Thanks, it can be great to do mining runs
---
I really don't have much time to play and leveling up professions and making extra money is what I can't keep up with.
---
Maybe good to play the auction house aswell?
---
Aye, And I never have a felhunter out farming, it's almost always VW, esp as it a versatile, works against most classes.
---
It’s pretty hard to fuck up as hunter. Dismiss you pet when you run around and wait for tank to aggro before multi shot. Not sure where the problem was to begin with.
---
How do you get your healing to show?
---
i mean, he's right. Some people aren't happy with their guild.
---
2 items inside each other. a glitch or misplaced graphic
---
Permabanned
---
once you're in the endgame it basically is. the good thing is that it takes a long time to get to that point
---
Can confirm. A GM contacts you, forcing you to rename the character.
---
Anybody have any experience playing from China? Is it blocked or extremely slow without VPN?
---
Since server transfers aren't a thing, playing on a local server and moving my character when I return to North America isn't an option.
---
Got it at 40 had to borrow 15g from a guildie though.
---
Damn bro you laid it to him. Gj.
---
I would report you, solely based off the fact anyone who names their character that must be under 12 and therefore not be allowed to play World of Warcraft.
---
....and this isnt..?
---
It doesn't destroy the game, but it absolutely changes it.
---
One of the great things about vanilla wow is that once you finish questing the game fully stops telling you what to do. You just do what you wanna do. Adding achievements takes away the total open world feeling of the game. It creates the incentive to do stuff just because it's there to be done, and makes it about checking boxes more. It's not better or worse, but it's different.
---
That's a weird way of spelling Nice
---
That was amazing! Reminded me of internet historian
---
Not sure if that was an example of pride, greed or over eagerness but either way that Mage learned to not get in melee range that day.
---
That's actually amazing
---
LMAO.
---
I've tried this xD
---
Worst case scenario is you get a free name change, I wouldn’t worry about it.
---
No, but you just won't get the preferential treatment they get. In the end you're still a Healer and those will always be needed.
---
Depends what you down. If you want to raid alot, expect to get called out on it. Fear ward is very very good on some fights.
---
Though in the end, playing a race you dislike can be very painful so don't sweat it too much.

Yeah, seriously. I pvp'd as holy/ret for months. It's impossible for a paladin to beat a competent mage without cheese or triple crit.
---
I just want to be a stepdad why is that offend you
---
Only if you are needing on items that your class obviously doesn't use.
---
Everything else is need if you need.
---
For alts I usually ask if everyone has rolled greed and it's sometimes polite if you don't need on a necessary upgrade (e.g cookies wand is a better upgrade on a priest then a mage but both can use).
---
Basically don't be a a** and you should be fine.

So for you, input broadcasted to one window, ok? Input broadcasted to multiple processes, not okay?

Damn so many salty people taking a term I used out of context and using their life experiences as the standard... If you aren't gonna contribute to discussion about the Warlock class please see yourself out.
---
Exactly,  put up with it for so long it's a breath of fresh air seeing another class get it for once. Didn't matter how good you were as a hunter people always talk shit
---
Multiple addons do that. I'm using MSBT.
---
Level DPS but heal anyway. Have some healing gear.
---
The fuck? No.
---
Having to link some source of credibility was not caused by achievements existence.  That existed before Wrath.

That's why I asked to remain on topic. Sorry for offending you.

it's huge and spread out. Lots of players doing lots of walking and passing the time by being toxic in general chat. Lots of people see Barrens Chat's reputation and take it as an excuse to be as edgy as possible, too.
---
Summons are good, healthstones are good (bring lots of shards). People will like you for those two utility things and your DPS may not be at the top but it won't leave any room for complaint.

Got a lvl 43 warlock and 51 warrior...
---
Gratz if that is your first clear I'm not anywhere near doing that yet.
---
I thought I disconnected from Discord while watching your video LOL
---
There ya go ; )
---
OP was behind the times, addon has been updated and now has this all built in.
---
Ass mad
---
Mages are a little rough right now, especially my brother. but eventually the noobs will learn through lots of deaths and it's great to see a mage now down a camp, tho only if I'm just running around looking for flowers
---
Thanks for your comment.
---
As I mentioned in other comments, I do try to be the driving factor if I do full parties in dungeons but as you say it's very exhausting and it's only maybe half the time that I have the energy to do it. After making this post however, I realized that I have to approach the game from a different perspective so I rolled a warrior and plan on leading every dungeon run that I'll do on that char as a tank. That way I can judge the people I play with myself before we jump into the dungeon and also establish a nice friendly vibe in the party. I think it will help alot honestly
---
If she does go hunter, for the love of kittens make use of the training  and ability guides on https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/. It's amazing how many hunters go dozens of levels without training anything but growl.
---
Repair before every dungeon
---
Wanding in PvP..... and screaming. Lots of screaming in that video. The teenagers will love this I guess.
---
Alright, so in my infinite Mara farming Princess dropped Blade of Eternal Darkness https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17780/blade-of-eternal-darkness
---
Opinions on this? Wowhead comments seem to think it's pretty good with a decent procrate. There seem to be mixed opinions on whether it procs on DoTs, or just the DoT application, or not at all.
---
I was the only rogue for a long time. I miss it.
---
Yeah they told me multiple times they can’t do this.
---
Thats what i love to see in classic
---
The amount of mages that have gone oh shit im dying i know polymorph works for me in this situation i should turn that cat into a sheep.
---
As soon as i see the poly animation i laugh in druid and finish them off.
---
Warrior is Definitely my vote for the class the bad players are all flocking to right now.
---
How u gonna use a GoT meme but not know Bobby B!!!! Krom kush gang tho
---
My rule of thumb for myself as a hunter whether it's a tank or a pet is to wait until the remaining health drops past 90% before I start attacking. Not sure what optimal is but it seems to be what worked best while leveling to not have my pet lose agro if I mana dump skills
---
how is it punishment? Unless all 4 players are in the same guild and tell their whole guild to not group with that one person again, even then that's one guild and there's thousands playing on a server at a time.
---
Go destro
---
swiftthistle is \~3.5g/stack on the AH on my server (fairbanks). Crazy expensive. I'd sell em, but all the good alchemy recipes use them.
---
Where do I go to for quests at level 41 as a rogue?
---
Just got to booty bay for the quests and almost all the mobs that I are required for the quests are higher level than me.
---
I was in Desolace doing that Burning Blade quest line, the one where you use the Demon Pick to release that level 39 demon from the red crystal.
---
There is an alliance quest line there to that same room, an escort quest for them.  
---
I go in there, 32 lock, and grind down the lvl 35 mobs in the room.  Drink and eat to recover my lost 1/4 of health and mana and in comes three alliance, all lvl 35+ for the escort quest. 
---
They all goto separate corners of the room and /sit to watch me do the demon.  They know I'm way under leveled for it. 
---
I break the crystal, and just fear, dot, drain life, and send my succ at it.  Fight goes on for over a min, and I've turned almost all my health into mana to spam the dots cause the demon kept resisting most of them.  Last dot ticks, demon dies, I get my Demon Box loot for the quest, and then /dance.
---
The Allys (I'm on a PVE server) all /clap and I bounce out. 
---
Felt good.
---
#justwarlockthings
---
thanks dad
---
And also I know your original question was earlier today and probably is buried right now. If you're still confused and have similar questions just ask again tomorrow maybe late morning. That's what these threads are for.
---
I don't play a hunter on classic so I can't really help you. Good luck.
---
You can hardly do any meaningful leveling there either. The quests are lackluster; you'll be done by some grinding for sure.
---
All good dad
---
Mage probably best bet as they can make their own food and drink, which lowers down time. They are also versatile.
---
I would also recommend leveling an druid alt with her as you can help heal and then tank in dungeons, should you decide to do so.
---
Don't out level her on said alt and only play it with her or else she will probably tap out.
---
Also don't fall into the trap of telling her to go healer, she is playing the game to play with you and have fun, not be someones pocket healer.
---
Fall damage is a % of your total hp. Just as the guy jumped off the zeppelin he gave him fort buff. 
---
Fort buffing someone increases their stamina and health pool but not their current life. Guy was expecting to take about 90% damage and walk away with 10%. However, since he got buffed just as he jumped he was at 90% up when he got the ground instead of 100%, so he died.
---
Wrong. Hunter went AFK at last boss of UBRS last night. When he came back he turned on aspect of the pack.. whilst we were telling him to activate cheetah instead, he randomly pulls the boss. Then ends up dying instead of feigning
---
Great story, I agree that's probably the best way to make friends. I have had people do that to me now that I think about it, although I must not have realized I could have made a friend out of it :P
---
You're neglecting your original arguement for a new one to prove your point. Typical. Have a good night.
---
some people are pieces of shit
---
Well 16 year olds have ran out of other things that are acceptable to hate and be edgy about. But pretty much everyone can agree that furries are still in the free fire zone.
---
PvP happened.
---
&gt; (though I don’t think they come with it - you have to tame another species to learn it)
---
what do you mean? you have to tame another species to learn boar bite?
---
Dreadmist on EU :)
---
Wait so you're saying that a game developer literally sat there and built an entire class ( designed the talent tree, balanced spell damage, designed abilities, etc) around being   AoE based, and anyone who uses said class as an aoe based class is using it in an unintended way? Someone gotta smack yo mama up cause boy...
---
Hunters that think Dalrend is bis in p1 lul
---
“When you can’t remember to repair before a dungeon”
---
Yea I just think it makes the problem worse as it doesnt incentivize anyone to leave an imbalanced server from the dominant side.
---
i'm actually insulted.
---
I keep considering Rogue in vanilla since I only played it in Legion for the most part. Then I remembered how energy ticks worked in vanilla and how long you have to wait between each attack.
---
Let her pick her class first, then you pick a class that works well with her class.
---
Seems like the talents that gen rage with shield block would give you more rage to spend on threat. As it is, I never had enough rage to spend on sunder.
---
Explains the other thread about mages.
---
This is a story told a thousand times.  You'll be glad to know that sharding solved the problem though.
---
I don't play a rogue, but I'd imagine it's gonna be pretty tough. There's a lot of rogues looking for groups so I would suggest trying to find a guild to help out.  Personally the type of player I am I wouldn't mind taking you but there's a lot of people vying for that position.
---
What? What do you mean "if they really phased loot"? 
---
Are you saying loot isn't phased because MC loot isn't?
---
There is a shit ton of phased loot.
---
This is why I don't think hunter is a good class for someone who has never played. Way too much micromanagement.
---
Questie? check the addon settings for what level quests will show, there should be an icon around the minimap for questie.
---
Puggle is a cool addon that watches chat for people looking for groups and adds them to a pretty cool interface. I keep LFG open in another chat tab then check this addon when I want a group. 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle
---
Many different species can learn bite, but not all of them automatically come with it. On my hunter, I tamed a boar, and it just had charge. I then tamed a spider which came with bite. After fighting with the spider for a few minutes, I got a message saying I learned bite, and I was then able to teach it to my boar.
---
Whats even more ridiculous is when someone in the group breaks CC so We started multi shotting, and then at the end when asked "Who broke it", its linked that we casted multi shot so we MUST have broke it. And explaining that once it was broken we used multishot doesn't work out well.
---
Yea dude that’s my GM. You eat ass. GM is female. Stalagg. Pst for invite.
---
Once I hit 43 tanaris and feralas felt good. A nice burst of quests in tanaris got me about 55k xp an hour
---
Maybe they did!
---
Huh, I thought it was TBC that was delayed until almost WotLK release, and WotLK itself was only delayed for a few months? Was I misinformed then?
---
Will defs be using this mate
---
Who needs CC?
---
First part made me smile.
---
Yeah I guess you're right about that. Been in a rut for a while so I guess I'm kind of stagnating

Who the heck right clicks to attack?

Ah, good to know! Hoping somebody's had some experience playing from here and replies. I really want to play this but don't wanna go through the process of installing and getting my hopes up for nothing.
---
Picked up that door stuck sound clip, lol
---
All the internet sounds in this video are what make it .
---
If its the first boss sure like corpsemaker from RFK i dont mind or if a druid asks for help in gnomeregan cause we can just stealth together. Otherwise yesh no dungeon boodts though as u said i dont mind helping WW warrior or elite quests.
---
Oh and usually i cant say no to my irl friends/brother if he needs a dungeon boost.
---
Yeah I'd say it's the opposite. Hunters have to manage a dumb npc where it's easy to make mistakes. A bad mage is a bad player
---
You left a trophy for the alliance citizens to admire. Thank you for your service :p
---
I don't think you are wrong here OP but next time try to tell the group that you need to do the content that you want before starting the run.
---
This way, if they decline you will find a new group and if they agree they will have no excuse not doing the bosses.
---
Especially if they got the next level of food so I can get a few stacks before the end of dungeon.
---
Thanks Mages! 
---
(On a side note - just ignore the stigma. I play Prot Warrior and see plenty of posts about shitty tanks, I know they aren’t about me)
---
If you don’t care about efficiency, are the 55+ zones cool and fun to level in?
---
Wait for freedom buff and sheep. Then freeze them out of sheep, stay out of range of their stun if it hasn't been used yet (save blink for it) and kite them. Pallies are probably one of the easiest matchups for mage.
---
Ehhh, but did you?
---
Mages have and always will be op. One of the best in classic and are the best in retail (pvp).
---
my cat goes nuts whenever im at the ah and there are dozens of people running around
---
That's the staff I'm talking about. The one from the leaders of the fang quest.
---
Had a friend who was an over the road trucker get banned as well although his was over turned
---
This. The plan for sure.
---
Roll a mage, where your high intellect stat is ironic!
---
Watchin' that dragon orgy
---
On the weekend.... yeah. The rest of the week most of the servers are low-medium for me. But I play when yall are at work and school so... I don't know what to think.
---
Yeah the versatility of Druid as my roll is appealing. Just depends on her choice really.
---
What could possibly be more righteous and holy than being bathed in the blood and bones of the heretics and xeno scum that you and your batull bruvvas have cleansed in the name of the EMPRAH!
---
Thanks, that was an excellent video! It's like it was made to answer my questions haha. He even knew about the part where the RL yells at DPS for attacking at the start of P3 and we truthfully say we weren't doing shit.
---
All great points that I’m considering tbh, just depends if the class is appealing at first glance to her.
---
I'm so glad I'm on Grobbulus, pretty much even 50/50 and really chill people. Still pvp too to make it exciting.
---
Yeah absolutely the plan going into this.

---
We're raiding TM right now
---
i can only assume his name comes from [this classic piece of YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plQIf5fS8xw)
---
Not sure if that would work. The person who does the quest may be the only one who can pick it up. Can anyone confirm?
---
Does warlock Fear break from damage in classic?
---
I'm in STV and just experienced a single Fear, and during that time my health went from 100 to 0, yet Fear never broke. Felt pretty bad like I had zero control of my character
---
the only reason you switch to dagger+ offhand is if you get those and they're better than your staff
---
lol hunters are pretty middle of the road, I can think of at least 3 easier classes
---
If you weren't dying each pull it is proly fine
---
Your leaps in assumptions is Olympic-level.
---
Doing nice things and helping out guild members is **not** bribing people. No where is he claiming he's doing this "in the hope one guy will stay". That's like saying doing your wife/husband a favor and/or helping them with something is 'bribing them not to leave you'.
---
I would follow your reasoning if the OP said anything along the lines of specifically doing these things with the direct intent on recruitment or retention of guild members, but there is none of that there. 
---
If you honestly believe that a guild member / officer / leader going out of their way to help or do favors for guild members is 'bribery' then I feel bad for you and the guilds you've been in.
---
BGs are going to be cross-realm, they confirmed this a while back.

Good night guys, zug zug

Yes SFK for sure. Some great caster gear there. Only 3 quests. One is from UC which I dont think has a prereq. The other 2 might have a couple quick prereqs at Sepulcher. 
---
After that is BFD. Also some good caster gear. And a great caster wand quest reward. 
---
Look up TipsOuts guides on wowhead. Just search "dungeon name classic wow" and its usually first 3 results on google. Pretty comprehensive guide for each dungeon with strats, gear, and quest breakdowns.

Dude, i was in the same boat as you. I just said fuck it, and made my own build. So far it's working well. My goal was/is to be good in pvp, and in raiding without the need to respec. With this build i believe you can do that.

Level ret first, ignore holy for the moment. 5 points benediction, 3 points seal of the crusader, 2 in judgment. 1 for seal of command, 5 conviction, 2 pursuit of justice, and then the final 2 points in eye for an eye.
---
5 in divine strenght, 5 spiritual focus, 1 consecration, 3 healing light, 1 divine intellect, 5 illumination, 1 divine favor, 4 divine intellect, 5 holy power, and the last one in  holy shock.
---
When your guild mate tells you something like that, you should just open the party chat and turn it around. Something along the lines of "we should probably kick this tank, can't even keep threat from my pet without growl". Best case scenario the moron will admit fault, worst case he leaves or argues and you'll have a laugh about it. Stick it to the haters my man.
---
Yes I like the wide range of accessibility of the mages talents and skills and spells.

I've done reading on WoWhead and what not, it says anyone can pick it up off the ground. Some people even complained of their eggs being sniped.
---
All very valid points, things I’ll be considering as she chooses. Thanks for the in depth input it’s appreciated!
---
You will ALWAYS want more hit %. You want to have roughly 8% more minimum for the first raids, and any more means more damage. Later raids you want to nearly double that stat. 
---
So % hit is very valuable
---
Sword of Omen should be best in off, bc of stats and speed!

You don’t have access to shit. You fucking fraud.
---
Druids, Jack of all trades - master of none.
---
Why hide the name?  Show the name and server so this guy gets known.
---
Be me, warrior tank, makes bank alt preist.
---
Decide to get a few levels in and get some professions like tailoring and enchanting so I can proffit more of drops.
---
Be salty that after a wand was equipped I leveled 3-4 times quicker than as a warrior.
---
Be preist main now.
---
While leveling any spec warrior is the tank. Anyone who can heal is the healer. You don’t have to spec into it below like 45.
---
Lol that would have been pretty good. Honestly at that point in time we had been waiting for a while to find a tank since it was during the dead hours on the server and we were probably halfway through MC already. Dealing with him being an ass was easier than having to try and find another tank in the middle of the night.
---
No....warriors.
---
Well deserved, I saw no fire blast in that entire clip...
---
Love the noob linking krol blade lol
---
right!?, exactly my reaction..
---
Seriously. A warrior 2h tanking is just like a shaman tanking in terms of damage taken.  I have to drink so damn much.  It’s like they won’t sacrifice their dps for the group.  I love bear druids now.
---
Tank a few rfk groups to grind a level and get a few gold each run
---
If I worked from home and couldn't devote any kind of real time to the game, you bet I'd be on a mage or warlock teleporting people places for some easy passive income.
---
I feel like this image is missing a painted wall.
---
Or you could roll a priest and laugh as they fail to kill you.
---
Ret pala, ench sham, warrior, hunter, everything that can use mail. Rogues, feral druids would use it too if they could wear mail.
---
Also the most loot-hungry players I have found, I am a Warrior btw. Was discussing with my guild how loot would work and the (DPS) Warriors flocked to discuss how they need loot prio being gear dependant..
---
Yeah not happening bud.
---
Well all I can say then is test it. Fly to a far off village &amp; just stand there. Your character will sit down when the system auto-afk's you &amp; a message in chat will say you're AFK. Start a timer until disconnect. 
---
Try it again in a city. 
---
All I know is I've yet to be kicked for being AFK unless it's like an hour or so. I'm still leveling so I make it a point to stop at an inn anytime I know I won't be actively doing anything. Made Mac &amp; cheese today and was still sitting in ShadowPrey village when I got back to my PC. My Mark of the Wild was gone, so that's a 30min timer confirmation.

I loved my journey to 60.

I spent it mostly questing with level appropriate dungeon runs throughout.

The allows you great immersion, and as a Vanilla player, I was constantly smacked in the face with nostalgia.

I think it only becomes a “real grind” if you let it be. 
---
Folks that run SM from 30-40 and ZF from 44-52 seem to be the most miserable people I encounter. 
---
I know some people just want to experience only the end game, but in the process they sacrifice a very rewarding leveling/story experience.
---
Multi shot is one of the main skills in a hunter's rotation, even single target (as it has a +dmg modifier).

Nothing about this tells us he broke a CC, what OP should have done is switched it to "broken CC" on details.

You were the chosen one!

I saw a mage open world AoE farming a pack of 2 today. What the fuck were they thinking?

God forbid you get 2 melee dps in the same group. They spend the entire dungeon measuring dicks to see who can top the dps chart.

Everything after wrath was a clusterfuck that ruined the game. Wrath introduced achievements but it wasn’t toxic like it is now. People now want you to have every AotC that has nothing to do with the raid you are doing, want you in mythic raid gear to do a normal. All it’s done it make that elitist attitude worse. Before this all that was done was your toon was armoried to see what gear it was in and check boss progression.
---
Try running Mara. Rogues Hunters and Warriors.... only people that will message you.

To paraphrase the words of the great Halbrium:
---
&gt; *^(If you get him down low and he still has enough mana to heal, stun that  sun of the gun, and do all the dmg power you can. windfurry, earthshock,  nature swift!, and stormstrike all in UNISON. make him say "I am going  to win" and then bring him the dead screen. He will think he is under  the lag.)*
---
The best part about this is that since the mob technically killed him he took a 10% hit on his item durability.
---
It’s the kind of people he said he wants to attract after all
---
It is an art * ftfu

I love your character name, very zug zug.

Have some questions regarding the Gnomish Engineering - Battle Chicken:
---
- Is it strong?
---
- Does it regenerate health overtime outside combat?
---
- Is it better to get the battle chicken end-game or earlier while leveling up?
---
Int doesn't give any damage. It gives crit.
---
lvl 44 human rogue right now as hemo build when should i witch over to combat? im using vanq sword/galgan firehammer combo but should i change the mace to something else? like a sword with agi stats?
---
I'm a rogue. Have done UBRS 10 times.  9 times Jed was in the instance. 8 times the trinket dropped lol.
---
Hey guys. Currently a 43 (nearly 44) lock. Doing the standard drain tank succubus build while questing.
---
Is the shadoweave gear worth it? Basically a set in the 40s for equippable increases to shadow damage. Seems to be about a 14%dps increase across my dots with only two pieces equipped, but I definitely am/will lose out on int and stamina by using the full set (although with a higher dps increase). What do you think?
---
This was exactly my feeling. Was a random PuG (at least for me).  After the first few pulls going just OK, I left. Was not advertised as a spell cleave or speed run of any kind, which I would not have joined.
---
that vid just made my day! ))))
---
Is that legal?
---
You idiots actually fucking fell for that?  Really?  Are you serious?
---
If you dont have anything nice to say just dont say anything at all.
---
Dbag.
---
Realism is nice, but style is ageless.
---
What? Really? For what reason?
---
They definitely take away any sense of community. Cesspool guilds!
---
Gotta love these people. Everyone talking about how great having people be accountable is being on the same realm forever and whatnot, only for people to say shit like "who cares" when you call out the ninjas publicly.
---
This is totally true. But in this specific case performing heal/DPS/tank at the same time seems a little optimistic.
---
the texture looks bad on an angle.

---

---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO this is so funny
---
It really isn't when most people are wearing ah greens and have 0 answers for fear. As an example I tried farming essence of fire in ungoro the other day when a warrior decided he didn't like my face. He charged me while I was fighting 2 fire elementals. I killed him 6 times in a row with about enough time to kill 3 mobs before he would res, run away to get full hp then back for me. After the 6th time his guildies started showing up. A hunter, mage, priest and another warrior. I got 9 essence of fire in ~2.5 hours there while being harrassed THE ENTIRE time. They got me a few times but I was laughing my ass off at how much of their time I was wasting overall.
---
When a mage refuses to group with another mage I tell him that I will get a warlock then, so both classes will roll on the same gear apart from the odd one out like Burial Shawl. The same applies in raids. It does not matter if you are 3 mages, 3warlocks, 1 elemental shaman and an oomkin or plain 8 mages, because tier pieces are mostly shitty and the rest of the gear will be needed by all of them.
---
Just join the groups and spam shit like winnie the Pooh and tianneman square
---
So funny when people dont want a Rogue. You dont want an off tank that can lock down casters? You dont want a distract to easily skip some packs? You dont want locked chests opened? Oh by the way... also the best boss damage for most bosses.  People are silly.
---
Depends on the group. Most low to mid level dungeons are faceroll if everyone is of level.
---
I've been farming for it for weeks and havent even seen one yet. I can't wait to get it and really start pvping as enhance.
---
That's crazy. Good luck on getting yo chicken. :)
---
i thought the same thing today when I did that! Pretty snarly for a strong peace bear.
---
But you said "I did!" Even though you didn't. I don't care about your choice or excuse, just your LIE
---
Nahh Mages are doing me a service. Why would they do stuff for me when they gain nothing from it. I pay mages 1G for portals that they have to make for me, 50 Silver for the ones that already exist and 50 Silver for 100 Water.
---

I’ll take a number 3, leg and thighs only - El Pollo Loco

Mouseover macros for healing scares me.  Does it work on unitframes?
---
I've never been endgame so I have some questions about the viability of certain sets for endgame pvp in bgs for the most part. I'm an altoholic so I tried to be realistic and not give myself t3 for every class. Obviously they're not the best available gear but what I want to know is if it's decent enough to compete at 60 pvp.
---
Felcloth set for a shadow priest
---
Bloodsoul Set for a Hunter
---
Five Thunders set for Ele Sham (I know this can be long but Shaman is my main so I intend to put more time into it), also curious about the Zul Gurub set for Shams and in general how good ZG gear is.

Imperial Plate for Pally

Humans are alliance

Incendius? I've spotted this mook a few times before, they're always camping around BRD. Good job
---
Games don’t use any data or bandwidth really, its the updates that kill it. 
---
Have played my share of console games on hotspot considering Australia (or at least my part) only left the stone age (ADSL1) last year.
---
Well I think there’s legitimate criticisms to be made about vanilla/classic wow. Problem is they swung the pendulum to far in the other direction.
---
I’ve described it this way to my friends. The moment to moment is more fun for me in retail. But as an overall experience, how rewarding it feels. Classic has it beat easily.
---
I do feel like vanilla leveling was too slow and grindy on multiple playthroughs. However, the answer wasn’t to make it trivial. Keep the difficulty but decrease the time it takes. Add variety. Instead it’s just pointlessly easy in retail.
---
I hope she continues doing them, following.
---
Thirding. I have played mage in vanilla and almost every expansion since (didn't play wotlk or cata) and I get whispers for invites to dungeons from ppl I have ran with before all the time. If you play your class well people will try and get you in group again. Just be friendly and understand how threat and agro works and you are good to go.
---
It still mostly feels the same. It's always obvious who is a retail kiddy tho.
---
I have no idea how he added me, but I received his friend request with a lil' hunch about who was trying to reach me ;)
---
“For a little bit” he says xD
---
For a first time scamming you don't get 30 days. You get maybe 3 hours to 3 days max. Source, I scammed someone back then and got banned for 3 days.
---
He added op to bnet to cry about pvp happening on a pvp server.
---
You mean rouge\* right? Paint me like one of your french rouge.
---
Most streamers have done about 4 clears iirc. So he leveled up at a streamers pace, or was part of a hardcore pserver guild that rushed 60. None of that is casual
---
I remember when this made you hostile to your own faction, and me and my shitty guildmates held onto this quest until we hit 60 and leveled the crossroads.
---
Good times.
---
Interviews with classic devs reveals that enhancement shamans were made initially to be able to tank at least up to ZF/Uldaman. But past that most likely won’t go so well unless high min/maxing.
---
I believe you can still click on the players portrait and click add friend in this version
---
Hillsbrad on my sever
---
A lot of people abused the layering to grind nodes, herbs, mobs etc. Thats why you are seeing so many epic mounts. Also everyone knows the farming patterns for gold farming since its a 15 year old game.
---
Slut
---
Don’t be afraid to let the party know it’s your first time in that specific instance. Ask them to explain boss mechanics if needed. It can save a lot of headache .
---
If it makes you feel any better my friends and I have a gnome mage kill counter to see who had the most when we reach 60
---
Since classic launch I have run dungeons with many hunters and mages both. about 5% of the hunters are huntards and about 55% of mages are magetards
---
So the ret paladin should be allowed to need on the Rare staffs that the priest needs?
---
i use threatplates myself
---
I think it's already a thing. People only post phone pics on purpose.
---
This same thing happened to me earlier today. Lol. Same dungeon, kept breaking sheep with multi shot. What fun
---
This reply is a reply.
---
If a target is marked with a skull, attack it first. If it is marked with a moon, don't attack it.
---
Make sure to bring Soulshards, give at least the tank a healthstone. If you are level 28, expect to summon people. 
---
When you see chests, don't open them. People roll for chests by typing /roll. 
---
Try to not take any aggro by damaging too early or even pulling mobs.
---
Need is for when you need stuff for equip, greed is for when you don't need it. Greed everything you don't need.
---
Try and go there around level 35. People head there right at 30 when all that goes is make you an easy target. I haven't had too bad of a time there and I'm almost done with the zone.
---
It works for Frost Nova, there was plenty of discussion happening regarding it right at launch, when everyone was watching Jokerd AoE grind the last levels.
---
To be clear there is money being invested in terms of development to create a coherent experience of content within Vanilla that isn't simply a slap down of one or other of the existing images and there's money spent in terms of maintenance,  community maintenance etc. They aren't charging a separate fee for Classic so it's actually a gamble to define a population that would pay to play classic but not retail when there were already vanilla servers out there.
---
Remember, from ages 3-6, no one farms alterac valley better.  Had a guildmate whole strategy for getting pvp ranks involved his wife playing the game and his 4 year old playing his paladin.  She  would just follow the kid around healing him while grinding av.
---
Hunters are bottom tier levelers now change my mind
---
You'll more likely than not be reported eventually. The first few times you get reported it's pretty painless. You get flagged for a rename, and cannot log in until you rename. I have guildies on their third rename. Eventually they will start temp banning you as well if you continue to rename to another name violation lol
---
My Classic paladin is already a clone in name and appearance of my retail DK. We've gone back in time!
---
I alt tab to my 2nd and 3rd screen all the time. Easiest way to get out of a full screen application and to the direct tab you want.
---
Thank you :)
---
Friend was forced to name change (his name was simply 'Boner') and he tried to be cheeky and just pick it again.
---
GM messaged him like 2 hours later with 'okay smartass, here's a 3 hour ban' and his name was changed again on login.
---
I don’t get it..
---
Hunters defintelt have the most complex dps rotation. Not saying its hard, just harder than the rest.
---
Oh wtf you can add opposite factions on bnet in-game???
---
I hit 60 and immediately rerolled warrior due to having 12 rogues on our raiding roster and a lack of need for rogues in dungeons
---
There’s no “later”.
---
Thanks Zeracho
---
I was referring to Murk's comment, stop being triggered.
---
Great insight, I completely agree. I’ll read all class synopses and see what she likes. I’m leaning toward a mage or the hybrid classes like you said for the same reasons. All in all, it’ll be her call though. I’m just here to try and describe them as best I can and play a complementary role when she chooses. If she does go Druid, leveling with someone else will ease a bit of that pain but yeah, not the best leveling experience I’ve had haha.
---
Thanks MoreSmartly
---
Ton of fun. Checks out.
---
Yeah, they didn't want to be part of that shitty alliance
---
You have no idea how much that means to me!! &lt;3
---
Mate, remember we have reputation again. No battlegroups. No server moves. No name or race change.
---
Sure people will get away this stuff but they'll hit top and have a stink on him.
---
I've moved guilds a couple of times due to friends moving. Each time I've thanked for support- even when there's been nothing more substantial as a friendly atmosphere- and let guildies know to hit me up for ports when I'm 40.
---
The assholes are out there, but come 60 the opportunity afforded by begging a mid level run and skipping is gone and the rep remains.
---
i watched this 3 times and that discord sound made me think something was broken. almost as broken as windfury
---
Lv 37 play couple hours a day work 50 hrs a week
---
Because I enjoy pvp, but I also see a bigger picture called server health, dawg.
---
Thank you for the reply. Maybe I’m just taking too much of a true vanilla view on dungeons and should give this a try. With the spell cleave meta and other new tactics it seems that almost anything is possible any more.
---
Interesting
---
Maybe I'm weird but I farm with my succubus out. Immediately seducing when you're getting ganked lets you reset and gives you the chance to reopen, and I really like that.
---
so why comment
---
I only play from my iPhone’s hotspot on T-Mobile. It’s my sole source of internet. $95/mo for unlimited everything anywhere in the world. I get 50mbps down and 12 up. WoW ping is rarely over 100.
---
I don't think you understand how druids work
---
Anyone that is this dumb to listen to someone and not just need deserves it tbh
---
25 but I'm playing a holy priest so it is slow but I enjoy it
---
Both of you seem to act childish and take this game way too serious. I guess this sub turned into a blog or twitter feed.
---
See previous post. Server health is more important than your e-peen gank, slut.
---
51 - got work and life obligations.  Also sometimes I don’t feel like playing.
---
I don’t think you can, tried yesterday and wasn’t possible.
---
Asshole move.
---
yeah just make everybody play mages. how fun.
---
25, 20, 21 , 14, 12, 7 . im aimless and and hop around alot.
---
Yeah exactly. That’s how it always is. I never ganked horde but after some bad experiences I started attacking every one. But now I’m back to peaceful cause I have a mount and personally not a big fan of being dismounted much less do it myself. But I always dismount for fights that have already broke out.
---
Most mages I’ve come across are very passive aggressive and have god complexes, but hunters are really kind and helpful
---
Hey  aren't  you the guy who blacklists people from top 4 guilds  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9ogpq/i\_really\_like\_this\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9ogpq/i_really_like_this_game/)
---
I don’t think so, I think it was accidentally temporarily available but since has been removed. Maybe it’s an old screenshot.
---
I’m in the same boat.  At level 34 I decided I wanted to start working for the Bonebiter axe.  I spoke with Anton in SW and made the long trek to Desolace.  However, I kept getting distracted by quests and just made it to Southshore at level 37 and received the quest from Raleigh with Bonebiter as the reward.
---
It does not change the hypothesis at all, in fact it helps it, but yes I will edit it in. Very foolish to disregard a valid point because of something that doesn't affect the results at all.
---
Mates ran me through SFK. It was great hanging out but 17 xp a kill. Not exactly going to outperform me solo questing or grouping appropriately for a doable dungeon.
---
A simple reloadui fixes it for me.
---
They need to expand their services to Stalagg
---
Lvl 44 and going strong while working 70-80 hrs/wk but no childs yet so that helps
---
He clearly stated the ninja looting rules when formed the guild.  No ninja lootin from people that matter, lol.  Everyone else can get it.
---
58 that would've been 60 if it wasnt for i've been unable to play past 3 days. 
---
But on the upside i'll have plenty of rested exp to catch up.
---
Then i've couple lowbie alts in 10-15 lvl range because i can't decide which alt i want to focus on. 
---
Either priest or warlock or a tank druid. Leaning mostly twards the druid.
---
47lvl, 2 jobs and family. My wife let me play more often then before because it's nice place to meet my old friends and chill out
---
You simply rushed the shit out of the game and wonder why you can beat the defacto tutorial beginner raid easily.
---
If you are 60, it is time to help your guild get a full 40 man group of people outfitted and to farm materials for consumables.  Or get up some alts. One of my guildies who got to 60 before anyone else, just began getting a warrior alt up as well as he intends to make 3 level 35 alts that exist to transmute stuff via alchemy and tailoring.
---
56 and working fulltime as well.
---
This too, every mage so far has been a complete dolt
---
[x] doubt
---
You will be a godsend to healers, just know that prot isn’t the optimal build for levelling.
---
Move it to something easy on the main number line so you can use Alt to modify it to self cast. Dispel at 7? Alt+7 to self dispel
---
No they aren't. A daily quest in the nelf starting zone involves helping a fisher. [It explains that Night Elves literally eat baby octopi raw.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/A_Slippery_Snack) There are also quests where you [cook ribs to feed sentinels](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ribs_for_the_Sentinels) and [Kaldorei Spider Kabob](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kaldorei_Spider_Kabob) is one of the first recipes you can learn leveling a night elf (Kaldorei literally translates to "Children of the Stars" or "Night Elf" which means the spider kabob is named after the Nelves).
---
However, night elves also REVERE and RESPECT nature. [They only take what they need](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/308761107663683585/625530859394564116/Screenshot_3901.png) from nature, so they probably would only kill something if they knew the whole animal was going to be used.
---
That'd be like if Classic launched with TBC's 2.0 balancing.
---
Or if Wrath launched with the Cata pre-patch.
---
Those patches were like turbo buffs before the new xpacs came out.
---
Shreks on Worgs
---
That's why I like classic.  It punishes stupid and makes people smarter.
---
Yeah, I'm level 49 now but I played like 6 hours a day on average. Some of my guild mates played for 3-5 hours a day and are level 41 now.
---
gonna get downvoted but
---
if you see something like Edgemasters drop **in a PUG group** and you don't roll Need, you're the idiot because you had better believe at least 1 person in the group will try to ninja
---
Same for paladin’s, fysa.
---
Lol, I was the tank in this group. Complete silence from the hunter after this.
---
Learn when to use aoe and when to use single target. Very easy to accidently pull mobs when you use aoe at the wrong time
---
Ok all the love here and I use WoW to escape mine too but just be with your family dude. I'm showing this to my wife the next time she calls herself a gaming widow.
---
Wait, you're the 2nd guy? The one telling someone to "eat ass" for just asking you a simple question? 
---
You seem like an asshole. The other guy is 100% in the right here. Idk why you would post this.
---
When you take 15 years of toxic teenagers who grew up to be toxic manchilden and release a game 15 years old this the kind of dirtbags you get. Everyone wants wow classic to relive those days but their is too much greed, ego, and narcissism in the gaming world due to streamers and influencers for anyone to give is single shit about anyone else. Welcome to 2019.
---
I looked around,  I can't see how to do it unless OP uses their account name as their character name. Which admittedly sounds perfectly plausible.
---
“Me next”
---
Yeah I wouldn’t be proud of that dude, pure dick move.
---
Asmongold has said no ninja looting from guildies multiple times.
---
40. Similar position but I'm a priest so I'm I've basically just been doing dungeons to level since 28 and leveling professions. I've never really leveled professions seriously in all my years of Wow so giving it a go this time around - enjoying it so far!
---
Thanks I'll check it out
---
Come on man your main cities are the backdoor into BRM :)
---
Speaking for us mages aka yellow taxi, Fuck Uber.
---
Wiped there like 100 overall in real Classic.  Probably will wipe there again today. Ahhh Classic ... 🤩
---
You do realize the link is 18s long yeah? I 100% agree with you though.
---
Yeah I remember back when I was a child I needed 5-7 months just to hit level cap. Now I will likely manage to hit it in the next 10 days, but it is still quite insane.
---
Good on boss fights and against rogues!
---
Yeah eveey grop i've been in they killed cannoneer.
---
I add them as friends and make a note (as well as ignoring them) just so I can keep track of my enemies.
---
tell me how Shamans aren't unbalanced as fuck?
---
Sunder is one of the cheapest abilities besides hamstring.  If you don't have rage to spend on it as a tank you're doing something massively wrong.
---
Just an FYI, stop using Heroic Strike unless you're over 80 rage.  Heroic Strike not only costs rage but it makes your next auto not generate rage, so it's a lot more expensive than it looks.
---
Completey depends on how you do it lol. If you go into the game already thinking "Ugh, I gotta level" then you are of course doing something wrong. I for one am stoked every day on running dungeons, speaking with guildmates, etc.
---
Indeed, Classic.
---
Without fully doing the math, I feel like the value of the proc/crit is devalued by the amount of abilities that can potentially miss. Damage bonuses to 96% base have a long way to make up, but I don't know how many rogue abilities are guaranteed to land.
---
That's my hunch anyway.
---
Iron counterweight is the best because enchanting your Manual Crowd Pummeler is a massive waste of money.
---
I am a skinner. You think I should stay in Dustwallow Marsh rather than go to STV? I also heard about Swamp Jaguars but people are saying the drop rates are different than before or something.
---

---
Absolutely it would, but that 4% hit only affects white swings, and then it would only matter on 3% of those, meaning I would be surprised if that interplay affected a swing during an entire raid, let alone a single fight, which lasts far too short to consider. 
---
For your second point, there is no reason to pool energy beyond 65, since you can sinister strike twice in a row at that point, if you are fishing for windfury procs. 
---
Your points are valid but they should almost never matter in an MC encounter that lasts 20-60 seconds in my opinion 
---
&gt;I like you write up a lot btw
---
Thanks for reading :)
---
100% worth it, you'll feel much stronger on all fronts, even foregoing the other stats. You can usually find a full shadoweave set on the AH for like 15g total.
---
Did you wipe?
---
Maybe you went oom cause you were level 14? Casting doesnt open up until the 20s.
---
Play a meme spec if you want. Maybe youll find a raid group to take you.
---
What you are doing now is just strange.
---
Play a mage or similiar ranged if yoy want a caster.
---
Edit: just saw you said you want to be a raider. Not sure what "all the way in" means but if you plan to actuslly push the harder content youre not gona have an easy time finding a guild playing a meme spec (as theyre called. We used to just call them bad specs).
---
Youre way behind the curve already and need to start leveling if youd like to participate in phase 2. Youre abandoning classes early barrens when you dont even know what theyre like
---
Warrior doesn't have much in the way of tricky timings involved like say hunter. I'd be surprised if it makes a gigantic difference honestly.
---
I play with 130ms and never really notice.
---
I think the quick reaction rapid-fire straightforward mechanics appeal to younger players and the games they've migrated from.
---
While leveling I cant complain - almost two-shotted a 31 mage yesterday with my 32 druid.
---
Abilities cannot miss as long as you have 6% hit.
---
Pretty sure cleave does as well, both players and cleave from monsters as well.
---
Yo noob here. So uh wtf just happened?
---
Once you find a group, try and put your best foot forward so you can ask to friend-list them. Do some research on the dungeon so you can be a navigator or bring up what loot you want from what bosses. This will make future groups much easier to find. And then once you have a few pre-raid BiS finding a guild should become much easier.
---
But have you tried it? like going near the enemies and hitting them. Did you keep up with mage dmg?
---
Sketch???
---
From what I understand rogue, frost mage, and shadow priest are the untouchable top 3. Warlocks are consistently high rated, and are super flexible as far as how you allocate talent points but usually don't top meters in pve
---
What you expect from the piece of shit that is Asmonbalds guild. They all follow in his image.
---
Whitemane is petty close to even. You are either in a spot where there aren’t a lot of ally leveling with you or a bad layer. Ally have been in giant groups around brd and ubrs killing anyone wanting to run.
---
YES! The elements embolden you.
---
Except sunder generates threat on one target and swipe does it on three.
---
Dude I'm a shaman, I have so many fucking abilities that don't do shit for me. It starts with Windfury and Flametongue totems.
---
So just to squash all the 'lol what an idiot, should always roll need on BOE purples' replies- this happened to my friend Dudechill who has known Royson for a LONG time from retail (and were bnet friends) so he trusted him. After the ninja happened, he blocked Dudechill and removed him from bnet. Doesn't get scummier than this.
---
spare weapons?! nobody got bag space for that, if your weapons break just use your hands like a real man!
---
I'd rather have more convenient FPs than a capital city location.
---
I am surprised that no one that I see doing this is using consoleport
---
Dude the reason Moonkin gets an armor buff is because Balance is a PvP Specc.
---
Guys this is just propaganda created by mages do not uovote this
---
Wanna join my corp?  Bring all of your stuff and move out to 0.0 with us!

Has to be staged. No one is dumb enough to all roll greed on a boe drop. Always need. Fuck outta here.
---
Leatherworking will give you from pre-praid BiS items in the devilsaur set. This will mean it will be useful for yourself, but also as a way to make money crafting it for other people.
---
It's also useful for gearing alts.
---
yeah what an inconvenience someone put 3 lines of text on ur screen lol why do you post this
---
I’m new to wow. Can someone explain what happened here and why it’s amazing?
---
NEED ROG!?! BIG BOY ROG?!?
---
oh shit you can add notes??? thats useful I had no idea
---
I know some guides say not to buy spells you don't have to, like Fireball or Fire Blast if you're a frost mage levelling, but I always found Fire Blast to be a nice "oh no you don't" button.
---
I edited a point in..... what about once you get a shiny nightslayer drop? That kinda fucks the whole thing. Then you will want a lot of the Pre bis stuff.
---
A simple act of kindness which denies an imagined self-interest, and which shows so much :-)
---
Yes I do this and never have to stop to drink. Dark pact between pulls and you can go forever.
---
Lol yeah never fell for that one thankfully
---
needing isn't selfish. not needing it boe stuff like this is just stupid and you should feel dumb for greeding it. 
---
different situation if you are doing a guild run or with friends, but for pugs i start my parties ALL NEED EXPENSIVE BOE and its fine.
---
Haha it was kind of a mix, iirc. The Nostalrius people had some of the fights right but people said "I don't remember it being it this easy", so they got buffed. Some of the buffs were just attempts at tuning unknown code to be more true to vanilla.
---
Get an auction house addon
---
Unbind “backwards” key.  Only way I could ever break the habit lol.

Damn! Outplayed so hard!
---
i sort of agree except in the screenshot he literally told everyone to greed and then needed himself. pretty scummy.
---
Esfand is probably the best ret, and he doesnt even do 50% of the dps other classes do. This will get worse and worse the better gear warriors, warlocks, mages etc. get.
---
I have NEVER skipped bosses in ANY dungeon that wasnt agreed nobody needed loot and nobody cared to sell loot from it. I have even spent 30 minutes of my time to just do 1 extra boss for people and missed out on entire runs doing that. You decided to group with these people. YOU HELP THEM OUT.
---
....and yer arse.
---
Rend is less expensive. I’ve almost never used HS as a tank. After reading the faq on the tanking discord, I probably need to use battle shout first then demo shout to get aoe threat. Then tab revenge and sunder as rage builds. Also, probably need to build rage as mobs begin to die at end of pull and pool it for next pull.
---
Oh, you blowhard.
---
Depends on the Guild really. Loot council guilds often mean that the officers and GM's are the first to receive loot. This has to do with 3 reasons:
---
1. They often fulfill important roles such as tanks and heals
---
2. They can be certain these players will stay a long time with the guild and will be at every raid, so the gear is worth most on them
---
3. They sit in the loot council.
---
My guild simply uses DKP.
---
Cat or wind serpent if you want highest dps. Boar, bear or gorilla if you want tankiest.
---
Cats are great because they have fast attack speed and can learn a lot of abilities. Wind serpents are great because their skill ignores armor and they can eat mage food.
---
That's true of enhancement, where your windfury procs are still wet noodle without a really good 2hand weapon. Elemental on the other hand has a really nice toolkit and impressive burst in P1. It really comes into it's own in P3/BWL where you get enough gear to nearly oneshot people with your burst.
---
Need on BoE Epics might be a good approach but _TELL PEOPLE_ you're doing that, or you're no better than the ninja you're trying to outsmart.
---
absolute chad move to post for 420,69,69
---
i mean there are like 40 slots in eaid fir bossing,and first players will be there,simple as that,no? (i mean i think this is how it works)
---
I do but not for mobile. I use it when I’m doing PvE most of the time.
---
I made a guide on that

---
310 isn’t the same as an additional 3% from 300-305. Scaling doesn’t work that way. Therefore 3% hit from gear is &gt; than the hit calc from 305 to 310. However rogues get the 5% chance to hit if speced so Human rogues can take other talents than the 5 weapon skill and just need to be 1% away from skill hit cap (yellow damage). This isn’t to say any more hit% is bad as it will still effect white damage and crit caps
---
Wouldn't tank UBRS without a shield but everything else is fine.
---
yeah i mean that definitely makes it easier to hate on the guy, lol
---
.... You forgot the 2nd part where one usually explains why.

wrong guy?
---
I mean I think there dicks and you're a bitch. This game is 15 years old who gives a shit.
---
Just kidding love you
---
Cuz if one person said it, the next one will too cuz this is far above the Avg players match skill!
---
Repair whenever you vendor
---
dude i didnt want blame or downvote ya :( I just asked :( Cause maybe im wrong or etc...sigh
---
Might be biased here but the early 60's are a blast to play with, not braindead they play as a group and pick up slack when needed, hunter overaggros I can trust him to either feign, use pet or bring it towards me. Greed on all the moneymaking recipes incase a tailor/smith/alchy needs and greed on travel backpacks, orbs, non mana users pass on runes ect.
---
Meanwhile fresh 60's or high 50's. I shoot 1 arrow and hide behind a corner they all start aoeing instantly I can just play a game of catch and pray that my healer isnt braindead and uses los or I must aggro a new pack to get those casters in the back that are killing the healer cause mages just aoe dont decurse or counterspell. Every item thats worth something is needed on. Nobody speaks, I love banter in dungeons its just night and day not only with randoms also with guildies.
---
I hope they stop enjoying the game and go back to retail real soon.

ClassicAuraDurations show you the dot wearing down like it is default on the retail wow

Holy shit my defensive guy.  He just said you ain't casual if you're 60, which is true my dudemyguymybromychampmychiefmychum, like it or not.  Sorry *you* got offended.
---
you're saying you *don't* like Tanaris music?
---
Ran rfk as priestbthe other day with warrior 2h tanking, 2 rogues and a lock. Did like 1 heal per 3-4 packs, spent nearly all myntimenwand and dotting.
---
They should change that maybe.
---
&gt; Using the mechanics in a way that was no intended
---
In order to AoE farm properly you must willfully pick certain talents that you'd skip if you were just trying to do the most single target DPS. 
---
I have serious doubts that kiting groups of mods and AOEing them was not intended or something the developers did not forsee. If it were not, then those talents wouldn't have existed. 
---
Like I know Vanilla design is pretty haphazard, but Mage AoE farming wasn't some big secret you have to jump through hoops to achieve, it's a build and it's been known since 15 years ago.
---
If noone else needs on it you can always be a good person and get people rolling for it while explaining,make sure you call it fast or have people think your a backpedalling ninja
---
Not extremely strong, but can buff your attack speed for a few minutes. It's level is based on engineering so if you have really high engineering for your level it will be very valuable, especially against stealth. It should regen health while out of combat, never really paid attention though.
---
So you're saying rape is legal if the victim is drunk?

Same gear on male - looks like a catholic monk or Islamic imam.
---
Pre-30'ish, that's not unreasonable. By about 30 you out scale spir pretty bad and it becomes useless though. At that point it flips to the standard str -&gt; Stam -&gt; agi.
---
OP has a 20% chance each swing to proc 2 extra attacks that have additional attack power.  
---
He purged the mage removing his ice barrier, auto attacked, procced 2 extra attacks, and earth shocked.  Then the elemental slapped him.
---
Imagine trying to put someone on blast and it's not even the guy you're talking about lmfao. His name's Royson, not Roysun.
---
Auto-needing on BoE epics does sound selfish up until you see stuff like OP's post happen, then it all makes sense.  Can't need-ninja if everyone rolls need!  You just have to make sure everyone knows beforehand.
---
Not even kidding, I wish I was as unsalty as you.
---
Never once have I ever been beat as bad as you and just sat there thinking about how great the guy who killed me was

So funny my kitten loves watching the screen while I play as well:) yours also looks eerily similar.

Bruh, how it I every 60 ive seen speak acts just like you.

Where tf can I get a wand? I’m a night elf priest.
---
The mage had already gotten the agro of a random mob. decided it was a good idea to attack this shaman. the shaman being beaten up went over the hill to avoid line of sight. The mage ignoring the random mob decided to blink over the hill to attack the badly wounded shaman. A mistake on the mages part. The shaman in 2 hits blap blap'd the mage and nearly got the mage. The mob still chasing, finished the mage.
---
The tank specc is the offspecc. If you have a tank in your group, you can be sure said tank will roll on his DPS specc. And you will not be able to do anything about it, because you are worth 1/30 of a tank. The group can get another DD just as good as you or better within 30 seconds.
---
Pick blindweed if you care about getting gold at a low level.
---
I agree with this.
---
Also, you can train ritual of summoning as early as level 20.
---
I think people using unoriginal titles are obnoxious but I also don't care what anyone on reddit thinks so I wouldn't even listen to myself, according to myself.

Tedious but stable income as Horde is farming shellfish at the Desolace shore base. Repeatable quest, turn in 5 shellfish for 55 silver. Works well if there's no competition
---
Is this a confirmed alt of Royson? Because not sure he'd have time to level a second character already...
---
The shaman purged the frost armor and had no mana for a lightning bolt.  He was completely dead if the elemental hadn't shown up.
---
I been waiting for the 4th episode like a mad man. Seriously when??

Mage blinked into melee range of the shaman. The shaman auto attcked and proced a windfury attack. Windfury has a 20% chance to proc on auto attack.  Windfury generates two extra attacks with 400ish extra attack power. 
---
Shaman follows windfury up with an earthshock. 
---
Mage gets nearly one shot.

Random mob 1 hits mage.

Mage dies.

I don’t think it’s because you’re a newbie but because it took you longer to ask this question than it would be to google it

Hey man, dont wow and drive.

Nope, the OP only posted one thing. you can tell by the "To" from the whisper.
---
Not everyone enjoys things the same way. I don't know how this is still a thing that needs to be said, but here we are.
---
DAMN. Fuck you OP. On another note.. do you think this dude is happy with his guild? lol
---
Mouse binds
---
Windfury proc’d. I don’t know much about shamans but I think windfury is a spell they put on their weapon and has a chance to give an extra swing? Looks like he got three swings in one. Not 100 percent sure.
---
Shadow priest are amazing PvP but horrid at PvE.
---
Roysun is Royson's alt
---
Nope
---
If someone is in the group as a tank or heal, expect them to roll on the DPS gear. If someone is in the group as a DD they need to ask the tank/heal whether they also can roll on the tank/heal gear. This is how it works.
---
Tank &gt; Heal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DD.

---
How many people checked their discord after watching this
---
The easiest and earliest wands are from enchanters, you can usually buy them on the AH.
---
Well it is actually because hunters can get a better crossbow easily from strath, whereas it is bis for rogues.
---
Hunters needing on dalrends are just stupid.
---
They had every right to roll, don't be butthurt.
---
Yeah, i hit 60 yesterday and even i know i didnt play casually, doing my first mc run tomorrow night :)
---
Literally, alls he had to do was stand 10 ft away from the shaman and he kills him. He's a clothie and he sprinted into melee with a tanky melee dps. Of course he got dicked.
---
The trick is having a guild or a premade group you usually raid with. 
---
Yeah hunters in our guild will get their melee weapons, after all rogues got them first. But there will be a point where he will get his stat stick.
---
maybe that's why they're 60, they see objectives and stick to them, unlike the majority of this thread...
---
This is why the "all greed" logic is fucking stupid, why not just all need on something that valuable... ofc you may not use it but this is exactly what happens.
---
Buy a greater magic wand from the auction house. Low level enchanting craftable that are sold for a relatively low price. It'll do you well for heaps of levels
---
Me and my brother did the same for his belt. He got pissy cause he felt like he was wasting time doing angerforge and golem lord.  Next run when he left the belt dropped and as the only cloth wearer I got it.

---
Personally I did it in STV but I'm not on a pvp server. So if you think the ganking really will be that bad I'd stick with dustwallow. The most important thing is trying to find a grinding spot that you can circle. Where by the time you complete the circle the first ones you killed will be respawning.
---
Ohh good to know, I always thought it was a level 28 spell.
---
&gt; while our two sword rogues are fighting against fury warriors for the swords that drop.

And thats why i rolled horde.
---
If I am in a 5-man guild run or a friend run, I am happy to give anyone who NEEDS a BoE Epic the BoE Epic (they've done it for me before).
---
If I even have a single random in the group, all need. Can't take a chance on someone ninja looting 300+g off of a guildie who genuinely needs the item, or me if it is a total pug run.
---
This. If you NEED it. Then that's why there's a need roll
---
Any chance on hit thing doesnt work for bear/cat form. They didnt change that until later.
---
Other dude placed a dot on the mob causing him to get Aggro. However dots don’t count as tagging until the mob actually takes damage from them. 
---
Therefore our streamer boy here decided he was sick of sharing so he tagged the mob ensuring he’d get the loot.

---
Wetlands whelps for lucky pet drop, skinning and herbing too.
---
I thought so too, but apparantly all the mini bosses in Scholomance have a 100% drop rate on a rare item in their loot table, which means these powerful items are not rare.
---
I don't remember this being a thing in vanilla, but it was probably changed late in vanilla as a catch up mechanic.
---
Yeah it depends on a lot for me. If the hordie has a guild name thats pvp-esque, Im attacking no matter the level, or if they attack alliance, or have a bad name, or look at me with their eyeballs!
---
AFK Warlocks with a Fel Hunter out should terrify mages
---
The way that’s written doesn’t mean what you’re saying it means. That’s more to do with copyright stuff and has nothing to do with streaming to your phone or whatever.
---
Should have played Alliance then!
---
Healthstone for the tank (and yourself) and Soulstone for the healer. Whatever mob the tank is fighting you kill that one first usually because of aggro. In 5 man dungeon you usually use imp for buffs and it doesn't die as easy as succ. Keep enough Soulshards with you, that should be easy enough.
---
It depends. The 4 piece shadowcraft is still bis, optimally you will replace chest and shoulders with t1 first, but obviously it will not always work that way. If you get t1 boots and bracers or belt you should probably ditch shadowcraft and go for other preraid options.
---
You lose the buff when you switch, otherwise it'd be best in slot for warriors as well.
---
Hunters need less hit than any other class.
---
KEK
---
There isn't a minimum speed for tanking weapons, but the faster the better for tanking. It just makes tanking smoother, your rage will be usable more often and missing attacks will be significantly less punishing.
---
Found the mage. scholo or strat for instance require a lot of range pulls hide in los to get the mobs grouped up for aoe, but as soon as my arrow leaves the bow mages be spamming that aoe, but they are to braindead to counterspell the ranged mobs a tank cant reach without aggroing another pack. Also decurse and buff the healer, you lazy turds
---
id be careful with that blanket PvE statement. They are bad in raids currently because there's like no gear in game for them. But i've been running 5 mans, Scholo, Strat, LBRS with an spriest healer who is not only doing competitive group dps on average but only needs to drop form to do real healing on certain engagements. Horrid? only if you consider being able to run 3 endgame dungeons per hour, horrid.
---
You are right my bad https://shadowpanther.net/armor-sets.htm

SPILL THE TEA, SIS ☕️☕️

Holy cringe

Thats his paladin alt that he plans on stream all the time

Hunter's fault.

Once learned you can train the ability forever even if you abandon pet.
---
Food isnt that often, just as other classes keep food/water you keep food for the pet instead. Maybe once every 1h once they get some loyalty.

I did exactly this. I got helmet and shoulders.

Swords
---
Yes he’s streamed leveling this alt several times. I watched his streams occasionally seemed like an alright guy but not anymore
---
if there's one mob left in the pack, and you want to conserve the most mana possible, and the mob will be alive for another 8 seconds, and there's no reason to kill it asap, its the best use of clearcasting.

There is no point in putting something in for 1 silver lower if nobody is gonna buy it. If I can create a potion for 3 silver worth of materials and it is listed at 23 silver, I can assume nobody will buy it. If I however list it at 15 Silver, I will have a bunch of Auction house scanners come and buy my potion.
---
That’s fair and I know in 1v1 settings it does well and is way better damage but it’s also super idealistic to think you can tag 1 mob at a time in some of the more densely populated areas of Azeroth. Vanilla teaches that more than any other version of the game. Face pulling, aggro radius, dynamic respawns in caves and other areas. Im pumped it works for you and I see the appeal to the mana battery I just don’t have that same level of luck in the works questing
---
Surely these will be distributed to alts?
---
I mained Troll Warrior back in the day, and never really rolled a mage.
---
This time I did a total backflip and rolled an Alliance Mage. I'm not very far into the game but I feel like 90% of people I see are mages. I rolled a warrior again and I'm loving it :)

If I'm not mistaken, it's better to hold on to that till phase 3, as it's a good twink item. It'll sell way below value now simply because the bg's aren't open yet. I reckon it's worth about 40g, but you won't be able to sell for above 5 right now
---
I am neither shocked or appalled. 
---
You honestly think anyone from Asmon's guild is gonna be honest?
---
Difference is. Hunters sucks.
---
MOST mages that play them because they like the class are actually nice guys. It's the ones who play it because it's the "new black" and "the best class" who are often the jerks.
---
I main healer priest. I have two mages for other purposes (mostly tailoring CD). Mage is just easier to farm on and level if I need profession alts or non-rep kills done.
---
FYI, that hill doesn't block LoS. Don't know if the mage knew that. He might have been trying to get distance from the elemental he aggroed or just wanted to keep eyes on the shaman to make sure he could finish him off.
---
How long did it take him to release spirit?
---
I just got this same exact laptop a couple weeks ago. How you liking it? I just added a dual channel memory kit to it a couple days ago seems like it made a little difference.

You can look down at my comment where I say that none of the T1 is BiS for me...

You still drop out of combat if you get a full duration sheep on someone.

I was leveling as a fire mage but I respecced to frost at level 20 just because I was getting tired of my spells taking twice as long to cast from being hit. I don’t like aoe grinding either, I just prefer the frost toolkit
---
Gz 500g seems like okay but those gloves are BIS until naxx if i remember correctly, because of how weapon skill work. Usually they went for 1k+ but people also need to rrmember that servers now compared to back then has what the triple amount of people. A high pop back then is a low-medium now. And with them increasing server capacity only more people are online playing making these drop more often. 
---
So personally i think you did alright. I hope you got your epic mount now
---
If you have aggro, there is a mob who is running to you, don't run away. Go to the taknk so he can see it and taunt it of you
---
He’s in a guild run by a giant douche canoe.. what did you expect
---
aye the brewfest news was a slap, all those fond memories of all other events came up, and then just dissapointment
---
Well at this moment DPS stat wise they are on the lower end. I have a priest. great heals and great PvP but they lack damage for raids hints why most raids only ask for 1. Always out of Mana. But Spriest will always be my favorite since they look badass.
---
Thanks for realizing your mistake. Hopefully it doesn't happen in the future.
---
The way I worded my post was terrible. When I say full shadow I mean that I get shadowform and use it. Of course I need disc talents too, especially the one with threat and wand dmg.
---
How would you talent it?
---
i only give them food to have them at happy. you're telling me that if i keep giving food they have extra loyalty? even if they are already at happy?
---
I did it in 2006. Itll be easier for you once pvp gear and battlegrounds are live. You can still heal too, id you need to in order to get the occasional BRD/ubrs run. And in mc, with 40 people, there's a LOT of room for inefficiency so a shadow priest dps or healer is fine too.
---
They are attacking Bolvar not Onyxia, Onyxia just ran so we could kill her later in her lair .
---
I'm a warlock with herb / alch, do I have any options to unlock lockboxes outside of rogues?
---
Yes but at that point it's not a pre-BiS list, it's just individual pieces being better than individual shadowcraft pieces.
---
No, and the experience gain gets worse, and there are more people to split the loot between.
---
The only upside I know of running dungeons designed for 5 people with 10 or more people is that clearing it is much easier. Otherwise, everything is worse (loot and experience being the big ones).
---
Just make friends with ferals they tank 1 run you the other, both get to dps its a win win.
---
Remember that in PVE, pet attack speed really doesn’t matter. You can level with any pet just fine, but make sure you know how to keep their abilities up to spec (by training certain beasts of certain levels to learn the skill)
---
I remember when people were giving him shit for sucking at Dark Souls and he had a mental breakdown on his subreddit. It's like, my dude, you've spent 3+ years cultivating a toxic community, then are surprised when they shit talk you.
---
Lol I got sent the photo from a friend
---
Should use Rake against every mob that can bleed. (In dungeons, leveling and pvp, not in raids)
---
Lol... cc report is just one of the letric collected by recount. Same as for instance interupts or damage taken. Or rage generated.
---
Seems your pair has to much control over what you do because you certainly seem like a dick
---
I had both a lock and a mage at 60 in vanilla. To be honest, I preferred the lock. If you like pet classes, I'd at least give your lock a shot to at least lvl 40.
---
Same rotation you read in Dive's guide which I think you should be familiar with. Not having dark pact is no big deal and ruin makes you kill stuff faster.
---
imp drain soul isn't needed but fel concentration is pretty good for drain tanking/solo pve/farming and pvp. My specc for everything:

Is he toxic though? I’ve only seen him on YouTube but he seems to understand how to get views and it’s basically his business. He knows exactly what to say to get a reaction and plays dumb but is it actually toxic?
---
Just repeatably run the dungeons for your level area. You should be able to go RFK right now, so just run this a few times. Then when you are 30ish go to SM and farm SM from 30ish-44. Then go to ZF and farm until you are level 50-52. Then farm for BiS gear in Sunken Tempel and BRD.
---
You really shouldn't make posts if you're so over dramatic and sensitive.
---
I wonder what the excuse would be from the "It's just his persona for streaming" crowd.
---
He breeds toxicity either way.
---
Nature’s blessing
---
Why the hell would all greed? Not saying what he did was right by any means, but by agreeing to greed you allowed it to happen.
---
Yep. Whenever i see a drop i always check his spreadsheets. Really nice information and that guy is an insane serious theorycrafter. You should have a chat with him sometime since you are like minded.
---
Obviously, “bro”. But, I gauran-fucking-tee you this translates into their personality and character, or lack thereof, in the real world. Don’t act like you don’t agree or know this.

Exactly. Just calling it that for easy ref.
---
Well thats fine and all but requires a bit of understanding to WHY we do things a certain way..
---
Most of the players people complain about copy cookie-cutter specs with a vague idea of whats going on and roll with it. Asmongold is the perfect example of this - the dumbass see’s Skarms DW Tanking video and without even watching the full thing runs off into Onyxia’s lair to DW Tank.
---
The video discusses times to do it and avoid it, gear thresholds he needs to pass and consumables required. It worked out for him (apparently, I haven’t seen) but i’d hate to be his healer right now.
---
Lol what? There's a reason why 3 mage aoe groups were the best for dungeon farming. Mage AOE damage is great as soon as they get Shatter.
---
blizz giveth and blizz taketh
---
each side has its pros and cons concerning locations
---
Happens on both sides, I have guild members that rerolled factions even after leveling up a character on the other faction to a pretty high level due to experience with a bad community. Probably varies on servers and factions. Most groups I’ve been in have been nothing but friendly.
---
Male dwarfs just rub their beards together and babies pop out.
---
We’ve found our new Warchief lads
---
Someone aggro'd him while me and a hunter were killing those skeletons and I about shit my chain mail.
---
So he did, why did the rest agree on it tho?
---
Man you got me in the first half
---
What does toxic even mean anymore
---
I rly like reading the stories and being immersed in game.  Optimization for leveling quickly just feels like I'm playing retail... -Pick a quest - kill mobs without knowing why- talk to npc &gt; repeat
---
I don't know about you guys but classics withou ANy addons to give you directions seems like you have a REASON to do all the quests..
---
Also Since is my first time playing classic seems like if I skip some quests I can miss a important chain quest...
---
Legspreaders
---
What you should do is keep an eye on him by adding him to friends list or via /who to see which guild he joins next and then find out who the leader is there and warn them of what happened.
---
Your definition of worked up is far different from mine, lol. 
---
Also, you may never run into this exact person specifically. But, do you truly believe you’ll never run into persons of this nature? If so, ignorance is bliss, I suppose.
---
Played a mage in Vanilla, now i in Classic I play a hunter. Still early days yet but I do miss the versatility of a mage. My style of playing mage was, when the situation get dicey, I'll jump in and aoe the mobs, reason being I'll rather just me dying than group wipe.
---
Do locks have an AoE that burns health? I’ve been healing and sometimes I’ll be healing locks far more than the main tank. Super frustrating when I’m running out of mana 10 seconds into a fight
---
Like I said to the dps warrior who doesn't want to tank, you can play however you like, but don't be surprised if you have some trouble finding dungeon groups. Healers, mages, and warlocks need the same levelling gear as you, and most won't want the loot competition.
---
Same, this may seem petty but if I see a Horde run past me while I get jumped by Alliance i’ll just put that person on ignore. 
---
I’m 100% in on being a Tank for the entirety of Classic so it’s not like i’m hurting for teammates.
---
When you post a vid of yourself, expecting internet points but instead highlighting your douche-ness
---
The amount of people that don’t know trolling is a art. Too damned high.
---
You likely legitimately have a case to have him reported for this, odds are if his account is entirely clean he won't be banned for it but this is literally the only type of loot intervention they'll get involved in.
---
The rules have to be clearly stated and someone has to deviate from the rules in order for them to get involved.
---
Looks like it LOL
---
Hi, /u/Audball59

Lock feels less like a retail class (mage being the closest of all the classic classes to having a full toolkit) and more like a very self sufficient caster tank. Locks are great if you like planning ahead, if you look at your kit and plan ahead you can prepare yourself for basically any fight. You can use your voidwalker to distract, or your felhunter to deal with casters. You have heals prepared in advance through healthstones and self revives with soul stones. If you like being a slow but inevitable force lock might be for you, if you prefer being fast and reactive you might prefer mage.
---
If a warden staff drops and I'm not with my druid buddy Im needing on my epic mount.
---
god damn windfury procs must be the most amazing thing lol
---
In endgame, yes. In leveling? Absolutely not. If this was enforced, how difficult do you think would it be to find a healer or tank? Nobody would want to play this in dungeons anymore because most people are not dungeon grinding to 60.
---
15 runs and chances are the final group will look nothing like it did during the first run. I wouldn't mind committing to help everyone get the weapon, but I can assure you there'll be more than a few who'll be like 'gg it's late lol thx 4 run cya'.
---
Searched "face tent"; 4 days ago and 23 days ago. Am I missing something?
---
Gz bro, u can also go get Bangalash or one of the elite tigers in Stranglethorn.
---
Lucky you, on the alliance side of Zand RP is a rare sight, and a large chunk of OOC talk and stupid names around.
---
It really has more to do with all stats except arguably strength being good for a hunter.
---
Well this post turned to shit pretty quickly
---
See, that’s where I’m torn! I want to be both of what you mentioned in your concluding sentence. Ugh. I love the speed of mage, but I love the utility of certain pets and the other self-sufficient offerings locks bring the to table.
---
It's a hell of a lot higher than Hunter, warlock, or paladin. Druid, rogue, and shaman are all higher than mage though.
---
Holy fuck
---
r/azerothporn has got you covered
---
I am priest in classic I was playing shadow but you are basically forced to heal or u won't get a group on my server anyway, so I respecced holy now I'm bored at lvl53
---
Damn shame, I shall see you on the killing fields
---
The screenshot sure. But I referring to a good portion of the playerbase as this is common to happen.
---
Classic
---
Nugrunner, it's great I tell you. The name is strange, but great.
---
Yeah with guild runs this discussion doesn’t even matter.
---
https://discord.gg/eVtS6p hopefully that works, if not just google warlock classic discord!
---
I NEED 400g. Ty.
---
so no nets?
---
There are some limits to these obligations though. 
---
Some dungeons are long, yes, but there are people who make them needlessly longer - if me leaving is disrespectful, then so is being semi-afk for the whole run and hoping no one will notice. 
---
Need a brb? Cool. AFKing between every pull and making everything take longer? Not cool. 
---
Had a healer like that in ZF today and it was bullshit. The guy was obviously busy with something else too and didn't care enough about everyone else's time.
---
The smart thing on my part would've been to leave - after all, there's plenty of groups for tanks. Ironically HE was actually the one who had to leave eventually, we got a replacement and finished, but in the time we wasted with his bullshit + the time it took for the replacement to get there, I could've literally done 2 Zul'Farraks instead of 1.
---
Why?
---
Mages 
---
yeah....
---
thing is tho. Mages aren't as tanky as hunters. Like a mage can try to grief you and whatnot, but if you're even a warrior with like a bow and arrow and the mage is running away to do bs,
---
you still can do a considerable amount of damage enough for the mage to reconsider his or her actions......
---
and god help the mage if you managed to land even one hit on those dudes. 1 melee swing and like half their health is gone lol
---
Lok'Tar my Ogar
---
I'm supposed to take investment advice from someone who dinged 40 and had 3g to their name?
---
That's like if my financial advisor was in his 50s and living out of a cardboard box.
---
And nobody that has had loot stolen wouldve listened.
---
I wished it was real
---
Amazing how many people still freak out on you. What the fuck man you’re not protection???? You can’t generate threat!!!! Happened to me this morning in Arena BRD when he wiped because we were doing AOE. Drives me crazy.
---
This needs to happen. I know blizz devs frequent this sub so hopefully they'll see this and do something.
---
Thanks but I'll keep at leather working
---
Mage nearly destroys Enhancement Shaman, which is pretty standard and expected. 9 times out of 10 this situation ends poorly for Mr. Shaman. 
---
In this case, the Shaman manages to get out of line of sight of the Mage while on very low health. Mage then uses Blink and lands right next to Shaman, who promptly broke Mage's shields (assuming with Purge, but maybe not) and hits Mage once with his 2H weapon + 1 Earth Shock. That single hit from Shaman's 2H weapon turned into a massive Windfury that brings the Mage to very low health.
---
Mage begins casting Frostbolt to finish off our Shaman friend, when suddenly a water elemental comes out of nowhere and finishes off the Mage right before his Frostbolt goes off. Shaman 1, Mage 0.
---
Bonus: Mage took 10% durability damage from this death because an NPC landed the killing blow.
---
I meant speed it up to a point where it breaks even over just continuing to level and then buying the mount a bit later. If someone is stopping to farm gold at level 40, especially from herbing/mining, then they are already missing any chance of breaking even on anything, since the most efficient thing to do is just keep levelling and get it when you get it.
---
This doesnt make sense. A warlock with a felhunter is literally the hardest mage counter in the game. The only chance at beating a warlock is getting a good shatter combo. We're not worried about your felhunter's melee from being too close to you when it'll get to us in one cast anyways. We're worried about it eating all our buffs and giving you time to get dots up. Warlocks win on attrition, so the longer a fight lasts the better chance they have. A good mage will get in your face and try to end it early.
---
Maybe if you didn't play on a server with 10x more players than the game is designed for, that person wouldn't just get away with it without social consequences.
---
It's a BOE, always roll need on a BOE.
---
Yeah but you then risk one person waiting until others hit greed and then they hit need and take it. You know, like in the OP?
---
SO THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT
---
Mages start wanting 1 gold on my server for 6 stacks of water instead of 50 silver.
---
You will need two sets of armour. I’m 60 now but for farming, I have a set where my principal slots (head, shoulders, chest, wrists, hands, waist, legs, boots and weapon) prioritise physical stats (strength, stamina agility and maybe some int if it happens to be there) and my accessory slots (neck, back, rings, trinkets) prioritise mental stats (int, spell power, healing power, spell crit). That seems to work well enough. 
---
For healing, it’s all int, healing power, spell crit and stamina. Whenever you hand in a quest and none of the rewards benefit your levelling gear, look to see if any of the other items improve your healing set, even if they’re cloth, leather or mail. 
---
This is the levelling spec I use:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0555312--05205050202315
---
I judge wisdom on a mob and then throw up righteousness and then judge it on cool down. You can heal while getting hit thanks to Spiritual Focus so just throw in a heal if you’re getting low. 
---
At level 52, start running Blackrock Depths a lot! There’s tons of healing gear in there!
---
Levelling a paladin is tough. Your 50s are going to be horrible! But you can’t lose xp in WoW so every step is a step forward. 
---
I’m on 400 +healing and 12% spell crit now with a full holy spec and I’m starting to get a glimpse of what life is gonna be like as a well geared paladin healer and I like what I see. Keep going; it’s worth it!
---
What a POS
---
lol windfury is KA-RAAAZZZZCCCEE
---
Currently on this one!!
---
Sucks I gotta fly all that way back there....
---
I guess we should all roll mage so that we can farm
---
But won't engineering be &gt;more&lt; useful?
---
Thank you, I joined! It looks really informative
---
He's 100% toxic lol you havin' a laugh m8?
---
I thought classic has a pristine community?
---
I remember that! I was surprised they allowed that up. I mean, she's clearly nude.
---
Damn nice, I myself started when i was 4 on my brother account and haven’t stopped since!
---
Love the game through and through,hope your kiddo enjoys it as much as we all do.
---
All hail the shaman!
---
Maybe if you dont value hit!
---
Spell crit requires 15% before it hits its cap.
---
Talents/intellect allow 5%, so you need an extra 10% from gear/consumables. 
---
If you're frost/arance then priorities are crit&gt;dmg&gt;int
---
If you're fire, priorities should be dmg&gt;crit&gt;int due to the talent tree and rotation procs.
---
I'm playing on a PvE server, would that make it ok to go leatherworking?
---
You stole almost everything in this video from [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-cloth-farming-silk-mageweave-runecloth-felcloth) wowhead article and failed to credit the original author.
---
I can't hold a candle to this guy, but I'm glad he confirms my theory.
---
He's a priest. They have no stuns. It's obviously best to save blink, but sometimes using it as a gap closer against certain classes is a necessity to do any sort of decent damage.
---
He never claimed he didn't ninjaloot. He openly condones it as long as it directly benefits the guild's interests, and he states it all the time. What Royson's doing here is blatantly just 100% greed since he told everyone to greed it then threw it on the AH for a pretty penny.
---
The Internet is part of the real world, whether you you'll physically meet them or not is irrelevant because the feeling of betrayal and time and effort that was wasted due to this dick-move is very much real.
---
Its like you don't realize that people on the internet area real people in the physical world.
---
The point of these quests is to show you zones that have level appropriate quests for you to do. People complain that there are not enough quests available but that'd actually not true.
---
I went on my servers discord and a friendly Night Elf helped me out. Thank you for caring though :)
---
He fast.. he really fast.. he make fast people look... Not fast.
---
PoM pyro was the most fun pvp build. Just for the times you got to do it.
---
&gt; At least rogue CC stops being CC when the target is damaged.
---
umm, what? Cheap shot and Kidney shot would like a word.
---
Most people don't have the gear to powershift yet. So feral isn't too scary, but they can get away whenver they want.
---
Play the game yourself, noob.
---
Only thing I want to add is that you ALWAYS have a 1% chance to miss, even with yellow hits while capped.
---
Yeh, it's super depressing but I'm hoping for some random redditor to msg me about a computer they don't use anymore haha. I've got a family to care for and it's my only escape between work and my family. One day I will return to finish levelling, what a joyous day that will be!
---
Because it's a social game, where people are supposed to help each other and have fun. And because people are inherently good and a few are assholes who will exploit this.
---
Yeah just had to setup the chat things in the install again. Thanks
---
If you had screenshots where you discussed loot rules and showing that he broke the arranged agreement this post would be relevant. I don't like Asmon or his ilk but this means literally nothing without more information.
---
20/0/31 for sure. The exact build I follow is on wowhead
---
If you don't want to heal, don't play a class with a heal.
---
What a bitch move
---
Then let your wish be granted.

Also as a bonus here is Preach also streaming Dark Souls, can you notice any big difference between the two players. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/367699911
---
Bone broth
---
yes, he is actually toxic
---
Totally. Not only is the art good but the panelling is spot on too.
---
Im so torn between Rogue and Hunter, Im a PvP player, I do prefer Rogue for PvP, and I feel like ranking in Phase 2 is gonna be way easier as a rogue.
---
But the leveling/raiding experience of hunter is soooo much better than rogues imo
---
I dont think its working correctly I tried to add the textures but they arent loading correctly?
---
2009! = 5.039220013x10^395
---
That’s a really late year
---
More appropriately hunters are the new mages. Classic came first.
---
I disagree. Every DPS warrior I've dungeoned with faceplants 3-4 times and they can't figure out why.
---
I dunno jackass... You charged in 1/2 a second after I pulled, raged, and popped your cleave and whirlwind. I have no idea why everything turned to you and pimp slapped you.
---
Rez them up for the next pull and watch them repeat. No fucking concept of threat management which simply doesn't work out in their favor in the level 60 dungeons.
---
Anyone playing on a streamer service like Faerlina are just dense, why would you want to be on a server where everyone is just sucking a couple people off.
---
Ehh I disagree, in the upper levels everyone will start looking the same when you need the same gear to do pvp and raids
---
Transmog let's you create a identity for your character
---
As a hunter i love laying random frozen traps on the road for horde to get caught in.
---
I usually jump sideways tbh
---
These people?
---
Wtf you mean these people?
---
Honestly, when items are worth so much then there is no “main spec need” anymore. It’s BoE. You can buy it if you really need it.
---
I play both :)
---
Same same but different
---
Hmmmm, are they showing up as green squares?  
---
In game type /wa  
---
Check under the 'BarUI' group for the 'HBGlass' auras and ensure the texture path is correct, or just delete them as they only add slight shading.  
---
Let me know how it goes.
---
I hate that this cynicism is on point.
---
The plaguelands are a pathway to abilities some consider unnatural.
---
The people I work for barley understand how computers work, these are some dinosaur motherfuckers lol.
---
Leeway system is honestly silly, you can get up to 10+ yards of melee range which is just absurd.  It was in vanilla because there was a lot more latency 15 year ago.  Since thats not the case anymore, it's actually more like Vanilla if the leeway system was taken out.
---
I really disagree the hype has any relationship at all with bracks comments on stage. All that is just a sideshow. People don't enjoy long term commitment mmorpgs just to give the middle finger to an ignorant developer.
---
Stick it out you will get better. I personally would advice you to level in as many dungeons as possible though.
---
Be sure to join! They sound fun
---
Windfury crits like that is awesome. Both parties are equally shocked.
---
Mage: WTF just happened
---
Shaman: Holy shit I almost one shotted him
---
Someone get on that
---
He is ok with Ninja looting as long as it doesn't hurt his guilds or his friends guilds.
---
Because that is too complicated, he just says no ninja looting at all as a rule. Will be interesting if he does anything (I doubt it).
---
Wow you are missing the point.
---
play what you want, you need to have fun with it, not your friends
---
Lol, 15 mins, when i finished my SoW someone glitched it and Onyxia sat there for hours.
---
You could easily make that in like an hour doing world quests and such.
---
Asmongold breeds the worse behaviour in classic. Im so happy I play on eu realms.
---
Dwarf gets fear ward, nightelf gets some shitty damage ability.   Tbh it's a pretty big difference, fearward is nuts in classic.
---
Only rare BOEs
---
So he declares loot rules in chat and then immediately violates them. This is akin to scamming and you have all the evidence you need. Your whole group should report him for scamming, he deserves a temp ban, at least.
---
The problem with this is if I am running the dungeon just for a BOE epic, then I rather know ahead of time people are doing this so I don't run the dungeon. If this is the norm, I guess I just gotta farm gold because I am in no way taking a 1/5 chance on something.
---
I can extend your logic to all loot because of this. I could need on BoP items because I can disenchant them for valuable crafting material I can sell on the auction house.
---
That is theft. 
---
What a shameful thing to do.
---
Very night elf from you.
---
No... with 315 weapon skill it would be 5%.
---
&gt;I’ve only seen him on YouTube
---
I've been watching him on Twitch since 2016, yes he's toxic as fuck. The best thing is he tries to pretend he doesn't have a toxic community with banning people in chat for almost anything and makes fun of other streamers for having a toxic community (Forsen), but he acts like a fucking moron most of the time and then wonders why he attracts toxic people. Like he used to be even racist on stream before TOS and then was mad why his stream attracted racist people and had to ban cmonBruh and TriHard after TOS because of course he's completely against racism and never was racist. By the way his obsession with banning emotes that trigger him is laughable as well, banning BabyRage emote is fucking ridiculous for example.
---
I preferred his stream back when he was starting, no pretending and his ego was way lower than it is now. He also wasn't triggered by everything. He was toxic even back then, but at least he was open about it. Now he's trying to play some kind of Twitch saint and purge the toxicity from his toxic chat that got attracted by his toxic personality in the first place.
---
which website is safest for downloading classic addons?
---
Herod was specifically chosen by most of the community because it isn't a streamer server. 
---
Also, as someone who's been playing on the server since day one, wtf are you talking about it being toxic? Please go back to your RP server.
---
it requires one of you to die near the door i think.
---
You're playing the prisoners dilemma with someone for whom there is minimal to no punishment for choosing "betray". The optimal play for everyone is to "betray"(Need).
---
I watched Asmongold's stream for 10 seconds when they were on the front page of twitch. He was MTing molten core. In the couple minutes I was watching a tank piece dropped, he stone cold fucking ninja'd that shit and spent the next ten minutes shouting down anyone who complained because "I'M MT THIS AIN'T BABY WOW MT GETS ALL THE LOOT."
---
I've been operating on the assumption that anybody who would willingly associate with that chud piece of shit is human trash this whole time tbh.
---
What spec guide/build would you recommend?
---
You’re reaching a bit too far with your argument. I doubt you don’t see the difference between needing on every little crap and needing on something so valuable that could finance you your epic mount or another BoE epic.
---
Keep an eye out for updates, I believe it was fixed or getting fixed soon
---
I remember farming it by killing elite dragonkins in winter spring back in the day. I was lucky enough that it dropped after a few kills.
---
Fuck this guy..
---
Sold me on it almost entirely until that last part. That's super lame! Why is that?
---
Can’t kill someone that’s already dead.
---
I always yell out "ALL NEED" as fast as possible.
---
Where can I watch his streams?? What's his streamer name?
---
Guys it's so good. Tip your warlocks.
---
Effectively none. Herod was chosen by most of the community because it isn't a streamer server and that's why the queues were so brutal originally. This guy is talking out of his ass.
---
It's the brutal way of life on pvp I'm afraid.
---
Want to wPvP at 60? Going to have to tough it out.
---
More interested in bgs or pve? Go back to pve.
---
Be warned, you will probably get flamed hard by some of the Chads in this subreddit for the next day or so xD
---
You can just say u always roll need on boe epics and then reroll with /roll
---
Or you can just say that and hearth
---
What the fuck? what is the joke then?
---
Thanks.
---
Dude, you don’t get to dictate people’s response to anything. That’s not how it works. 
---
You’re straight up just asking for anyone who agrees with this really stupid idea that killing other players in pvp realms is bad to reply to these threads, and everyone else who disagrees to ignore the post. 
---
That’s an echo chamber. That’s stupid.
---
Which is why he is an idiot and it’s very suspicious to see. He should be saying, “all need”
---
Thank you
---
Mageblades as well
---
Asmon himself said this many times on stream:  ninja if its not in your own guild
---
The sad part is he probably thinks he was the victim due to how hesitant you were for accommodating his every whim.
---
This didn't work. This macro only casted one of them at a time.
---
You do realise no one can see your specc right?
---
So you say you can heal, you heal, they dont know you're shadow.
---
I'm healing every dungeon and I'm full on shadow specc, no issues.
---
Least he wrote Gnomeregan right
---
Yeah I’m sinking a lot of time in to professions as well. Generally just re exploring everything. Having a blast so far!
---
You can block channel invites in your setting Incase you didn’t know!
---
Another reminder of why I chose not to roll on the streamer server. It attracts a toxic community.
---
110 after today. So depressing lol!
---
Imagine not jumping over every possible thing in the game.
---
I’m joking – I completely agree with you. This is super annoying and has definitely caused me to die multiple times in SM. Mostly happens on my Undead Female but it has also caught an Undead Male model once or twice.
---
that is not messed up. Those two items were swapped in loot tables in patch 1.10, so they only redid the first version.
---
Is it? How so.
---
I got mine at 48, don't despair!
---
Nice guys guild version
---
As a warrior
---
no
---
I said “small group of mages.” Yes, you need good mages for successful world pvp. They are the engage tool. This isn’t anything new. Doesn’t mean everyone needs to be a mage dude.
---
&gt; If you're missing range autos 
---
No, you're not missing ranged autos.
---
&gt;because you're inept at spacing appropriately via wingclip/strafeing and all the other tools you're given. 
---
Yes, the fact someone chooses the superior of 2 options means they're not capable of doing the inferior one, that's some solid logic you got there.
---
&gt;You sitting there raptor striking is NOT A GOOD THING it's not free damage.
---
No, you're not *sitting there* you're walking in there while waiting for your auto shot, hitting, then moving out again.
---
&gt; I highly doubt you're capable of melee weaving given your thoughts on this whole matter.
---
So your argument is that a bad player shouldn't aim to improve? Are you for real?
---
&gt; you're just bad at being a hunter.
---
Lets pretend that's true, why does this matter?
---
&gt; And even worse you're a shit groupmate for screwing over your melee counterparts.
---
How exactly are they being screwed?
---
I’m on a PvE server and was accidentally flagged for PvP. While waiting for it to go away I got jumped by a low lvl hunter who had no pet out. I spent a few minutes giggling while fearing the poor bastard before I put him out of his misery.
---
It's like sending an unsolicited dick photo, no one wants that shit!
---
The quest chain to get the class might for both a Warlock and Paladin takes you to Maraudon IIRC and it isn't available until phase 2.
---
So if you hit 60 before you'll have to buy a normal race one, afterwards you'll get a discounted one during phase 2.
---
I'm not sure I prefer yet, I find them both super fun to play. The only thing I regret now is rolling Alliance. I was always Horde but wanted to try something a bit different this time!
---
The best thing about streamer's guilds is you know who to avoid like the fucking plague.
---
When is the "Asmongold Reacts to Olympus Officer NINJA LOOTS!" coming out
---
Stop playing with my feelings.
---
Are you 12?
---
Specially when capsized advert
---
I say need if you'll equip it, greed for gold.
---
Literally the only reason why I would login into retail is my DK but their class design is probably the worst it's ever been now so sadly I don't even miss my DK that much.
---
REDDIT
---
Curseforge
---
Sure you instantly become the ninja that can let everyone /roll for a BOE instead of risking it get ninja'd by the other guy holding out until the last second to ninja need for hundreds of gold.
---
Who would you rather run instances with?
---
LOL awesome, FUCK mages man.
---
Witch hunt? Witch hunt is hunting someone with out proof.
---
You could if you thought the silver was worth more than equipping the item. With needing on blue BoEs the basic assumption isn't that equipping isn't worth much. It's that there is always some fool who will pay more than it's worth.
---
You need to use more buzzwords. It's very helpful for everyone, but as I said I'm done. Points have been made and this isnt worth my time (kinda like I pointed out about the same people making the same comments over and over on every thread like this).
---
hunter is harder to play in a lot of situations IMO
---
Does anyone expect anything but this from Asmongolds guild?
---
Totally agree. I remember when they announced classic. They mentioned that they wanted a pure vanilla and experience. I had nightmares that they would just fire up the 2004 engine with its 14 inch non flat screen monitor 256 colours standard graphics setup lol.
---
Sorry it triggered you so much, I have zero need to explain why I rolled alliance. It’s telling that you feel the need to justify why you rolled horse.
---
20% chance to get 2 extra attacks with extra attack power.
---
Obviously, for items that expensive everyone deserves a shot at it.

---
Well GOLLY. If you say so then what're we doing wasting our time believing something else?
---
Some rando ain't getting priority over a 500g item just because they can equip it lmao
---
Good on him for respecting the 1 on 1
---
this guy should feel bad
---
Thaaaaats about the dumbest thing I've ever read.
---
It's like every new comment adds a new layer of cringe to the mix. Hard to believe you could keep being disappointed with every new comment in the thread
---
I'm toxic and even I hate asmond.
---
Yeah this is good shit
---
I miss Durotar, Orgrimmar and The Undercity. I miss my Banshee Queen.
---
The Alliance never have to learn the pain of Mankrik's wife. It was a character building experience
---
Considering context the guy was trusted. Trust can be exploited.
---
Then try /castsequence reset=10 Holy Fire, Shadow Word: Pain
---
Why do people watch this asshole? I don't get it. Is it a hate watch thing?
---
I’m in Olympus II and I can tell you it’s an absolute toxic shitshow. One of the officers, Leifer, regularly makes anti gay and transphobic comments. Two members, prestongravy and fartlover, constantly flood chat with cringey attempts to be edgy, and Angelvomit goes off on racist tirades. Just today he went on a rant about how black people are destroying Chicago. Day in and day out there are trolls in the chat making furry emotes and weeb chat, all the while the officers faux-threaten bans while they low key encourage the toxicity and chaos.
---
&gt; Whisper me AOTC achieve for invite ... ugh. People ruin everything
---
I don't get it, you took the only positive thing about achievements as your example of why achievements suck?
---
I wait to roll until I see what everyone else has rolled. As long as someone doesn’t roll need then I greed as well.
---
They were in guild. This is illegal. Rules on loot when stated, have to be upheld, this is actually bannable.
---
Shop smart. Shop S-Mart... YAH GOT THAT?!?!
---
I think the problem is that people are too averse to grinding. They avoid quests that have low drop rates, run around avoiding mobs that aren't the ones they need instead of killing stuff that's in the way, and don't realize/care that you can make a ton of gold just spending some time killing beasts until your bags are full.
---
On my 54 rogue, I have lots of quests that are on the brink of turning gray, and I've got at least 5 zones i haven't set foot in, not to mention all of the dungeons from ST up.
---
I love these quests that send me all over the world. I don't try to super-optimize my routes. I'll go off to the other continent to do some things, and maybe do a few quests there then go back to a city and turn in some things, hit the auction house, go do some, gathering, fishing, or cooking.
---
theres this really cool lookimg shoulders i want but its only 9str/sta and im a rogue. i have these shoulders with a 15 stam and +6 agi/5str but they look really ugly. will i lose a lot of dps if i wear the better looking ones?
---
Fair
---
Whats the lesson?
---
So I'm going to start farming mara princess tomorrow for my Warrior. My question is what's going to be the easiest way to exit the instance to run it again if I get a group that wants to stick around for a couple runs? I don't remember an easy way to get back outside after killing princess.
---
Not really, look at guys like Seagull or Venruki. They're positive and upbeat dudes with clean content and good attitudes, their chat is a reflection of that.
---
Someone saying "All Greed" is already a scum move. If anyones saying that, don't comply directly. Wait until all other players have rolled greed, then greed as well.
---
Glorious
---
this is the only reason i’d get a tesla
---
Played with RPers in a few games. Most arent bad by mechanics standards, but the time and material investment for classic Naxx is a time tink most arent able to commit to. RPers, on average,  tens towards simple content for their endgame. WoW, ESO, Swtor for my experience playing with RPers

Blood for the god Hakkar?
---
I'm not lying. Our experiences can be different. Is this something that exists in your world? Wtf Bro.
---
Some people are honest. When they ask me if I'm Shadow and I am I say yes. 
---
And for some people it is an issue depending on server and how honest they are. I have been turned down already (which level are you 20?

For price to rise three times, little bit = couple months.

---
I have literally zero interest in raiding beyond maaaybe BWL, and I just want to have a bunch of high level alts to jump back and forth between to casually pvp on. I have no interest in getting tier gear, so what do I replace these things with? The blue pvp sets?

Interrupting is all you do in retail now.
---
You can. If someone ninjas during a run where loot rules where clearly mentioned, a GM will remove the item from the ninja and give it to the person that won the roll. That's rarely done but it happens. Don't think it's comparable, but maybe somewhat?

what r u a cop like goddamn

Nah this is enough proof just in this screenshot. A gm would easily over turn this to whoever rolled the highest

No... but the people who watch him and support him... what does it say about them?
---
Then there’s me who has been dungeon leveling since I could enter RFC
---
He didn't specify a subject, although reading it, it definitely leads you to believe it's him.
---
It's his job to spend nearly all of his free time playing the game, and considering MTs get geared out first I don't really see the problem with this specific example. If you're have one person dedicated to getting pummeled it would make sense for him to get pummel-minimalizing gear before anyone else. I get your distaste for him but I think it's a poor example.
---
Correct. Go prot at 55 at the earliest which is when you can start spamming BRD runs
---
Everyone always needs money.
---
Therefore I should roll need on literally everything. BoE, BoP, doesn't matter - vendor gold is just as liquid as AH gold.
---
^/s
---
To be fair it was no different back in original vanilla, the MTs always had loot priority on tanking gear, and it’s no different to any serious end game guild
---
Just like that Ice Poseidon guy. The bigger you are the harder you fall.
---
Ok So It loaded the textures.. thats fixed now it looks like a red pie though. but i can tell they are here now
---
Did this earlier as a 58 warrior and 60 priest, that poison is rough. We had to pull out all the tricks and kite him around in circles for what must have been 15 minutes until we killed him.  Felt damn good to win that fight though.  Should have just kited him there instead, might have been faster lol.
---
Or reset=8 depends on Holy Fire cd, not at home to check it, but it should be work.
---
Can confirm. This works 100%.

It sounds like you need to come back. ;)

Just last week was a post about how “locked chests are rogues loot - who else is going to open” so we can rule that one out..

https://youtu.be/AWqaBjgAaUI?t=65
---
note to self: say "all greed" when BoE epics drop to increase your chance of getting the item
---
I have no idea.
---
I can safely say that there are more female trolls than tauren or orc
---
Asmon has also been policing ninja looters in Olympus
---
Yeah literally everyone rolled the greed it wasn't just one guy. They all trusted him.
---
All quest npcs? Are you use those aren't quests you have outleveled?
---
you did by making this post
---
look at cohhcarnage for reference of having a massive stream with a great chat
---
And then a gnome rogue comes along and slaughters you. Pretty picture :D
---
not even close.
---
Cheers for the replies 🤘
---
Yes I got mine at 40. Rogue.
---
You're selling a stack of 3 clothes, beast of satan
---
Aside from the logic, if everyone is rolling the same thing why not all roll need so there is no chance for someone to roll something higher? Seems like what should be done.
---
Don't take it so hard. It's just nerd bullying. They have been around and seen others bullied for posting this and they want to fit in. Everyone can be savage on the internet. Especially nerds. 
---
You'll be fine. Just don't show anything in game without the highest quality screenshot you can get and never, never, ever just take a pic from your phone no matter how easy that seems. And don't bitch about pvp. They are sensitive about that.
---
Yes. There's a reason the greed symbol is gold.
---
I can feel that bitch slap through the screen
---
&gt; Melee Warlock.
---
&gt; Tank Hunter.
---
&gt; Spellpower Rogue.
---
&gt; Sadly OP thinks stuff like Ret and Enhance are memes and not perfectly functional builds.
---
You have to define meme spec. Since a Hunter Tank can get t'ill AQ, if you do it properly. I don't know about melee warlock but I know that a Warlock Tank can get half-way into AQ. As a normal rogue you do stack a great deal of spell damage potions and buffs since Shadow Oil will outdps rogue poisons but idk if that qualifies as a spellpower rogue.
---
Name 1 "big streamer" who hasn't a toxic chat, go on.
---
I just feel like if he needed after being told to greed then  HE would have got shit for not listening to someone of higher rank. Am i wrong to assume this?
---
Are you high? The item is worth 400g tops and I just checked—rates are &lt; $0.6/g.
---
Cast sequence macro on a random bind that you can spam while autorunning.
---
If you win the roll u can sell the item and then get your BiS. Every class has something they need to spend some pretty pennies on. 
---
HOWEVER, if there's someone who clearly would equip it there and then. I strongly suggest the winner of the roll to get some good karma by perhaps selling it to him at 60% of the going price.
---
And that is 100% the right mind when choosing what realm to play on.
---
Am I getting annoyed if I get ganked at the same spot by the same people a couple of times in a row? Sure, but then I'll just go to another spot for the time being because I was well aware of what I was signing up to when choosing a PvP realm!

Oh the "It's just a game" argument. Would you kindly give me all your gold then pls? It's just a game, right? You wouldn't be so stupid to actually care about your gold then, right? It's just a game LOL!
---
You should mention that he's playing Warrior like a 6 year old child.
---
Only sunder. The guy doesnt change stance, doesnt stun, doesnt charge when he can, doesnt mitigate shit, doesnt dump rage.

He's a poor example of a wow player and he's annoying.
---
Random guess. It may have been someone used to reading manga.
---
Reading that drawing R-L gives you a very different general impression than L-R because of the establishing image that then lends its context to the rest of the picture.
---
Looking at it R-L it seems a lot more harmless, whereas L-R it cant really be anything but soft core furry porn.
---
Always amazes me how people defend this kind of thing.  It was a dick move, there is no way around it.
---
I agree - what's wrong with advertising to people who are in a guild already? Eat ass @OP!
---
From a maximum potential perspective dwarf wins hands down with no competition.
---
Desperate prayer and fearward are the best alliance priest racials and dwarfs get both... NEs get neither.
---
He's talking about "large streamers", and all of them have a toxic chat, some have less toxicity than others, but all of them have toxicity in the end
---
ive been an off tank in a guild, MT always gets the gear first. thats the way it goes
---
&gt; In that situation everyone needs and you trade it to the person who actually needs it?
---
That's how I personally do it since you can't trust people to *not* need it. 
---
&gt; it's best to avoid randoms at all cost then
---
Pretty much the best way to avoid drama for sure.
---
Only to save face. He  constantly admits he himself ninjad his way through most of the game and he thinks people deserve it. 
---
What he doesn't get is that it's pixels In a game
---
Why should they?
---
thats an ez ban and removed item. hope you submitted a ticket brah.
---
There is no evidence I've seen that weapon skill affects the yellow hit cap.  Weapon skill primarily affects glancing blows.  Furthermore, as soon as you get a real tier 1/2 upgrade you will break all your benefits of having the set items.  Having best in slot items that don't require a set bonus is beneficial once you start raiding.
---
I like having streams or videos on while gaming so l don’t feel so lonely/keep the mind busy while playing uncompetitive games, most of the times I wouldn’t even remember specific things about the streams! I just like having a voice in the background. I guess it’s kinda like semi-listening to a soap on TV while cleaning your house or something.
---
it's classic and your energy regen is very slow, should be no need to mash anything. You get like one sinister strike every 4 seconds or so
---
Stonks
---
Be careful doing this shit. I fought horde for a solid 2 hours trying to finish that dsmn quest. 
---
Horde shaman thought he was smart and purged it off of one of our group members. I was terrified to go up there until I realized the shaman didnt get aggro from it so I purified him, and then one at a time the rest of his dps friends. 
---
Queue trying to do the quest many times fighting 5 or 6 hordies with my 2 friends until I say fuck it and go to sleep.
---
I haven’t had the sound on WoWC since after the first day. All I do is listen to music while I play.
---
&gt; WHEW!
---
&gt; Thank God I'm playing Holy DPS and not Ret.
---
Well... technically the highest dps you can achieve as a damaging paladin in Nax is by having most points in the Holy tree. (hell even Holy Shock for most fights)
---
I know you were trying to be funny but it backfired.
---
Awesome sound design mate
---
You're absolutely correct.
---
It should be a crime to use the word "racist" are we talking about the same Asmongold who bans people who use the word Naga on chat?
---
Also been listening since that post, 11hr is a beefy playlist.
---
Ride the boys!
---
"Do it for a guildee?" He was 100% manipulating and taking advantage of you. Im sorry 😔 for what it's worth, this hasn't been my experience at all; don't let the bad apples ruin the bunch
---
You actually chose to roll on the streamer server? Better in his hands then one of you just giving it to asmon for free
---
What a shitty comment. This is so far from the truth unless you play with min maxers.
---
Who?
---
BOEs are only gold for everyone, so that logic doesn't hold.
---
He's saying need but it's just a backup to avoid this. If someone genuinly needs it and will equip it on the spot it can be given to them after.
---
100%
---
I've grouped with a few warriors who don't understand how to fucking stop attacking too.... Whispered shamans to stop dropping WF for a warrior at least 3x so far.
---
I had something similar happen, but it took me months to realize I was being conned. 
---
Guy seemed super nice and was always upset that he couldn't play much due to real life responsibilities. I would help him farm mats for his professions and he would pull stuff from the bank for X, Y, and Z reasons. Always explained why he was taking it. 
---
One day I happened to stumble upon a trade he posted on the AH of stuff I had sent him earlier. Searched for other things and they were all posted. He was literally using me as his farming bitch to make gold. I asked him why he would do that, and he just put me on ignore with no explanation. It's sad you can't trust who people seem to be.
---
1. Getting fucked over by someone you trusted is a shit thing regardless. 
---
2. This is ninja looting with more steps. If a raid used FFA and someone ninja loots, by your logic we couldn’t call it ninja looting because we “could have just as easily [looted it].”
---
I don’t get this either. I’ll emergency shield them expecting them to back off before they get murdered through it
---
Dan ninja fun king hate them if you can’t play the game right Fuck of and let other play  just black list him
---
These last few comments just feel like an advertisement.
---
Did you know that that gear can be equipped? Weird concept I know.
---
If you're getting wrist pain, your body is telling you to change your environment. 
---
Get gel wrist pads for your keyboard and mouse. Consider switching to a vertical mouse. Stop mashing and stray weaving abilities between auto attacks.
---
best pvp healers in the game :-)
---
I use an MMO mouse. So worth it. Makes things so much easier.
---
Why the hell wouldn't you sell it from a bank alt?  This guy is clueless.
---
At least he got undercut by 70g on one of the top BoEs on the game lmaooo
---
On Pservers edgemaster's go for over 1k, standard.
---
I wonder if they will stay at under 50% of that value for classic
---
They are bis until cthun iirc, Gauntlets of annihilation **edge** them out , slightly
---
I’ve been having that issue with melee dps personally.
---
Where's your grounding totems dude.
---
It does matter if it's boe or bop, because bops can represent something other than money to a person, a boe can't.
---
No. When you get these types of rare world drops you get to keep it yourself, even if someone else 'needs it more'. They sell for a hefty price on the Auction House, so in essence y'all are rolling for a big lump of gold, not the item.
---
Pretty much everyone needs more gold, right
---
Honestly just play the talent you like, don't buy this crap that you have to be the 'meta' dps class to be viable, the raids are about to bring 40 people, not a 'meta' comp. If you don't have fun with what you're doing it won't worth it in the long run, even if you want to help your raid.
---
We have a ret pally. He was #15 DPS in MC tonight with little to no BiS. Play what you want man
---
I want to press it once and have both skills go off, one after the other.
---
Sure! Give me your character name and realm and i'll mail you my gold
---
Who cares about "big streamers?" You don't *have* to follow something just because it's popular.
---
He cut ties with a friend because the friend is a piece of shit.
---
I'm gonna stop using the auction house, nothing sells. Better off selling to vendor.
---
This mentality isn't just exclusive to vanilla, or even wow for that matter. 99% of the time, your MT is tanking and often the only tank. When they die, it's pretty hard to recover from that, which is wasted time and repair costs. It's only logical to make sure your primary damage sponge is the most geared.
---
You should post guild and server..protect your fellows from whatever this fucking is
---
I agree with you, but you’re being too idealistic if you expect everyone else to play fair
---
Im 39 now and sitting on about 20g as a mage with mining and herbalism. I did lend 15g to a friend who was ahead of me though; by the time I vend all the gear I upgraded farming SM tonight, I'll be worth about 40g total. 
---
Basically all the ore and herbs Ive picked are sitting in a mailbox right now. Some of my addons got fucked somehow and i need to reinstall AH stuffs. Lots of iron and similar level herbs to sell. Tomorrow may simply be spent at the AH...
---
The couple times I've pugged since classic came out, I've made it explicitly clear before the first pull that if something can be sold on ah, I'm needing and they should too.
---
Will give 50g to the first person to message me if Asmon doesnt ban him from the guild after he catches wind of this, that's how sure I am the guy will be punished 
---
also I assume GMs will ban him too as it was deceptive behaviour
---
That might have been one of the best wow clips I’ve ever seen in my life. The elements harmonize with you today.  
---
Wtf?! It’s so good.
---
I wonder where he got that mentality from...
---
It may seem minor but I’ve found it much more relaxed after macroing Riposte and sinister strike
---
&gt; Maybe i Just want fast clear times because i want to do other things in the game or RL.
---
&gt; Maybe i dont want this meme spec to roll on my Pvp Gear.
---
&gt; Maybe i wont pay 100g for respec because this other guy doesnt.
---
&gt; Like OP Said its your choice. But you are actually being carried. If the whole raid did the meme way, gl hf in further content
---
Having a few "meme" specs has little to no impact on clearing time. If they deal less than the REQUIRED dps to kill a boss then kick them just as you'd kick any other under-performing person.
---
P.S. The required dps to kill a boss is abysmally low. You'd need to LITERALLY have a melee mage going AFK every 5 seconds to not do enough dps.
---
Who would I pick between in a dungeon scenario if I was making a group? As a tank I would always pick a mage as my dungeon partner before a warlock.
---
You can't equip BoEs?
---
While his shit attitude and response to the community is awful, he's not wrong in that MT's always take loot priority as they are hands down the most important member of the raid.
---
Isn't the market terrible since not enough people grind gold instead of materials though?
---
So relatable man, feelsbad.
---
Shoulda needed.
---
If you need an item you can buy but don't want to pay for it, that too is greed.
---
It's the most pathetic, childish thing you will ever see.
---
Like, he goes as far as practising off-stream for literally a whole day for a certain boss just so his stream wouldn't laugh at him, while being a much higher level you would ever naturally be on a new game of darksouls, while going an INCREDIBLY forcing build with literally 60 Vigor and wearing heavy armour and a meta strength weapon.
---
I'm not a viewer, but one of my friends is mega into darksouls and was really curious to see him play it. 
---
It's no surprise to anyone that has raised endgame content once in WoW that Asmongold is actually a clueless, awful player. But to just see exactly how bad he is at videogames while playing himself up is just insane. I think those streams where he was actually out of his comfort zone actually broke him.
---
I now know why all of his content is him transmog and miubt farming, where the hardest thing about it is remembering the instance locations.
---
there is a huge difference between needing on some recipes vs needing on a rare epic boe. 
---
valuable thing = need on it
---
Enchanting recipes that are rare and/or high level, yes everyone should need. 
---
I've seen enchanters needing on everything to DE. We've all adjusted and needed on everything going forward too, to compensate. Then I've blacklisted them, but it's their prerogative to piss everyone off for 5s or 2g or however much those green costs.
---
You dont get to adjust to someone ninjaing a BoE blue or purple. That's why everyone needs.

Venruki has toxic people in his chat, it's less compared to the bald one but he also has a lot less viewers but regardless of that there are toxic people everywhere, look at swifty, he's a pretty chill dude yet you have a lot of toxic people in his chay making fun of him.
---
This situation was addressed by asmongold before this occurred. Olympus is allied with crusade and power. So ninja looting anyone from those 3 guilds is a gkick. I'd be willing to bet the people in that group are all randoms that Roy ninjaed. That being said it is scummy. But it is allowed scumminess according to the alliance of those 3 guilds.
---
Got me hahaha
---
typically MTs are chosen because they are good at tanking tho
---
Go ahead. Be sure to use "/e" to use custom emotes when interacting with others and only accept quests given in written form, NPC's that know sign language or after using an emote that goes like: "/e gives the %t his/her notebook and urges them to write it down."
---
And I imagine the cover of your notebook says something along the lines of "Deaf and mute, please write down your request".
---
Then you would even have a literal quest log. You could even keep 1 slot in your inventory reserved for it, one for ink and one for a quill.
---
It would be awesome.
---
What would this accomplish?
---
I play video game all the time and have had my cat for around 6 years. 6 years of not caring no matter what game I play, but now that I'm playing WoW he just suddenly can't get enough.

Ah, well its immposible due to GCD.
---
I like titles, gives you more ways to customize your character.
---
Imagine ruining your community reputation for 200g.
---
I 'll say what has been said a billion times in this subreddit: Play what you want. Of course Fear ward is a benefit, but night elf stealth is super funny in PvP. Mind controlling someone fully unaware is a blast. The only time you should consider rerolling to dwarf is when you plan to join a hardcore min-maxer guild. Other than that you will be totally fine and be welcomed by everyone else. Also on the upside, you won't be a dwarf wearing a dress.
---
Thing with mage too is that it’s really easily to play in end game because the rotation is just spamming frostbolt

---
Seems pretty stupid to install a addon when there’s a working built in alternative.
---
Yes enchanters should roll on all tradable items just like everyone else.
---
1$ for 2g? Shit naga, sign me up.
---
Most countries outside the West have way worse pays. I could make 30g an hour easily.
---
But no greed roll happened since it was needed
---
Apparantly, from another thread, Blizz will actually act on these cases. So make a case just to be sure.

Says the horde. lol
---
The sad part is a frost mage is actually amazing to have in a 5 man. Just so many of them don't know when to stop... Or start for that matter.
---
Lmfaoo such a poor cut away to try and hide the shame and embarrassment
---
Maybe it's just me but I'd never cut ties with a friend that I've known for a "LONG" time just bc of a boe. Mad for a little bit sure but to go that far? lol
---
cringe
---
It is nice that I have a full paying job work my butt off with a house and with a spouse that lets me game. No kids just two little fur babies. When I can't play for a couple days then get back on it feel so rewarding and relaxing to play a game like this compared to games today.  All I can really say is this game is just nice to have in this era.
---
Brought many of my friends back and brought new ones in. It's nice to chill out and game with individuals that I haven't talked to as much. That's the real reason.
---
Wow. The balls on the guy who didn't even post the auction from a bank alt.
---
&gt;I main a warlock 
---
Make sure you spam life-tap until you are at 10% hp. It's a good way to bond with the priest.
---
Because WoW is a party-based loot grinder and you shouldn't be shitty to the people that are helping you in your group.
---
Guild leader is ninja looter and you are amazed by this?
---
At level 40 you should propably buy/craft Draemweave gloves and vest although they are + all spelldamage

Hey man, Karma got him already. He was undercut pretty hard.
---
Everyone needs 500g
---
Trade it to your friend if you get it. If you have no friends sell it.
---
Did you know that gear could be bought from AH if you wanted to equip it so badly?
---
Haha yea i was coincidentally questing near that guy for a while, helping each other now and then, so we got really familiar
---
I agree with you, I don't watch a lot of streams outside of the tournamenrs and pro players and most of the time I find the streamer humour a little bit too much for my taste (DrDisrespect, Quinn, etc) but that doesn't make those streams toxic, people think that streamers are some sort of role model and twitch chat are a bunch of 7yo kids, and it isn't.
---
I mean, is 500g really worth being ostracized by the community? 500g really isn't even that much when you've been at 60 for a bit.
---
He was serious. He ended up undoing the rule and banning it because “people didn’t understand the rules” or something - the “rules” being some parameters/exceptions he listed. He said it became more trouble than it would’ve been just banning it, so he banned it
---
Still has his moments
---
Excuse for what? That he is ninja-looting? That has nothing to do with this streaming-persona. If you can't see that Asmongold is a made-up character as any scripted movie character, then you are stupid. Now perhaps his real persona is also toxic of some sort, but that doesn't have anything to do with the streamer Asmongold per se.
---
What do YOU mean these people
---
Look at Grubby's chat. If someone says fuck, he gets kicked. Ez as that.
---
Gods I was strong strong then then then ( critical ) then then then ( critical )
---
He didn't even try to sell it with an with an alt. But he allready ninjad anyways so he made his bed
---
Shadowmeld + Mind control, find yourself a good cliff and start throwing off unsuspecting passersby
---
There is so much more story now and these questions. Back when these were released they weren't just common knowledge like they are today. If you played Warcraft 3 then you had an advantage.
---
I actually think you can wear bracers, belt, shoulders and boots and get away with it. The only piece of those 4 that is really outclassed by a non-set item, is the shoulders, however you'll get some stamina in return as well as the +40ap bonus (and you will have the required amount of hit for yellow attacks)
---
I feel like with greens and blues and most importantly items that are BoP then rolling need for upgrades and greed otherwise makes sense. For something like a BoE epic though, even if it is a really huge upgrade for someone, rolling all need makes sense as everyone needs the 400g that this sells for. Obviously it's difficult to make that decision, whether you should deny someone a huge upgrade so that someone else can profit from it, but I also think it might be a better option than letting someone ninja loot it.
---
Herod was chosen by so many because of the name lol. You can go back to the server name announcement threads and the most popular off the bat were Herod and whitemane, which coincidentally are 2 of the biggest now.
---
&gt;In that situation everyone needs and you trade it to the person who actually needs it?
---
This is what would happen if a BoE Epic dropped in a similar situation. If a guildie needs the item, everyone needs so we can try to get them their item, which sounds unfair for the pug, and it is. Unless the pug does what I have yet to see a single pug do, greed the epic (3 BoE Epics so far, every single random has needed irrelevant epics), then we all need.
---
&gt;Seems like if the rule is to need on the epic drop then that one random you have in the group has a chance to get it even if he doesn't need it.
---
Exactly. With BoE Epics, courtesy flies out the window in most groups. The rule is in place to assure that no one ninjas the item, but it still isn't as good as if people were genuine with their roll selections. It's the least-bad option.
---
&gt; It seems like if ninja looting is that common it's best to avoid randoms at all cost then.
---
Ninja looting is not necessarily that common, not at all. The issue is that you never know who the ninja will be. Also, people who are not normally ninjas may make a quick decision to go for 300+ gold from a really lucky drop instead of following social norms. Would you risk the potential for an epic level cloth upgrade to the unusually quiet Warrior lagging behind?
---
That actually happened to my Holy/Discipline Priest I run instances with. I was absent, he found a group, his almost BiS chest piece, [Robes of Insight](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=940/robes-of-insight#comments), dropped off of the first trash pack in Zul'Farrak. Warrior tank needed, as did everyone else, and he lost it.
---
This is why a lot of people have set groups and stick hard to them. Loot goes where it should do the best work, runs are faster and safer, and thus more gear is earned for everyone.
---
Genuinely curious. What does the fact that he's wearing cloth have to do with it?
---
Edit: oh you mean the mage...oops
---
Just be shadow and heal dungeons. Honestly I assume every priest who isn't level 60 is shadow because it makes solo/questing way better
---
"All greed" smart call hahahaha
---
You misunderstood him. HE got blocked from the friends list.
---
Yes because sometimes you wanted to do a dungeon/raid because you know, you wanted to play the damn thing! But then groups wouldn't invite you because you couldn't prove that you can run it blind and super efficiently. Well how is someone who has never done it before supposed to provide this?
---
He anyway got shit for greeding : got blocked and removed from bnet, so what difference would've made if he needed?
---
Actually you probably could. Maybe not quite 2004, but pretty shortly after. Verizon deployed their EVDO network in ~2007 which was enough for some games via 'dial up' tethering (which also only used your (unlimited!) minutes!). I ran WotLK dungeons on the freeway en route to visit a friend that lived 3 hours away, he was mind blown when I showed up within 30 minutes of the last dungeon we did.
---
Might as well ask the other mages here. 
---
Do we have any potions to drop combat or is it just run away with a Swiftness Potion?
---
Sorry you feel that way? There are just a lot of people that don't know about it.
---
Always hold your roll until the last moment with shit like this, and only greed if everyone else has too.
---
If anyone else needs, need it too. If you win, be a good guy and let the others (except the asshole) do a /random roll to try and beat your roll. 
---
That's what I would do, at least. 
---
And don't let people guilt trip you into them needing the item to equip, even if they actually equip it it's not OK with a 600G+ item imo.
---
On BoE that doesn't really apply.
---
That item is +400g networth for those that can't use it. For those that can use it it is either +400g from selling it or it just saves them forking over 400g at the AH themselves. Nothing truly major in the grand scheme of things. 
---
It's not like a BoP which you have to get it as a semi-rare/rare drop from a specific boss or whatever, where those that can't use it only can vendor it for a handful of gold.
---
Got him good bud!
---
edit 3 randomly works now I thinks.. dunno what i did tho
---
Typically anything that is done from within the loot system is fair game.  You set it up that way so what he did is totally okay according to the rules.
---
ITT: people blaming asmongold for something he didn't do
---
LEFT SIDE! EVEN SIDE!
---
Asmongold and his people
---
Yea I watched him level with asmon when classic launched and he seemed really cool. This made me lose all respect for him
---
Your going to want 8-12 to actually prevent stress injury for wow
---
Not even surprised. Dude barely showers and laughs when he takes shit from other players who suck his dick.
---
If it's nothing truly major, then the person who can use it can get it.
---
you thought me nightelf?
---
oh wait
---
 Unfortunate situation being used in tandem with a clickbait title so this sub can hop back on the stream man bad circlejerk. Does not involve Asmon at all.
---
Report him. As long as he stated the all should greed, the GMs will strip the item from him.
---
I'm a nelf priest and I love it! Dwarfs are ugly, nelfs are pretty. Nuf said.
---
Ah, it seems like the frame strata settings get screwy when importing them. There are a few elements that should be displaying over the health orb in the middle.  
---
As for it looking like a pie, this is due to the minimum and maximum progress settings on the health bars. I'm not sure how to set them to a percentage, so they're a flat value right now and not compatible with every health value.  
---
Time to take all of this back to the lab and see if I can make it work the way it's supposed to when imported - sorry to have wasted your time!
---
Incredible dude. I don't even know what to pick out. The T1 or the Oblivion or the LOTR or Scott Pilgrim or the anime junk. It literally had it all.
---
I was questing with a rogue i met in searing gorge. While killing the elite acolytes next to Thorium Point the epic dwarven handcannon dropped. I insta greeded since it’s a rather poor epic anyway and I’m warlock, rogue said he could wear it and that it’s an upgrade for him (+14agi) so I told him to “sure, take it” - well, he didn’t equip it though. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was trying to get a quick buck out of it, as the dire mail +hit bow is better anyway. I didn’t make a big fuss out of it since it’s a pretty bad gun anyway. 
---
My point is that just because someone can equip it doesn’t mean he will. Imagine Frozen Band dropping while you’re playing on a mage, would you take the 250-400g or wear it, just to eventually replace it on lvl 60?
---
Ran ZF today.  We pulled the first three pack and killed them all in order.  The shaman sat to drink after and I moved on to the next pack.  The mage quit......we werent moving fast enough
---
That would be crazy! That epic mount ain't gonna earn itself.
---
You can always plead your case, and I think \*most\* chill people will be all right with it. Not all, but a lot of em. If you're farming a dungeon for a dungeon-specific BOE (a pattern or something especially) I think a lot of people would be cool about it. If I was farming for something like that though I would also post something about it in the party chat before we started and see what people say.
---
He looks stoned
---
Noo Im always glad to help! I hope this gets developed more soon I will be looking for updates I love the look and idea of it. feel free to ask for help in the future
---
Mara is available,  dire maul is what you're looking for.
---
Uh oh chud detected
---
That's the one! Cheers
---
It doesn't fail. He has more than enough evidence.
---
You sound butthurt. I'm curious as to why.
---
Best advice. On etiquette, everything is in top comment.
---
I am interested as well
---
without an addon, I dont think so. I don't know if ignoring the player will make any dif. I Do also highly recommend the aux addon. for many more reasons than this
---
Isnt that also against rules? I may be wrong but I thought macros couldn't have 1 input for 2 actions
---
No one’s stopping you from Greeding all you like.   
---
Just know that there’s plenty others that’ll Need your Greed rolls.
---
You're understanding how many man-children watch twitch, these aren't always necessarily kids, just people who live and breathe for twitch, I've met people in their 30's who say shit like 'pepega' out loud, these are the kinds of people who, with a touch of anonymity, turn in to some raging spastic.
---
By far the best **endgame** class, both when it comes to dps and tanking.
---
Notice how warrior is the single most popular class (or probably second to mage, not sure), despite being a pain in the ass to level? That's all just to top the dps-meters in the end, even though the raid content we have in Classic is piss easy. At least until Naxx.
---
Of course this is not the case for every warrior player, but a large amount.
---
Usually if you communicate at the start then it's all good. Not always, but usually. A lot of people are surprisingly chill about that kind of thing and will be okay with letting you need if that specific item drops. Just tell the group you're there for \[epic BOE to use\] and ask if they'd not roll on it (unless they are also there for that item to use).
---
That being said, I just farmed gold and bought my truefaith vestments recipe because I think it's really the faster and more sure option.
---
is he a douche?  
---
yes  
---
is it against TOS what he did?  
---
no  
---
merit: play with shit, get shit on

Probably cause he is a piece of shit human... If you want people who agree with you /vg/ is still active...

Once an item has that much value its just treated as a sum of gold and not the actual item
---
Trees are actually oxygen neutral for the most part. They give off O2 while they photosynthesize, and they take it in when they don't. They basically take one long breath every day, inhaling daytime, and exhaling nighttime. Trees are decent CO2 storage, but algae produces most of our O2 and stores more CO2 as well.
---
What if you're stupidly spirit rezzing every time? :p
---
Nobody cares about Asmongold guild drama.
---
He was serious.
---
Asmongold made a guide on how to properly ninja. He sees this behaviour as a core element of his gameplay.
---
It wasn't a joke.
---
Would you give me a quick breakdown of what's happening. I've never played wow but was  an OG EQ player and am familiar with ninja looting but have no idea what's happening here.
---
Fuck streamers
---
nah fuck em roll need
---
Goofy as ever = top pvp guild on the server, probz
---
What a witty retort
---
I'm not shocked, Asmongold does attract that mentality.
---
But I am appalled, since the behaviour is unacceptable.
---
I'd just report the ninja since they got those two screenshots.
---
I never knew him but when I saw him for the first time on twitch I just don't know why I hated his so damn much. It must has something to do with his face and the way he talks
---
They won't temp ban for it ,but take away the item, sadly in this case it woll just be deleted ,rip
---
Get a wrist rest for your keyboard.
---
Guess's it's time to start sniping the AH, what the fuck
---
That's shit of him. Even the buyout amount he's put it for is a joke.
---
Asmongold tells his viewers to always need in a situation like this. He also brags about how he would Ninja stuff all the time.
---
What
---
Survival mode! You’d waste so much time.
---
that is why  i hate Asmogold and his colleagues
---
I bet that dude was so angry that he shit his pants.
---
Yes that is true, if the lock is preemptively spamming it then it won't work. I suppose you can just then poly again but at least it will buy more time for the lock.
---
Its the reason the thread was made?
---

I'm lvl 42 and have only used rank 1 and havent had any problems
---
Thanks, friend - Much appreciated!  
---
I may try building a lot of the elements from scratch in Photoshop so there is less layering issues in-game. I'll shoot you a message when I think I have something more functional :)
---
I'm starting to believe there was no "mental breakdown" and he's just  overexaggerating. As is usual with people watching asmon.
---
I love the Scarlet Crusade music that goes off when shit is getting serious and that you don't even hear before.
---
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.
---
Asmongold looks like the voodoo doll that was used to give Ryan Reynolds AIDS
---
This 100%. 
---
Had similar situation and the GM who resolved the issue also pointed out that the person was intentionally deceptive and we had proof.
---
This was years ago though (during wotlk), but I believe these same rules still apply.
---
It would be interesting but incredibly cruel and would be impossible to get anything done. Maybe if it was PVE and not doing dungeons.
---
Eat ass? With pleasure.
---
N-....no thanks.
---
This whole thread is absolutely full of unoriginal harpies regurgitating exact same talking point about him
---
I dont even like asmon, but this shit's really telling how much of a  bizarre, pathetic hivemind this sub is
---
He basically said in his guild rules ,your are allowed to ninjaloot, just don't do it from guildies
---
seriously we powered through the herod queue and now it's basically gone after only a month. everyone who xfered and/or switched either didn't do their homework or were just entirely too impatient.
---
I’d consider trying it but only on a PVE server and I’d be scared to raid and would never leave town without a group
---
Asmongold himself is that type of person so...
---
He‘s at TwitchCon, so most likely not (yet?).
---
But its just a persona /s
---
No it's like if your financial advisor was in his 30s with a villa, the best clothes, a booming business, but no car and no money in the bank.
---
Ahh! An enhancement shaman!

I also crafted dreamweave vest+gloves for the stats with some added sp.
---
I would swap in between mara and brd. 50-55. mara quest gives the trash blade that you should use as a mh until dal'rends. after getting trash combat swords will be king. you can also pick up mirahs song from scholo or strat quest as your off hand (idk which instance has the quest just wowhead it)
---
Diablo II Hardcore in WoW.. jesus you really are a masochist
---
"I'm not a viewer...."
---
Bro, come on, dont lie.
---
You have friends that come over so they can jabber at you for hours on end while you grind murlocs in the wetlands and barely listen to a damn thing they're saying?
---
You're better off spamming shadowbolt as most mobs will die before they'll get hit by your full dot. Toss a corruption and spam away.
---
It's very unlikely a GM would do anything here, but fair warning to you, just cos it's an online game doesn't mean you can do whatever.
---
You CAN actually get a ban/warning for scamming people, which is probably what he's thinking of.
---
For example, if we agree that you'll enchant an item for me, or craft me something, and I give you the mats - and then you fuck off with my mats, you CAN actually get into trouble for that. 
---
I don't feel the guy here saying "all greed" really counts as a scam in that way though.
---
“Reminder of your debt” 🤭...
---
I doubt people are inherently good but manipulators will manipulate
---
Looking for the cast bar, chat font and scrolling damage text
---
I like how this post would have been buried in new if it wasnt about Asmon. You guys are crazy for him yet fail to admit it.
---
Yes that was the general consensus on the other ninja threat.
---
Groovy!
---
People have traditionally gotten annoyed by it because dire maul exists (in phase 2). Personally I still think it's stupid, deadmines got there first, so it gets the abbreviation. Dire Maul was always easy to distinguish because nobody just looks for Dire Maul, it's DM East, DM west, DM north, which misleads basically nobody
---
Well its not, you can use trinkets, on use stuff, if they dont have gcd you can use it. Something like 
---
/use "some trinket"
---
/cast "some instant spell" 
---
People do that all time for so long, even more things put on 1 input, the main reason is gcd so you cant do all in 1.
---
I'm more surprised that anyone that joined a raid Asmon was MTing was surprised enough by that to complain. The guy is a selfish butthole, that's his persona that he sells to these people, and they think he'll share loot with anyone else before he gets his?
---
Then give it to the person AFTER the roll? It’s BoE. If there is one ninja and one person needing it, everyone needing gives an 80% chance the person gets it, while the honest people greeding gives a 50% chance.
---
And half the time is I think 38
---
I need opinions here. Not fanboy opinions, just true, factual opinions between both classes. I understand they're both casters, and both bring different things to the table, but, I find both of them to be interesting and fun, and I can't decide between the two. On one hand, I want to play a mage for the ability to conjure, make portals, etc. On the other hand, I want to play a lock because I really enjoy pet classes (I main a hunter. I also off-main a warrior) and I feel like warlocks are just spell casting hunters (minus the ability to tame pets/rename them). I know there are tons of mages in the game currently, as they're the FOTM or "meme class" currently (feelsgoodman that hunters don't lead the way on that anymore. Thanks meme mages), so that pushes me towards a lock. I've also never leveled a lock passed level 30. I've leveled a mage (in retail) to 110, and I've leveled a mage in Classic to 23. My lock is currently level 7, and I'm becoming incredibly indecisive on which class to proceed with in off time.
---
Dang that proc sounds beastly. 
---
Thanks for the explanation mate, really appreciate it. It's not much but have my upvote.
---
He didn’t say “hey I need that” he stated that all (that would include himself) had to greed roll, then intentionally broke his own rule. He committed an act of deception. That’s the issue.
---
Do you guys have dashcams for world of Warcraft ?
---
As it should be.  We less people like him in WoW and in life in general.
---
well fuck the guy. he still deserves a ban for scamming
---
There are plenty of twitch chats that aren't like the ones for people painting, or the piano dude. Just because you only watch toxic gaming chats doesn't mean all the chats on twitch are toxic.
---
Yea, I know that it isn’t recent foreshadowing! Didn’t know it was so objectively explained as their homeland tho.
---
Do you know how inflation works? It will sell for 1k gold later because  each piece of gold will be worth less.
---
I guess I just hoped this would be a place to share fun and interesting experiences while playing this game together. Imagine being so bitter and hateful that when someone excitedly shows you what they found, hoping you'll share in their interest, you mock them and shut them down.
---
I know I sound sensitive. I'm not usually, I just really hoped for better. I thought it was kind of eerie and thought people here would enjoy it. Legitimately.
---
Leveling as holy is easy, especially if you can reach plaguelands.
---
Slower than Shadow ofc but definitely faster than prot war (even other specs if you have underleveled weapons) or paladin. Holy fire SW:P into smite spam then wand.
---
But if you don't like healing, just go as SP everywhere every server needs some dedicated ones, but yes It's a niche spec. Wait for P2, SP being the best 1v1 PvP class, We'll see a lot more.
---
k,thx
---
Lvl 36 is when I swapped, as soon as you can get flurry your set
---
Go lock. New experience, pet class, and you alreagy see mages everywhere
---
I'd expect nothing less from someone who thinks anything goes regardless of rules fairness or anything else.
---
His excuse would be "none of these fucking idiots should have fallen for that shit, its their own fault for being so dumb"
---
Which is pretty much textbook psychopathy.

---
I'm sure he might be a completely wonderful person in real life. Unfortunately, he's known publicly for his video game exploits. I mean, we're calling him Asmongold - his online handle - and not Zack. Given that, it seems pretty reasonable to judge him by the actions he takes in those games. I mean, in real life he does take care of his sickly mother at personal cost to himself so it's not like he's a total monster, but all you have to do is watch a few of clips of his less admirable moments to see just how much of an asshole he can be to random strangers who haven't really done anything wrong.
---
Now that's a screenshot
---
Not at all true. The trick is to build a tight group from the people that joined those 200 member + guilds for leveling and merge with other smaller tight nit guilds
---
From an entertainment standpoint, this guild system is genius. From an ethical standpoint, it's just sad. Basically like Big Brother.
---
Still hate hunters with a passion.. Horde/Ally. Makes no difference
---
Lets see if he kicks this one.
---
 First of all this is nothing short of exortion. You're only getting ONE side of the story and even then it's just a snippet. I can confirm. I was there and have the chatlogs to prove it. You're basically like the women who cry rape when they were the ones who got drunk and made a bad decision. SMH.
---
He was absolutely undeserving of it and I have the logs and meters to prove . When you join as a PUG, you work under the assumption that you are helping the guild progress. Guilds &gt; Pugs. Everyone knows that. If you have an issue join PUG raids. You are benefitting from our expertise and organizational skills. Not the other way around. Don't make me post the meters.
---
Also, lol @ the idiots who are giving us grief for finding pugs to fill the slot. We didn't need them, they needed us. Unlike APES or any of the idiotic poopsocking no life guilds who spend all day glued to their chair we have lives and girlfriends and jobs. We are a semi hard-core raiding guild. In time we will have enough members where we don't need to pick up scrubs but we were happy to give this guy am audition. Guess what. He failed.
---
You want purples? Impressive us. Do 👏your👏 job👏. If you act like dead weight we will reward you accordingly. If you do your job you can roll. If you really impress us you might even get recruited. In this case the opposite happened. This guy was a scrub, and the officers decided we couldn't reward mediocrity. Of course being the girl he is, he decided to QQ to reddit instead of manning up and taking responsibility.
---
Also, the idea that a bunch of nerds on Reddit will get us blacklisted is completely laughable. Most of you don't even play on our server. Most of people on our server aren't on Reddit.
---
Your SJW attitude is hilarious at best and pathetic at its worst.
---
Thanks for the laughs- we are having a ball laughing at all you on Discord over all you Reddit nerds. Yeah ok have fun blacklisting us, idiots we're soooooo scared. My fave is the moron going on about some scrub rogue who dueled people. Really? You think that's gon scare us? You for real? 😂 😂 😂
---
In short, this wasn't ninja, it was karma. Dont you reddit nerds know about that? QQ all you want but we're here to stay. Im sure Reddit being what it is you will downvote and hide my post but as an officer I felt obligated to give my 2 cents.
---
Current day situation like this is a tad diffrent then back in the day.
---
A) servers are way larger back when a server had maybe 500-1000 people on your faction getting a bad name ment more. With the much larger player base per server unless you keep doing stuff like this for a long time to lots of people it will be missed by a large portion of the server.
---
B) its a streamer server with a high ranking person in the main streamers guild meaning they can do this stuff and unless the streamer themselves adresses it the following will continue since they have such a massive pool of people to help them with whatever they need being hated by a portion of the server will do little to them.
---
Not defending him but you should pay an attention to what he says. "All greed" could either mean "we all greed", or "you all greed". You all greed so he can need. I hope Blizz still will act on it and ban him for scamming.
---
Those streamers can't be considered "large streamers" and since we're talking about big streamers they are irrelevant to the subject
---
Fake news. Dumb AF video.
---
You’re an idiot for posting this.

I’ve seen plenty of Druid healers turned away while leveling because we had no other Rez in the party. Though I personally couldn’t care less
---
And this friends puts to bed the debate over what you do in these scenarios. It's always ALL NEED. Then you never worry about this.
---
I watched asmond for about 10mins when the servers first went live because I was at work and I figure the biggest streamer must be in game. I'm that short period one of his so called mates was having a cry that he got in late and the forced him to play a class he didnt want to play. Like he was legit upset. I'm not surprised his friends are like this.
---
I'm also new and I've had a group get mad at me for needing on an item that was a significant upgrade from my other one just because that item was "not a rogue item". I feel like if it's an upgrade you need, that simple, but apparently if you and another class both need it it's suddenly more important that it go to the person playing the "class the item is for". 
---
It was a cloth headpiece with +20ish? Def +agl and +str and NO healing bonuses. The priest needed on it (it was like a 5 armor upgrade and priests don't use agl or str so idk why everyone cared?) and I needed on it to replace my other cloth headpiece that had +2 armor and no other stats. Well I just walked out of the dungeon after they started making a fuss and took my friend (the tank) with me, we still saw them looking for a tank after another full run and had a mage at the minimum level for the dungeon.
---
Actuelly it's against the EULA to scam. The screenshots could be considered evidence of scam.
---
Edit: this was actuelly a thing in vanilla. Ppl scamming got temp banned.
---
Experienced the same, i actually unbound my keys from time to time and restructured them to a more comfy position.
---
Speak for your faction.
---
Apart from dwarves, the Alliance takes great pride in their postal service, and the laws governing it. Especially the elves. Never open a letter belonging to an elf!
---
Humbug.   
---
Seen plenty of that douche behavior during Vanilla onwards.
---
Friends don't let friends photograph their monitor.

All ninjas look the same to me

---
What he did was wrong, but its boe world fucking drop = ALWAYS NEED! Every group Ive been in NEEDS on boe just so no one can ninja.
---
Instead of saying “ok let’s all greed”when they drop go for “let’s all need so no one can ninja”.
---
I’m pleasantly surprised.
---
Never heard of that, but if u shift click someones name u get some basic info
---
ahh ok thanks. so i should wait til im 50 for mara? what duengons should i do before that? im 45 rn. can i do zf?
---
Yes, let bullies get away with it, just so you have more bullying in schools and at the work place. People looking the other way, so bullies get their way are complicit.
---
Yeah like when Day9 tried to play dota with purge? No toxicity at all, the rest can't be considered "big streamers"
---
How much do you guys tip, or expect to be tipped for lockpicking? Got a few boxes and I'm shy to ask without knowing the etiquette.
---
So.. this is officially a atreamer channel then.
---
Mods can't we ban this shit already.
---
If i'm in a group with friends and a boe epic drops they can and will use, they can have. I don't need the AH or gold, especially if it's their first epic and it'll be fun.
---
https://prnt.sc/pcduz5 I think you had missing textures for Intellect and armors because I tried buffing them and the panda appeared! progress?
---
as soon as the paperwork goes through, my village can apply to get electricity \o/
---
I sen stormwind cheesecake to Subversa. He returned it so I sent it again and reminded him that cheesecake was sensational. Returned again. I finally sweetened the deal with 2 copper and guess what. He returned it along with a message stating he would contact a GM if this behavior continued.
---
Dire maul* mara is in phase 1
---
*child* move
---
FTFY
---
I like to do the whole thing at least once. Especially as many people have literally never done it on classic let alone retail.
---
What you're basically saying is that intention does not matter, only action, and that's a really deep rabbit hole that I don't think you want to go down. Streamers are generally toxic to make money, aka out of greed, and I think that is not as bad as someone who is toxic out of malice.
---
If you had to add either a hitman or a serial killer to society, which would you add?
---
Not everyone is trying to take the absolute quickest route to 60. A lot of the fun in classic is leveling and some people want to enjoy it.
---
I'm only level 20 and already want to pill with the no mount life wasting more time running between cities than actually leveling. You bet your ass I'll be doing what I can to get that mount asap
---
To avoid that sitaution yes
---
But won’t stand by that I think if a BoE drops and someone actually wants it that is in the group, that person should need on it to get it, as long as he equips it directly.
---
Can confirm.
---
Source: Rolled a PvP server temporarily to help my brother who GENUINELY wants to play on a PvP server but quit before hitting level 20 cause I could see the griefing coming a mile away. What's worse? We/he rolled alliance, on a HORDE dominated server.
---
A portion of the wow community has decided the gold for BoE epics on the AH so they can buy their whatever is &gt; the person who will use it equipping it.
---
Warriors aren't spec Prot until 60 for example. As a tank I don't mind healers in dps specc, they only need healing gear
---
That is why everyone is supposed to need on epic BoEs. It should go without saying lol
---
I rolled on an RP-pvp server to avoid streamers and try hards. In vanilla and legion I played on a pvp server. The only difference I’ve noticed is people are more pleasant. I’ve only once come across RPers. A bunch of (high lvl) alliance RPing they were the defenders of stormgarde keep. Making it impossible for horde to quest there.
---
The only redeeming quality of warrior solo leveling. I feared everyone except demonists. Sure some fights can be close, but it's often just me sticking to their hitbox eating them alive.  
---
I'm getting dicked on by a lot of others though, so not gonna pretend solo warriors are demi gods lol
---
No surprise coming from the heel of the streaming world.
---
Because it's worth much more to the player than the scraps you get from vendor on a BoP. It's not the same logic. Now you know why your position is wrong.
---
Happy b day
---
I use addons for it.  It can do many things, but it cannot ignore this problem player.  I generally try to buy out large quantities of these items to resell, it goes well, but these troll bids are requiring me to take more time to manually filter past in lieu of just queueing everything.
---
There's a huge huge difference though because in Overwatch you're put with random people. It's a random queue, so you're expected to stay for the game and punished if you're not. This is why retail WoW punishes you if you leave a randomly found group.
---
Leaving a dungeon in WoW is more like leaving a Pick up game of basketball at your park. If the people there are being dicks to you, or aren't fun to play with, there's literally no reason why you can't leave the park and go find a different group. You have no obligation to stay, and if they don't like you leaving halfway through a game, they won't play with you. 
---
This is the social interaction that made WoW so special.
---
asmongold is a scumlord shitbag so of course someone close to him would be a shitlord. hope the worst for everyone his influence reaches. and of course himself. he is a waste of oxygen
---
Warlock mount isn't available until phase 2 unfortunately.
---
happy cakeday
---
Right when the tank goes in ranged DPS can start going as hard as they want. Only melee has to wait for threat.
---
Nope never heard of zak. I mean asmonbald. Or whatever his Name is. In fact I have never heard of World of Warcraft either. Especially after joining this subreddit. /s
---
Nah but for real, im with you. If you follow anything wow related outside of the actual game or googleing quests, you know asmongold. And if youre super new or whatever, people/youtube will make sure you know about him in seconds. Yall go the movies, join social media about movies and then claim to not know who will smith is too? C'mon..
---
If I recall correctly, lore master was an achievement that required you do all quests in Azeroth. I don't know how Cata affected that achievement.
---
Ok here how it is one may make him money the other wont so he chose to make money
---
Mages I'm fine with. Warlocks that spam Hellfire and expect to get healed through 7 mobs beating them and the constant damage they inflict on themselves? F them.
---
We kill one pack a bit faster but does it really help in the long run if I have to drink 5k mana between every pull?
---
Yeah, it really is shockingly clear that no matter how authentic they try to make the classic experience, the people have changed, and the toxicity appears more rampant than how classic supposedly was.
---
Part of me wants to say it’s partially the fault of the streamers for making people think this is okay and allowing these attitudes to fester in their chat, but chances are these shitty people were gonna do shitty things anyways. 
---
Either way, it’s upsetting to see.
---
You deserved it imagine doing runs with olympus
---
You ain’t gonna like this article because it highlights how ironic your first question is:
---
http://www.vice.com/amp/en_uk/article/8gkjep/the-long-love-affair-between-furries-and-disney
---
This whole "being shitty to the people" is entirely in the head of the player who thinks they're entitled to some ultra high value BoE drop because it happens to be good for their class/spec, even though the \*entire group\* could benefit from the item as much as said "entitled" player by simply selling it.
---
This is the sort of thing that, if universalized as an attitude and a standard of behavior, benefits EVERY NON-NINJA in the long run.  Literally the ONLY people who benefit from the rhetoric you're espousing, in the long run, are people who ninja loot.  More people adopting "need if you will use, greed if you're selling" attitudes just leads to ninja'ing being more profitable.
---
This is the material reality.  Does it suck that it has to be this way?  Yeah, I think so.  Nonetheless, just rejecting reality and advocating that assholes shouldn't be assholes isn't a solution to the problem.
---
First, you never all greed when someone says that... Second, you rolled on the streamer sever man, you chose these assholes.
---
The problem with NE Priest is not that you're missing Fear Ward, it's that you're broadcasting that you are comfortable putting every person who plays with you at a disadvantage for your own preference. Of course, this can apply to all classes, but none near to the extent that it applies to the Priest.
---
FWIW, I played Night Elf Priest back in the day and I think you should play what you want, but a decision being informed is important. As a NE, you'll still find groups (even though I've already seen recruitment messages specifically requiring Priests to be a Dwarf), but you need to be aware of the message your choice sends potential group members.
---
I don't remember there being this big exaggerated mental breakdown that happened on stream as is being implied.
---
But, trying to do variety did lead to Asmon taking a break from streaming due to mental anguish and is on record as saying that it's the worst point in his streaming career. So, there is that.
---
I am curious: what made you join Olympus in the first place? What you are describing is the exact thing I would expect from this guild.
---
"racist" lmao
---
10-20s each
---
Nobody in the military would call themselves that unless they were stupid or ready to get roasted to hell
---
So you telling me u gonna do stockades or rfc?
---
Why not? If people need it, they should need it to wear it
---
yo, just ask at the beginning of the run about loot rules
---
Horde side, there's 2 NPCs on the border between the Barrens and stonetalon, both of whom offer a total of AT LEAST 3-4 quests (possibly more, but I haven't continued with them). You really have to go a ways out to get to them, whether you're meeting them coming from the Barrens, or running back to them from Sun Rock Retreat. I probably *could* do the last quest or two they have remaining at my current level, but I ain't going that far out to meet them again.
---
Yes, I get it. We all do. We have seen it before. The ones bitching at you know you didn't know any better. That's why they feel free to attack you. Because not knowing marks you as an outsider. 
---
Like I said, just forget it. Everyone else will. Until the next time...
---
Remember, there are almost 400K subs here. Just a few were jerks to you. This **is** a good place to share and find cool stuff about Classic Wow. So stick around. It's a good time. Have you heard of [The Legend of Chesnutz](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1ebal/little_to_my_knowledge_the_maddest_of_lads_was/)?
---
His influence has nothing to with this. It's not like asmon's behaviour is creating scumbags. Scumbags are created by opportunity and lack of good sense. But in the end is your choice to make.
---
MANY WHELPS! HANDLE THEM!!!!!!
---
I don't know about Fury sorry mate.
---
Leveled as Arms and switched to prot. I wouldn't be so sure on Fury WW single target cause you're most likely using dual wield so you won't benefit from an instant peak 2H damage like WW Arms does.
---
Join the Warrior discord or read something about rotation would be my best advice sadly.
---
Have everyone in the group submit a ticket.
---
It gets much better at later levels, but that's the truth for levels 1-45. Learn to finish mobs off with wand to conserve Mana.  Your wand is probably your most important gear slot for a bit.
---
As a rogue, I suggest 12g per box...also, come to me for these services.
---
In all honesty, probably 1g for anything requiring &gt;200 skill, 75s for 100-200, 50s for &lt;100.  Seems fair enough, figuring the top end to be in line with mage portals.
---
Remove all gear with durability. Die, run back to purple entrance.
---
Moonmoon has a lot less viewers than Baldmongold, making it easily to perform this kind of management, but even then Moonmoon still has his fair share of toxicity, if he ever gets to have 30k+ more people watching his stream on a normal basis then you'll see how quickly the nice chat is ruined, popular things evolve that way, it's just how it is.
---
Blizz bann this fucker
---
Okay I have a 100% serious question. Just something I wonder abou5 considering how weird it looks to everyone else and how much of a meme it is, yet the RP servers seem to have a decent amount of people actually attempting to RP or ERP in certain popular areas.
---
How exactly does one get into RP? Do you just wake up one day and decide youd like to tell stories over text? Or does this come from like D&amp;D? (Ive never playes D&amp;D or know anyone who has so this might be what Im missing)
---
Doesnt it get old having to tell people your story over and over, and doesnt it get old listening to the ridiculousness of some of theirs? 
---
Lastly, From what Ive seen reading RPer description stats, it would seem that many more RPers are open to ERP than they would like people to think overall. How do you tell the difference between a standard RPer who also enjoys cyber sex, versus ERPers who only use RP to try and talk characters they determine to be female into ERP? (Or trick males into it but you get what I mean) And Im not talking about the people who just run around asking everyone to ERP with them Im talking about the ones that start out as if theyre just your normal RPer (if normal is a term that can be used for such an activity) but have intentions solely of ERP.
---
Or are ERPers just accepted into your underground society the way thirsty dudes at a bar are accepted there?
---
What is a fanboy opinion? Usually a fanboy is related to a person, not a thing. Anyway...
---
It depends.
---
PvP Server: Warlock is most certainly not a spell casting hunter. Warlock plays very differently from Mage and Hunter. Mostly because of fear and seduce.
---
PvE: Mage, Warlock, the differences are not what you'd think. They both have a 1 button rotation at end game, but the leveling process is different. Mages need to stop and slowly eat after every fight pretty much, Warlocks can keep going.... forever, if you efficiently use life tap. I dare say that a warlock brings much more to a group than a mage. Healthstones, Soulstones, Summoning other players, Seduction CC, Fear CC (though this can get your group wiped, it can also save you if used properly) and a huge HP boost for your tank and a DS to boot. A mage spams frost bolt (or arcane explosion....) and refuses to summon water, and sheeps. That's pretty much it. The portal thing isn't so great, as everyone is doing it. Each city only needs like.... 1 mage to make portals for everyone, and there will be like 5 mages offering them. Same thing goes for raids, there will always be 5+ mages, so its not like you'll get recognition.
---
If you want my opinion.... make a Tauren Druid. I never played a Druid in classic because I heard everyone talk shit about them. Holy crap was that unwarranted. I've got a 31 Pally, 35 Hunter and a 28 Warlock and right now my Druid is the real soloing beast. I HoT up, moonfire 3 mobs, bear form and watch them all melt. I've not died yet, I even survived the roaming lv25 roaming Son of Arugal that aggroed me when I was level 15.
---
Can any rogue help tell me the best combat build to use while leveling+duengons?
---
Still leveling a month after launch but want to be the top pvp guild... Keep dreaming lmao
---
Pretty sure I read somewhere that griefing a hunter doing that quest is completely fine. I could be wrong.
---
supercool42_ Pog

they are 100g since they are pre-raid bis
---
If you ever get frustrated over healing a lock in dungeons you can do multiple things
---
1. Think of it as a way of converting your healing mana into damage ultimately resulting in a faster, more efficient run for the whole group! 
---
2. Inspect his gear to check if he has enough +spellpower to actually warrant lifetapping all the time. 
---
3. Don’t PW:S him when he’s lifetapping (and not taking aggro). I noticed so many priests wasting their mana like this. Having no awareness. 
---
4. The purpose of a healer is not specificly to only keep the tank alive, but to minimize downtime for the whole group, to make the dungeon run faster in total. Your drinking+healing is like eating for the whole group. A healer is good so we don’t all have to eat and drink for 30s after each pull. 
---
5. Aside from Hellfire, a skilled warlock will most likely life tap and therefore lose hp towards the end of a fight, so you can heal him without worrying about much extra threat during the early fight. I recommend healing him towards the end/throwing him a hot and then drinking. Blessing of Light helps if you’re a paladin. 
---
6. If you have a mage in your group, make sure he provides food and drink to the warlock, that will effectively double his mana regeneration and take pressure off the healer. Bandages also go a long way if you play a warlock. 
---
I’ve had a pally heal in Scholo once, he’d rebuff me with BoW, entirely convinced that he would have to heal me less with those measly 15mp5, even when I asked for BoL/Salv. Having played on private servers for the past couple of years, it amazes me to see just how clueless some retail players are about classic.
---
Hate ninja looters. Nothing compared to this, but was running SM arm and cath on my druid a few days ago and this gnome mage on Blaumeax named Hobbnocker was bitching during the cath run that the "group can't even handle a big pull" because we half wiped on an accidental 8 mob pull. I died as heals cuz I aggroed and our rogue died, but managed to win the battle. The run was going at a decent pace for a non-aoe group too imo. Anyways, I had a feeling he was gunna be a little bitch at the end even tho one of my guildies payed him gold to conjure her some water. Kill the bosses, loot drops but takes forever to finish roll. All of us run to exit, he needs both items, talks shit and insta leaves group. Luckily I won the necklace which was all I wanted, but what a complete asshat. Again, HATE ninja looters.
---
All I'm trying to say is it shouldn't be that surprising that an officer in Asmongold's guild would so something like this. No one knows this person, but they are in a guild with a GM who has spoken highly of ninja looting and for some reason they all agree to greed and then get surprised when he ninjas and they post it on Reddit. If you're upset enough to share it online then maybe the best choice was to just all need. Most people won't be assholes so it's fine to be nice and let them need for a piece but there were plenty of signs this guy probably shouldn't be trusted.
---
Dude it's a months old thread and if you check it I provided a tanking build a some explainations
---
no, he actively states that ninja looting for the benefit of the guild is ok. he's a shit head.
---
Until you hit that one dead zone and dc during an escort quest that you finally got a group for.
---
Oh definitely, he's entertaining in the way the 3 stooges are, or the way Anthem/Fallout 76 are.  It's fun to laugh at how bad/cringy they are.
---
You act like aggro management isnt a core skill of a good dps player. The fastest groups i have in 60 dungeons are the ones where the dps have this core skill. Healer is not oom every pull, tank isnt frustrated/oom If a pally and dps can actually dps. The retail logic of "should hold aggro through everything" doesnt apply in Classic. Holding aggro is no problem at all, its all about that initial puffer that you either get with good dps or Not with bad ones.
---
Royson deserves to be banned. Enjoy leveling to 60 again idiot
---
theres a tauren on herod  I dont remember if hes  a shaman or a warrior  but his name is untippable.
---
Well then I am the fool.
---
Why is anyone watching that jerk at all??
---
Dots.
---
I would go a step beyond that. Who is he to declare what someone else rolls? The fact he said "All greed" is irrelevant, the way rolls work are if you intend to sell, you greed. If you intend to use, need.
---
He needed for an item he intended to sell, its as simple as that for me as to why he's a scummy ninja.
---
Sorry then. I shouldn't reply when being tired I guess.
---
Chicken shit
---
I actually don't want Blizzard to act on scams. I prefer players regulating players. Like in EvE Online, great scams are done, it's part of the game, knowing who you're playing with is part of the challenge.
---
&gt;also I assume GMs will ban him too as it was deceptive behaviour
---
If reported.
---
Your toon will still be there.
---
Also, you may want to phrase this a little differently than "Im hoping someone on reddit will just give me a free PC so I dont have to buy a new one"
---
I guess this take could probably run on some shitty hardware though. Laptops that bad probably arent worth the effort of selling.
---
Which begs the question, why dont you just buy another shit laptop? 
---
My friend runs the game on an apple laptop in high settings. If a mac can do that Im sure a toaster could run it in classic graphics
---
He also says a lot of things that are not true or contradicting. It's kinda his thing. I watched him occasionally since Classic started and talking BS is his main trick.
---
Not saying that he didn't need a break for whatever reason, but his act looks like schoolbook example of "mental anguish".
---
This whole *let's report and ban* schtick is getting old.
---
I remember when 15 yrs ago we all acted like men and dealt with shit.  Now everyone wants to tattle tell and post shit on social media.
---
Also worth noting most quests can’t be completed while in a raid group
---
Went through anyway because I had to get to Burning Steppes. There were hundreds of skeletons lol. Just a path of them leading to BRS.
---
The fake ghost wolf is perfect
---
Roy is Hoboo confirmed
---
Im a pala tank and i always feel people kinda being standoffish on it. I mean just supply  me with water and im fine. I have completed about 80-90% of my runs as a tank.  Just Warlocks and Shadow Priests are fun to deal with threat
---
Which is exactly why everyone should NEED on valuable BoEs. It prevents bullshit drama like this.
---
No, you're not more entitled to an epic worth 400g just because you'll equip it. The other party members need that 400g just as much as you need the item. If you want it, then fucking buy one.
---
Right, much easier to tell everyone to roll need instead, that way no one can scam anyone else.
---
Its different this time around with buggy fd/traps and leeway. Warriors can charge from miles away.
---
This makes me happy
---
“expertise and organizational skills” running a pug...
---
“In time we will have enough members where we don't need to pick up scrubs“ ... you have thousands of members and have a hard time putting a guild run together?
---
I had something like this happen to me. Was in East plaguelands questing, shaman walks up invites me we are killing mobs for about 10 min when axe of the deep woods drops, we both paused a moment I mention how I could really use it as a fury war. He rolls need so do I he wins and turns and runs off I make my case on how I coukd use it and would equip it right in front of him he replies with "sorry I only speak taco." Drops group runs off I seen it in AH later that night for 350g
---
Olympus has a really bad name and a lot of people have left. Really the only people in there are NEETs and kids. People not mature enough to function in a society or kids who think others misfortunes are funny. He eggs them on too which is probably another reason for them staying. They get validation.
---
But if I leave this guild I hate that fosters an atmosphere I can't stand, then the streamer creating that atmosphere won't say my name on stream :(
---
All means everyone if nothing else is specified.
---
Basically the main guy in the video is playing Enchance shaman - they are pretty useless except occasionally the stars align and one of their skills activates for a ton of damage. Even though the mage was winning the fight, the shaman got a lucky proc on Windfury and a crit, so it almost one shot the mage.
---
Even though its kinda dumb, in a 1vs1 like that, the mage really never needs to be in melee range.
---
Just part of the fun of Classic.
---
Overall, spell power. Spell power will apply to whatever spec you decide to use and, as far as I know, spell power is more common and in larger numbers than just shadow damage on items, enchantments, etc.
---
I think it depends on the city you are in. At least for me it does. I always crash in UC but never in TB or Org.
---
probably not but saying no normal human who did nothing wrong would post on reddit, is stupid.
---
That's why the actual rule is "all need". Since there's always the chance that you can't trust that one guy that might be in your group.
---
Multi-shot will do some weird shit sometimes though.
---
Tell that to Sylvannas.
---
&gt; If your poor and $800 drops in a video game I woudnt even consider it immoral 6o ninja 
---
Theft / fraud is theft / fraud regardless of where it happens or how much is obtained. That's the beauty of principles, they always apply. But it's why almost no one is consistent, it takes extreme moral fortitude to be ethically consistent.
---
You're argueing against a single word. Your trolling skills are 0/10.
---
Just saying. There has been a ton of fun events lead by the streamers. Them getting gold free from their followers dont affect my gameplay at all.
---
not the boe, the behavior
---
okay i got really lazy and just screen shot the ones i use, you can ignore the two that arn't turned on, i just havn't deleted the files for them yet
---
My Addons: [https://i.imgur.com/w4ymjqU.png](https://i.imgur.com/w4ymjqU.png)
---
You can inspect talents of other people if both of you got details! addon.
---
The boss in sm armory drops a 2h axe with a fun whirlwind effect
---
Yeah, but you can't do that AoE because tanks can't hold AoE threat for shit, and mobs having melee leeway makes kiting them while still doing damage almost impossible.
---
The only way Mages can really AoE in dungeons is if there are multiple mages, to chain Nova.
---
So, you're stuck using your shitty Frostbolt and occasionally Cone of Colding before instantly using Frost Nova because you pulled aggro, even though you gave the tank 10 second to build threat on the other 2 targets...
---
You're assuming that anything would be willing to breed with Asmongold.
---
I've always maimed a Hunter. Welcome to the club.
---
I'm in Olympus II and he linked these in gchat when he got them.

[https://i.imgur.com/w4ymjqU.png](https://i.imgur.com/w4ymjqU.png)
---
this is a screen shot of the addons i use
---
There is a ton of both. On the two servers Ive been on, locks were vastly overpopulating. Many mages too.
---
However when the Jokerd stuff happened and AoE SM groups became the new thing, suddenly mages started popping up everywhere. Now there are way more of them then there are locks.
---
Also there will contimue to be, as they are so easy to level and farm with that itll be the number 1 alt by far
---
You really going to pretend this is a 2019 problem? Ninja looting videos are probably some of the first memes that ever came out of this game. 
---
I mean, shit, [anyone remember this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ0DbPCqboM) 
---
Welcome to 2005, more like.

I'll get off your lawn now.
---
If you are running a dungeon for a certain boe then ask if you can have it if it drops before you begin. A lot of people will probably let you have it if you ask when you join.
---
Energy ticks every few seconds, unless your energy is capped, there's no need to spam anything. It's actually bad practice to  completely use your energy because you'll miss interrupts and kicks.
---
use succubus. use different rotations. i am also sm/ruin but i gave 2 points for succubus damage and health drain/fel concentration maxed which means i can also drain tank efficiently.

1. spam shadowbolt, thats all lol. this kills shit faster. shadowburn also when you can
---
2. once you are oom, life tap to no health, send succubus first and let her dps a bit before attacking, curse of shadows + siphon life and health drain. 1 mob at your level fills your hp. then you spam that whole hp you just gained again for even more mana.
---
3. do step 2 2 more times till you get to %80ish hp-mana back again.
---
4. start spamming shadowbolt again. rinse and repeat
---
This rotation lets you kill stuff almost without stopping, but as you see at second step you stay with like %10 hp to fill your mana, so it is kinda dangerous in contested areas. If you dont wanna deal with it, this is other best way, you end up killing as fast as first tactic:
---
1. spam shadowbolt, and shadowburn at the end.
---
2. once you are oom life tap a little bit, not your whole hp bar.
---
3. kill 1 or 2 additional mob with your halfish hp-mana
---
4. eat enriched manna bread, it is incredibly fast and around 10 secs you regain full hp mana. you need to be friend with argent dawn which is easy to obtain.
---
Even though you stop for eating, that enriched manna bread is OP AF so it takes very short time to actually start killing again. Only down side is it is a bit expensive. 60s for 5 breads.
---
Depends. If they popped amplify curse then it’s very possible.
---
Spell batching was there originally to accomodate for trash internet. I played vanilla and the spells didnt feel like this in any way shape or form. Now its an artificial shitty lag that ruins PVP for anyone who isnt a total noob.
---
On one hand its cool because they are all fire creatures and should be immune, on other it sucks that the moment you start going into blackrock instancees fire becomes useless and respeccing is very expensive.
---
player auctions has people seeling between 1.1-2g depending on server

In terms of loot whoring, that would be warriors.

The community is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH less toxic than that of a PVP server, mainly because Blizzard enforces rules a lot more on RP servers because they have special rules compared to other realms, but there's a trade-off...
---
RP servers have amazing communities and events and they're a ton of fun, but the actual players are way more focused on the social aspect than anything else, don't expect to be speed clearing dungeons and playing with the best, so you gotta ask yourself
---
Do you want to play with good but toxic players?
---
Or
---
Do you want to play with decent but friendly players?
---
Also here's the rule set for RP realms
---

If you pick to play on Bloodsail let me know, send me (Panhu on Alliance) an in game whisper or mail and I'll be glad to hook you up with stuff to help you get started!
---
When you find that 1 video you've been looking for ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Gold now is worth more, if you don’t have your epic mount. It increases your GPH for many gold farms and will save you more time/gold the sooner you have it.
---
Stop playing the game for a bit. Its a classic server and not retail, no need to treat it like a rat race.
---
I swear mages are so fucking dumb on my server it is embarassing.
---
Yesterday I did UBRS, I am a tank btw and the first thing after pulling a group of mobs is the mage casting a cone of cold into everything ofc getting aggro of everything before I could give a mob a sunder. He was the only one that died multiple times in that run and even after advising him she should wait at least a few seconds and then casting singletarget frostbolt he said but CoC does more dmg and he continued dying...I have plenties of examples like this, it is crazy how dumb the majority of mages are. 
---
Sheeping a mob and then immediately casting Blizzard on everything to get the sheep out - 2019 Wow Classic Mage logics 😂
---
No, you should only roll need if you actually NEED it.
---
What happens with we have a tank in a group and a really good BOE shield drops? The tank is definitely the end that will benefit the most from that piece a gear so the correct thing to do is to let him roll need because, guess what, he is the only one that actually NEEDS it.
---
Rolling need on BOE just because you want to sell it in the auction house is a dick move. Period.
---
And ferals.
---
Pshero is one of those retail rogues who thinks he's so good that he doesn't take advice. He doesn't use slice and dice on his rogue in PVE because he says "it's bad". He also just seems like a miserable person in general.
---
Take a break, save up a bunch of rest xp. Next rainy day off, dive back in.
---
If you've been questing a lot, grind some dungeons instead. SM 34-42, ZF 44-48, Mara 48-52, etc.
---
Dont get your hopes up for getting to 60 with the same dedication? The fuck does that mean? The guys nearly halfway to 60 for real anyway.
---
The games been out a month. Why would this person not be able to make 60?
---
also, you've kinda got the concept of karma wrong.
---
karma never states that you'll get rewarded in the same way, or even in the same life.
---
also, if you do good expecting to get a reward, you ain't really doing  good - as far as karma is concerned
---
Need is for people who really need the item, aka the ones able to equip it. It is kinda shocking how many ninja looter like you run around Reddit here and think it is ok to ninja a boe item because it is worth x gold. Hope people blacklist you and stop running dungeons with you. I definitely would never play with people like you again.
---
You’ll be fine going to org. Some quests send you to a specific trainer that may be uc tho
---
On PvP servers it's where you hit the contested zone part of leveling, where from then on your game time is dictated by the other faction in the zone, it becomes a lot less "get 5 levels in this zone" and more visit 5 zones this level, etc.
---
he is the edgelord what did you expect?

Regular person + Audience + Anonymity = Total Fuckwad.
---
Every good ninja knows that you have your alt throw the item up on the AH.
---
This is just sloppy ninja looting all around.
---
But renew is not mana efficient. Id rather give you a normal heal.
---
I mean, you could speak up.
---
There's no point in wishing other people to speak up if you don't either...
---
You already have 7 BIS items. You can tank everything!!
---
And even with normal gear I would tank everything when I ding 60
---
There is one like this, but cannot remember the name. Just search the twitch app and you'll find it.
---
&gt;Bud, the game isn't the problem. The people are. 
---
Yeah, the people are a problem because the game doesn't handle people well lmao
---
Orc’s racial is overrated imo. The real downside of playing ally is not having the will of the forsaken against warlocks, priests
---
Int only gives you more mana and spell crit. That’s nice to have but always worse than raw healing power it will. And the willpower on the staff amounts to less healing power than your main hand off hand combo. I’d take the latter for efficiency.
---
was a fun event &lt;3
---
Doesnt he actually have a girlfriend though?
---
Lol his price though.
---
420g 69s 69c
---
It’s the only realistic answer in Vanilla.
---
No its not, its a fuckin game, dont trust anybody. This is the equivalent of asking your dad to help you when someone insulted you.
---
If you’re interested in Ubrs I suggest looking up the fights before hand, but also going in as the off tank a couple times to get used to the pulls and how the fights are done.
---
When it comes to running dungeons though, people in my experience have been understanding (I’m a dps who’s grouped with a lot of first time tanks), and are generally just appreciative that you’re there. 
---
Don’t be afraid to ask questions about bosses or mobs or where to go, or to mark mobs or to tell the dps to give you a minute to get threat, or anything. Honestly as the tank, you have a lot of control over how things go, and I find communication is key to making even the longest most tedious runs seem like fun.
---
People are just happy to have a tank, and even if you don’t have a flawless first run, they’re most often happy to have done it, and it’s the best way for you to learn.
---
Blacklist this guy. If you see him, spit on him. If he wants to join your dungeons or raids, ignore him.
---
i don't get it either outside of the simile. 2lvls isn't a big deal for any mob.
---
He's Asmongold's officer, and I said their ilk. Read a book.
---
I swear those people are living in some fairytale wonderland. Not a single group that I have been in since the servers have gone up has *not* needed on boes. Not sure why they think they are more entitled to items that are equivalent to hundreds or thousands of gold than their groupmates.
---
Oh wow, someone who's affiliated with asmongold is a total douche? I'm so shocked!!
---
/s...
---
Peoppe also skip green quests and miss out, chasing yellow quests.
---
He’s not doxxing or inciting any action. Just because he wrote their tag that’s witch hunting according to the rules?
---
I have a human rogue. Do I or should I learn swords/mace skill
---
Not every bear has a tongue

The funniest part is that people are actively begging to be on the same layer with these people so they can play with them
---
Ah didn't know
---
I’m the opposite of you then, I very much do not enjoy just being on discord talking....if it’s music or a stream I can always pause it and switch to something else too
---
They don't "all look the same", you can tell if a person is someone you shouldn't mess with by looking at them
---
There are two types of people.
---
One type looks at a system in a computer game and says "how do we best use this system to avoid bad outcomes and create good outcomes?".
---
The other goes "Look like gold... must mean gold!"
---
I don’t know why you’re downvoted. You’re entirely right.
---
“LFM &lt;Dungeon&gt;, link &lt;Dungeon Cleared&gt; achieve or GTFO”
---
That was a plague on retail.
---
Because 15 years ago the game was new for us. As for AoE mages, there were LOADS of them 15 years ago, doing the same thing as today : AoE grinding.
---
However, 15 years ago, we did it to farm gold, not because we were bored, and we did it properly, making far more gold in open world, killing non-elites, instead doing it in instances, killing elites.
---
The currency drop is almost equal for a non-elite and for an elite....however, it takes 3 times less time to AoE 15 non-elites, instead 15 elites.
---
So, why we didn't do it with elites 15 years ago? Simple : because it was ineffective.
---
according to him that benefits the guild. spend more money making the guild better. it's totalitarian and stupid but that fucker is making more money per hour than 99% of this sub so cheers for the time! may his hair eventually grow back.
---
Go play retail then kiddo.
---
But you dont have intelligence.
---
Sometimes I'm really glad it's all personal loot now (in dungeons at least) with drama like that happening here all the time lol
---
If I knew someone for a long time and was close friends with them and he ninja looted an item I would not cut all ties and unfriend him. You have other issues then if that's your go too. 
---
Obviously that's not the same if he ninja loots then blocks and unfriends me, like in this scenario.
---
Pretty much. I guess common sense doesnt apply when your guildmaster is a huge duchebag. I havent watched more than a few of Asmongolds videos, but damn....he is like a spoiled brat that think everyone else exist for his pleasure. He gladly brags about how has manipulated loot distribution and never help in a raid where he doesnt need an item.
---
He is the ultimate representative of "Generation Me me me!"
---
That's stupid fucking logic. If you can benefit from wielding the item, not only does obtaining it vastly improve your leveling experience, you save the exact amount of money you would spent buying it from some asshole who needed on it for gold. Wtf do you think the gold symbol is for? Things you don't need and wanna sell but are below an arbitrary selling price?
---
Affliction is awesome sustainable damage and survivability. You can virtually off tank as cloth. 
---
Destro is incredible burst damage and specced right can one shot anyone else. 
---
With enough talent points you can spec Soul link/siphon life and be damn near invincible, especially with a VW for sacrifice, MD to instant summon another VW for another sac shield. Imagine 30 seconds of being invulnerable on top of 30% damage reduction. All while regaining health..hahahaha.
---
There are so many ways to spec a lock and still be wicked. That’s why I love it; it never gets old.
---
I played a lock in retail from mid vanilla. I’ve been through all the nerfs and changes. I’m extremely happy to be back to a time when he isn’t broken. And I have the benefit of not having to learn the class over years. Just gotta get muscle memory back :)
---
Don’t forget to try out enslave demon. It’s not really too useful, but it’s fun to see different pet abilities that exist from different mobs.
---
Hope you continue to experiment and enjoy him! Welcome to the void!
---
How can you explain the behavior of this Officer from his guild, then?
---
The people he watching on stream would not had been watched the same youtube content, another way to say it, Captain Grim. asmon watched on stream, at that time I didn't know who this youtuber was, I'm now subbed and watched his most recent video, he started out below 10k subs, he now has 66k subs, Tell me, would he have a net gain of views? Asmongold is away, the newest video has 262k without asmongold
---
because you are retarded, its not rocket science to understand that people like different things.
---
All that for bit of gold too...
---
pathetic
---
Yea, ninja doesnt happen on any other server, that logic.
---
If anything, most people would blacklist you because you're trying to ninja boes from the rest of the group. Literally no one who I have met in this game so far would pass on an epic because some random dude claims that he is entitled to it for an arbitrary reason.
---
Atm shadow dmg. You use mostly shadow, and in raids it’s all shadow
---
This is a lie, he kicks people for ninja and for way less, but keep up the lies!
---
You mean battle stance?
---
Noted. I will be reporting him for scamming. Thanks for the PSA.
---
his account will be flagged though
---
Go with the mh+oh. Not that it really matters though.
---
A bit late, but I'm curious about the situation. Were you using AoE moves throughout? Regardless of the threat generation, were you actually pulling mobs off of them? 
---
In any case, I have never kicked someone for this, usually just request specifics on what they do differently. Typically this would be asking them to wait longer to attack, to use a specific move less often that might be causing issues (mind blast or w/e on priests, AoE moves if I'm having trouble with the aggro, etc), or to focus on what are high threats, which I would then start marking with icons if I see that it isn't as obvious for the entire party. I hate "entitled" tanks, but the truth is that they are kind of the party lead, but this also includes putting out information that they would like the party to know like the things I specified above, or inform them if something is actually hurting the party's efficiency, rather than saying general statements and kicking without stating what the exact issue is.
---
He acts like he IS an intestinal parasite.
---
This shit.. This is the shit that really gets under my skin. What absolute fucking blob of lard do you have to be to pull this shit for fucking video game currency?
---
Lol in wrath you could that's 2 fucking expansions later and you needed 25man naxx gear minimum.
---
Not really ninja looting if EVERYONE in the group agrees to roll need... Or at least wait until the very end and make sure nobody else tries to do that. I usually just wait if nobody says anything but as soon as someone else hits need I roll need too.
---
Wasn’t it confirmed by Blizz that the first 5 weapon skill above 300 gave no hit increase?
---
Nah you arent bragging about warlocks. You are bragging about yourself. Title is completely misleading but its cool man, whatever gives you your jollies
---
I'm tank, if Skullflame dropped and I won it is vendor that without pause.
---
When you're talking about how many of one class there are compared to another the relative percentage (100% more) is more relevant anyway.
---
Comments like these are fuckin retarded, you cant know anybody from 10 minute,  you might catch a clip of him beeing mad or what ever. Seriously you trash talkers should use your brains to not look like retards.
---
What would you replace freezing band with at 60 it’s pre raid bis
---
And that video taught people how to avoid Ninjas from looting your items, what Roy did was 100% a Ninja.
---
If a Video teaches you how to do something, then it also teaches you how to avoid it.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Sounds inefficient. But much more fun and to my liking! It's an MMORPG, head out into the world to explore, quest and work on your proffs/mount etc! But being a healer I also feel bound to do every dungeon I come across. I forgot how long and shitstormy BRD can be, too.
---
Seriously. Something doesn't have to be an absolute explicit lie to be obviously deceptive.
---
Paying it forward is the best thing you can do!
---
Makes sense to me. Good advice!
---
imo: gold&gt;gear. 
---
If he had his epic mount...that would suck, but imo boe rare/epic = need.
---
ninjalooters defending ninjalooters, go back to fortnite.
---
Stfu boomer. Go take your 4th vacation this year with your 3rd wife at your vacation house.
---
lmao 400g is a huge amount for some people and some classes that can’t just AOE farm their way to an epic mount
---
Howd u get it? Did it let u loot the corpse?
---
Everyone rolls need on high value blues or epics. Those items can be turned into gold to buy yourself a boe.
---
Why would he be banned? There is no enough tools in the game to not get scammed. This is a living breathing world, scamming happens, maybe DONT trust a random guy?
---
Why the fuck are you in a streamer guild? What do you expect?
---
Stay as far away as possible from their raid groups.
---
And you can put int enchant on peacemaker too but nothing on dal rends
---
+ 5 sword and mace only applies to pve. Yes, take advantage of it but in pvp it doesn’t matter. People usually go for sword cause you get decent swords as quest reward
---
I believe he does. Still hope he doesn't procreate.
---
Thanks! Will do. I know lol but I’m a casual and dungeon healing is my favorite thing. Just having fun at trying to be the most efficient healer.
---
Charge range is only 25y
---
Next time all need.
---
pog
---
His stealth speed on land is probably the same as your swim speed so he just simply followed you and killed you. Also if you’re stealthed or invisible and swimming at the surface of the water, you make a ripple in the water that can still be seen. 
---
Can’t lie I’d be kinda shocked too lol but that’s the best explanation I can think of. 
---
But no, there’s no addon like that :p that would be cheating lol.
---
You sound like a bitch. Go play hello kitty island adventure. I wish asmongold was more toxic. It's extremely entertaining!
---
The OP mentioned the bags so I omitted it but yes, there's a 16-slot and once world bosses are available there will be a recipe for an 18-slot, which requires a whopping 12 mooncloth, iirc.
---
Time value of money. There may be inflation. You can do stuff with that 300g now and invest it and make more than the 1k you would get a few months later
---
That sounds fair, considering how much of a pain it can be to level up lockpicking they deserve some form of compensation for it.
---
No, you didn't. The offender blocked the friend after he looted.
---
There literally is no strict rule for that. If everyone is stupid enough to greed, they should suffer the consequences.
---
If I don't feel like talking to people I usually watch movies or things, streams are the absolute last thing I want to watch
---
Except from that warlock in my group that was still spamming shadowbolt on onyxia as she landed yesterday... Fuck that guy.
---
So? Still shouldnt be banned, next you guys are gonna ask for bans if someone ganks another player more than 2 times in 30min. This is a living breathing world, dont trust anybody, need on BOE, period.
---
A friend commented that I'm really aggressively nice to randoms on my healer.
---
"You gotta be nice on your priest, that way it stands out when you're being petty to 'em"
---
The looter blocked the friend, not the other way around.
---
Just learn from all his vids farming brd i'm sure he has made.
---
When you made 10g?
---
Your Pet is immune to cc and you got a stun.
---
It most definitely is true.
---
Except if you both choose steal, don't you both get nothing? So if everyone plays "optimally" it actually produces the worst outcome for everyone.
---
Been my looting rules for years, don't give a darn if it an Upgrade we're all needing
---
Oh that lovely twinkable BoE is worth a lot of gold but also a massive upgrade?! It's also a massive upgrade to gold and potential mount/ epic mount to enchants.
---
How do you define a "popular furry porn style"? Genuine question. What about this says "furry porn" to you?
---
You don't really need to stack +defense, just like you don't need to be prot spec for tanking 5/10mans. Look for a good mix of stats, plain +def/stam is really bad.
---
Classic is game of threat, not survival unless your healer is slacking.
---
Nice private server pic
---
Spy addon detects players in vicinity and notifies name and level (but doesn't pinpoint exactly where obviously). A druid can also track humanoids in catform. So whenever you ressed his spy addon probably buzzed.
---
wow that proof is too easy. Hope it's a long ban form wow and perm ban form the guild
---
Thing is, this only exists because of Classic as it is nowadays with guides and BiS lists and crafting recipes in a library.
---
In 2004 when an epic dropped it was a neat thing and whoever needed it needed it. I'm sure there were exceptions, but for the most part loot was treated as a "if it's an upgrade, it's an upgrade!". Everyone in the group was happy to see that person get so lucky.
---
Now we have this toxic meta where gold is the ultimate decider and people know what's absolute best for every spec. It's "best" from the same mindset that the retail loot bullshit is "best".
---
Because that's what happens when ppl scam in wow. They get banned. It's against blizzards eula. The one you accept when you install wow. Several ppl have been banned in classic for ninja looting allready, temp ban ofcause.
---
But it's funny because it's the weed and sex numbers xDxDxDxD
---
Nope, you get 25% of the reputation to all factions. You got around 20 rep to If, Darnasus and Gnomer.
---
There is an add-on called 'spy' I believe, never used it used it myself so im not exactly sure what it's capabilities are, perhaps check it out?
---
cmon fellow boomies grab your pitch forks, its lynchen time.

Spell batching is the worst thing in classic
---
THANKS BRO

What do you mean? Now you can finally play the game!

i tried to post it but it exceeds the 10000 character limit

This is the dumbest thing I read in this thread so far..
---
Pics of life, girlfriends, and jobs or it didn't happen.
---
He plays Dota with Purge like every week, and his community is never toxic, lmao.
---
Also it's pretty easy. Offering food and water is all it takes.
---
&gt; He was MTing molten core
---
&gt;a tank piece dropped
---
&gt;ninja'd that shit
---
I don't see the problem. Main Tank will always have priority on any tank drop that is an upgrade.
---
Because people treating others poorly is acceptable?
---
Grow up.
---
Scam through trade window is also a reason for reporting and banning
---
What difference does it make running into this guy, or running into someone who isnt IC at the moment? 
---
You’re bound to bump into OOC characters constantly anyway...

OP is Richpleb [(see his post history and his youtube video with Richpleb in the title)](https://www.reddit.com/user/pleblifeTV/)
---
The [blacklist post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9ogpq/i_really_like_this_game/) was by a different person, Good\_one, who [states that he killed a lvl 2 troll](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9ogpq/i_really_like_this_game/f1jouy0/) (Richpleb's Horde alt for x-faction trading) in Booty Bay (ie Good\_one is alliance), and then received the mentioned toxic message (from Richpleb's Alliance main)
---
TL;DR,   
---
The OP of this post (Richpleb) is the same person who posted the blacklist/KOS by 4 horde guilds shit
---
I don't even play WoW. But thanks for the absolute galaxy brain level take off 'juSt PlAy reTaIL', it was extremely informative.

So even if I'm invisible, all he has to do is track humanoids and I show up on his minimap?

Sure, [I got you.](https://www.google.com/search?q=all+definition&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;)

I don't follow.

I didn't go straight there after the cheese shop guy. When I went there the ? was missing, so I abandoned the quest hoping to pick it up from the last step, but no! It just vanished completely!

I get like 10 whispers a day "Wanna Heal Rendrun?" 
---
Why they dont understand there isnt any loot for healers, but a single drop from a rare.
---
Go full URBS run if you want find healers.

You are lying, in vanilla you didnt get banned, they changed this rule in 2010:

Didn't know that... what about being underwater in general? Does my name above my character show above the surface even if I'm way underwater?
---
Not really. Ppl complained for being banned after they ninja looted. So in 2010 they made it official.
---
You crazy Hordes
---
35-45 has always been a roadblock for many. Each level takes a significant step up in time required &amp; leveling zones are far more spread around. Also, as said below, its where you hit contested areas, which slows down levels even more
---
So if that someone else who needs can equip the item you decide to ninja? Man you are a nice guy.
---
You're not alone... though I \_think\_ this time I've nailed down my main! Yes. This time for sure. -\_-;
---
On a positive note... with so many alts, rested XP is much more frequent and useful...!

Random question, but what is the chat addon called from this screenshot?

Is Blizz going to change anything concerning class balance throughout the entire phases?
---
G. R. O. S. S.
---
No but he sees you when invisibility wears off. Or maybe he had an Invisibility detection on him from a lock.
---
I assume scum people like you live in NA? I have never seen that shitty need on BOE items on German server ever. Not now and definitely not during Vanilla. I guess we have decent humans here.
---
Being able to equip an item is not an arbitrary reason. It is the reason why he should get the item. I hope I never play with ninja looter like you.
---
It's also content for his stream when he does it, he has an actual financial reason to deal with these people excluding the PR stuff.
---
He's just smiling.
---
May i ask you how the hell did you dig a thread 5 months old?
---
:100: :fire: :joy: :ok_hand:

That guy is a moron, he's in this thread acting like he's the authority on who is a big streamer and who is not based on who he watches, and when it fits his argument. Pointless trying to reason with him.
---
How do you RP? The whole RP thing is completely foreign to me.
---
You can consider playing warlock(sl lock is kinda similar to sp) if you do not want to heal in any occasion.
---
Im not trying to stack stam or def, but im just following the pre bis guides out there to gear up. However i see alot of ppl with mail or even leather items which makes me rethink what im doing with my gear. It also makes me wonder if i even know what im doing.

---
affliction if you're on a pvp realm, one fear is enough to 100-0 most of the time.
---
What a complete and utter fuckwit. Then again is anyone really surprised? Asmongold doesn’t exactly scream trust or competence. No surprise that he’s putting dickheads as officers in his guild
---
I updated my post to explain.
---
This is absolute bullshit and the worst part of classic wow community on retail.
---
 It’s completely normal and meta to stack mages and rogues in raid groups because they’re simply a very good dps class. 
---
Don’t be a fucking loot whore like that, seriously. This is what retail wow has done to its players. 
---
And don’t go into a raid expecting to get any loot that night.
---
So you just chill in subs for games you don't play..... that's pretty pathetic. You're right. The true galaxy brain move is to complain about a game you don't even play or to not just play something else if you're someone who does play it.
---
You're real smart, man.
---
I’m a newb. My herbalism is 200. How can I make money with herbalism?
---
I won’t be for long
---
&gt; Trees are actually oxygen neutral for the most part. 
---
overtime trend is carbon sequestration via root systems from worldwide tree coverage, as in, if you graph out a couple of centuries you'll see the influence of trees effectively removing carbon from the atmospheric systems
---
Do you run the scans when you are the auction house?
---
Kids do anything these days for attention
---
need on bags, BoE epics and Onyx diamonds (or whatever theywere called for the DM enchants)
---
Absolutely. There are some green items considered BiS. Obviously this doesn't apply to all/most items, but you can get a general idea by looking at the item type and stats first. If the name doesn't ring a bell, look at those things, then if you're still genuinely unsure, there are some sites that look at previous auction histories to give you an idea, as well as your current auction house.
---
Example: you find a green bow. Great! You notice it has spirit &amp; int. No so great!
---
You find a green helm. Great! You notice it's level 40+, mail, and has a lot of strength + int. Quite possible that a shaman might need this.
---
If you find a cloth chest piece and it has strength + agility, you probably won't fight that many takers. 
---
People much smarter than me have crunched the numbers to determine what items are "best in slot" for the different classes and their chosen specs, but you should take a look at the list. You might be very surprised at some of the rarity qualities &amp; level ranges. 
---
Lastly, the game is still in an early state, so if it's not going to help someone with a raid or is one of their BiS items, they probably won't pay too much for it. Twink items are worth quite a bit, but you won't be able to sell those things at full value until much later, and when battlegrounds come into play.
---
Could someone help me a little bit? What is the correct order of alliance dungeons up to ~level 40?
---
Why don't u just delete adibags and stick to elvuI
---
Bro I just bought a used lenova for 100 bucks just for wow on vacation. It doesnt take much to run it!
---
Asmon doesn’t say any O2 members names as he isn’t in this guild. So nice try.
---
imagine being the first to click greed on a "all greed" haha. all greed is dumb anyway, should always be all need in these cases to avoid ninjas.
---
but yeah i hope he's banned
---
also wtf is that edgemasters for 250?!?!
---
type /who name to see their class level and guild
---
Right click and inspect for gear and stats but you have to be close for that
---
I don’t trust streamers and asmongold annoys me. He does sucky things in WoW and expects us to do the opposite.
---
It is quite a chunky heal. ~10%
---
It’s almost like people do what they want and you can’t control them.
---
You know you just posted literally the exact same questionable "proof" that I responded to? Link proof that doesn't require assumptions.
---
You get on it
---
 midlvl crisis. It'll be ok
---
I literally, specifically said, it happened here on reddit (aka not on stream), on his subreddit. It's on /r/asmongold and it's the top post, lmao.
---
Yeah but you use all combo points for kidney shot, so during the stun you aren't doing much damage.
---
Yup, that doesn’t actually help your cause.
---
Not saying retail is empty.
---
You want to do Arena or m+?
---
Check out the group finder and you will find someone.
---
But fewer upgrades make me appreciate the smallest change.
---
Maybe the dungeon browser was a mistake.
---
I mean, not really.
---
They were like 5 different spells they could have used to instantly finish the shammy instead of what they did.
---
Arcane explosion, fire blast, cone of cold, even fucking blizzard instead of literally running past the shammy.
---
Why even use frost nova when any instant damage ability would kill the dude.
---
Fear Ward is extremely overrated in PvE. There aren't many fear-based encounters, you probably already have dwarf priests to put it on the tanks since almost every priest seems to be dwarf, and Horde gets along just fine without em. Warriors get their own fear break/immunity for a reason.
---
It's pretty solid for PvP though. But shadowmeld can be pretty useful in PvP as well.
---
But consider that a receeding hairline is a huge problem for many. And surgery to have it fixed is atleast 7k. And as we are discussing how twitch chat is toxic, But here you are slandering his looks for no reason at all.
---
I'm sure it was justified the first time you've been there
---
And gear that is boe can be bought and as such winning it just means you saved gold.
---
But the run between flight masters and zeps is more than 30 seconds and if you miss the boat or zep because you're moving slower it costs you even more time. I'm not suggesting only using mounts, obviously the advantage is in having access to both. The 72g you save is honestly peanuts by the time you're ready to get your epic mount, and having your 60% will get you to 900g faster than saving that 72g will is my point. Suggesting skipping the 60% mount to save for your epic mount is as stupid as suggesting skipping travel form to save for your 60% mount.
---
Now if we want to talk the importance of getting your mount at exactly 40 that's a different story, but you should definitely have it before 60.
---
He soaked fire blast right after mage blink
---
This would be Chadtastic if it was a ret paladin or enh shaman.
---
As I play enh shaman I await the roll off and the rage quit inducing feels that may occur for whatever warrior or rogue that will be in my group. That chat will be hilarious will screenshot forsure.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Its either Claw or Bite. Bite is more focus efficient but Claw looks cooler
---
Yeah planning to unload through p3 -&gt; p6, since AQ/NAXX will reward the most cash, as casual guild will need them in order to raid
---
Probably started very late into retail where this shit wasn't as easy to punish as it is in classic.
---
He might have changed his mind but i refer you to this guys comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/daqh8j/psa_asmongolds_officer_royson_teaches_us_a_lesson/f1tlah6)
---
I doubt its the best its ever been. If that was the case, the support for hots wouldnt have just been collapsed, especially in the fashion that it was. I mean thats not what a company who is raking in the dough does, they wouldve done a gradual pull out, announced a date but no it was like hots support existed one day and was just gone the next.  
---
Its just pretty obvious that blizz propping up both Hots and OW as the next big esport by pumping the scenes full of money, has not had nearly the amount of return that they were expecting. They were probably thinking they were going to get Dota 2 type money but ignored the fact that dota took about a decade to build up and Valve doesnt really treat their playerbase almost with disdain by openly talking shit at blizzcon.  
---
For blizz, them releasing classic is actually admitting defeat. Something they tried to avoid doing for a very long time. It has to be nothing short of ego.
---
All is defined by the author, as your link stated. 
---
A ”particular group” can in this case be everyone except the party leader, which is quite normal in situations where a social hierarchy exists.
---
For example, when a teacher tells his students ”Everyone do this task”, it does not mean that the teacher is also expected to complete the task.
---
Im at 42 and my play time has reduced drastically from the first 2 weeks , there isn’t really anywhere i can just get a load of quests to do at once , 43/44 should open up a fair bit for me , its definitely the questing 30-45 wish i did more SM
---
I skimmed over the first part, skipping to random points. I see no sign of a sudden mental breakdown, but from the clips I was hearing he seemed to be getting genuinely more demoralized as the session went on. 5:43:15 seems to be a much more real reaction over someone completely over it than the normal "REEEEEEEE!" rage-quits he would do.
---
My guess is people saw him legitimately not handling the toxic comments on top of hard gameplay, and called it a 'mental breakdown' because of course they would.
---
By joining one that doesn't require it and if that doesn't exist they can make their own group.
---
Why do you expect others to carry you?
---
Asmongold is a pretty chill and nice guy in reality. He puts on an act on stream to make it more entertaining. If you just watch one or two if his streams then he does seem like an asshole, but if you watch him for a while like I have then you realise he's a pretty normal dude. He's definitely not some toxic asshole a lot of people make him out to be.
---
Dude shut the fuck up. Someone has a different opinion than you, which 99% of people agree with him. Why don't you go back and read your replies to this guy and realize who the scumbag is... Fuckin weirdo.
---
Please tell me how intentionally doing something that harms your group isn't giving people the middle finger.
---
I dont care if you are good for the dungeon. I make the group, lead it and tank it.. You dont bring that much to the table anyway. Not going to take rogues who want my fury gear. Sorry dudes.
---
idk man i dont even know how i got to this subreddit
---
This feels more like a beg for a laptop than an actual post without secondary intent. Saying you have a family is cool and all but a functional laptop that can run classic is 200 if that.
---
Do you mean pools? Fishing pools look like a circle in the water. You cast your rod into the circle to catch more expensive/rare fish usually 100% of the time. Its a bit like finding a mining node, just in the water.
---
If not, perhaps they just mean places to get expensive fish, in that case I suggest looking for fishing guides on youtube, plenty of them show the best profitable fish.
---
There are not enough points to spec sl and siphon life
---
Invest in what? A BOE that costs 300g and will cost 1k in a couple of months for example?
---
No. The particular group in this case is everyone who is capable of greeding. No more. No less.
---
"**All** greed."
---
Not "All greed, except me"
---
&gt; Exactly, what there is the ”particular group”. Is the people he is ordering to greed, or isnit the entire party?
---
... what?
---
He used right after blink  but grounding totem soaked it
---
Yeah! Of course it’s all dead to me...
---
The issue with that clip is that that‘s Asmongolds humor. If you watch him a lot, you‘ll realize that he often says ridiculously toxic or provoking stuff, but he himself never actually does any of the things he says. He says them for content and as a joke.
---
Obviously that‘s not an excuse, because a lot of people don‘t realize that he‘s almost never serious and then enact what he says - like in this case.
---
The Felwood ones are in the underground part of Jaedenar, through the second entrance where you do the escort quest.

Ungoro then run from there

Yikes, saw the notification on my phone and you really got angry enough to start throwing out slurs. Take a break from Reddit bud.
---
YOU JUST KNOW
---
I suppose what I mean is messed up for a lot of ppl who played on private servers with a later version. Lots of things in brd, lbrs all drop off different bosses. Nothing wrong with it was just surprised the first few times I ran through those dungeons.
---
Yes, waste GMs' time by falsely reporting people for scamming.
---
Commenting for later
---
Try the Ironman challenge
---
How expensive would leveling engineering be without having mining?
---
Well that's what I meant by notice. There are players in retail, but none of them will ever care about you, your character, what you bring/how good you are at the game, what you've invested, etc.
---
You can help people, actually help people in classic, through your hard work and efforts. Its a good feeling.
---
Lol ok. I have every AotC from up to the current xpac. I have all pvp titles. I have a max lvl toon of every class and multiples of some. I love the game up until wrath. After that I just played because I already invested so much time into it.
---
I like how you are gonna come here and tell me what I like when I criticize what I said I didn’t like.  Let me break it down by xpac of what I think is complete shit. 
---
Cata- LFR should never have been a thing. 
---
MoP- the entire fucking expansion should never have existed. 
---
WoD- 3 boring ass raids that were out forever and garrisons. 1st pvp set was nice and elite was cool. Every other set was a raid set recolor. 
---
Legion- WQ and artifact power. Shit was beyond stupid.  Also mythic dungeons. 
---
BFA - again with the world quest and artifact power bullshit. They also took away tier and pvp gear and left us with the stupidest fucking system in the world, your gear has bullshit traits.  Mythic+. 
---
I’ve played since release and I know what I like. It isn’t nostalgia, vanilla, tbc, wrath is a good game. Everything after is shit. Again I say this as someone who has played the game for over a decade.
---
According to your opinion sure, but it’s definitely not always the case.
---
I'll be more diligent with the matter
---
Wait, while you're sheeped, doesn't your mana regen as well?
---
I really don't want to do that, thanks.
---
Yuup, sounds about right. Wiped there twice - lesson learned!
---
Nice try scammer.
---
Enjoy reaping the rewards of your hard work! I hope its a big payoff.
---
I'm currently leveling my priest and Green quests/mobs are the best. I never have to stop for mana when doing that. Yellow I have to drink every 3 mobs or so.
---
Actually there are quite a few decent humans in this thread who understand the need/greed system. Sadly there are also quite a few ninja looter like the op, so he deserves any shit he gets. I'm not gonna be friendly to shitty ninja looters like him (and you I guess).
---
Does it really matter for dungeons? Is there a spec that does shit dps outside of having mana issues? Because mana issues are not an issue in dungeons. Mages have amazing dps but in dungeons where they are doing aoe on most packs they need to drink after every pull too
---
And race
---
Gehennas EU here too. Sucks coming home and wanting to get online immediately, but I just remote desktop in once I start heading home and by the time I'm home there's usually only 20-30 minutes left in the queue. 
---
My guild considered moving to a lower-pop server, but besides the obvious difficulties of getting everyone on board, we didn't want to go to a server that wasn't as outrageously dense and full of opportunities for groups, so we're staying. Hopefully within a month or so the queues will be gone.
---
Funnily enough ran my first gnomer in classic with a guild 5man. Party leader already had a few Gnommer stuff and completed the quests. He lead the way and we still got lost. How people did this before maps and wow head I'll never know (I'm assuming there would have been a time people had to do this blind?)
---
Tracking does display through stealth unless I am completely misremembering, but I'm sure it does - it's one of the reasons doing quests with stealt mobs I'd alot easier as a hunter!
---
Not opinion. It's definition. Anything less does not fit the definition of all. If you can't comprehend that, **go back to school.**
---
I hate their running animation as well. Was never very satisfied with my mount as an Orc.
---
Sooooo, [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulBreakableWrenchUncleNox) isn't asmongold telling people to ninja items from not guildies?
---
Track humanoids or simply see in stealth bc higher level. Drop off begins fast
---
&gt;What you're basically saying is that intention does not matter, only action
---
Um, yes? It what would do we excuse harassment because "They were just playing a persona"?
---
I know chadtastic in real life hahaha.
---
I think you need to look up what a scam is.
---
Just because you can pickpocket, doesn't mean its the best way to make money. If you WANT to make money by pick pocketing, instances are usually the best places to do it.
---
I suggest looking at Frostadamus' videos on youtube for making gold. Really, really good stuff.
---
I think this person's point is if everyone needs that's just the same as everyone greeding, except it leaves no space for ninja looting because there's no higher rolling tier left.
---
it's nice that you ask because RP servers have ben invaded by non RPers.
---
never LFG or LFM, WTS or WTB, using acronyms, speak of out of the game stuff like politics, last graphic card, or even in game stuff like your stats, theorycraft, appreciation on a class,..
---
don't use at all /say and /yell channels except for acting as your character. it's the strict rule and the core of RP. don't respect it and some people like me will kindly at first explain to you how things work on a RP server, most will just put you on ignore list because they had enough to explain and that should be the job a some game masters if Blizzard was doing its job.
---
names: you can be named whatever you want as long as you don't use /say /yell /emote .. as long you don't communicate and your name will never appear in channels used by roleplayers. better say that's impossible so you should have a RP name from the start,  a name that fits in the world, or you'll be reported, ignored again by most, and forced to rename by the GM.
---
many people that don't know about RP and don't ask how to, do and don't, just like you did and I commend you for that, end ghosted and think the server is dead.
---
Need is for if you’re equipping it or can use it.  Greed if you plan on selling it.
---
Because spell cleave mages be like
---
It's like you just read the word generation and exploded. Like chill dude lol
---
While your way to roll might make sense in theory, the safe way to do it is always to have everyone roll need on items like this one. Also, from my experience, always everybody likes to does this differently, therefore it‘s always important to state if people should roll need or greed on expensive items.
---
Okay, Lulu.
---
Cross posted my original Post on r/Mograine.
---
Sorry if this is not allowed I could just make a new post here and copy pasta if this is against the rules.
---
But he ninja looted that helmet?
---
Get Barman's Shanker from BRD
---
And just like in real life, there are rules and punishments. Don’t like it? Don’t do the crime.
---
The norm on my server is if you're running a dungeon with randoms, you always NEED on epics, no matter what.
---
Everyone should have the chance to get it, so why would anyone greed on it?
---
Gonna have to do some victim blaming here and say that you kind of walked into this situation by saying "GREED". Why the hell would you do that as opposed to everyone NEEDing?
---
Elvui does this. Dont know if there is a standalone version
---
This was gold
---
Im 49 rn, what kinda gold ya pullin on those rn?
---
Timbermaw hold enchants exist in classic wow
---
Isnt this naming and shaming? Im not sure if it’s smart to include the names
---
Your gear is fine. If a tank has bad items and because of this he makes low threat, the dps have to control their damage.
---
Blizzard sure loves protecting stupid people. will that lead to their downfall again?? Awe shall see
---
Source: Played a druid back in vanilla days and picked a fight with a lone pally in warsong gulch. Fight took forever while we healed ourselves constantly until we're both reaching the end of our mana. Pally eventually won but that was one heck of a long fight. I took this as a lesson to leave pallys alone, even if I'd won it wouldn't have been worth the hassle.
---
He said the druid was a skull if I assume level differences affects stealth detection even in classic .
---
Your reading that wrong.
---
The guy that did the ninja, blocked and unfriended the other guy.   
---
He cut ties because he’s the piece of shit.
---
It’s a bitch move people like this do so they don’t have to answer to their friends.
---
Ive had groups ask me why my damage is so low when im playing as a feral druid after ive pulled agro a few times and started waiting to attack.
---
Its low because if i open when the tank does, i become the tank....
---
If other people do listen and you're the only one that needs you are the one that's stealing loot. Him saying it just places you in a bad position.
---
ElvUI has a built in interrupt announcer, it might have been that.
---
That tune changed with classic release, Asmon has actually been a decent dude this time round, he helped his other guild get their Sulfuras and they're not even in his team.
---
Ok that's not true though, Blizzard has a history of intervening in cases like this.
---
They do something if the criteria for what constitutes a scam is met, but that's not always the case with ninjas.
---
I understand the argument of need if you actually need, greed otherwise. But when you have instances, like in the referenced ninja looter post, where it's "all greed" it doesn't make any sense. If you are trying to get everyone to roll the same way, then having everyone roll need accomplishes this without room for someone to ninja.
---
I rescan everytime i login. Or whenever i get back to org etc. Prices always change and if 1 guy puts a lowball stack then the price gets fucked up on auctioneer
---
There is literally only one recipe that use them and that is cheap as fuck.
---
Yikes,  the amount of retail soft boys in this sub. 
---
Ninja looting is only when the master looter in a pug raid takes an item and leaves. Imagine being so entitled you think you have to bother a GM because a guy Needed on your stupid level 50 item in a dungeon. YIKES
---
God i miss LH so much
---
Wasnt in vanilla, wich is the only point that matters.
---
If you don't watch 10 hours of video and read an essay you can't say I'm  overexaggerating :) .

I‘m not saying it‘s a good joke or thing to do, I‘m merely explaining what a lot of people who‘ve never watched the guy are not aware of.

Horde has TWO boats(FROM CAPITAL CITIES NO LESS) and a flight path to the center of Stranglethorn, a boat FROM CAPITAL TO CAPITAL across continents, a flight path to the Badlands, a flight path to the center of Swamp of Sorrows, a flight path to the center of Dustwallow,  a flight path to the center of Thousand Needles, a flight path to the center of Felwood, and a flight path to the center of Stonetalon.

I prefer rolling greed over becoming a ninja looter. And if people roll need to sell I will ignore them and that was the last dungeon I will ever run with them. It's my decision. I will not compromise myself to support this shitty ninja looting.  And if more people would actually be somewhat decent we wouldn't have discuss about this shitty behavior and accept it.
---
Or maybe you could link them.
---
I know what you're saying but jumping off a ledge to have the pet take the long way is not an expected issue. We know it's an issue because other people didn't dismiss the pet and wiped their group. I sure did back in 2005.
---
(Not the guy you're replying to) Also the mage could have fire blasted the shaman when he was finally out of range, but he was charging up his frostbolt instead.
---
Everyone in here agrees. He said "all greed". Not "all of you". "All" means everyone that rolls, unless he specifically excludes himself. Stop defending a piece of shit and trying to sound smart with mental gymnastics that don't even work. Everyone knows what "all" means or what it should mean in this case and that's why his action is crappy. 
---
By all means keep arguing against it if you want, you're just collecting more downvotes. I won't bother replying
---
Xaryu is one of the more popular youtuber pvp mages and swears by rank 1. Damage is not important on nova. It's all about mana efficiency.  
---
Look him up on youtube. He made a ranks video recently.

Your server just sounds like it's got a bunch of retards. Anyone who thinks that casting frostbolt is Aoe (or that any Aoe mage would even take any rank of Frostbite) is touched in the head.

Well, you're setting yourself up to be fucked and you have no one to blame but yourself.

https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023

The only reason they changed it is because of the casuals that started playing the game and complained about loosing a fuckin group of pixels in a game.
---
Gold is a number. Experience points are a number. There are activities that are more and less efficient for each. Do activities that prioritize gold gains, and your gold coins will increase.
---
You can focus on getting EXP and Gold, though, and have enough by 40, but its really not worth stressing about. As soon as you sit on that level 40 mount you'll think "Now I need to save for my epic mount.....".

And if you watch the entire Onyxia raid you can watch Ozzy tank. until the 1st breath, where he dies. At least he fessed up to Ninja looting it i guess.

Oh right all the 500g drops that I've gotten how could I forget all of those...you know I always click need when a high value drop that I can't use comes up. 
---
I'm curious now though...how many 500g drops have you gotten? lmao
---
If you're talking low level items, sure, passing a couple of gold is fine if it means someone else gets an upgrade.
---
If we're talking a 20g or more item, fuck that, I'm rolling on it aswell. We obtained the item as a group, so we all deserve a chance at getting it.
---
Who prefers that? Idk how it works where you're from but the Royson thing just got some attention because it has Asmongold in the title.
---
Every group I've ever been in with an epic drop all automatically respond "all need"
---
&gt; If everyone needed on everything all the time it would be a lot harder to get the drops you actually need to improve your character.
---
Only for the assholes who put on worse gear so they can need because "I'm going to use it hurr durr". For everyone else it makes it **EASIER**.

Im on on rp-pvp server. I dont care about rp'ing at all but it's been good in the sense that people are friendlier with less try-hards. For exemple the mage spellcleave groups are not as proeminant as in normal servers.

Sounds to me like ninjalooting is a scam. The system is designed to roll need on the items you need, not roll need out of greed. That's what greed is for. I'd call this intentional abuse of game mechanics with the intent of making the game unplayable for other players.

This isn't ~~scam~~ *EVE* Online. No one should go unpunished, or even be rewarded with the benefits of selling a BoE, for being an asshole.
---
Your post history reeks toxicity yet here you are trying to condemn a streamer who supposedly did all these bad things but where is your evidence? If Asmongold is as toxic as you claim I'll still side with him any day over people like you, lol, and I'm sorry but so will the vast majority of people. You belong to an angry but loud minority.   
---
Btw I found your overrustlelog in Asmongold's chat for September  
---

---
Doesn't look good now does it
---
When it comes to BoE's that sell for that much... yes. Unless they say they're going to equip it WHILE IN THE GROUP then sure. You cannot take someones word, welcome to the world - people suck.
---
This video literally only makes sense if you already know all the info it gives.
---
Nice memes though?
---
I don't think this applies at all, the previous cases were because the player changed the loot system which is a game mechanic only available to the party leader. This is different and should not be bannable but is still scummy as fuck and he should blacklisted by as many people as possible as well as his guild.
---
Loot rules must be stated at the start of an instance or when a new member joins the group if master loot is set.
---
Otherwise you can't report anything
---
I specifically said his mental breakdown happened here, on reddit, on his subreddit. [Here is the giant post of him complaining about chat and wondering why people are so mean to him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/adqvew/responding_to_criticism/)
---
I can't tell if you fanboys are purposely misreading my comments or you're just this stupid, but shit's getting old.
---
1. Make a lvl 1 alt.
---
2. Invite a friend.
---
3. Give him lead.
---
4. Have him invite your alt.
---
5. He can now quit the group.
---
6. Do dungeon. 
---
7. Logout and relog to alt.
---
8. Wait at least 30 sec after the original logout if your pc is fast.
---
9. Reset dungeons and go back to main.
---
Do you know how many people play on a server? not to mention new players? do you know how many ninjas it would take to build an actual bad reputation? you can easily ninja once a month or so and easily fly under the radar unless someone is hell bent on exposing you and spams trade/lfg hours everyday.
---
Ninja happens on all the servers you utter moron
---
burden of proof is upon you, you should present it to us, not the other way around
---
How the fuck is Asmongold witch-hunting still allowed on here? I've asked mods about this half a year ago and they said they didn't want the subreddit to be centered about hating on streamers. What a clowny community this is..
---
&gt;I don‘t really understand what you‘re saying. How is it ninjaing if you say „everybody roll need“ and the entire group rolls need? Everyone has the chance to win it then, there‘s no person just taking the item for himself.
---
What you have done here is create an equal opportunity for everyone who intends to sell it to ninja it, and less opportunity for anyone who intends to use it. If you force a need roll for everyone even those who should greed, someone who **actually** needs now has less chance.
---
When any item drops the fairest thing to do is to treat it the same as every other item. The value of an item should not change what is "fair" to do. Imagine you're in molten core, and instead of only people who can use the BoE epics getting to roll on it, the entire raid rolls.
---
I'm sooo happy at lease someone understands me. I can't even put it in words. Can I cry on your shoulder at the mostly nonsensical replies to this post? :( 
---
It's as if people didn't read half the words I wrote. Like I asked "why do people roll greed instead of need?" and not what I actually asked.
---
&gt; Except that GMs actually *should* do something against it.    
---
ftfy (:
---
No im not, use your brain once in a while my man
---
I’m so glad that ninja looters are again a thing.
---
Second song a nod towards faxmonkey??? Super cool!!
---
Druid. You'll be able to do things other than heal, and you won't even need to respec. There's a split build that lets druids tank AND heal 5 mans, and it does pretty good dmg in cat form for farming.
---
Read a post on here how he failed classic wow when the game was coming out he’s like wer going home boys and what not and now they just spam leveling SM along w asking for gold and asking where everything is and not questing and what not. I really don’t like this person he don’t seem like a good person
---
That's fantastic lol
---
Mages are also the new Gank happy rogues - change my mind.
---
When you pick pocket in BRD and you get resisted, you vanish. Talking about efficiency:
---
Should i wait for the vanish cooldown or just keep pick pocketting risking to die and walk all the way back?
---
(Im playing Prep. if that matters)
---
So hold on, you dont watch asmongold, i do, but somehow you know him better or when he is joking and not? Not the sharpest tool in the shed huh?
---
As other stated, use most buttons more.
---
Also, do some wrist exercises, will save em health in a loooong run.
---
They can purchase it from the auction house though, like everyone else. It's not like they're farming for that item, most BOEs are random drops
---
Now imagine being a warlock pulling aggro from 2 mages with just 2 ticks of hellfire, after giving them 5-10 seconds head start.  Sometimes I let them get to 10k damage done before casting and it's the same story.
---
Note to paladins: always give your warlocks salv.  Unless they specifically ask for something else.  And if you're running an AoE farm group then the warlock should be the only person with salv.
---
Seems like most if the alliance has... we are so damn outnumbered. Lol
---
You seem to be in the extreme minority, unfortunately. I have yet so see a mage that doesn't default to instantly AoEing everything, even if there are only 2 mobs. I never get food/water unless I ask for it, and asking typically takes around 2-5 messages before they actually bother to give me 1 stack of water and no food, even though I offer a healthstone in return every time. Then I need to ask 5 more times a little while later when I inevitably run out.
---
I asked a mage in Ironforge yesterday if he wanted to trade food + water for a healthstone + tip. He spent 10 seconds summoning me a few stacks and I gave him the healthstone and 15s. He said "that's it?", called me a "cheap little punk bitch", and spend the next few hours harassing the officers in my guild trying to get them to pay him the larger tip he felt he was owed, plus trying to get me kicked from my guild. Some extreme classic mage energy.
---
Meanwhile hunters have been mostly fine, though on the rare occasion that CC is used they tend to break it with multishot.
---
Dudes a cop.  He literally does nothing and expects to be paid for it.
---
Use pet or sac it for buff when farming pre BiS gear ? Was watching some streams and locks were farming end game dungeons with no pet out
---
&gt; Sounds to me like ninjalooting is a scam.
---
Please elaborate where you see the dishonesty or fraud in the act of ninja looting.
---
&gt; No one should go unpunished, or even be rewarded with the benefits of selling a BoE, for being an asshole.
---
Ironically, by greeding instead of needing on BOEs you're rewarding dishonest people while harming the honest ones, so that doesn't make any sense.
---
very situational.   
---
Hunters gonna be very valuable in AV due to their range but rogue playstyle is pretty fun, especially if you group up with a druid/other rogue and intercept reinforcements or roam the world killing everyone. Nothing more annoying than a ganking rogue.   
---
On the other hand, rogues will have a harder time to kill people if you aren't very good at it. Hunters are a bit easier but might be not as fun. 
---
I'm 54 atm and loving my hunter though.
---
Spellcleave is on every fuckin server hahahahahaha, holy moly you joking right?
---
Pretty sure you need the key from rattlegore. Dont think that door can be lockpicked
---
How to get banned in under a month
---
He's already got a name for himself, it wouldn't be hard
---
When i first started classic, i joined nice guild and someone gave me 4x 6 slot bags for free, when i said i would like to pay, he said no need just stay loyal to guild. Then same person gave me 4x 10 slot bags for free. I always asked to pay for it but he didnt accept it. 
---
Now i am level 27 and made some decent gold with professions, i always try to help out my guildies, quest or mats, doesnt matter, if someone needs anything, i am helping. It is a nice feeling.
---
SM/DS is a meme spec. There is no gear that is bad enough where it outperform SM/Ruin. Bane alone is a 16.5% dps increase then you have 5% crit and imp. Shadowbolt that you are missing out on, the extra range on destruction spell are also very big and shadowburn is a fantastic spell. All this alone easily out preforms what you get from SM/DS not even taking Ruin in to account, and even with really bad gear you will have about 10% crit at the least with destruction talents, ruin is a 33% damage increase on crits and with 10% crit it will bring an additional 3.3% overall damage increase to your dps. Ruin is not the greatest yet at bad gear but it is still better than your other options.
---
I've just thrown a plain example since it seemed to be the only kind you could comprehend, since you clearly didn't understand my initial question.
---
shitty bleed ruins a debuff slot
---
Gold is literally greed. Your opinion is wrong.
---
What? You can change autoloot from options mate :P
---
Stop gaining XP, start farming gold. Mining, fishing and herbalism are probably your only options, I recommend mining. Though I do think you started a bit late worrying about it ONE level before your deadline...
---
Not to any significant degree.
---
Ofc you equip the item while in the group. That is a given. And yes people suck, but you don't have to become some shitty person just because other suck. Or else everyone out there would run around stealing, cheating and whatever crime you can find.
---
Gotta be proactive. I'm a bit of a shitposter, I like to talk a lot in chat so if things quiet down, I usually start them back up. People also gravitate towards that energy, so cracking jokes or just generally being helpful will "set the tone" and usually a lot of people will follow suit.
---
I will say though, we are an English server and while ofc I don't care if you don't speak perfect English, I do think that the massive number of Swedes that just don't speak English in chat kinda alienate themselves from the rest. Like, it's totally fine to have Swedish guilds where you can speak Swedish all day, but in public chat it would be nice if we could all understand one another...
---
Yes, it does matter.
---
The reason you take a Shadow Priest over a Mage or a Warlock is the idea that they will, at times, off-heal.
---
My twitch account is the same as my reddit account, kid_khan. Kidkhan isn't me. [Here are my logs](https://overrustlelogs.net/stalk?channel=Asmongold&amp;nick=Kid_khan). The only time I talked in his chat was to talk about Apex, which I was really big on when it came out. Literally two lines, neither of which talking shit on him, but rather calling his chat dumb.
---
But that's a great attempt at an exposure my dude.
---
How would he know OP got them though? Only the seller would :o
---
No?
---
hah Gnomeregan.... wait until you do full BRD quest run now that takes a few hours... days...
---
E
---
You're funny.
---
IF is nowhere near ZG.
---
Horde get a zeppelin ride from either Orgrimmar or Undercity directly to the center of Stranglethorn.
---
Alliance and horde have the same flight path to AQ, BUT Horde had two capital cities close by, and the third gets a zeppelin ride to Orgrimmar.
---
Aliiance have to take a flight to a boat to another boat.
---
Or take an equally time consuming flight path from the most remote capital city in the world.
---
And Undercity is very close to Naxx... again, a zeppelin ride from Orgrimmar.
---
You're dreaming.
---
Im on a rp server and nobody cares about your name, the channels you use for chating or what you talk about. 
---
Name policy isnt enforced by blizz as far as i can tell. 
---
Just don't disrupt the rp of people rp'ing, that's common curtesy. Besides that it's like a normal server but friendlier
---
That's not really the point I'm making but it's not just talking about loot it's clear terms.  If I as the person about to ninja don't say anything about loot I haven't made any agreements it doesn't matter what people assume or what agreements they make without me if I don't also agree to them.
---
No, the opposite. They confirmed the first 5% gives a whoooping +3% hit.
---
Actually, I mean field of view as in the amount that's visible in your screen vertically and horizontally, regardless of how zoomed in or out your camera is. A wide fov is like a wide angle lens, and a narrow fov is the opposite, and tends to give me a huge headache. Thank you for your answer!
---
We obtained the bop items as group as well. And I really need that vendor gold or enchanting mats. 
---
Man you guys disgust me honestly.
---
Where is the threshold? 5g? 20g? 100g?
---
While you paint the picture that it is established and widely agreed upon that to Need is to use and Greed is to sell, it's simply untrue, unless you're only referring to bind on pick up items. Bind on equip items SHOULD be needed by everyone because everyone can benefit from getting that item. If I'm playing a caster and Krol Blade, Edgemaster's Handguards, Alcor's Sunrazor drop only a class that can use it should need? That seems quite juvenile considering anyone gets a major benefit for receiving it, regardless of use. I'm sorry but pre-raid  BiS does not mean 4 people should suffer. 
---
"*You're proposing that in order to avoid ninjas, everyone should ninja.*"
---
Nope, proposing that everyone gets a fair shot at winning an item that has immense value to whomever wins. I'd expect every class to roll if a Freezing Band dropped. It just makes sense. Bind on Equip and Bind on Pickup items should not follow the same procedure. Just my opinion.
---
Wait... WHAT?!
---
Absolute bollocks. You're not "benefiting" from the item if you sell it. You're benefiting from gold. You're presenting something indirect as direct.
---
Molten core has BoE epics. Should I roll on the prophecy bracers as a warrior? Hurrdurr everyone benefits from it.
---
Deleted my comment because I don't want to give you so much shit :)   
---
Can post it again for everyone to see per your request  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/DreQo5a](https://imgur.com/a/DreQo5a)
---
The turds really surface in classic/vanilla. Scarcity brings out the worst in some people. What a piece of shit
---
GZ! You truly now have the BIS epic for life &lt;3
---
that absolutely does not hold up in the context of looting though does if haha, a firefighter is providing a service to other people by being in that position, a scummy raid leader who ninjas after telling everyone to greed is just fucking everyone else over
---
Thats cuz its 2019 and people have no patience, social skills, or attention span.
---
Agility is your main priority, getting crits for flurry is very important.
---
Everyone always says you should take a slow 2hander but honestly I keep much better pace with a good 1hander+shield.  Sure when you do windfury with that slow 2h you one-shot the mob, but when you don't you take a lot more damage leading to more downtime.  I always keep both available and swap as needed.
---
You'll be back in a month complaining how your rogue can't get geared because you can't get in groups.
---
Oh yes! I knew there was something - thanks for the clarification!
---
Yes, but why wouldn't that group agree to all roll need instead of all roll greed? Then that guy couldn't ninja the item and everyone would've gotten their fair chance.
---
I'm obviously not stating that the "greed" option is useless or anything, just that it shouldn't be used in cases where everyone agrees to roll on an item.
---
Sure.
---
Pretty clear if you ask me.
---
You can't play on US realms too and avoid people like him. Every streamer seems to have rolled on Faerlina. I've no idea why anyone would roll on the same server as that bunch.
---
Yea I remember him saying that. Screw that guild.
---
I'm pure vanilla. Haven't played since tbc
---
Make damn sure its what you want. For me personally, I save engineering for last, after I've made all my gold from other professions (such as skinning or enchanting).
---
And yeah, prices are at the lowest they ever will be. Or, actually, even now they're climbing. 2 weeks ago they were dirt cheap, now they're just kind of cheap. Soon they'll be not so cheap anymore.
---
Isn‘t that a guild run? The Ozzy guy is still in his guild. I bet my ass that they did Loot Council prior to Onyxia and it was always clear that Asmongold gets the helmet. But because he loves to provoke people (eapecially this subreddit) he pretends the item is gonna be rolled for, Mcconnell feeds into it a little („are you a big enough asshole bla bla“) and gives it to himself. He ALWAYS does stuff like this for the outrage, and its scripted every single time, but a lot of people fall for it and give him views.
---
Then make transmog available at max level only:)
---
Btw GMs wants you to report them
---
Im in one right now and they were having a meeting about raiding in a few weeks. I figured it'd just be a decent place to find groups while I level/get some preraid BiS, but I was on and figured with. Man, I wasn't expecting to raid with them but I had to mute it half way through. The optimism while having no idea what they were talking about made me want to scream.
---
Maybe I'm just a pessimist, but the amount of these guilds who aren't even raiding yet who think they're going to be a top guild is hilarious. I had some shit come up and had to level slower than I wanted. I know I'm not gunna be in a top guild... At least not anytime soon. So many delusional guilds recruiting right now.
---
It took me 1.5h for full BRD a few days ago.
---
Lmao are you sure about that big guy? I really get the impression that you just can't comprehend anyone's answers since all of your replies start with "But..." &amp; you ask why your shit is getting downvoted. Don't come at me sideways just because you don't know the game &amp; can't take sarcasm when someone calls you on saying some dumb shit lol, fucking clown. :•]
---
Im paying 25 for this
---
That’s true too. Almost all of our oxygen is made from algae living in the ocean. Kelp is a huge amount of it too. Very little oxygen comes from ground based plant life.
---
First mage or shadow priest you encounter will prove you wrong. First UBRS run with over half the party as rogues/warriors will prove you wrong.. And more
---
Or shaman
---
Name and shame all these little shits
---
You pay at every stop, it's an attempt to control inflation - just like rapair cost and training. Also, WoW is not RL. Sorry about that!
---
Could you ellaborate on proper shortcuts please? Also, I know of only the trogg miniboss with the caves, which is the second one?
---
&gt; If a clear cut agreement between the Master Looter and the other raid members was written in a public chat (such as raid or general) prior to the start of the raid, we will be enforcing that agreement in the event of a scam or a loot dispute.
---
Very clear. As per my first comment, this only applies to Master loot and if clear rules have been set at the start of an instance of when a new member joins they must be informed.
---
This does not apply to any other loot mode
---
Maybe we just have a different loot philosophy here. In pugs, every BoE should just be rolled between the entire raid. Thats fine and fair in my opinion.
---
Here’s a picture of you https://m.imgur.com/YOcdhBm
---
Actuelly it was. Alot of ppl didn't understand why they got banned for ninja looting so eventually blizzard did that to make it more clear.
---
These quests that take you all over the map are something I actually really like about Classic. It's obviously not a super complex system but if you read the quest descriptions you'll see how so many of the NPCs are connected in various ways, and it adds a bit of extra texture to the world that makes it feel more believable. The OP's post is a good example. Or earlier today I was in Ironforge and saw that an NPC had a quest for me, with a description that referenced a quest I had done for his colleague like 25 levels ago. Those details are awesome and give the game more of a proper RPG feel, but I guess it also does mean that a lot of quests become easily missed if you don't check everything out.
---
Yeah, they do that because once Dire Maul comes out, problems will arise. I remember that problem earlier.
---
Great, you linked it, now read it yourself.
---
Because it IS pretty clear, it's talking about a subset of what constitutes ninjaing and in the cases it's talking about it *is* scamming.
---
So please tell me how it applies to every other case of ninjaing?
---
no i see what you mean now, and yeah in a situation such as that one, where they were all trying to get on the same page and have the same chance at it, would have been much smarter to all agree to roll need
---
It’s worth winging it. If you fail then oh well, just keep going at it til you develop strats to keep aggro.
---
In their defense you probably should have gotten the hint it was an aoe run when 3/5 of the group was mages.
---
Question— if you’re horde and need to repair mid Gnomeregan, where do you go? What’s the nearest flight path you can use too?
---
Oh, I will go on vacation and enjoy my big house and my huge pensionplan, when I retire 30 years from now. But I do plan on sticking with my first and only wife, so you didnt quite hit the bullseye.
---
Go up to my top comment, unedited where I specifically called for 'Temp Ban'. I swear people's reading comprehension is going in the toilet
---
&gt;that absolutely does not hold up in the context of looting though does if haha
---
True, this case was obviously ninja-looting. No defending that one.
---
Nice, more content for asmon when he returns from blizzcon
---
Thats a non issue though, cuz 90%+ dosnt level thier lock picking anyway
---
I'm glad you're not leading any Molten Core near me with such an insane "philosophy."
---
1) this is the game that revolutionized the world as being the first newbie friendly MMORPG.
---
2) yes, its an rpg
---
3) it requires time commitment over a long period of time, but you can get max level with one hour a day, it just will take a few months. you earn bonus XP while offline. It is worth it if you enjoy it. I personally... might not play an MMO if I only had 8 hours a week, but everyone is different. You won't find an MMO better than WoW with that short of time, though, classic or retail.
---
4) It is both, depending on the server you pick. I recommend PvE for you, heavily. You will find yourself robbed of your fun time on PvP realms, with so little time available to play.
---
The worst thing is that the proper abbreviation of the final boss is EV as Edwin Vancleef.
---
Ineffective ideology, BoEs are an award to the entire group. It's only fair everyone who participated has an equal chance of winning something cool. If you think someone should absolutely have it, win it and trade it to them. I actually do this myself all the time. All my groups are happy to need BoEs and most will distribute them fairly to people who would equip. 
---
It's a social game and through painstaking lesson after lesson many consider this to be the only effective mitigation against rogue (no pun) party members. If you want your system so badly, implement it into your groups that YOU form and state the rules at the start.
---
It was a thing in vanilla. they only did that because ninja looters kept complaining about being banned.
---
You're pathetic.
---
Maybe he killed Skullsplitters and took their tusks?
---
I get you, i also like to keep talking in chat and messing with people but after 2 weeks of occasional  interaction back makes it a bit lonely.
---
It’s not dumb. An item that is worth 1g has not much immediate use for you. Therefore greed makes sense. An item worth 500g is useful because it gives you the resources to buy an upgrade. Maybe another BoE epic or expensive enchants.
---
The stupid thing is to keep thinking in a main spec mentality with rare BoE epics. They are BoE for a reason.
---
"he deserves a ban"
---
You say this, but I'm clearing SM armory in under 12 minutes.
---
None of the tanks in our groups complained about getting all the Herod gear in under an hour.
---
Don't worry about getting a mount at exactly 40. I had the money for it but didnt get it till 48 when I had well over 200g.   
---
Also, farming that 100g at mid 40s is much better and is best answered if you mentioned your class/professions.
---
At about 43-45 its great to go to the south west cave in Badlands and kill ogres. Lots of mageweave drops and about 3-5s raw drop.   
---
If you don't have bags reserved (hunter arrows/lock shards) and have loads of bag space then killing beasts about 2-3 levels below you works wonders. Reason I mentioned the cave above is because the spawns are great and very little competition. If you are competing with opposite faction in particular, that'll ruin your gold gain because there's high chance of pvp if you piss them off. At 40 I remember farming the basilisks at the very south tip of Shimering flats right above gadgetzan. They are about lvl 33 but lots of spawns and drop 2 types of greys (mid value though) Bag space fills fast.
---
And then thumbnail be him looking horrified but also very angry like screaming
---
That's only true if they don't rot
---
Pretty sure it's warr rogue mage then warlock and huntard dead last.age aren't number one till you get out of the fire immunity and can piggy back big dick deeps off of ignite. 
---
Though the private server goobers have found a gearing/talent build for enhance shaman that is between rogue and warriors dps wise. Gonna poss some people off but hey I like proving people wrong. And no I am not talking bout that bard shaman build either.
---
Playing horde I do not see alot of warlocks but holy shit do I see alot of gnome warlocks or alliance locks on general.
---
Can you still kill your own faction NPCs? People got so mad whenever you killed bankers and AH
---
Give an example of racism you’ve seen on his stream?
---
And people whining over someone selling bronze tubes for 20s.
---
the irl comment was a comparison, but thanks for the reminder
---
If you enjoy playing alliance, play it. You can counter OP abilities by having a friend or guildies support you. Or even group up with a random nearby individual.
---
Oh, so if everyone agrees that must be correct.
---
&gt;"All" means everyone that rolls, unless he specifically excludes himself. 
---
Not necessarily. "All" means a particular group, which can possibly exclude the authoritative entity.
---
Of course the guy is ninja-looting in this case, but it's fucking stupid to make up some rule that "All" always means that everyone in the group should greed when it's entirely context dependent.
---
I have found warrior tanks to be the worst so far. too many 2-hand wanna be tanks stinking up the joint.
---
It was a thing in vanilla. they only did that post because ninja looters kept complaining about being banned.
---
Anything related to Asmongold is going to be toxic.
---
A temporary ban is a ban and I was repeating myself. How you think I jump from temp tonperma just because I didn't include temp again. Cuz mobile and my thumbs. Shows again that you lack reading skills.
---
So you think real scammers deserve 0 consequences? Sounds like we know what you do
---
cloth + mage = no armour no stamina no base hp besides ice barrier that can get purged off.
---
shaman + wf + 2hr = lots of sudden physical damage
---
Yeah but when you don't proc, you slap your enemy with a wet fish.
---
Asmon literally had a rep as a ninja on KT
---
leveling guilds are one of the most fun parts of vanilla/classic
---
&gt;what about being underwater in general?
---
Bad idea if you're running away from a druid. 
---
By the time you get out of range of cat form track humanoids he'll pretty much know where you're trying to go and be able to pop aquatic form and get there ahead of you even while detouring around you.

Ozzy is playing fury and even confessed he only rolled for drama later on during the same stream. He's not a main tank, and any guild would've done the same because it is what makes sense. But since it's Asmongold, it suddenly becomes ninja looting ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Don't get me wrong, Asmongold still did some shady stuff on classic multiple times. And when people "surprisingly" decide to pass on some items he needs, it's obviously things that wouldn't happen if he wasn't a streamer. But in that particular case, no, it's not ninja looting.
---
shaman can't use swords unfortunately. but Hand of Justice is a trinket that gives you a 2% chance to do an extra attack like thrash blade does.
---
Imagine being a healer and needing help healing dungeons. Im a healer myself. the reason i would take a shadow priest over a mage is simply if i found one faster than i found a mage.
---
minimum lvl for mara and zf? lvl 45 human rogue not sure if i am ready yet. i just finished most of ulda quests
---
so stop watching him.
---
Unopened 30 days. I'm not sure about opened but won't be longer than that for sure. Losing sub does not extend time.
---
Healers will notice, but might not complain.
---
No, the logic makes sense. When a BoE drops, it benefits anyone whether they weild it or not. The gear upgrade vs gold profit is a subjective benefit, you CANNOT argue that the gear upgrade is more beneficial than 400g is to any of the other party members.
---
I might be wrong here but, wasn't his character a mage named Royson? Because from what I can see here this is a paladin called Roysun.
---
Feel free to correct me here, but this seems to be more of an incriminating thread than something else.
---
He states his opinion on his looks. He might be a dick, but no argument is being made and none attacked. Learn the difference.
---
where is this.. blue arrow?
---
Yes, I‘m aware of that. And I bet he‘d still be that way if he wasn‘t a big streamer. But since he‘s a streamer, toxic guy is just his persona, and provocation is what he does.
---
In fact, I only played vanilla. If you set upon an agreement before a run and ppl went against it. GMs fixed it, also in vanilla.
---
Why change your mind? You're right.
---
Anyone knows how's alliance on Ashbringer eu World pvp wise?
---
&gt; "Hurr I'm a weasel-looking asshole who makes reaction videos on YT and promotes shitty behavior"
---
For the sake of fairness, those aren't his channels and videos.
---
[His actual channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1kvvdjChB40wuzcynmgsCw) has been inactive for the past 11 months. He does upload vlogs once in a while to [his other channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ZackRawrr/featured) which does not feature his online persona.
---
Me too, but there's so much content across YT and podcasts that I don't understand watching someone who seems to mostly post reaction videos from someone trying to bank on a douchey persona. Even if you just want to watch something WoW related, there are tons of actually informative YT channels about lore and meta. I play in windowed mode and have other things playing almost all the time I'm soloing.
---
Or you orcs need to slim down and be like your female counterpart...pity the wolves
---
You can dual wield from Lvl 10 2nd sword needs to be "one-hand"  or "off hand"  in opposition to "main hand".  Check item text.
---
I refuse to zerg 60. As someone who doesn't want to raid because pressing 1 button rotations for hours doesn't seem even remotely fun there really isn't much to do after you get BIS dungeon gear in phase 1.
---
You realise clicking usually means clicking your hotkey right?
---
I think those players who say all need are arse holes. I get not wanting to be fucked out of a nice epic drop, but if someone actually needs it and some turd wins with a greedy need roll, I'd be furious.
---
Why, so he can be a boring human on a boring horse, like 75% of the alliance population? And asmons army?
---
I don't feel like the rogues are missing out on much if this is how you are
---
So I have a question for you, as someone who doesn't have a stake in any of this, as I don't play WoW.
---
If someone advocates for *A* and then later on removes that advocation and even starts arguing against it, do you really think that someone like that should still be held accountable for people following his earlier advice? What you call "*backpedaling*" could be a genuine change of heart and if so I don't think it logically follows to still hold him accountable for things he no longer believes are good. If he still advocates for Ninja-looting now, then fuck him, but your comment made it sound like he no longer does that and if so, I am curious how you can justify blaming him for past actions he no longer agrees with.
---
Holy shit what a fucking moron you are. Someone thinks scamming people deserves punishment and your response is for THEM to grow up? Are you 12 or just really stupid? You shouldn't deceive people and take advantage of them. If you do so you are a piece of shit person. 
---
&gt;Just like in real life it's your own fault for falling for the scam, learn from it and move on.
---
You've got to be a fucking child because actually in the "real world" scamming people is illegal and results in punishment if caught. What "real world" do you live in where people are free to scam others and when caught red handed everyone shames the victim for falling for it and the law is unable to do anything? 
---
"Don't want to play with toxic pieces of dishonest shit who will scam you? TOUGH! Dont play! This game is only for garbage people who want to be taken advantage of by other garbage people, like me! Grow up babies!"
---
You are a moron and a piece of shit.
---
I'm just disappointed because I wanted to see his mental breakdown on video.
---
Just went over the comment chain and figured out you're not the same guy that posted the video. 
---
I don't really care enough about asmon or some essay he wrote to invest 10-20 minutes into reading that, video of a breakdown is more interesting.
---
Crippling poison is essential. You're a melee class. If they are running away, you can't hit them. And believe me, people will kite you without crippling poison. Its your counter to hunters, mages, warriors, etc. Warriors, you slow 'em and bleed 'em out.
---
Ah sorry! thought you just used the wrong word. 
---
I don't think FoV affects 3rd person view much, if at all and it's unlikely you play in 1st person so probably wouldn't worry about it too much. So to answer our question, I'd imagine the fov is the same as live.
---
Duke Hydraxis, all the way in the lower right corner. Hung out and watched TV and dicked around on my phone for a few hours last night while my guild ran MC just so I could be in place to summon the dousers when they needed it. Was a lot of good will.
---
I feeel that. rerolling warrior as we speak..
---
Arguing bullshit semantics like this is just as bad as ninjaing to me
---
helpful list's you have here thank you . :)   
---
but how do you get "Sash of the Windreaver" before phase 3 it a drop from  Elemental Invasions, which was added in patch 1.14.0.  
---
and  "Helm of Latent Power" is a quest rewared for  **The Darkreaver Menace**  which is also added in patch 1.14.0. and they changed the reward to "Skyfury Helm", so you may never get "Helm of Latent Power" in classic. please correct me if i am wrong.   
---
You seems like you good  grasp over which items is good, whould it be possblie for you to give a alternativ to pre-raid BiS head and belt. ?
---
in the mean time what to expect from a guy that call himself JeanPaulVandamme on reddit in an answer about roleplaying ..
---
Not this.
---
Loot wise, Warriors are the new hunters.
---
Wtf is a pepega?
---
Update: I made it over without a mount :) uploading the video today or tomorrow
---
There is a reason why Blizzard abolished it. People abuse the system by needing when they should greed. So people need to counterabuse by just needing it as well.
---
Has anyone ever grouped with a rando hunter that turned out to not be terrible at their class and wow in general?  I’ve got a 60’paladin and 40 mage so far on classic and I never have.
---
Hope Blizzard intervenes, let it be a warning to those who take advantage over decent people who play fair.
---
Lol, you really brought up the BoP vendoring argument? Fine, for the sake of going to your level, I would gladly offer to pay the vendor price for the BoP to the douchebag who wants to vendor it over me using it as an actual upgrade. So do a /roll outside, winner of that gets paid the vendor value by the person who eventually gets it. Now are you on the same page as the rest of us rolling need on that epic BoE?
---
I was leveling as hemo in badlands to try it out, and I will never forget the ball ache these rock elemental quest chains were with them being immune to not only bleed but poison as well.
---
I can understand that. Should've said that 4 comments ago instead of calling me a liar, my dude. :)
---
Oh that’s a shame
---
Don't be salty. You get that sword easily while farming princess anyways. I'm not worrying about that. Hypnotic Blade is also nice and even better for dots when your not spamming shadowbolt. (pvp, solo pve/drain tanking/farming)
---
"I don't see the yellow part".
---
"Exactly".
---
"Everyone needs instead of greed on my server. Fuck fuck fuck. Nothing wrong here at all."
---
Unfortunately I've learned to be cautious around others myself due to some bad experiences, and tend to wait to see if most are honest before rolling myself.
---
My primary thought regarding epics was that perhaps the general community saw epics as BOTH equippable items AND general cash makers which might make them fair game for all (so that even if you can't use it, its value cash-wise to you would qualify as need). I originally disagreed with this mentality, but I've seen it so often that now I'm wondering if perhaps THIS is the norm.
---
Depends how you play in my opinion. If you’re trying to absolutely maximize your capabilities then yes, you need to be an advanced player. But if you are unskilled and take it easy, you can still get by without issues. The class is well designed in that regard.
---
Side note - what addon is the dmg/healing done on the right there?
---
yeah it looks like your standing in the pond and your head is above water.
---
This right here.  At no point on the journey from 1-60 did I need to straight up grind mobs for reasons not related to a quest.  Sure, there were periods I did a lot of globetrotting for quest objectives or bouncing between zones, but at no time was my log empty.  Most of the time I had to decide which quests to drop and pick up later because my log was usually full; at least one quest I dropped and started again three times.  And there's almost always people willing to team up, especially for elite quests.
---
if I wanted to throw fucking fireballs around for big crit damage I'd have played a fucking mage.
---
It was already unchecked. The checkbox doesnt seem to function.
---
that's not true at all. Blizzard will only intervene when the loot mode is master loot and loot rules stated in the advertisement for the group or at the beginning of the instance in a publicly readable channel such as /raid or /general.
---
God damn, you're strapped for friends if youre that desperate to keep liars and thieves around.
---
I agree with what you say and it makes the skilled hunterplayers way beyond the scrubs, where as this new meta for mages is pull everything on purpose and then get salty when it doesn’t work the way they think it should because they have watched a group on twitch that have practiced the aoe grind so the group knows what to expect as apposed to the pug group with the “Leroy” mage trying to be a hero and top the FPS meters
---
He put it down for 420 69 69.
---
Is this a joke?
---
Calling it a ninja doesn't make it a ninja. It's counter-ninjaing really.  Also I'm dubious of your "very good experience". Do you think master looting is ninjaing? If not, why not just set master looter for every group?
---
Questing as holy impossible? I'd wager you are doing something wrong since it's actually quite strong. Go mostly holy but take spirit tap and you'll destroy solo questing AND world pvp 1v1s. Unkillable, strong damage and spirit tap is fantastic. I quested 45-58 as holy without spirit tap and still had a blast.
---
It just makes everybody the attempted ninja.
---
That isnt a solution.
---
Thanks, I'm currently only level 22 with my rogue so I've still only got my sights set on WC (SFK if I'm feeling ambitious), but back during vanilla this was certainly a concern. I never know whether to broach this subject before a run as I'm concerned that it'll bring up hostilities in a party for something that might not happen.
---
GPS?  Gnomes Per Second?
---
It’s a game so you should be having fun playing it.
---
If that’s not the case you should probably just take a break. There is no need for you to stress yourself over a game. 
---
I don’t think you’ll fall to far behind given that old content doesn’t become irrelevant in classic.
---
you are dumb as a brick.
---
You know nothing of the subject, you couldn't care in any way and you don't play the game. Sooo what are you doing here again?
---
He doesn't regret ninjalooting in anyway. He regrets bad pr.
---
Why should he be made an outcast? According to your other comment it was the victims fault for being so stupid to roll greed when told "all greed." They should have just lied and rolled need so they didn't fall victim to this clever scam right? Remember, "Just like in real life it's your own fault for falling for the scam, learn from it and move on."
---
So i should mix up some dps gear with what i have then right?
---
But you say you gank as well. Which is okay it is a PvP server. Doesnt make it any less if a dick move
---
You can gouge for combo &gt; blind &gt; restealth&gt; reset
---
Look for Shadow Damage bracers. Other suggestions from tailors are good as well, but there are not any strong caster bracers. 
---
A lvl 35 green of shadow damage will leave you set until 60.
---
Lmao the fuck
---
Tauren female hunter eh - literally the rarest class race combo in classic
---
Twitch has runescape 3 and oldschool runescape separated
---
Hahaha. I love that half-ass water elemental swipe to end it. For the Horde my friend!
---
It was you I was replying too
---
The double question mark &amp; the multiple exclamation marks is often a red flag. What a goofy lad
---
Got that on my first kill suprisingly
---
Go ahead and tell me what the icon for the Greed roll is.
---
I'll wait.
---
If you want it to sell, you roll Greed.
---
If you need it to wear, you roll Need.
---
If you're going to sell it and Need-roll it away from people that will equip it instead, you're garbage unless the group agreed to those rules beforehand.
---
Fuck your mount.
---
I don't get why he wanted to finish you with a FB when he could just have blasted you...
---
Before trinket comes out if vs someone who cant remove poisons.
---
Cheapshot, sinister, blind, restealth, cheapshot, kidney, adrenaline rush, sinister until evis will kill.
---
What a retard at least use a bank alt... Like me
---
I used to be of the mind that an upgrade is always a need item, but I've so often seen the mentality of others that epics are a source of cash and fair game for all that it made me wonder what would be the right thing to do here. I certainly agree that folks should only roll need on an upgrade, and if/when I see the sort of behavior of folks who want all need on such an item I keep a wary eye of joining up with them again. Upgrading gear is always a struggle (heck, my current character has gear that's mostly about 10 levels below his level).

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/datblf/for_all_my_warlocks_out_there/). 
---
Dude, what?
---
For years ninja-looting was completely fair game. The primary source of great realm-forum drama was when some guild running FFA got all their Garr or domo shit taken (domo's chest didn't follow loot rules either, so it was always FFA and you'd have raidleaders screaming at anyone getting near the chest because it was a first come first serve deal). This was in a time when barely any guilds could even summon Rag, mind you. That was valuable stuff and you did not get it back. Videos of people disenchanting high-end loot were everywhere.
---
Hell, if someone offered to enchant your stuff, and they logged off after you traded them the materials, Blizzard's default response was to suck it up and be smarter about who you trusted.
---
Not sure where you got the idea that people always got banned for ninja looting.
---
Isn't that their guild rules? if in pugs ninja good items to make their guild better.
---
Heyyyyy there it is!
---
I was thinking about rolling a gnome rogue on a horde-dominated pvp server and name them "Ungankable" but I'm not sure if I have the willpower for it
---
Is there some place to get a price check on rare items for auctioning? I.e. items that are rare enough that you likely have no add on data.
---
I would.
---
Details
---
ok almost everything ive seen about asmongold in the past 3 years now is just linked to shit. this guy needs to just do what he said and just fucking quit wow dude
---
banable
---
I don't believe you, unless you were above the appropriate level
---
One of these addons is making me unable to shift-click quests to link in chat, forced to type them out, do you know which? /u/Chamallow81
---
They slowly auto attack you to death while they have an x number of health bars.
---
I feel the same way with cleave and whirlwind.
---
Or he watched one too many streams trying to set up a shatter combo but didnt know how to gauge the melee range. A good mage can skirt around a melee's melee range for days, a bad one... not so much.
---
If the main healer is a druid then I'd def take a shadow priest over another caster, or a ret pally. One rez on what, a 30 min cooldown? Wtf is that garbage.
---
Oh shit, am I supposed to hit greed or need? I thought hitting greed was bad due to the negative connotation associated with the word
---
May I ask what Brewfest news?
---
Well I mean it’s actually a solid server, I’ve met a lot of genuine people on Faerlina so far who’ve helped me a bunch.
---
If I make groups I make it clear everyone should roll for boe, chests etc. If people sign up for that then you're good to go and you avoid drama like often posted here on reddit.
---
How much does need improve your odds?
---
When you're talking 'this will fund most of if not a whole epic mount' sums of money, the dynamics change quite a bit from a regular bop item that you can vendor for 2g.
---
Sure, for regular items the normal loot mechanic usually works fine, but the more you increase the value of the item, the more greedy and susceptible to ninja looting people become.
---
The top post is the reason why I'll always need on a BoE epic, regardless of what other people say. If it's a big upgrade for someone else, sure, they can have it as long as they equip it in front of the group.
---
I’ll boost friends, but everyone else can fuck right off.
---
Liuuuuuuu
---
*see a post from /r/classicwow hitting /all*
---
*Leaves a single comment on the post that takes less than 30 seconds to write*
---
*Is now a pathetic no life*
---
Get ubrs key while leveling, create your own groups.
---
If the item is sold, usually only a warning or short-term ban will given to the offender. The support staff’s preferred solution likely wouldn’t be on that could present more issues down the line (i.e. another ticket for a lost item). I don’t have a personal experience with something exactly like this, but I’ve always received/kept lost or removed items that I ticketed.
---
Indeed! Bunch of 30 year olds reliving the past. Myself jncluded. Little to no drama involved if you can see things in perspective.
---
Log out and have a character outside the dungeon reset it.
---
Depending on the emissary you can make 3x that in about 10 minutes
---
It's the same idea behind it. You value the gold over giving it to someone who improves with it. So why shouldn't I value my gold more than the item which improves you? Needing on every item gives you quite a good amount of gold with enchanting mats after every run. Probably even more than waiting to ninja boe epics.
---
Yeah but you're gonna have a bunch of power leveled ADHD mages pulling everything in every PvE aspect because they have done lvl 13-60 through spell cleave and can't wait 16 seconds to prep for raids etc Lmao
---
The buyer is considered innocent and will keep it. The ninja will lose the gold and get a ban.
---
Yeah
---
You should be wearing at least boots for movespeed.
---
There’s a very obvious choice here and it’s not the sword
---
I do lot of dungeons, more then questing last few levels, if mage trade you drink give them healthstone, just cause you can.
---
I use imp in dungeons cause of blood pact where it gives 17 stamina at lvl 28, which is nice
---
Preach.
---
Windfury: 15% of the time, it works every time.
---
I recommend using Quartz, you get more information from it and can customize the size and appearance of your cast bar.
---
Isn't the procc fucking with debuff slots ?
---
Read stories about ppl getting kicked out of raids because they had weapons with debuff procs
---
Thanks friend, clean ui.
---
&gt; rather there is no legitimate situation in which you need a tradable ite
---
bollocks
---
&gt;  so what's the harm?
---
u screw over the ppl that aren't assholes and use the default need before greed loot rules.
---
contest winners
---
Sure but he’s right - warlocks are not as good as mages at aoe spellcleaving.
---
Taking your replies into account I dont think you ever was in MC. So no need to worry about such trivial things you would never partake in.
---
Quite common practice to all need on BOE with a market value. Needing a BOE because you want to equip it and having everyone else greed, to my experience, only happens in guild/friend runs.
---
To say that it is the norm is ludicrous.
---
I doubt it. That person didnt do anything wrong nor has any idea what happened. I know they will remove items that shouldn't exist but that's a different case. They would probably take that gold from him.
---
I make 50-100g a day just casually farming herbs.
---
You’re wrong and the above post is not an exaggeration.
---
The most.conclusive way to spot a psycopath is to discover them saying that the people they hurt deserved it, because they allowed it to happen.
---
Sure, sure. Gloves are anywhere between 500 and 1000G (or $300-$500) and you'd pass on them to a random person who pinky promises they just want to equip them.
---
Being a contrarian must be fun.
---
Technically everything can finance your epic mount or another BoE epic.
---
Absolutely can't wait for the "asmongold reacts to" video /s
---
You are over exaggerating. He listed out his points in a really well formatted way and got his opinions on twitch chat and the whole dark souls phase. If you think having thousands of people spamming you rude shit every single day for hours on end isn't at least in some way infuriating, I can't help you.
---
Spill over reputation.
---
What an idiot, just mail it to you bank alt and auction it with his name. This scammers are getting rusty.
---
Tbh you can sell gold like 20g for 15 $ on the web currently. So someone might get rich from this kind of disgusting behaviour.
---
http://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
No, I'm saying the person who can use them should be the one getting them. The person who needed them is clearly in the wrong.
---
Thick. As. Pigskin.
---
Think you'll find very few people agreeing with you - BoEs aren't like BoPs, you don't get to take an epic mount away from the other 4 people in your party cos you pinky promise to equip the item.
---
No but logically - if the point is you decide to unanimously be fair and roll greed for it and nobody does want to equip it - why not 'all need' because then you're not opening up the chance for someone to ninja if you all greed.
---
Support for HotS being collapsed is a part of why their numbers were so good. They let go like 15% of their staff to get those numbers.
---
Ultimately Classic seems just like that - short term profit at the cost of long term stability. Blizzard released a second MMO which will compete with their existing MMO. In the long run, after the hype of classic has worn off I think both games will be worse as a result of the other taking players away.
---
Ego has nothing to do with this, it's all about having good earnings calls.
---
Hard to do if everyone you know plays on a pvp server. Either you play on a server no one else does, or you have to endure scum shit like this. But well... part of the online game expierence: people = shit
---
So? It's still gear you need that drops from a dungeon you are doing.

I like my reddit name as well thanks a lot :)

I'm not telling the OP that it's how it should be, I'm telling him it's how it is. 
---
You can go on a report spree all you want trying to force people to behave the way you think they should, you're going to waste your time.
---
Back the the original question : OP you should choose a RP appropriate name (in case blizz decides to enforce the rule someday) and you shouldnt interfere with people rp'ing. Besides that it's exactly like a normal server, everyone spams the lfm channel and general channels like they would in a normal server. So don't hesitate and join the fun :)
---
BoEs have always been that in vanilla and the same in classic. Could be a standard difference on US and EU.
---
Im part of the "all need" community. It just ensures people have a fair chance at the epic and it avoides problems with one person trolling and clicking need. My second reason is say for an example the epic dropped is worth 500g is it fair for that one person to get it as an upgrade that they would probably replace at lvl 60. When anyone in the party can sell that on the market and and buy multiple upgrades. The only exception i would see if its BiS for lvl 60.
---
&gt; bollocks
---
Name 1.
---
&gt; u screw over the ppl that aren't assholes and use the DEFAULT need before greed loot rules.
---
And they will adapt quickly, however applying the "DEFAULT", as you call it, just sets them up to have items ninjaed from them over and over by people thinking they're entitled to the loot for *reasons*
---
It's not like retail where you get perks for being in-guild. In fact, you have that name attached to you and people will blindly judge you based on that, which could damage your rep. Ultimately, it's your choice, but I don't see any downside to rolling solo while you LFGuild.
---
Paladins had a different mechanicaly, but very similar in effect Reckoning. Reckbombs were devastating when charged.
---
Thanks for the blog update. Looking forward to more of them!
---
To the front page!
---
Ive made better friendships with people on the opposite faction in contested zones than some of the people ove been in guilds with...
---
Asking for alliance and horde balance is reasonable, and is the biggest issue being raised here. If you can't see that then you're missing the whole point, all the other issues of ganking and being corpse camped go away if factions are even close to being balanced.
---
Perhaps in pure literal terms and if Blizzard were bound to laws this would be true - but the fabulous thing about Blizzard being jury, judge and executioner on game disputes is they can look at context and go yeah this dude ninja’d, thats a scam, seeya later. There arent any loopholes a scammer can point to that Blizzard then is bound to throw up their hands at and go aw shucks guess we cant do anything - they decide whatever action they want regardless
---
And above a certain number of targets battle shout spam is higher tps than tab swiping. Warriors are superior aoe tanks despite what most people assume.

I need silk, mageweave and runecloth in pretty much unlimited quantities, are you willing to give me all the cloth that drops in the dungeon? If not, what's the difference?
---
Minimum 300g. People may not be ready to soend thst yet but its just going to go up and up. Grats om the snag!

Most streamers aren't streaming to tens of thousands of people telling them how to play their game. Fuck off if you think it's some easy job.

Dont load up a spell and then an instant cast damage ability as the tank is half way through his first auto... and then run away from the tank jumping when the mob aggros you
---
&gt; He is the ultimate representative of "Generation Me me me!"
---
Seems to me like he's more of a representative of "Generation got to sell this persona". He'd definitely not be the first to have an online persona that doesn't carry over to his interactions with people outside the game. Boring people hardly get viewers.
---
Try the addon gnome sequencer. Dunno if it works in classic but with that u Can setup a Macro to fire all the spells u Like when they r of cd.

dummy here but if it takes 30 gromsblood to 1 blacklotus shouldnt the gromsblood be way more valuable?
---
Some people have other things they need to do in game than running around picking flowers all day.
---
Yeah sure. I don't need it. If there's a tailor that needs cloth and I don't need it they can fucken have it. If there's mining nodes then the miner gets to use them.
---
Frostbrand only has a chance to proc ( like 5% more than windfury? ).  It's honestly not even useful for applying a slow since there's no consistency.
---
Not every turtle has meat. Some have two meats though.
---
Are you someone who drives through the red lights, too?
---
No, this not "acceptable" it is forbidden by Blizzards rules, your pov is irrelevant.
---
Until I suddenly see one of my shots go thru my shoulder thru the wall in almost an 90' angle with the other two.... Awareness up to a certain level 😉
---
I dont think he is toxic, hes definitely retarded at times, but I dont get what this subreddits obsession is with him. Its literally 1 streamer I see posts on here every other day about. Like hes no scummy then other scum that play or have played the game. I dont get what makes him special to warrant all the hate or attention. In fact one can argue the people who constantly say if you watch asmon you're a retard or are toxic are probably also toxic. Just let 1 streamer do his thing  and everyone else do theirs. Lifes too short to worry about 1 mans actions in a vidya game and sometimes lack thereof.
---
Verigans fist has more then 10 topend damage and way more dps, the str and agi is negligent to be honest. Seal of command goes of weapon damage.
---
Well he’s made about 500 gold off it in a few day. What he tells me is that the kill takes about 5-6 min so i dunno, probably decently efficient.
---
As he said and you were apparently unable to comprehend, both a temporary ban and a permanent ban are, in fact, both "bans." You assumed he meant permanent despite him never saying so and your instance that he meant "permanent ban" when he said "ban", which logically could mean either, and clarified "temporary ban" is pathetic and revealing.
---
Didn’t asmongold do a molten core run where he overrode a loot role to give McConnell an item?
---
Southshore and Arathi disagree
---
It's very accessible. Mainly a UI improvement, the advanced stuff is hidden in a console thingy.
---
I downloaded Guidelime, and I've put the Sevenleaves folder in my addon folders aswell, but it wont actually show up in the "Guides" ingame? anyone might know why?
---
I've tried putting the folder in both /interface/AddOns, and I've tried putting it in AddOns/Guidelime/DemoGuides
---
$95 well you got scammed
---
case by case looting is just a recipe for mistakes. Need if you plan to equip, greed to sell. Check before needing if it is for an offspec. This applies to boes and trash drops as well. The reason everyone needing on things such as patterns that no one needs, bags, trade goods or rep items DOESNT work is because it is different than the way people treat gear, so there’s gonna be people greed rolling out of habit on things they won’t equip and missing out when the rest of the group needs. It seems simple to say “yeah only need for /these/ items” but when the list gets to long people fuck it up so most of us just all greed. If you hit need on something to sell it, when you can clearly see 3 other people already greeded they aren’t “suckers”, you’re a dick. 
---
That’s it.
---
Who are you putting in their place?
---
You're pathetic if you think that hating on streamers puts you above other people, or that I'm a moron for calling you out for your over exaggeration. Streamers are perfectly welcome to write out their opinions and it's bullshit for you to act like he's having a breakdown, or that there's something wrong with that.

\[How to Access the Black Forge at a Low Level?\]
---
I am just about to ding 50, and I wanted to know if it was possible to reach the Black Forge at my level.  I have the enchanting level and materials to make the Smoking Heart of the Mountain, but I need the Black Forge to make it.  As a druid, I can stealth with the detection range equivalent to a level 55 (50+5).  Are there any tricks that might make it possible for me to reach the Black Forge?
---
He musta been tanking a pub....  zen only goes so far.
---
Because he’s reacting... that’s way better than a video being 10 minutes and a react video to it being 11 minutes.
---
Yes! Definitely, however I still need to pick one for my main character
---
Worked thank you
---
It's the difference between comparing one tree through a 24 hr period and a whole forest over many years. They're both right but they are talking about much different scales of time.
---
Care to come up with an example of a person who needs a tradable item?
---
Gud tips, thx
---
this comment made my day
---
Definitely.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Either you have an IQ of 2 or are a seasoned conspiracy theorist, because that is all 100% cut and dry
---
It probably lies within your inability to detect satire.
---
And this is exactly why I dont pug. Grown men acting like 10 year olds.
---
I just check ah A LOT
---
Not necessarily, it's context-dependent.
---
Then learn what threat is, don't take aggro from the tank, and you won't die. I know, extremely hard concept to grasp.
---
How is He causing harm when Not going dwarf priest? Your Flair is Hunter man. Just suck it up and reroll mage dude wtf. Youre literally harming groups by Not being a mage/warri/priest.
---
Unless you are a full guild group you should nearly always need on Boe or recipes, that way you won't have this happen and you can always trade the item if you want to give it to someone who actually needed it.
---
Besides the ones who run into 4 elite before the tank has aggro and spam hellfire.
---
Everyone NEEDS hundreds of gold. Not everyone needs one epic worth hundreds of gold. It's more fair that everyone gets a shot at a random drop that can be sold at AH.
---
I mean there’s a difference he doesn’t react that much he just stops the video half the time and chats nonsense
---
Each guide has its own serperate addon listing in the addons menu.  Can you find it in the addons list (seperate to Guidelime)?
---
That's completely retarded, there are BoE epics which are upgrades.
---
Go farm the swamp jaguars in swamp of sorrows.
---
Oh dear OP I can't believe you didn't know that! Definitely a ninja!
---
/s
---
He's a moron, don't worry. The dagger and OH are probably better for dps but getting them both can be very difficult. An upgrade is an upgrade, spirit is still useful to you too.
---
Can't spell fungus without US (and yes I know algae isn't fungus, just go with it).
---
I feel sad for you
---
Maybe you should just blacklist him along with the top 4 guilds on horde?
---
&gt; one of my guildies payed him gold to conjure her some water
---
What? No. That guy gets kicked from my group. Do NOT tolerate people like this, it only emboldens them. 
---
They need to get pushback again and again until they realize that their shit just doesn't work, it's people being quiet and tolerating them that gives them power. 
---
Like I would seriously invite another DPS then AFK for 15 mins while they get there than let a mage charge water to people in my group, and if he's the leader, he can find another tank.
---
Why do you have more need on a shitload of gold than others? You don't have to buy it this way which leads to you saving a lot of gold.
---
dae spell cleave bad
---
I’m not understanding, you are the rogue that needed on the dagger as well?
---
That's very much a mage item too, the spirit is very valuable for leveling.
---
Or you are like me and level one of every class to thirty to figure out which toon I like.
---
Report him, I think this is a clear ninja right? Surely blizz can enforce this?
---
Youre the stupidest person Ive encountered in quite some time. Congratulations!!🎊🍾🎉
---
Some real gatekeeping folks in these comments. I gladly take non-intrusive non-RP folks over the jumpy annoying meme-roleplayers. You simply cannot tell others what to do if they are keeping to themselves and within the rules. Hell, if you bully these non-interacting people off the server you also destroy any chance they had to be motivated to join in in the future. Stop the elitist shitshow. Report the xLegolasx players and leave it at that.
---
&gt; How is He causing harm when Not going dwarf priest? 
---
He is intentionally increasing the difficulty of the dungeon for no reason at all.
---
&gt; Youre literally harming groups by Not being a mage/warri/priest.
---
Every class is needed.
---
imagine being a SHAMAN and almost losing this hard to a mage who is clearly a nub :O
---
It makes sense. Do/hour increase as you level, so the XP halfway is not the time halfway.
---
There's been a few, if you're looking through this thread. I wasn't talking about you, but the fact that you're so defensive about that is telling enough.
---
Anyway, no. Doing something no one else is doing is strange by definition. He couldn't handle people being toxic, despite the fact that he's never done anything to curb toxicity in his chat, and instead of doing something about it, which he has the power to do, he whines on reddit. That's strange. That's also what I'd call a freakout.
---
No it is not you greedy fuck. You take away the chance for someone who needs it for an upgrade just for the sake of some gold.
---
If nobody in the party actually needs it, then yeah all roll need.
---
Why haven't they bought them then?
---
[Naw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXF8MIG_HQI)
---
Best written quest chain in the game imho.  That whole little chain and surrounding quests are great.
---
Oh wow what do you know, Asmon and his community is cancer. BREAKING NEWS MORE AT 10.
---
Some people will never learn, it’s always your fault for not needing you dunce.
---
Thats why you always need on boe blues and purples, always.
---
Lol, people make mistakes, patrols are missed or overlooked, pugs are completely random skill levels. You're assuming that everyone is perfect and should never die in dungeon runs.
---
Because they are expensive and they can't afford it. Are you incapable of grasping that fact?
---
You don't understand what it means either. He's not arguing anything, he's insulting him outside of an argument, making it just an insult. Nice job trying to look smart though
---
Yes, I do see the default ones, but I don't see the one i manually added
---
What I want to know is why does my wolf only leave his front paw prints in the snow?
---
I initially rolled RP-PVP (Deviate Delight) but was turned off by the amount of politics and trolling in global channels. It was on horde though
---
This is such a dumb comment. It's literally an emote for a reason. To show your distaste and hatred for an opposing faction usually. Why shouldn't it be used?
---
Even with lootmaster, if they clearly state in chat that nothing is locked and then ninja an item, you can open a ticket.
---
If they say nothing and ninja an item, that’s not an offense because it’s lootmaster and they can decide to give loot how they want. So if you ever decide to join a lootmaster raid, then make them say the loot rules in chat. Blizzard holds players accountable to that.
---
He's whining on HIS subreddit?? How can you actually be upset about someone putting their opinion on their own subreddit?
---
I want to roll with this SM Ruin specc and use it for everything I do: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/2500250512201005--50500251020001
---
I hit all the important stuff of course but I'm curious what other people think of 2 points in imp lash of pain. Reason for that is I use succ for pvp and solo pve/drain tanking/farming and could use the extra dps. Cata seems real bad I gathered. imp firebolt makes imp go oom fast and imp is mainly used in 5 man.
---
Of course it does, but nowhere near the level of the streamer servers especially if you're in a streamer guild. Seeing McConnell and Asmongold get 90% of the loot just shows anyone there raiding is a fool wasting their time.
---
The average dps player goes balls to the wall 3 nanoseconds into the pull, and forces me to heal the unnecesssary damage they take because they can't seem to wait for 1 sunder to make sure this all doesn't happen. I don't think you are any different based on your attitude here.
---
SHAME
---
There's another hidden roll in the event of a tie. It just doesn't show it.
---
imo drain tanking is the best spec to level with. you can solo elites and you have an infinite supply of health and mana. the downtime between pulls is almost minimal. it’s pure aff and god i love it
---
Can you hear that? That's the GM's weeping over the escalating number of petty complaints.
---
So, is there any addon that will allow me to add scumbags like this to a "warning list" so I get warned when such person joins my party etc?
---
You don't *Need* **any** bind on equip item to progress. Edgemaster's Handguards are a BiS for fury warriors up to Naxx. There were, and will be in classic, plenty of fury warriors unwilling/unable to pay for them. These same fury warriors will still be raiding MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 &amp; 40, and Naxx. The way people are unable to grasp that BoP and BoE items have incredibly different values is incredulous. 
---
Progression is important, but saying an item that is marginally better than another negates 4 other players chance to benefit from the sale, comes across as extremely entitled.
---
Bnet news would be empty if they separated the versions, there is no upcoming stuff except for the rare phase increment. All events are community made.
---
Better to have relevant news to WoW than nothing at all.
---
Always all need
---
If you're like that all the time there's a pretty good chance that's just who you are.
---
&gt;cheap shot

---
that's about 25 seconds of CC while dealing damage for maybe 18 seconds of it. You need to resist a stun in order to beat the rogue.
---
He did it with AOE too.
---
Are you full of shit or just feel targeted?
---
Twitch’s core demographic consists of 81.5% male users, 55% of which are 18-49 year-olds. 
---
https://mediakix.com/blog/top-twitch-statistics-live-streaming-game-platform/
---
100% manchildren.
---
Then that means either the guide is broken or the file structure is broken (as long as you definitely put it directly in the root addons folder like i think you implied and not in the addons/guidelime folder).
---
Shouldn’t have to drink too much with spirit tap. Depending on your level, mind blast SWP and mind flay into wand spam should be very sustainable leveling while being relatively quick. Maybe an extra mind flay or if you’re lower leveled, just holy fire mind blast SWP instead.
---
Lol, by your statement half of the community are greedy fucks because this is a split topic that will never be settled. Why you getting so worked up over it calling me a greedy fuck, I was perfectly civil in my response.
---
So they need because they want money. Good thing we agree that there's only greedy need rolls then.
---
I love it. Keep it coming. Fucking hate privileged wow players who think they can do what they want. Ban em all please
---
Lol no, you can't ban people for ninja looting, what world do you live in?
---
It's wrong, but it's not breaking any ToS.
---
I can't speak for the ninja looters, but need is there for what it's name suggests. You Need the item.
---
I can't help it if people think they should need on every single item that they can, that's their choice but I won't group with players like that.
---
That's a lot of words to let us know you don't understand etiquette or decency
---
dreamweave, shadowweave, or the mageweave stuff is all great. i’ve got pieces from everything equipped currently
---
You probably shouldn’t of phrased the post as a question then. If a high value item no one needs drops and it’s going to be sold and someone says “all need” before anyone rolls it is obviously less risky than saying “all greed”. The issue is someone can greed before this rule is put in place if the time isn’t expected, someone could need the item (pattern, rare armour, w/e). If the question is “why would a group all greed on an item they are farming that they all beforehand agreed to sell” the answer is I don’t know. That seems like they are opening themselves up to being ninja’d for no reason. If the question is “why do people in pugs roll greed on high value items” well that’s been answered 40 times already.
---
Found a bad person in classic? BFA's fault!
---
Maybe if the folder has "-master" at the end of it you could try deleting that part of the folder name, I noticed some other non-Guidelime addons had that problem.
---
I do sympathise with the angry little man, all that spirit is looking pretty good. But he's definitely an idiot.
---
I'm sure you've complained in your own home. You own the home, does it change the fact that you're complaining? You've probably complained that your car is running funny or your dog crapped on the carpet, whatever it is. Ownership of the platform doesn't change the fact that it's whining, and doesn't solve anything. Action is what solves problems, action that he would instead forego so he can continue to whine about the problem.
---
He didn't ask her to pay him, she just did. He was just being a little bitch about the pulls. But, totally agreed. We shoulda kicked and replaced.
---
Thank you for providing all relevant information. Royson is absolutely scamming the fuck out of these guys, this should be reported to a GM. They will act because you have pure evidence and Royson is so clearly in the wrong that I don't think he can get away with it. Blizzard almost has to give him a ban because the community knows and would become so distrustful that it would be harmful to blizzards rep.
---
He stops the video and reacts to what has been said, then continues, stops and reacts to what has been said. He basically dissects videos and reacts to each topic individually.
---
&gt; This proposed "safe way" is a paradox. You're proposing that in order to avoid ninjas, everyone should ninja.
---
Yes. That's a fundamental premise of basic game theory. It isn't a paradox, it's the only winning and rational strategy if there's any chance at all of someone not upholding their part of the agreement and acting completely selfishly, as clearly demonstrated in the OP.
---
But he is best healer in the game ... ?
---
I certainly hope they don't take notice that easily, there ARE cases of folks handing over gold to help out lower leveled players (but then again I suppose they're not handing over hundreds or thousands in gold).
---
I'm doing demo destro. How can you go past ruin? Afflic is so boring. Get those sacrifice crits going
---
Spell power for single target, int / spi  for AoE farming right? Like an extra blizzard is better than the blizzard doing 1dps more. Iirc.
---
Are you his PR account or something? You have a bunch of nonsense comments defending him in this thread
---
I will agree to this, accept toughness is simply not worth it, imo.. you don't get enough value, compared to what 5 points could bring you elsewhere.
---
I have gone shield spec, dodge, parry, crit+flurry, elemental weapons and weapon mastery in the enhancement tree. All of this is defense and melee threat.
---
Then I went elemental; shock mana, resistance, 2 in shock dmg, the one that makes 1/10 spell free to cast (so nice, when pulling with cheap LB and interrupting with cheap ES and getting procs), and now I'm building shorter shock CD's and then I'm unsure what I'll do..
---
I've tanked everything up to and including Mara. You need good gear and make sure to be same lvl as the highest boss, if you wanna have a smooth run. But I've gotten alot of praise by ppl out there^^ however I'm a bit scared to try ST, really need better gear now (I'm 54). Oh and engi bombs/grenades help alot with whoopsie-pulls!
---
I 2-h staff as dps and when solo, because my staffs always have way more dps over a 1h. Use totems well and you have very little downtime during questing.
---
But you can always help groups out with the tank role - like Jintha'alor as well, I tanked that too!
---
Nah
---
But please make sure it is actually ninja looting and not just your weird definition of ninja looting. Otherwise you are just wasting other peoples time.
---
&gt;You know nothing of the subject, you couldn't care in any way and you don't play the game. Sooo what are you doing here again?
---
I mean... You're the ones upvoting threads to the frontpage. Don't be surprised when people show up that don't play the game ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  
---
Also: I do know what ninjalooting is, so I know *something*, just not that much about this specific situation
---
And again, if he still advocates for ninjalooting, see previous comment (*fuck him*)
---
Look dude, its not a difficult concept.  
---
Epic BoEs are not something you go into a dungeon group expecting to drop. If you absolutely needed an epic random world BoE drop, there is zero chance you're specifically farming for it and go "Oh finally they dropped, sheesh I've been at this for hours!" You're just thinking "HOLY SHIT" lol.  
---
They are VERY valuable for a reason and even if you NEED the BoE, the entire concept of you feeling entitled to it is just plain selfish. You winning this item with no contest HAS SAVED YOU A VERY EXPENSIVE TRIP TO THE AH! Very comparable to needing on it to obtain the gold it offers.
---
A group being lucky enough to have a super rare BoE epic randomly drop should all have an equal opportunity to reap the insane benefits from the item.. Whether that's from not having to buy the item for yourself later, or by just selling it for raw gold.  
---
Really hope this provides a little bit of insight on how Bind on Equip works.
---
Lol, I play a tank. I've run so many dungeons, where do you think my suggestion comes from. Now, before you assume I'm a shitty tank, just like you incorrectly assumed I was a shitty dps, let me tell you, random pugs can't be convinced of anything. So instead of having to waste time waiting for them to corpse run all the time, I'd just prefer a priest/pally alongside druids in my party, just in case something unplanned happens.
---
I know what I’ll be farming now.
---
This single issue is ruining classic for me. I’ve had countless items ninja’ed. Gamers are not the same anymore I fear
---
how did u change the font i like it alot
---
Yo that’s a nice UI, what is it?
---
If this not happens on last boss, just stay in group and need on items mage need as well.
---
If there are not other cloth persons I mean.
---
The only thing I personally know after playing wow for years:
---
Vanilla &gt; retail wow &gt; classic
---
Was hoping that classic would bring back vanilla moments... But in my case I still wait for the first great moment.
---
Hi, /u/stillhazy

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/datnvz/stranglethorn_fishing_tournament/). 
---
No, they need because they want the item that just dropped before their eyes. It didn't drop a sack of gold, it dropped an item.
---
Oh yeah for sure, you skipping a lot of packs, i plan on doing the same when i farm scholo for bosses
---
Appreciate that his addon invited you to a guild.  Ungrateful millennials
---
[Vanas Kos](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vanaskos/files/2693879)
---
Officer of a admitted ninja looter's guild, who has said he would ninja loot again, ninja loots. Somehow I'm not surprised.
---
Depending on tier pieces you get you can swap into 3/4 stormshroud to retain the energy proc.
---
But can you get extra attacks off of windfury procs? What about retrireckoning and ironfoe/hoj? In early TBC retro+resto was a decent enough comp due to the roulette
---
Theramore, as indicated above the minimap.
---
Not true that its the "only way of winning" if its an item you shouldn't win in the first place.
---
Sorry but all greed here is dumb. If it's a PUG it's especially dumb. All Need on a BoE epic in a PUG. 400 gold ain't nothin to F with.
---
Obviously, this does not apply to guilds and RL friends.
---
It's still 75% not 100%
---
I had it on my mage. Pretty much any casters I've seen have used it at some point.
---
You know, you could just say "Well, when greed starts to set in then it should be all need!" instead of trying to find some weird rule where no rule exists. If you want to say that people should be rolling need on stuff that finances their epic mount or whatever they need then they should roll need on EVERYTHING, because EVERYTHING finances stuff like this.
---
Don't get me wrong, I am all for rolling need on BoEs by everyone in the group (and since I only create my own groups I also have a macro that defines the loot rules before we start), but your argumentation of why it should be the "default" is kinda weak.
---
You're right mate, I'm sorry for resorting to name calling.
---
My point still stands though, you should only need on an item if it is an upgrade or if the whole party agrees to.
---
I understand there are filthy little ninjas out there and at least half the community are greedy fucks.
---
I'm not getting worked up, but it does annoy me that people can be so selfish to need on an item that they can't even use just for gold.
---
I always wait to roll to see if anybody is trying to ninja in PUGs, in that instance then I believe needing is okay; but just to spite the ninja more than anything.
---
yoink
---
The last violations is that he didn't put it in AH with his banker alt.
---
Ninja looting is not against tos what is against tos is scamming, for example if you ask okay what happens if "x" drops, and leader says, all greed, but it drops and he's the only one to need. Thats scamming and bannable. If no one discusses loot rules and drops and someone just needs, not a scam just a ninja and not bannable.
---
Paladins frost res aura kind of screws mages to the point they should oom first in equal gear.
---
Also an even semi competent hunter can crush a mage on even footing, especially at lower gear levels. Mages that stack damage oom to viper sting, mages that don't stack damage die first due to push back.
---
They actually are in case of Classic.
---
There is literally one gold sink in the whole game and it is epic mount and 1000 gold is laughable amount.
---
After that there is nothing to spend money on. You are basically hoarding gold for TBC/Whatever they plan on doing after they have run out of phases.
---
thats gonna be a YIKES FROM ME
---
Did you forget there's timezones? It's a actually Monday in some countries tomorrow. 
---
After reading everything you wrote you're making a full of yourself.
---
Of course everyone complains, but sharing your opinions on personal forums isn't whining. I don't think you realize this. 
---
Regardless, I don't think i can convince you that people sharing their thoughts isn't mindless complaining/whining. Feel free to keep sitting on your throne and putting other people in their place.
---
We're missing info here. Did Zenny not actually need the item? In chat they claim that they do.
---
average reddit user checks out
---
6 stam
---
4 spirit
---
If he did have an off hand then he every right to roll it imo.
---
meanwhile I just deathcoil-soulfire people and sit afk
---
shit's FUN
---
Jeez, people have shit going on sometimes and forget stuff. Being forgetful in a single situation doesn't make you a terrible player.
---
Wait Hydra is back?
---
I have a couple times, while tanking sometimes I'll click something like a twink blue axe or something while fighting.  Not really epics but stuff that's worth alot.  So far have gotten lucky and the "only greed" thing has stuck, but I never push the "only greed" thing...and if group dosn't bring it up I've only got myself to blame and wouldn't be heart broken over it.
---
When someone needs, anyone hitting greed misses out. 
---
It then becomes whoever has the highest need roll wins the item.
---
And everyone wants that item, why should they get priority because they're lazy?
---
What a fucking shit human being.
---
They start playing fair after the loot is taken from them and the 3 day suspension ends.
---
Assuming they want to keep their account.
---
Oh you sure wounded me there. 
---
You probably think I'm greedy, but it's the rest of you who want to have dibs on an item this expensive that are being greedy. Everyone should have a fair chance, when you win this item you basically win your epic mount in a single roll. 
---
Even if I would be a Fury Warrior, I would still not be so deluded as to expect everyone to pass on this for me.
---
I'm paying 15,99 euro for this
---
Heh well I've been trying to get this rod for 5 hours...
---
I'm a healer as well and I'll take an Spriest every time if they want to join, just for that passive grp healing. It means I can slack off a bunch and basically be boosted through the dungeon with no effort. 10/10, do recommend.
---
No, it’s not. Your argumentation that gold is gold no matter the amount is weak.
---
Invest in free action potions and pray you take down the ice barrier fast so you can actually get some rage.
---
And probably die anyway unless you happen to have an ice reflector.
---
Hardly any spellcleave on my server, just another anecdotal evidence.
---
If something super valuable drops you should never snap roll it. Always discuss with the group. Anyone who snap rolls greed and gets ninjad are being careless and have not ground to complain.
---
Be careful of who you pretend to be. Some day you may just become the very thing you pretended to be.

Jokerd is solo farming Maraudon and BRD at low level, so it is possible.

If you can't expect to "convince a random pug of anything", why do you think it's beneficial to have a priest or paladin given they're also random pugs? At this point you're contradicting yourself. And keep in mind I don't give a shit about what sort of dps player is in the group, I play with balance druids, shadow priests, ret paladins, I don't care. Never have I stated otherwise.
---
Lol, and I forgot stats! There is a way to determine how much str is worth how much agility.. it's a question of raw output vs how often you crit. I don't know the math exactly, but I believe 2 str is 1 AP and 14 AP is 1 dps extra. Compare that to how much crit you get from an amount of agi - I go all in on agi for dps, unless it's like 8 agi vs 20 str, but when tanking you often  get str on the stam gear that you'd want for that and that's fine.

Try Auctionator or TradeSkillManager(TSM), both have options to scan the auction house and log prices, give it a few scans over a day or two and you'll have most items
---
So.
---
The game has a loot roll feature.
---
Option 1: Press this button and you have a small chance at winning some 'loot' unless someone presses option 2
---
Option 2: Press this button and you have a greater chance at winning some loot and automatically beat anyone who presses option 1
---
Some tasty treasure drops and everyone has the choice to use either option 1 or option 2. Some guy comes up to you and says to the group 'You should press option 1'
---
The group presses option 1 knowing full well that they are lowering their own chances at winning the much sought after treasure.
---
One guy presses option 2, because you know... he isn't a total retard, he wins the good ol' booty and reaps the rewards in the form of 420 gold pieces.
---
One of the option 1 crew gets mad at this and makes a post on the internet... "LOOK AT THIS HORRIBLE PERSON, HE ASKED ME TO PRESS OPTION 1, I DID IT WITHOUT QUESTION OR THOUGHT, LETS BAN HIM PLEASE"
---
I've only recently started to watch him and he talks about him being so fair and shit. What a scumlord saying its cool to ninjaloot with randos.
---
There are people out there who would absolutely love that kind of environment.
---
No worries. The issue is when BoEs drop, it happens so fast and people click before it's discussed, which lead to drama. No one ever starts a party going "aight yall, let's discuss what happens if BoE epic drops", but I think I may start doing that now because this is such a split issue. A person is only a ninja is they don't abide by the rules agreed on beforehand, someone wanting the boe to sell is not automatically a ninja. And you're saying they want the item "just for gold", but that same amount of gold can buy them other BoEs they may need in the AH, or get them 3-4x pieces in blue BoEs. There's no right or wrong, this is VERY subjective.
---
Yeah, the 3.0 nerf to SW was big.
---
Also, some of the talents (most notably, Honor Amongst Thieves) was buggy and allowed rogues to do way more damage than they should even with very crappy gear, resulting in easily Puggable (0 Darkness of a thousand souls) Kil'Jaedan.
---
Not final boss, but i cannot understand why  Temple of Atal'hakkar is called ST
---
Gold is litteraly gold, no matter the amount. What the fuck are you even talking about? You have absolutely no case for this one.
---
Same on Ashbringer. Server is full post 18h for a 10 min or so. Everyone's friendly, no ninjas so far. No spellcleave spam.
---
Lotus are far more rare. You could probably farm up 100 blood in the time it takes to find one lotus node
---
Is this literally me? I swear I had this exact interaction this weekend.
---
Green quests are actually the best. Theyre easy and they still give full xp till you've outleveled them by 5 levels.
---
Basically this, I dont want to be the healer at all. I want to be a DPS that can PvP (My main Focus) but still have fun when my friends play the game as well. I dont have the mettle to be the healer, I give you guys credit. It really is a thankless job and if youre bad at it everyone sure lets ya know.
---
Yea ure wrong bud. If the loot rules aren't in chat the item wasn't ninjaed and they won't do anything.
---
Naming policy is enforced. Pretty quickly too. But people don't mind so much how you chat in trade or LFG. /s and /y should be IC though.
---
What does everyone need 400g for?
---
Has no one actually paid any attention in what content we have available?
---
There is ONE gold sink of 1000 gold for epic mount.
---
You have X number of YEARS to get there because more ain’t coming.
---
Or watching Asmon do it thinking it's funny and the way to play.
---
Appreciate the tough love haha. Its unfortunate, the class is a ton of fun.
---
Ah ok thanks.
---
Except now you've healed the lock.
---
Really? I shouldnt need on an item that is BiD for me because its tradable?
---
Why do they say swords are so much better for leveling a rogue?
---
They as say daggers are much better for pvp.  On a pvp server so it would be nice to be ready for both
---
I don't care who it benefits. Ninja looting is a dick move. And I am not surprised at all that the cult of asmongold has no problem with it.
---
YOU CANNOT HAVE MY PAIN! &lt;CLAP!&gt;
---
And you've made good points as well. This is just like politics lol, we should discuss to understand the other side, not to further split everyone. Not left, not right, but forward. #Yang2020 #1000GAzerothDividend
---
Play anything but those two classes if you don't wanna heal and don't like the social stigma against rogues
---
Puny mages with their full Frozen Wrath gear without stamina :&gt;
---
Any mage needing on a dagger that only has 6 stam 4 spirit is kind of a bitchboi.  
---
There's plenty better items out there.

I've been in exactly 0 pugs since Classic launched and I must say it's actually been amazing.

You just understood nothing...

---
Dude, what the fuck? Over a fucking BOE epic in a game? What an absolute waste of oxygen. Trees are out there working hard to provide the Alliance with breathable air... OUR breathable air.
---
That's not the farm I'm talking about.
---
They abso-fucking-lutely will temp ban you, remove the item/gold, AND flag your account for close monitoring for breaking clearly stated loot rules in-game. My noob ass learned this the hard way in Wrath with a 3 day suspension.
---
No, everyone wants gold, he wants the item. There's still is a difference, right?
---
Think about the definition of the actual buttons "Need" and "Greed".
---
Need=I want the item  
---
Greed=I want the gold
---
Best spots?
---
You should roll need, just like everyone else.
---
If only more people had this mindset, we may not all be able to agree but at least we could understand why.

I think you forgot to include twitch chat emojis in your reply.
---
Are they really that good?
---
Some notes, ruin gives really little dps before you get good gear. 10% crit means it gives a measly 3.3% dps. Dmg you really won't be needing in phase 1 &amp; 2.
---
If you acually want to solo farm make sure u get spirit tap instead. Also maxing slow curse is great if you wanna farm elites, with boot ench u get a 38% difference meaning u outrun mobs.
---
Also the affliction hit rate might be overrated on 60
---
Even if you just go her bing and sell herbs while questing you should be at around 400-500g before 60.  Without any boe luck ofc which would jump it up further.
---
What is the recommended minimum level for doing mara, st, and brd?

No, he wants the gold he would otherwise spend on buying the item.

---
nope.
---
This is so interesting. So do you log off outside the dungeon or something? You're at level 60, yes? Do you have your hearth set to ironforge? This makes me want to level up my druid. I like playing restoration at 60 but I level up as feral and I wouldn't mind keeping a few MCP in my bags for when I spec tank feral again for fun. Would you still recommend that? I love the druid healing playstyle with a focus on HoTs, and I love being able to tank or heal as I level up instead of looking for either or. I used to main as resto druid at level 70 TBC content, occasionally tank spec.
---
Hey, btw, Dispel is very useful in WC and any sleeps. Perfect level to get used to it.
---
The post is basically about Master Looter, it won't apply to like 95% of cases. 
---
if you're like lets say a Priest and you need on Dal'Rends, you cannot be banned for it, even though by any player's definition, you'd certainly be a ninja looter.
---
In the popular case with the Edgemaster's Gauntlets that's on the top page now, that player can also not be banned for it (as per the blue post linked) - it was not Master Looter, the fact that he said 'all greed" before it is immaterial in Blizzard's eyes, everyone had the option to Need or Greed. No one was constrained. 
---
In before people tell me I'm in favor of ninja looters or a fanboy of some streamer I've never even watched...
---
How is it being 15 years old relevant here when we are playing a rehash of the game from 15 years ago?
---
It’s only 900g you need not 1000.
---
He specifically says he wants to pvp.  Ele shaman are great in pvp.
---
Mages are arrogant in lore too.... it all plays apart of class fantasy
---
I don't play classic but i did play a lot of vanilla, and i would argue that it means both, depending on context.
---
Yeah, I still remember watching his Moose Is Loose stream back in WoD and got like almost 200 people their moose mounts, shit was so awesome but yeah, not any more.
---
Go on then, advertise your furry porn patreon/deviantart.
---
Go lock. Go destruction. Play wannabe mage but with sex demon for company.
---
Nah the pet is really useful for ur group, those locks are just lazy
---
How?????
---
Scummy for sure, always need on BoE and recipes, dont listen to what others tell you or you end up like this. Hope Asmon acts fairly on this when he's back
---
&gt;You simply rushed the shit out of the game and wonder why you can beat the defacto tutorial beginner raid easily.
---
No I haven't, I'm 47. I'm just saying, most of Classic is leveling and the end-game isn't very fleshed out in comparison to TBC. I'm allowed to prefer the endgame of TBC.
---
If I had to guess I'd say swords are slower so the weapon damage is higher which increases damage of abilities based on weapon damage.
---
Daggers are fast which mean they're hell on casters as hits slow down casting.
---
Should I transfer out of Thunderfury-PvP server or reroll fresh? I’m in my late 20s and I personally feel the Alliance side is stagnant and boring. I sort of regret not rolling on Grobbulus-RPPvP where everyone is more involved in their character and in the world particularly WPvP from what I see on reddit. Or just some other PvP server where everyone is more involved together. But I already have over a day of play time invested into my main plus other alts on Thunderfury. I can’t decide what’s the best way?
---
Fix that gaming setup.
---
Playing like that for even just a few minutes WILL cause neck strains.
---
Sometimes shit just happens. Shit shouldn't happen 3 times if people are cognizant of what shit they've done.
---
What kills me is when the guy who fucks up is the only one who dies and he leaves after his first death.
---
I won the roll on a Freezing Band over a mage as a hunter. He would've used it for sure, but since it's an expensive BoE, the money anyone can use from it can go to improving either of our characters. If you really need a BoE, farm gold and buy it; you're not entitled to it if it happens to drop.
---
No im just not retarded enough to use the logic that everyone agreeing to need a boe makes them all ninja looters.
---
Better go ignore myself brb.
---
Fucking dumbass lmfao.
---
Shit like this was happening all the time in vanilla, stop with the fucking elitism already
---
I've been planning on doing this for that ring too...as I used to farm mara in the original and enjoyed it.  Went in for the first time in over a decade yesterday as a group at 50~...and won that ring.  Thrilling, but not as cool as if I'd have solo'd it.  lol  :)
---
You will always be in the minority and will eventually be a lonely gamer if you ignore people who play by long established methods that actually make sense.
---
It is a video game. It is supposed to be a fun recreational activity when your responsibilities are done and you feel like playing. If you have shit to do or dont really feel like logging on, just set the game aside. Other then this, if you have time and want to play but still feel burnt out, try another guild, or server or faction or a new class. Or dive in to some profession leveling or gold farming. Set a goal for yourself. A rare pet, or leveling up firstaid or crafting something for yourself or something.
---
Why are you even playing on Faerlina? such a disaster of a server.
---
Also as others said, always need on BOE purps.
---
You can die individually between wipes. A wipe means the whole group died, but a single person dying over and over for whatever reason could break all their stuff.
---
How is He increasing the difficulty? By Not having fear ward? Rofl
---
He's more than fair with lot of you watch. He just acts like this for reactions
---
Moronic.
---
Well all I'd say to you, having both a shaman friend and priest friend that never healed dungeons, curb your expectations.
---
No one should have any say how you play and enjoy the game, with that said, you don't have say over their experience. You will make it harder to get groups, you may even be in a position where the healer leaves 3/4 way through the dungeon and your friends will look to you.  
---
Play how you want, and if one of your friend's likes healing, stick around their level as best you can.
---
iTs JuSt A jOkE. Jokes are funny. Being deceptive for your own gain is not funny. Keep licking his crusty toes.
---
I'm happy to be corrected, but in classic, there is a lot of gear that could benefit hunters, so they tend to roll for a lot of things. I've never played a hunter, even back in classic, so maybe I'm remember it wrong.  
---
The "all look is hunter loot" thing is based on that, but it's really a running joke. 
---
As an, ahem, mage, I only need roll on something that is a clear improvement.
---
Rogue
---
Can you use that teleporter by the goblin to get to booty bay?
---
As a 40 Lock I stay as far away as I can from Warriors and Shammies. Can't fear them and I they just burst me in 2 secs.
---
We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.
---
There is nothing to see as you are talking bullshit. I mean, you can't even explain it, you are just repeating the same phrase. But repeating something over and over won't make it suddenly true.
---
Maybe try to explain how "gold is not gold". This is an oxymoron.
---
*never trust anybody*
---
Same goes for real life too pal.
---
It's good but honestly not worth the money for casual players. Robe of winter night is good enough as prebis
---
Always need on boe’s, I learned the hard way as well
---
Always roll need on expensive BoEs. They are in essence just huge cash drops, just because one person needs them doesn't change that they're liquidable. If anything, sell it to them on the spot for a fair price.
---
The only time I won't roll need is if I'm in a full friend group and it's obviously someone's upgrade, at which point I'm not going to make them pay for it but again that's just among my friend group since we're constantly sending each other materials and gear to help one another.
---
Lol do you really think Asmongold will do anything about it?  He's just as toxic.
---
This quest is fun once you get to the final tower. If there are people of the opposite faction farming Crusader recipe there, either Taelan or the inquisitor will beat them to a pulp :)
---
How is this even close to comparable? Dal’rends are at least technically pre-bis for Hunters. This dagger does very little for a Mage. 
---
That said, as a Hunter, I’m not gonna go for Dals because there are other great options and they’re much more impactful for a Melee I feel.
---
I know it varies from server to server but I wonder how much Staff of Jordan is worth
---
I did the math. i get like 10k exp unrested per quest cycle. 
---
since 58 and 59 are both about 200k exp each, you would get 60 in 40 quest turn ins. thats only 2,200 rep of the 42000 you need (if you are human) 
---
Humans are pretty lucky getting 10% more rep. Thats like saying it takes 4200 rep less than everyone else. 
---
It takes humans about 750 quest turn ins to do. Each quest might as well take 40 mobs to get the 10 quest items which means 30,000 mobs. 
---
if it takes 10 minutes per cycle thats about 125 hours of grinding. 
---
if it takes 30 minutes per cycle then 375 hours. 
---
Basically it takes more time getting exalted than leveling 1-60 which took me about 10 days played or 250 hours.
---
I have 3.5k with necrophile gear from scholo
---
Even better, on a classic server you gain a reputation for ninja looting and people will learn to ignore you and you will eventually never get a group again.  Reputation means something when you don't have cross servers and dungeon finder.
---
Completely leveling in dungeons. DM from 16-22ish, stockade to 30ish, gnomer once or twice for the quests, SM to 42ish.
---
I don't get the love for him. If I feel like just listening to somebody play while I'm playing or doing whatever, there are far better options with 20 or so viewers. I listened to him for maybe an hour one day and all I hear about is how he big dicks stuff and that other players are retards.
---
&gt;I doubt that there's some person pouring through data and instituting these bans. It's likely an algorithm, and like all algorithms it's not 100% accurate. 
---
Difference here is that OP was reviewed by a human after the algorithm caught him, there's no running from a ban made by a bot and verified to be true by a human. Had he been wrongfully picked up by the algorithm the human would have caught up on it during review.
---
It's still shitty behavior in game. And others do it like him without differentiation.
---
Love using blue posts from 2010 as guidelines.
---
EDIT: Stop complaining about Ninja looters and threatening to report everyone to GMs. Ever wonder why we have forced personal loot now in Retail?
---
Living the dream my friend.
---
He is learning from his leader.
---
Thats obvious but OK.
---
Vendor versus Auctioned is a big difference, to even make that argument is silly.
---
BoEs are rewards for the party. Period. BoPs are rewards for the user. If someone wins a BoE that someone else wants, then that person can buy it from the winner. Can't do that the same way with BoP.
---
If you have a 3.5mm audio cable plugged in somewhere it can be causing it.  When I route my Switch's audio through my PC it causes a buzzing if I play a game.
---
The EULA haven't changed on this point. But nice try degrading this post. Won't work.
---
Okey nice!
---
Actually I learned 15 years ago that people are usually decent humans on max level. Because I never used your ninja loot system and epics went either to people using them or got greed rolled to be sold. And if I don't play with people like you I don't have to be a ninja looter like you guys accepted.
---
You guys became ninja looter to prevent ninja looting. It's disgusting and you won't change my opinion on that.
---
idk fam i wanna see this guy post a video of doing a 3 minute in&amp;out gnomer resets. I think that's pretty BS even with a dash cooldown, with a total of 3 over the 5 runs.
---
That's a global report, spanning the entire dungeon. It's not because some pulls require a sheep that the hunter should stop using multi-shot for the whole dungeon. I'm sure the guy was actually breaking sheeps with it, just pointing out that a global recount isn't incriminating enough.
---
Woah, people closely associated with Asmongold are horrible little shits? Who would have thought?
---
When an epic BOE drops, Everyone should roll need.  It doesn't matter that you "plan on" equipping it, or CAN equip it.  If it's epic and BoE, everyone need it.  Even if you actually need it, since it's a BoE and you can buy it then the playing field needs to be level for everyone.  There is no other fair way.
---
He did fireblast. Not that it absolves him from what he did after. He blinked -&gt; fireblasted (got resisted I guess) -&gt; Frost Nova. He should've just done CoC or AE instead of Nova though.
---
That's awesome, and congrats man!
---
Hi, question from r/all, how did you got here and how much drama will you create over digital pixels?
---
At this point they may as well remove the Greed button all together and just avoid the constant flood of posts like these.
---
Well.. yeah? You go try rolling need on some boss drop you don't need/can't use and see what people call you. They'll say you're a ninja looter and they wouldn't be wrong. 
---
But can you get banned for that? No. There's nothing in that blue post about Group Loot Need/Greed rules. 
---
It's a flawed system, and despite what people say, has changed much for the better in the retail version of the game.
---
Curse of the Elements doesn't just reduce resistances, it also increases Fire and Frost damage taken by 10%, which I suspect is what's causing the damage increase you're seeing.
---
It's asmongold being sarcastic
---
Thanks :)
---
I think I have more people on my Classic ignore list than I ever did it all my years playing retail. Just not putting up with any shit heads.
---
How many dungeons do you a day now, compared to back then? Dungeon spamming is pretty much a norm now, but not so much back then, years ago most people would typically do one dungeon then hearth and be done. Also, like the other guy said in this thread, he hasn't seen jack squat, and neither have I, so it's just rng.
---
Yes it happened in vanilla, but not to this extent.
---
Rouge is French for red. Rogue is the word you are looking for. Master that and your dps will go up.
---
Of course 😊
---
You scared cause you ninja'd after agreeing to loot rules?
---
Adding onto this, the mage blinked in close because the Shaman LoS'd the mage, and mage does need LoS.
---
However instead of getting LoS in a safe manner, the mage blinked right on top of the shaman.
---
&gt;It seems like if ninja looting is that common it's best to avoid randoms at all cost then.
---
There's a reason retail has personal loot now. If you have even one asshole in a group the entire system could get fucked by one ninja. It was just easier not to deal with that anymore.
---
it happened to me and it was wowhead in the background for some reason
---
Wow, I am so glad I know nothing of "streamer culture".
---
I feel like LEARNING about it has made me a tiny bit dumber. 
---
Thank you though &lt;3
---
Are you saying Orgrimmar is close to AQ? That's like saying booty bay is close to Naxx.
---
I'd be more impressed with a /played count that supports your allegations
---
You always need on BoE epics. Everyone needs gold. You might be a frostmage and need that gold for a freezing band, or you might be a warrior that actually needs the specific item. They way world epics has been treated on private servers for the past 13 years is like they are X amount of gold, rather than an usable item.  
---
It doesn't make sense for you to be able to reserve an item worth 500 gold just because you play a specific class, that just makes you seem really entitled.
---
Your post degrades itself, I don't need to do much work on that.
---
uh oh, your wife disappeared
---
But he didn’t say they were. He just meant that guilds don’t have to have been formed early in the games life to be a top guild.
---
Just because you wish it, doesn't make it happen.
---
Get a higer fishing lvl at around 200 and the right spots i can earn between 5g-40g an hour depending on the time of day and if there are people around .
---
Paladins and shamans needing on any healing gear in the game cause they can wear it. Yep, classic experience.
---
Stamina is useful for every class. However, when it comes to this item, which is bis for many levels for a rogue, there is precedence to give it to people who will use it for the damage.
---
Mage is an asshat in this case.
---
Good lord. What server
---
pretty sure blizzard even bans people for this
---
Wouldn't work since you'd also need the number following the name
---
I'm still talking about master loot ninja. If you roll greed. Then that's just that.
---
Master loot ninja happens alot right now if you aren't up to date.
---
Honestly, there are dozens of people who know that hes playing a character and that there are some scripted aspects. But honestly, its still good entertainment. The memes are gold though. I like when he goes afk, McConnel talks shit and stops the moment asmon comes back from the background, moving like gollum and chat is like: "Withered inc" or "El Goblino".  
---
Honestly, he does a great job with his stream and if we take stats into account, he in fact was the most viewed streamer on the platform. That was about a week ago.  
---
I may be a fan of asmon, but that is mainly because I will never ever play with him on one realm. Because most of his chat is quite.. how do I put it, without being too offensive..?  
---
Yeah, his chat is like "Pepega" and "3Head" had a child together.
---
Pve shadow
---
Pvp Stam
---
Wow.
---
Mind sharing what those right spots are? :D
---
Can you show me an occasion of Asmon treating someone poorly?
---
I'm not scared I just think it's a joke that half the subreddit is complaining about ninja looters without realizing that this complaining is what caused forced personal loot. 
---
I also hate that people use ninja looting for everything now, just like League community uses inting to describe any kind of misplay or trolling.
---
&gt;Skipping any boss is retail like behavior and very casual. 
---
Lmao no it isn't. People skipped bosses back in vanilla too. Also been a huge thing on pservers. Not skipping bosses is very casual.
---
That's pretty reductive, I almost exclusively party with friends in dungeons and the standard Need/Greed system works fine. Even with a random person or two, I have never run into an issue even when a blue/purple drops.
---
Hahahahabahah
---
Since vanilla is so damn easy you can go for what ever you want. You don't even need to cap hit. Just roll over the content with gear that makes you look cool :)
---
I say your friend is dumb staying on that server. It's not even wow. It's a bunch of people slaving away for attention. It's disgusting and sad. Every drop is owned by them, so leave. Even the Horde are helping progress the alliance. Your friend will continue to get the short end of the stick by self entitled kids wanting to be famous by getting their character on screen. It's pathetic.
---
So the mage rolled on an item which was an upgrade for him, he was polite enough to explain that to you in chat.  You got salty because you didn't get the loot you wanted and left the group.  I'd ignore you too.
---
Yeah but in this case everyone is supposed to roll greed. If that's the rule at the moment why shouldn't everyone roll need in these cases where you know noone actually needs it.
---
A bit late but I don’t get the import of controllers config to work and the Brown for configs doesn’t seem to work either
---
Right? Most "ninja looting" I've seen reported is just by people who lost a fair roll.
---
You just aren't going to be as effective without daggers in PVP. Swords might let you go toe to toe with a warrior but you don't have the burst to break down the tricky to catch classes. Only time I've seen it work with swords is for higher level gear (Such as T2 or T2.5) which is more overgearing than properly specced.
---
i vote shaman, i too am mostly going to pvp when it comes out, but im running enh, but my buddy is going ele, so we'll see
---
Wrong. He is Just not lowering the difficulty by picking the optimal choice.
---
I didnt realize all my replies were to you, sorry for the spam. I don't understand your point of view, you're asking to get burned and only giving ninjas a chance to take advantage of you. I also think the potential gold earned from selling bop is more valuable than one person's ability to use the item. I don't think the way the game evolved out of necessity is disgusting, I think ninja looters who made the evolution necessary are disgusting which I'm sure we can agree on.
---
I care and hopefully the asshole gets perks banned.
---
*SARCASM* Thank me for my service God damnit!!!!
---
Reply to your edit: so we just ignore ppl breaking the EULA ? You do that. Have fun.
---
What have you got against figs?
---
&gt; I did not say nor imply I am the arbiter.
---
You certainly made an assertion that tacitly held you as the authority on the matter:
---
&gt; Not true that its the "only way of winning" if its an item you shouldn't win in the first place.
---
but you implying that you were the arbiter of the matter is neither here nor there. 
---
You're at least right in saying "The system is [the arbiter]."
---
The system is 'Need' if you **can derive specific value from the item**, which anyone can do from a BoE Epic drop regardless of whether or not they can equip it. Thus, the system determines who has a 'Need' or a right to the item; if the system in place grants you the opportunity, it has determined that you have a 'Need' for whatever it's offered up to you. 
---
As such it's not only rationally correct, it's also condoned by Blizzard's own system for anyone and everyone to 'Need' on BoE Epics. 
---
&gt; Greed if you intend to sell.
---
Nope. Greed is "want but don't need." 
---
EVERYONE **needs** the value that a BoE Epic guarantees them, either directly or indirectly.
---
&gt; Oddly enough, thats why the icon for greed, is money.
---
Since we're just making things up, **the icon for 'Need' is dice because everyone should do the utmost to make sure the odds are in their favor.**
---
You inventing an arbitrary rule which makes your ninja looting ok. Why do you think there is a gold symbol behind the greed roll? 
---
But whatever. Think of all the reasons you feel better by ninja looting. Doesn't change your action in the slightest.
---
Does the Troll racial berserking affect ranged attack speed too? In other words increase ranged  auto attack speed?
---
Except no one cares about the lost stats when you gain an extra cc ability.
---
which he wont even get to keep since blizzard usually act on stuff like this if he is reported
---
But what do when you have that awkward staredown between the last 2 or 3 people not rolling.
---
Define need for me. I need that 5 gold the weapon gives, why shouldn't I be allowed to roll need on it?
---
As a level ~58 with terrible gear, how would you prioritise dungeons as a warlock?
---
It feels like strat / Scholo have a lot of good stuff? Or should I target any black rock mountain ones first?
---
Looks like this Xkr person is a child, that quit when he didn't get loot that he wanted.
---
I had to look it up. The drops from the second last boss in razorfen kraul. So it's not like they were  done the instance. He just quit in the middle.
---
Or you could just make the dungeon run in all Greed mode.  At least in FF14 when I used to play ( hi coming from All) there was an option of  making all drops greed. If you bluff a need IMHO should not be punished but dealt by making the player a social outcast.
---
This is more than a ninja, a ninja just steals it from under you. This is a scam.
---
Rogue allows you to play a class that excels at everything. Shaman has you stuck in a healing niche. Ele Shaman are great in PvP for the first 6 global cooldowns before they oom, then they are a free kill.
---
Really? This seems insane to me. Out of the 3 175 skill stuff I opened, nothing was worth more than 60s vendor price and barely more on the AH.  
---
It is a pain to level up but having it opens up multiple farming situations just for rogues and people literally invite them to dungeons just to open stuff up.
---
Edit: Mage portals also use up 20s every time you make one, and as a lockpicker people usually have to come to you. I might start tipping more to play the lockbox lottery phase 2 or 3 down the line, or for the really high level lock boxes but that seems way too high right now.
---
Okay, lets go with that, how is that not harming his group mates?
---
As a tank that runs with my healer friend and warlock friend, if you try and charge them for water - you're getting kicked. And yes, this has happened
---
I did not make any such assertion. If you want to be dishonest like that then the conversation is over. Either correct that, or do one.
---
It's even better for melee classes. The amount of extra damage you deal + the reduced damage you receive, just from hits/crits/glancing/crushing makes green mobs FAR easier than level appropriate mobs.
---
P...pyro blast 
---
Now go respawn
---
That has nothing to do with Asmongold though. I've known the guy for at least 6 years -- he's a genuine person with integrity and I doubt he'd ever condone this behavior.
---
The worst part of it all is the fact that the officer approves the behaviour.. Saying "Either you work with us, or you get better". 
---
The guild we're talking about is &lt;Progress&gt; which you are likely to have seen or heard of if you play on Firemaw, and now you know what they are about :)
---
Remember, skulls are okay, but skulls and spikes are heresy!
---
And Stockades. Running stocks as tank really teaches you the value of Steel weapon chain.
---
I wrote the following after just waking up and realised I've thought too much about it, but I'll leave it there anyway, the short version is yeah that'd be best lol. 
---
If you're talking strictly about chaining Blizzard only, it could even be thought of as breakpoints (think haste in live through like WotLK-Legion) where at x mana you get a 5th Blizzard and any mana after is useless until you can get enough for the 6th, but that's not a realistic scenario because chances are you'll also be using Nova/CoC/CS/FS/FBlast even if you're AoE farming so it becomes a bit more complicated. 
---
Something like having enough mana for (random examples) Blizzard x4, CoC x2, nova x2, then stack SP after instead would be the best way to gear but unless you do the same thing every time it wouldn't work properly.
---
What the fuck man I'm nearly 42 and need like 15g for my normal mount
---
Have your imp out for the stam buff, have it set to passive so it doesn't potentially chase running mobs and pulling more.
---
If you get aggro, run TO the tank, even if that means running through the mobs who's attacking you. Most if not all taunts are melee range.
---
Soulstone the healer, make a healthstone for the tank as a panic heal.
---
If you're going to lifetap do it and immediately start eating or bandaging to refill health. Hell I even whisper the healer at the start to let them know not to waste mana on me in between fights. Alternatively just drink water if the group gives time for mana breaks (many don't)
---
If cloth gear drops and it's mainly +spirit thats more geared for priests. If no one wants it and its an upgrade by all means, but spirit for a warlock is kind of useless (because lifetap)
---
In terms of spells, unless its a boss Curse of Agony is a waste of mana. Most mobs will die long before the 24 seconds CoA takes to deal its full damage is up. Corruption + shadowbolt spam is usually a better option, with the occasional immolate.
---
Harambe has risen from the dead
---
Really shows how young you are when you get triggered by pixels
---
Fuck that guy. When stuff like that happens it makes me even happier that the other person didn't get it
---
Yep! According to blizz, chat agreements are binding
---
You're presuming a lot here. Aren't you the one saying everyone should need instead of greed, even if someone might actually need it? That's sounds like you're the greedy one to me indeed.
---
weakaura could help but it is a little obscure
---
Cheers, I'll look into getting that installed! Thanks.
---
Well... the counter argument here is that you don't really "need" the item. I mean I totally get what you're saying and it makes sense. Just general politeness would be greeding the item. Logic has your side though. Worst case just reroll against people who tossed greed trying to be polite.
---
Aww retail kiddie cant respect the grind. Tell him to stick to personal loot and leave classic to people with some class.
---
The best example I've seen is Shadowfang. Sure, it's an upgrade for nearly every 19-20 something warrior, but you'd be absolutely stupid to equip it if you plan on leveling past 19. As it can sell for several hundreds of gold as a twink item. In this scenario, like others, it's more fair for everyone to roll need to avoid someone trying to claim it's an upgrade for them.
---
Fuck em 
---
Mine now 
---
TriHard
---
It makes literally zero sense for everyone to greed, when everyone needing is exactly the same without the possibility of abuse.  Abusing it is still shitty, but use your fucking brain.
---
That may be, but doing that will attract some fans that are actually fans of the attitude that may just be an act for him.
---
What if you actually need the thing? This dramatically reduces the chances for people who actually want to use the item and not sell it on the AH.
---
That's disingenuous. Booty Bay to Naxx is a similar distance to Darnassus to AQ.
---
Darnassus is just slightly less than twice as far away from AQ as Orgrimmar, and it makes no sense to idle or log out there.
---
Orgrimmar is objectively closer.
---
And Thunder Bluff is even closer.
---
The other Alliance cities require quite a bit more time and effort to get to AQ than Undercity's zep-\&gt;FP.
---
And horde HAVE a fast trip to Naxx.
---
What app is this
---
You'd have a point if there was a third kind of realm type inbetween RPPvP and PvP where it was mainly about people using appropriate names and the playerbase being a bit more mature on average. But there isn't. 
---
So you either go on normal PvP and deal with twitchshitters and names like Skillstabzor or you go on RPPvP
---
And imo if you go on the latter and don't disrupt anyone RPing that's totally fine. Even RPGs need "background characters"
---
Great job!
---
Uh, no. Gear &gt; gold. Always.
---
Yeah I’m not sure how to write one with all the junk box types, and activation on looting an item. Unsure how to do that either, googling was no help sadly
---
A level 35 warrior would struggle massively on these. Most of your bleeds wont work, and they are level 38-39 and already modestly farmed.
---
What did you expect from a shitmondgold follower?
---
It's both and all have a right to roll on it. It's just as much as melee dagger (due to its DPS) as it is a caster dagger +spirit.
---
Yeah I will ignore people breaking the EULA because I don't think that should be against the EULA, nor do I take a blue post from 2010 as law when it doesn't pertain to classic nor was it even posted at the time of Vanilla. 
---
Besides the post mainly discusses Raid Leaders advertising fallacious loot systems, which even if unfair, nobody in their right mind will group with people doing that. Why not just let social norms police themselves out instead of banning these people. Most people getting ninja'd aren't even in these situations anyways so it seems stupid to sit on your high chair and act like the hand of judgement.
---
I’ve never seen him talk about being fair. I’ve only seen him brag about ninja looting items in raids and literally stealing from guild banks in vanilla
---
Let there be more threads like these and people will stop grouping with the people.
---
But the world isnt so small anymore, so many acammers will fly under the radar
---
Delete this.
---
Gettin Shwrecked!
---
Getting joanas leveling guide helped me when burning out since I never got stuck again and always knew where to go.
---
It's boomers that are afraid of change even against overwhelming logic.
---
Why would you think anyone would give a fuck about you outside of your guild? I mean worlds always been dog eat dog. Doesn't change in game either
---
Healer here.
---
I would certainly expect any caster and any healer to roll need on this. Every spellcaster benefits from Int and everyone benefits from Spirit. 
---
Neither healers or caster dps can lay exclusive claim to that loot, to suggest otherwise is just ignorant or greedy.
---
True, it was a close call between him and my level 1 alt but he definitely takes the cake here!
---
Or you can forget about this passive-agressive shit and straight up tell the tank you didn't heal him cuz he's an asshole. And don't bother resurrecting him either, just leave the group.
---
Didn’t even use an alt to AH them. What a scrub.
---
Are you the asshole for getting angry at someone who shows no remorse? No.
---
Are you the asshole for getting angry at someone who apologies and offers you your choice of loot from the box to remedy the problem? Yes.
---
I will say, retail has a nice way of addressing this - if you roll need, stuff is soulbound, so this crap can't happen. There are some QoL changes I miss.
---
Hunter is fucking hard man. I understand why the class got the reputation it did, because when I was 11 looking up 'what is best wow class' everyone pointed me at hunter, but the skill cap is nuts.
---
You can’t change my mind, sorry
---
It’s probably good for dps and pvp. Ima healer so my ui is real different
---
Yeah, I Agree. Just saying I dont think Orgrimmar is close at all.
---
General rules are if in a dungeon or group, roll for chest.  If it's locked Rogue has first dibs.  If open world and not in group, it's every man for themselves.  So nah, I think you're all good and not the ahole.  
---
There are a lot of people playing Classic for the first time though, so I believe a lot don't know this general rule yet, which is why its probably happened to you a few times.
---
Typical entitled children. No place for these pricks in this game.
---
Sucks. Asmons guidance is to need roll all BoEs to avoid any chance of ninjaing. 
---
Mailbox asmon, he usually takes action on these. He has 15ish classic guilds under his umbrella so it’s unlikely this dude had any personal vetting. 
---
Either way asmon is a ninja cuk himself! Asmonbald
---
Or being a druid...
---
I have been in numerous groups where they were not yet aware of the etiquette and after it was explained (including how to do /roll in some cases!) they complied.
---
I now operate on a one warning system, unless the attitude I get to that warning is pure AH territory itself.
---
&gt; I did not make any such assertion.
---
Your own words say otherwise. 
---
&gt; If you want to be dishonest like that
---
You absolutely do not get to branch off into deflection and personal attack when your ignorance and idiocy can't be backed up and you've been soundly blown out of the water. 
---
&gt; then the conversation is over.
---
You mean this non-discussion where you're incapable of mustering a bare modicum of rationale, knowledge, self-reflection, and can't even foment a basic argument that has any legs to stand on.
---
Not very much of a conversation on your part. 
---
&gt; Either correct that
---
Correct you? I have been doing exactly that. Get with the times.
---
&gt; or do one.
---
Ending a sentence and an argument on a non-sequitor isn't a winning strategy for you.
---
i wish on a tie, it would say one person won, but the other person would actually receive the loot
---
Please dude... He has told so many stories on stream about how he has scammed other players throughout the years and laughing about it.
---
Just because you don't think it should be against the EULA doesn't give you the privilege to talk down to ppl who just want the rules to be uphold. Take it up with blizzard. Don't really care what you believe the rules should be. Rules are rules.
---
Edit: the post gives a clear image about blizzards take on looting. Just because it's from 2010, doesn't change the EULA.
---
My Warrior got his mount at 43. Gold starts to come a lot faster as you level.  Have a bank alt, send your good greens to them and put them on the auction house.  Never equip a BOE blue world drop. Always sell them.  the SM BOE blues sell pretty well on the AH.
---
Also, skip a lot of training. You don't need slam really, more than rank 1 in Cleave, or Mocking Blow after rank 1.  You can always buy lots of these skills in your 50s when you have a lot more gold to spare.
---
Also, I skipped leveling my secondary and professions. Instead selling materials. Especially cloth. Silk and Mageweave will sell decently well on the Auction House.
---
Using Recount is the real crime here.
---
&gt;Fear Ward is extremely overrated in PvE. 
---
Lmao it definitely isnt overrated. Its the best priest racial. By far. Trivializes so many fights.
---
&gt;Horde gets along just fine without em.
---
Almost like they have shamans to break fear.
---
But it also states that if you change the loot system later on without communicating it in the beginning it's also scam/ninja
---
Also if you just state in the beginning what you expect the lootrules to be like and no one openly disagrees ( eg: need before greed even for boe) it will be Ninja/scam if they act otherwise later.
---
They unfortunately still show up in the chat (at least they do for me) but at least you don't have to click decline.
---
No problem!  https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicthreatmeter  is the best (maybe only) threat meter for Classic.
---
Happy Hunting!
---
My personal view is you should all need, but if it's actually something someone will use you should offer to sell it to them for 1/2-2/3 of the value under the caveat they equip it immediately
---
Just log off now because the fun ends when the child starts screaming
---
it used to actually proc off itself as well leading to some pretty insane looking pvp videos back in the day
---
and theoretically if the stars aligned a shaman could one shot a raid boss
---
For him it’s not just pixels in a game. He makes real money from this game, it’s his job.
---
I exclusively dungeon with friends and we still all need certain BoEs. Anything that can be sold for over a hundred gold and would be actually stupid to equip should be needed on by all. Regardless of if it's an upgrade. Common sense prevails here.
---
Hmm I like this zones music
---
How is 4 spirit more important than an upgrade from meteor shard (18DPS) to Swinetusk Shank (23DPS)? There is a reason why later on caster items always had 41DPS even though they dropped in naxxramas. So melee wouldnt need on them due to their crazy DPS and slow swing speed.
---
This is not the case while leveling, therefore if anything the mage can take a dump on 4spirit while the rogue has a 5 DPS increase which is huge.
---
So I am still pretty furious  about a guildies behaviour in BRD a few days ago, after the 7 dwarves (boss) there was a chest with the bosses loot in it. The shaman opened it, looked inside, posted the items and asked if someone needs anything. I told him I want the 2h since he needed another 2 hand before, but he then answered "but this is my bis" and just looted it without rolling for it.
---
Is the guideline applicable here?
---
Grugtar happy
---
Are you really serious with that statement? Every single player needs gold, that is some terrible justification to take a item if someone else needs for a upgrade.
---
&gt; I don’t feel bad for this dude at all that a CASTER won the roll. 
---
it's fine to feel bad for him when he lost something that he could have used.
---
My issue is that during his tantrum he abandoned the group.
---
What I did was farm that tiny little demon area in Desolace for Gromsblood. It's tough to sell because nobody needs Flasks for Molten fucking Core, but when it does go through it's a solid double digits sale.
---
What macro?
---
What a douchebag
---
I find that I don't always have to be trying to eek out ever bit of DPS if it makes for a smoother run. 
---
For example, as a rogue I can keep a Spectral Tutor stun locked so that it dies before it has a chance to do the splits and silencing anyone. I'm spending combo points that could go to an Eviscerate but in the end it makes things easier. Same goes for occasionally using crippling poison instead of a damaging poison to prevent mobs from running off, pulling another pack, and causing a wipe.
---
Try to read the people before you commit this much time. I just started a guild and we are only 4 so far but I trust them and I don't invite just anyone. I plan to keep the guild small and only invite players we become friends with. Something like this happened to me in Guild wars 2 and I sure learned my lesson.
---
Unfortunately in the crater if someone is standing around a corpse. Dont loot until they walk away.
---
I set this up this morning!
---
I don’t know why you expect an officer of another guild to be decent. They aren’t the e-police.
---
Nigerian princes have the good sense to commit crimes where they can't be prosecuted due to being in another country. This moron is dumb enough to do stuff where he's easily caught.
---
Of course it's a terrible justification, but using silly semantics to justify that ninja looting is a scam or to make your own definition of the need/green system law is terrible. 
---
Just look at the BoE situation where people still argue whether that should be all need or all greed, people obviously have differing opinions.
---
Speccing arms doesnt mean you arent able to equip a shield.
---
Tanking without a shield is a bad idea, since the dps gain doesnt justify you needing more heal, mana, downtime drinking mana.
---
To be punnised by blizzard for ninja looting the loot rules have to be stated in the chat. If the ninja looter then disregard those loot rules id say he is very much a scammer.
---
Scam: a dishonest scheme; a fraud
---
You don't see how saying one thing and doing the opposite is dishonest and fraud?
---
/u/roysun
---
It’s because these people are absolute fucking garbage and should have been aborted at birth.  Autism streamers
---
What's with all these fucking cry babies? Go back to retail.
---
I favor all greed (or need) on boe epics. The only exception is if the item is pre-raid bis for mainspec, which would be considered extremely difficult to replace. Even then I feel like the party shouldn't just give it in, but that's the only time when one player might have *some* saying in them having more rights towards it.
---
Leveling epics arenever/almost never bis at 60. Something like Warden Staff for feral druid is such, but it's a very rare exception. I'm not going to skip on my mount at lev40 because someone wants to wear a bit better dagger from 35 to 48.
---
I think there should be two separate debates. In my opinion the obvious choice for non-bis stuff is to 5way greed (doesn't matter if you roll need or greed, just all do the same). But does the feral druid have priority on the warden staff? I don't know. I personally didn't need on myrmidon's ring, which I'm still wearing 2 weeks later, but agreed to buy it for ½ AH price from winner of greed roll. Partially because I didn't know if it was going to be a top2 ring for me, partially because I believe in all party members having equal rights for the expensive drops.
---
Yay layering
---
well what did you expect from a member of asmongold
---
No the gold is not worth more. Items who drop are for people who can use them. It doesn't matter if they are boe or bop. If someone can use an item to improve himself he deserves it to get. After all they are worth that much for a reason. If you want to sell items then let need everyone on everything. Because personally my money is more worth than your improvement from an bop item. But I don't do that, because people deserve their items if they drop. It being valuable doesn't change the slightest thing.
---
I said it more than enough. You guys became ninja looter to fight them. I will stand by my opinion that this is disgusting behavior. And I will not do it. Will I get disadvantages from it? Maybe. But the advantage not having to play with guys like you is worth so much more. I'm happy if people get epics which improve them. I couldn't care less about people who steal the item to buy their epic mount. Go farm some rune cloth for that.
---
if you all need you're still trying to ninja, and now you're getting away with it.  very smart for ninjas.  20% chance to ninja with no consequences.
---
I am a shadow priest. I have anathema. Have a guild i do molten core and onyxia with. Im up there on the damage Meter (Will be on the lower side when people get gear), and the warlocks loves my shadow weaving. most annoying thing is that people Will Think you are healer. Always. Shadow preist are underrated man. Be proud to be shadow!! I love it
---
But can you not ninja loot without doing those things?
---
I think the point some people are trying to make is that rolling need on items that you only intend on selling does not classify as ninja looting, as you're using the standard loot system to do so.
---
Telling everyone to roll greed and *then* rolling need is a slightly different case and Blizzard might consider that a punishable offense it's hard to say right now.
---
He’s nothing like Ice Poseidon
---
You’re wrong and the post is definitely an exaggeration. You can’t “spot” a psychopath (actually ASPD) in any conclusive way; there are many diagnostic criteria to consider and control for. Personality disorders are very complex and if you don’t understand them you really shouldn’t make these naive claims about another human being.
---
Get ready for a LONG break!  It's worth it though!   They do sleep through the night eventually.  Congratulations and good luck!
---
Interesting.
---
I must have run more Wailing Caverns than the average horde with my shaman and warrior, I leveled straight through the Barrens to Thousand Needles.
---
kek
---
It's a simple thing to all need I don't know why people don't. Simply say it before the run starts and if they don't listen its their own fault at that point. Same goes for stuff like the UBRS gems. You all need them, so why chance it, just all need.
---
I don't understand why anyone would make that rule though. Everyone "need" is the same effect as everyone "greed". Why wouldn't you just say "Nah, all need"?
---
Wow, what trash.
---
&gt; It's disgusting and you won't change my opinion on that.
---
Something isn't disgusting if it makes everyone happy. 
---
You're not able to defend this stupid opinion you shared so you shouldn't believe it. Wanna reevaluate your beliefs or dig your head in the sand?
---
If the agreement was that you roll on everything. Then yes.
---
He has done plenty of IRL streams already, some of him gardening (?), and others him eating out.
---
??? where did you get the impression retail players are that toxic? I agree that retail players can be toxic while doing difficult content, but that is because the impact of someone failing a mechanic (for example in high m+ runs) is much more devastating than a fail in classic. In general you need much more skill in retail. A mythic raid  or mythic +20 in retail is so much more difficult than any classic contnlent...so people are upset when you cause a wipe. In m+20 one wipe will make an intime run impossible.
---
Sometimes you just have to let go. They were assholes but spending the whole rest of the run complaining about a decision that is already made will probably get you kicked.
---
I play frost atm but have specced into frostbite, don't have ice block or shield yet either. I didnt roll on classic to mindlessly press 3 buttons in dungeons. I help anyone I see in wild dying, give out food/drink also. I also find I can solo most quests people are waiting around saying LFG for. 
---
I find enjoyment wanding something hoping my mana comes back in time to nova, while my hp is 2 hits from death. Standing 3 mile away spamming blizzard is boring. 
---
I avoid grouping for quests for this reason, I'd rather have a harder time doing it alone.
---
Keep in mind this was changed in WotlK, which is beyond Vanilla. People like you kept complaining and we got forced personal loot. So yeah i'm talking down on you because you're obviously whining about getting ninja'd and try to take the morale high ground that you're simply purging the world of evil players. I don't like or care for self-righteous people such as yourself.
---
The picture in the OP shows exactly how and why your plan is doomed to failure everywhere it's implemented.
---
Before i spammed dungeons for tier pieces, for me now i know thats garbage.  I have been pretty lucky with pre-bis.  
---
Back in the day after school id get on and get 1-2 dungeons done before sleeping.
---
In fact in leveling 3 toons to 60 and gearing them up to full pre raid sets i have seen less epics than getting this one toon to 60.
---
Problem is no tank set for druids. Warriors with their tank set are obv better tanks.
---
Sure you can, you can even tank as a shadowpriest. But is it efficent? No.
---
You probably aren't, either.
---
Soooooooooo you listened to someone on the internet and now you're mad because they're 400g richer than you? seems legit
---
So you can use logic, hmmm
---
I will love when the same people defending it now will flip as soon as asmon reacts to this and tells in stream not to do it and that it was wrong.
---
You spend money on AH stuff. 
---
A piece of gear that sells for 400g is essentially a piece of gear I can trade for another piece of gear worth 400g. Therefore you don't get priority just because you can equip it.
---
REDDIT - yeah reddit is not happy and rightly so
---
Then don't bring 3 other melee to BRD. If you make the group, you get to choose what classes you're bringing.
---
Steam link
---
He has also said, and I’m kinda sad I fucking know this, that if a boe epic drops everyone should just roll need. Then there’s none of this stupid ass scandal.
---
Sorry to be that guy, but how is it "your" wand? Unless we're talking about a Hunter rolling for it I'd guess a Mage or Warlock "stole" what you thought was rightfully yours for lowering yourself just enough to grace the non-healing peasants with your divine presence. 
---
There are actual grievances in dungeon runs you can get irritated about, but letting people die because you lost a loot roll makes you look like a petty twat.
---
Can't wait for Asmongold's resignated face as in "great, here we fucking go again" when he has to deal with this live :D
---
Agree. I like these a lot. Helps that travel is not trivial which makes the world seem huge.
---
If he goes back on his word, yes. I remember him saying people can ninja but not other Olympus members
---
Yes but it was an unspoken agreement, we did not state it in chat
---
This is what I really don’t get about it.  Like this game is 15 years old.  The majority of the base is now grown adults, they should understand by now there’s so much more important shit than a video game.  Unless it’s your livelihood, competitions, streaming, whatever you should never be so obsessed with a game and even if you are, you should never be willing to do something like this.  Like you lose a roll, so what, I’d expect to see a 15/16 year old do this but not a grown adult; you should understand how irrelevant a piece of loot is in the grand scheme of things.  I love WoW but loot scamming is just too stupid a thing to do when you really think about it.
---
should be 10%
---
There's mobile classic? I'd look but my phones dead right now
---
&gt; Player Progression &gt; Gold
---
Except that your precious equation is rendered meaningless by the fact that in WoW, Gold = Player Progression and Gold = Player Improvement.
---
and thats why i love classic, no two experiences are the same
---
sadly only around level 30, but this time I'm playing with all three of my brothers, and it's been really really fun this time around! (my first choice was horde, but they wanted to be alliance :/)
---
Can this be avoided if everyone rolls “need” instead?
---
Edit: nvm read down below. This takes away the probability from people who really need the item. So unless everyone is trying to just sell, this wouldn’t work.
---
Why anyone would group with those idiots is beyond me.
---
Need rolls 4 lyfe!
---
\&gt; It does not change the hypothesis at all, in fact it helps it  
---
so which is it, does it change it or not
---
It doesn't sound like it is if you read the link. 
---
But you really need to sort that out within your guild, talk to the officers, it's not ok.
---
If I did my math right, that's a one-in-4M chance.
---
    1 / (0.04*0.03*0.02*0.01)
---
Offer to tank strat live groups if you get first orb every run
---
If it wasn’t entertaining then he wouldn’t be one of the biggest streamers making so much money...
---
Man gets 60-80k people to watch him play a game live.
---
Yep they have done a good job with it since vanilla days :)
---
He also tried Sekiro....once lmao.
---
Ehh kinda, it still feels bad to have your weapon especially be lost to someone that is going to use it as a stat stick, there responsibility on everyone's part to use common sense.
---
I've collected 3
---
No shit, you can probably clear the content naked if you want but that’s not the point now is it? Do you seriously believe that people min/max because they’re afraid they can’t clear the content? People min/max because they want to clear to content as fast as possible and squeeze every little juice they can get from their character and push it to their max potential. You can clear the content with a raid full of meme specs and people who wanna look ”cool” and that’s nice but personally I don’t wanna sit 4hrs in MC because the whole raid is underperforming in sub-optimal gear and shitty specs.
---
Yeah makes everyone happy besides the person which item got stolen. Yay ninjas go!
---
My opinion is quite simple. Need is if you equip it. Greed if you want to sell it. It doesn't matter if bop or boe. You just invent the rule for boe to make yourself feel better ninja looting. And because enough of you idiots do it other people get forced in your shit.
---
What do you expect from a group of dipshit loser entitled elitists?  Theres a reason i didnt roll that scumbag server, aside from the login que.
---
A factor in why they say swords are better while leveling is that there are so many more swords available than daggers.  If you're a swords rogue, you'll have more frequent equipment upgrades.
---
Well said. 
---
He doesn't seem too bright though, so all of that likely just went in one ear and out the other. It's probably best to simply downvote and move on. 
---
If he doesn't understand reality by now then he likely never will.
---
90% Upvoted a picture of a mage who very friendly explained how he needs an item that is great for him at level 32 that is aimed towards casters but happens to have decent DPS.  His ' good offhand ' is very likely the one from graveyard which is almost BIS until level 60(literally)
---
OP then proceeds to ragequit the group and whine on Reddit before helping kill the final boss. Sure should the mage have passed waited 3-4 levels for and done 5-6 runs of Library for Hypnotic blade? Sure. Is he obligated to? Fuck no.
---
&gt; Master loot ninja happens alot right now if you aren't up to date.
---
That seems pretty hard, if anyone sets Master Looter in some random 5 man dungeon, I'm just going to ask them to turn it back to Group or leave. There's no need for that bullshit. 
---
And if they set ML before a boss.. well.. I play healers and tanks. So like, y'know, good luck.
---
“He presses option 2 because he’s not a total retard?” What the fuck logic is this, after he tells the rest of the group to roll greed? That’s called being intentionally deceptive and scamming the group out of their chance to acquire the loot.
---
Why would you roll "greed" on item that you technically and practically need?
---
You people are really asking for trouble for no reason.
---
Warriors are the new hunters, they don't have a shield, they AoE ravager pull 10 elite mobs and wonder why they died. Healed many dungeons and taken threat because the warrior was AoE'ing and doing so little threat compared to the HPS he needed to keep him up that I take aggro.... healing....
---
Put a shield on or go solo AoE in the world and see how good you are then.
---
I have a new rule, I will only go into a dungeon if the warrior is using or shield or even better, just go with a druid. The fastest run of ZF I have done was with a druid doing traditional tanking so that the DPS'er could actually DPS.
---
I am on Firemaw and all my dungeon/questing parties have been very nice. The only thing I have encountered from time to time is some people don’t speak English but that’s not their fault so I am ok with it. I had this Tauren warrior the other day who made me laugh so hard with his broken English. It was so funny! He was a really nice guy too who helped me with an elite quest.
---
Trickle down rep is a thing.
---
Because everyone needs gold, if that's how need is defined...it has no meaning.  The thing that distinguishes need from greed is whether you will equip the weapon.
---
I watched the Onyxia video. He tried to give an epic speech before it was just cringy. 
---
Then he was tanking it and it was just really poor. It was a miracle they killed her after almost all the dps died
---
I don't think the word ninja means what you think it means.
---
Olympicus ?
---
But regardess whatever he states, people have their own brain. Most people anyway.
---
Reputation does matter. But you still need to be vigilant to the people who don't care about their server reputation. Sucks that this happened, I'd be heated too, but I'd learn very quickly from this one incident for next time. Next time, disable your trade window when farming devilsaur. If anyone else tries this again, open trade with them, which stops them, then skin it before they realize what happened.
---
Based on that logic every class is the new Hunter.
---
My opinion on BoE purps pre-60 or BoE purps that are not BiS or pre-BiS is that no one *actually* needs them.
---
If you want to be useful in BGs shaman
---
Sadly, that's you allways roll need and if you really need it, whisper to the winner for a trade or something
---
Exactly, that's why I'm arguing for all need, there's no logical argument for not doing all need on tradable items.
---
 I usually save arcane missiles purely for clearcasting.
---
Put their names back in your post. Or better yet, post a screenshot.
---
Since the AH is not a much of a money source I was thinking about crafting gear for myself and supplying myself and my alts(I have a severe case of chronic altoholism) with bags.
---
Good for you glen coco
---
the issue with players like that is that they want to see what is in the chest and i guess if an epic item or expensive rare is in the box then they will ninja it 100% of the time. thats why when i see players like that i leave the group instantly, some might say thats a dick move for the other 3 players but i dont want to party with players like that and i dont want a conversation with the other players on why we should kick that player and find another for the dungeon run.   
---
imo ruining their runs may change their minds about ninja looting chests at least....
---
I found a single one so far.
---
You sitting on 250.
---
How did you do this? Layer abuse? Low pop server? Sniping auctions?
---
This isn't like Retail where it rains gold. Making any sizable amount of gold will generally take you several hours and days. Unless of course you get lucky with a BOE drop.
---
Welcome to the game kiddo. The crater is PvP vs your own faction as well. Gotta learn how to secure your own skins, the “griefers” as you say can’t outplay you not looting a corpse when they are nearby.
---
Its a chest with a couple of drinks in it and maybe a trash vendor sword. Chill ffs
---
He changed his mind later, after getting lots of reports of his guild ninjaing, will probably say he "obviously" said it as a joke, but truth is he doesnt want his whole guild banned for things like these.
---
Nobody "needs" BoEs. They're equivalent to gold.
---
7 days seems a bit aggressive. Are you a cop or someone that needs power?
---
Anyone know how to farm Skul?
---
Or they complain when a warrior "ninja loots" their leather bracers by outrolling them.
---
Im just glad mages are the new huntard. A good mage is a gd wrecking ball in pvp, but the flood of bad ones have turned them into a meme at this point.
---
Why do people watch this cocksucker neverfucker.
---
Welp. Then you're a sucker. If every1 needed on BoE epics, shit like this wouldn't happen.
---
Dude we've taken a Shamy yesterday solely for windfury (4 melees in grp) and that guy had a hard time dropping WF totem and constantly eartshocked, got aggro and complained about dying. Was 59, had some absurd BiS gear (Truestrike Spaulders, the 4.0 2h axe, HoJ) and somehow still managed to be bottom DPS.
---
Like I'm not a dick but I'm not gonna do another dungeon with that guy. What a millstone.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The beauty of classic is that these people will eventually get socially outcast. You never have to play with them. Share a kill on sight list with friends who's judgement you trust and just don't party with such people. If everyone does that, eventually these people quit (because nobody but other toxic shits wanna play with them, which makes them think the community is garbage) or reform.
---
All hail: "Unkillable II"
---
I'm torn between this and not giving any reaction. I don't want to give them any satisfaction.
---
are you me?
---
I'm not talking about just killing people, even if they are low level. I'm talking about purposefully going out of your way to make sure they durability damage when they wouldn't in a normal pvp death. *That's* scummy
---
Uhh... do you not know how laws and the judicial system in the real world work buddy?
---
My bad.
---
No need to downvote me over a modest error like that, though.
---
https://youtu.be/9WBMU47fyIU 
---
Executus tried something similar - watch it!
---
That's not sarcasm
---
He needed they 400g to give to asmon
---
I don’t understand the animosity towards the OP... can someone explain or are people just that sensitive these days?
---
Yeah... I never cared enough to watch WoW streamers, but I checked out a couple during the Classic betas. I'd heard a few things about him, but after watching Asmongold for a little bit--damn. He was yelling at random people for asinine bullshit while grouping, and it just went downhill from there
---
&gt;selfish
---
If the end result is to have 5 people rolling, why the hell does it matter?
---
He IS the parasite.
---
I hope they do. In FFXI, if you hired someone as a merc and they reneged on a deal, you can screenshot everything and put a ticket in and the GM will investigate, refund what you lost, take the ill-gotten gains from the scammer and possibly temp ban them.
---
Officer at the door, it’s snowing?
---
I didn't ever try town guards, I did this because I was questing and it was fun at the moment. I didn't expect it at all.
---
Well then, I'll be grabbing that mithril order trinket out of my bank before I come here in future lol.
---
Report him!! He will get banned if you show this to a GM!!!
---
Nobody but a loot ninja would ever suggest "All greed"
---
I don't think the post ever states anything about Need/greed system, which is very much open to interpretation. This is only about Master Loot.
---
Fishing is very popular, Oily Blackmouth is a pretty low level fish even though it does come from the pools. Same thing with most other lower level fish that fishing guides recommend.
---
I'd recommend leveling it up and going to the Bay of Storms in Azshara. You need 330 fishing (So boosts are needed, easiest one would be the lures that boost by 100) and you'll get Stonescale Eel, Darkclaw Lobster, Large Raw Mightfish, Raw Glossy Mightfish and Winter Squid. These all serve a decent purpose once cooked so you will make a lot of money with these at the moment.
---
You don't need to white knight for a man child who is bad at video games and is toxic, remember he doesn't care about you
---
&gt; One rez on what, a 30 min cooldown? Wtf is that garbage.
---
It's not just a rez on a long cooldown, it's a rez that can be used during combat with a very fast cast time. Used correctly, it can prevent a wipe by bringing back a key party member like healer or tank.
---
All 3 in his case
---
Sure all those Posts about people needing Shit and selling them on the AH minutes later seem totally fine
---
Shoulda clicked faster. It's like 9g who who gives a shit.
---
You don't mind the community looking like brazilian carnaval?
---
"I'll promote you for ninja looting". Yeah it's sarcasm. It's the same kind of sarcasm he's been using his entire career. Look up his guide to being an elitist for more "honest opinions".
---
Be ause you dont fuckin NEED it, you want it to make money from aka GREED.
---
oh wow what a surprise /s not.   
---
This is expected guys like asmon and his buddies think they are above everyone. They are truly egoistical assholes, but still they have this massive fanbase.    
---
I would report his ass for scamming.
---
*creates a /cancelaura fort macro*
---
I didn't understand the whole Herod "no streamers" vibe until now. What a crappy environment where this guy will still have people begging to play with him just because of who he's associated too
---
He only leads them because it guarantees gear and gold is funneled to him.
---
Ball'd fucker wants to stay relevant I suppose.
---
It's not, but you should talk to your officers and have this guy punished or kicked out of guild if this is recurring behavior. This person is obviously toxic to group with seeing as they prioritize themselves over the group, and you should warn people not to group with them anymore.
---
I'm saving this delicious pasta, this thread was worth it just for this neckbeard comment
---
Tidy plates has that ability too apprently
---
36%
---
Actually, he is one of the best healers in **a** game. Unfortunately he never specified which.
---
What a piece of shit Royston is. Your friend deserves better than that. Lesson learned.
---
In real life if you get caught red handed blatantly scamming people you get punished, in some cases severely.. It swings both ways.
---
Used to be an code of honour that most would follow.
---
I agree with you, but regardless of how you feel, the entire group agreed to a different design. The guy is a shitbag.
---
My thoughts were it was penny pinching on ActiBlizz's part.  They have a new CFO and their prime directive was to spend as little money as possible.  While the data science teams likely had an accurate forecast of how many players there would be, they could have been asked questions that led the team to trying to start with as few servers as possible.
---
But keep the sword in bank. As an additional damage type is great for some encounters.
---
Same outcome, but no risk of getting stolen. Don't see why people find this so hard to comprehend.
---
I mean, sure, you can make an MC raid then ninja some random item with ML, but even the big servers aren't THAT big, and they'll probably get smaller in a few months.
---
I think a warning (which is what you're more likely to get) or a 1 week ban would be the least of your issues now that reputation is a thing again. You're basically not raiding again with that character.
---
So you're one of the "work harder not smarter" crowd. Check.
---
The zones become pretty big and quests spread around that point. It's faster getting 7g with a mount than 5g without one.
---
Gear that is boe is gold. They are interchangable.
---
Amplify curse + chain fear.
---
Fair enough I guess. Though it'd be hypocritical if I said I never got petty about loot. Like when WArlocks roll need on SPI heavy items (or SPI exclusive items even). That really grinds my gears.
---
Show me where the mage touched you.
---
He's literally a pile of trash. Why people watch him is so far beyond me being able to underatand... literally the only personality he has is "I swear a lot."
---
So you’re saying that it’s not dumb for the guy who needs it, to need it..? There’s a need/greed loot system for a reason, and if a guy needs Edgemasters, he shouldn’t have to chance it against 40 people for gold. Gold is not a “need”, it’s farmable, unlike super rare BoE epics.
---
People usually go combat swords while lvling. Kinda boring in my opinion. Went daggers and it was fun
---
I dont see any other option to change the casting bar
---
Yikes, if you're arguing that forced personal loot is a better loot system.......
---
Nope, I hate you because most of you are bad and annoying and rolled your class solely because of what you saw/heard from streamers and guides.
---
I was a mage main from TBC to Cata myself and I now consider mages the new warriors, I never thought that hunters are huntards, but warriors actually were and still are the worst.
---
P.S.: Surely there are certain percent of normal people playing the class, but thanks to the rest of them I personally blacklisted frost mages from joining my groups and plan on doing this up until we start raiding.
---
Thanks a lot man! :D https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA
---
Is telling someone to eat that booty like groceries supposed to be an insult or something?
---
How are you going to say that you didn’t say it was a 2019 problem then just double down on saying it’s a 2019 problem in a more convoluted way ?
---
It's a pleasure :)
---
Oh I agree, the battle rez aspect of it is super valuable, as is the cast time. But sometimes you have tough pulls, and when two or more party members die, you're just outta luck and corpse running back and it's frustrating lol. Worst I can think of off the top is Maraudon inner chamber, you can't run back in if you used the scepter. Gotta zone into orange or purple, then run out, then hope you or another dead guy in the team has the scepter to rejoin your party. That run back is already kinda long as it is, but this is probably the worst case scenario in the game, unless there's something else I can't think of.
---
Find me one example of someone getting banned for rolling need on an item they don't need and intend on selling.
---
It's not a raid. It's 5man completely different situations. Also, he isn't a guild master.
---
If my guild master would take item just to sell it on AH I don't think there would be many people raiding in that guild after that.
---
And yes if some random would say "all greed" I would at least wait until everyone else press greeds first.
---
Seconded.
---
Is it ninja looting if a player needs and wins the scarlet belt twice?  I would say yes, but I would not give a 1week ban,  maybe 2 days. Why would he need this belt twice? For profit I guess. There were no established rules at the beginning.  Does this mean that everyone can roll on everything? Even duplicates that they already won? Hmmm.
---
If it’s unwarranted than yes, but I think it’s fine if it’s in retaliation.
---
I'm pretty sure those are bots xD
---
Personally I think it's fairly obvious that his persona is an vastly exaggerated version of himself. It's not surprising that was close to burnout earlier this year,  it takes it's toll to play the fool.  
---
I probably don't even fault him that much for creating his audience and his "reality", it's just too good money to pass up now that he found a really successful concept.  
---
But I loathe that there is a large majority of his audience who love the persona and stupidity unironically or without knowing that this is a clown act. The audience members who not see him as entertaining but as a lodestar of toxic behaviour.
---
thats just sad man
---
I used that staff as an enhancement shaman until I got ravager. Im pretty sure I would have caused that person to completely snap...
---
Hes made videos on youtube on how to ninja loot and bragged about how much he used to ninja back in the day.
---
Any update?
---
The last part is about switching group loot to ML without prior agreement, regarding my first statement
---
And memes it up with a 420 69 69 pricetag. So happy not to have encountered any players line this yet!
---
A priest for when you get tired of playing warrior?? 
---
Damn, man. Your patience must be through the roof. Even if you crawl your way through to 60 on both, just running dungeons would get annoying I’d think. 
---
I would roll a dps like a mage or rogue, probably be a better alternative.
---
would have been better if she exposed herself to us...am i right?
---
Maybe I'll start caring more if I ever make it to endgame. My main ran some lower guildies through RFC last week and made one shameful need roll on some green mail bracers that were somehow an upgrade for my level 30 warrior.
---
Honestly who cares what he has to say? What chance is there he holds the officer accountable? None.
---
What’s this quest log add on?
---
At 49, you should start considering spell damage items. I personally would not use that staff. It has a lot of stats, but in my experience I really felt the effect of spell damage in your level range, and would highly recommend you start looking for it. For example, if you can get vexing cane, that would be really great:https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18082/zumrahs-vexing-cane. 
---
As to whether it was a good price or if it will change in price, I do not know.
---
Thanks man. I think it will be fine :)
---
I don’t have an issue with this; Hypnotic Blade is a pretty good dagger in a bracket where few daggers drop
---
Our raid had this rule that if you get 1 item per run you can't roll on other items if someone who didn't get one yet needs. It was an agreement that Benediction is not part of that, because it'd be retarded to have all priests pass on everything because everyone wants that item from the second to last boss.
---
Yea I guess you know what happened. Friend won the roll, item went to the girl in the group. Bottom tier performer even after she got the staff. Good investment. They kicked the non guild raiders (fillers) to go with a full guild group this week. Which is totally understandable but I silently hope they'll realize that their own healers blow.
---
Star man doesnt actually understand what the add on does. All it does is provide a nice UI to LFG chat so you dont have to stare at the messages that scroll by. They just populate a list. The people who appear on the add on are the same people in LFG chat
---
Tfw when I got got permma banned from his sub for suggesting that asmon may have some liability in cultivating a toxic audience. I guess he believes in absolute free speech to the point its worth it causing him life changing amount of anxiety as a result of being such a huge figure and the toxicity he receives, but on the same hand ban any dissenting opinions on how to not cultivate a toxic community.
---
Oh that makes sense. All X should always be need. Kinda obvious now that I think of it. I've never been in an all x group but I'll remember this for when I am. 
---
Really that makes this guy a worse ass. Say all greed, people trust you, now he can guarantee he gets w.e he wants because most people are honest. It's still shitty behavior
---
The absolute dream
---
Yeah this isn't about the video's OP, it's about someone who said they try to make sure an NPC always gets the last hit.
---
The thing that hurts the most in this clip is the bugged totem of grounding that kicks in way too late :&lt;
---
With a buyout or 420 69 69...I can literally HEAR my eyes rolling
---
Your character looks so sad :(
---
Too late, you don't heal back to 100%.
---
It's definitely a huge misunderstanding that there's not enough quests in Classic. Sure if you only do quests and don't touch anything else, you won't hit 60 just off quests, but as long as you're grinding or doing dungeons as you go, you'll be totally fine. My 60 warrior didn't even touch WPL/EPL, and i barely grinded or did dungeons in the 50-60 bracket.
---
It's a hunter weapon though! /s
---
&gt;No need to downvote me over a modest error like that, though.
---
Wasn't me, but that's literally what the downvote button is for. It's not a personal dig at the poster, it's a "this post has erroneous or bad content" button.
---
Don't take it personal, it's working as intended.
---
Yeah, I forgot to state that I usually do it with our guild main tank, who's also the GM and by the far the only guy who knows how to tank in our server lol. And I know about hotkeying feign, i just didn't get around to doing it yet
---
Just a simple /p macro where I tell what loot rules my party is going to use. E. g. Need/Greed, chests rolling, BoEs all Need, etc.
---
A DPS warrior will already be tanking if you go with a regular tank besides him though.
---
How is a protection warrior going to hold aggro against sweeping into ww into cleave?
---
There is no concrete item price for blue items/epic items.  It's worth however much you can sell it for.  If you're selling an item, lets say precisely calibrated boomstick on AH, and it's the only one up there, You've got to just post it up for a reasonable amount and see what happens.  Big ticket items frequently do not sell quickly, you may have to post them multiple times.  In this situation, sometimes another person will put the same item up but undercut you by a few gold.  Now you have a good reference point for the going price.  When your auction expires (but your competitors auction is still up) you can advertise in trade chat saying "WTS Precisely Calibrated Boomstick cheaper than AH."  
---
Theres a hussle involved to sell items at a premium, and it's part of the game that many of us love.  Right now I've got a bid on Devilsaur Gauntlets for 50g.  The going buyout price is 75g but there was a set of gauntlets that were on "long" timeframe that I put a 50g bid in for last night before I went to bed.  This morning before I came to work I expected the auction to be finished, but it still said "long" on it and I was still the high bidder.  I can't wait to get off work and see if I won Devilsaur Gauntlets for 25g less than the going price on AH.  The seller put a low bidding price, set it at 49g and hoped to make his auction stand out.  This is another strategy you could use.
---
If there's another precisely calibrated boomstick on AH but the price is way too high - lets say 900g, a low bid price is a good strategy.  You put your precisely calibrated boomstick up for 877g with a starting bid of 250g (which is a much more realistic price).  People are going to see the really high buyout price and the 250g bid - and they might bite on your bid price which is actually closer to what the item should probably sell for.
---
Mobile WoW? Well, phones are faster than 2005 PCs, I guess.
---
does this work with MotW to?
---
Sorry that happened. Don't group with people using their tags and try to warn others when you see recruiting in trade chat. Guilds like his don't last. Asmongold is used to retail where you can constantly xfer/name change. In Classic, his reputation will stick.
---
PS: O btw, in that situation it is common for party leader to say all need, not all greed. I would have just needed and then rerolled in the party.
---
You have yet to explain how "gold is not gold" and at what point gold becomes "not gold".
---
And yes, I am aware that you actually can't explain that. Because it makes no sense.
---
But it is always nice to claim not explainable things and then pull the "haha, you are stupid because you don't know it, bye!" card. It is the bread and butter of flat eartheners, anti-vaxxers and other such ... individuals.
---
Its silly the size of wow players that actually believe this. 
---
All need always, that's the way she goes.
---
What? There was a master looters that was banned. I'm still mostly talking about master looters ninjas
---
Depends on if you want a heap of gold now or want to make consistent gold over the life of Classic.

It takes like five seconds, meanwhile you can kill more things. I’m plenty chill my man, it just blows my mind how people don’t understand the mechanics of this game.  I don’t disagree that there are times to use succy, and even imp when you’re alone - but to say there’s no use for void is just plain idiotic.
---
No. But you lose the new added hp. So you don’t heal up. The health bar goes down.
---
It’s like taking off all ur gear with a gear wardrobe addon and putting it back on. Just changes the top end of ur hp.
---
Did he report him? As others in this thread stated, this might very well be a reportable offense
---
While I do agree that BoE are better as gold jackpots, and should be needed on to prevent ninjas, I dont agree with the discussion regarding the system. The system as its intended is very clear, greed for vendor/ah, need to equip. 
---
The fact that players and ingame economy has decided that BoE is worth a lot more in the AH than equipping it, is beyond the point.
---
I’m rolling a human Paladin. 
---
 Specced talents are all protection tree. I’m not too worried about how long it takes to kill something. I have absolutely NO interest in tanking 5 mans or raids at end game. 
---
I just want to live forever. I never want to corpse run again. 
---
What’s my stat priority? 
---
How do you feel about how redoubt and shield specialization? 
---
Thanks in advance to any masochists that are doing/have done a build like this.

Alliance pvp XDD
---
Bad rep didn't stop ninja in vanilla.
---
wow wtf is wrong with all you repliers here?? toxic retail brats you are!
---
Yeah that's totally fair, and I do think that's the only real case of ninja'ing, switching to ML right before a boss. I will say though that it's not possible to switch mid combat, so it's quite possible to see the ML swapped and then not kill the boss.
---
Yeah I remember actually watching him during that and it was very clear he was being facetious.  Now I could definitely see some idiots in his guild thinking he was serious.
---
I’m level 60. Already leveled at “that pace” man... and I used void for a lot of content. You just don’t understand how this game works.
---
Well it really just comes to down too would you rather a higher amount of gold right now, or, would you rather consistently make a lower amount of gold; always, going forward.
---
Why would you not want to tank? Tanking gives you the privilege to pull and you get more rage because all the mobs are attacking you (ideally). 
---
Why do so many people find it more enjoyable to dps as a warrior? Just because of the higher numbers?
---
Those numbers are incorrect, because twitch will not ever admit there are underage users on their site for liability reasons. 
---
Devin Nash did a pretty interesting talk about it. Key point. Notice they only talk and release data about the core demographic. No data on the over 49/under 18.
---
But this can even be figured out logically. If 55% is 18-49 that would mean 45% are 49+. Thats obviously wrong. Probably best to compare it to a similar demo like reddit where only 7% of the userbase is over 50. 
---
So probably 40% ish of twitch viewership is under 18

How many times man has asmongold said he and his trusted guildies are going to do what they want in their guild. You raid with them, you play by their rules. Its literally that simple. 
---
Oh right, you didn't think something like this would happen because you're you. Got it 
---
His guild is literally that guild or player everyone hated back in the day. Only reason y'all witch hunt him so badly is cause he said he didnt care about what reddit thinks and being able to actually watch him do it on twitch or YouTube and clip it.
---
Like father like son
---
Damn thats a solid change they should have implemented in classic
---
Yep, one after the other. That said, you don't usually put down all four, so it's manageable. During solo leveling I mostly just use one or two totems, depending. If the enemies hit hard in melee, I put down stoneskin, otherwise I don't. The one totem I put down all the time is mana spring, but people seem divided about its usefulness. I like it a lot, others claim it's worthless. 
---
In groups you tend to go 3 totems or so, but keep in mind that you usually pop them at the beginning of a fight and then just leave them standing. So it's not constantly placing totems, just three, four times at the beginning of each fight.
---
Just perks of being a GM, GM's buddy/GF, or the guild's main tank.  
---
Dealing with complaints and petty squabbles is his own decision and he could as well just leech on them letting the side-guilds go down to shit too.
---
His mindset is pretty cancer towards people outside his guild though because he is fine with being opportunistic if it serves the guild.
---
So glad to see people coming around. I've always thought he was insufferable
---
Wouldn't Master Looter work here better that it being completely random?
---
This is exactly what made me quit wow the first, second, and fourth time.
---
Which situation? Telling everyone to roll greed and the rolling need yourself? Or simply rolling need on an item you can use without any prior communication?
---
All kids are different... Mine didn't ever want to sleep... It was a long 2 years lol now hell sleep through the night, but doesn't always want to take a nap so he can be cranky.  Nothing Cars 3, Coco, Despicable Me 3, or Hotel Transylvania 3 won't cure though.  Don't know why he won't watch the other ones in the series....🤣.
---
Dunno if Goth is playing classic
---
Then why are you saying "this is exactly the situation I'm talking about"?
---
I'm sorry if your English isn't very good but don't argue semantics if you can't make your points clear.
---
Total profit from all that vs the money you would have gotten from vendoring that: 50s.

this is hilarious 😂

He's a grown ass man and still calls/texts his mom to order him pizza....
---
Fair wages for tanking those dungeons IMO.
---
The chance of a second hit is simple additive probability. **Given a WF proc has occurred**, you have two strikes with 20% independent chance, so 40% to get another proc.
---
What server is this?? I already love it
---
Or be a lvl 80 dk with lvling gear. I used to sell runs to get the fos when blizz warned us she was being remade for 80
---
&gt; But the mage uses blink to close the gap and appear right next to him 
---
The mage didnt blink to close the gap , he used blink because he lost Line Of  Sight of the shaman
---
This is spot on. Also you don't want to be energy starved at any point. Always make sure to have enough for a kick.
---
Go holy instead. The prot tree is weaker overall.
---
Warriors bag a rogues job
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
I mean, come on people. If the rule is all greed and they aren't going to cheat then all need is just as good. So the only reason to call for all greed... Is to cheat!
---
Lmao ruining a long time friendship for 400g. What a loser of the highest magnitude.
---
Except he gave hand of rag to someone else in the guild.
---
Oh, I doubt he cares where the clicks come from. Any attention is good attention, and this post has rocketed to the front page. No WAY he doesn't cash in by twisting this shittiness into some content.   
---
Scummy all around
---
Do you have trouble with processing written language?
---
I fucking LOVE this community.
---
You guys are mad when we PvP for the leather, and now you're mad when we don't? Holy shit this community is something else hahaha.
---
Make up your mind??

The hunter joke was more about "Everything is a hunter weapon" or forgetting to dismiss their pet if you do a skip, so you pull the entire instance.

Forscythe run to center...Mogris run to the center...what ebbr you do do not stand next to udder people. Okay forscythe center. Just heal me....
---
In my experience when I got to SM I was holding exactly zero threat with consecration and the 3 talents into improved RF.  Got the next rank at 40/42 I think it was and it made all the difference, was night and day.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
This also applied to guilds selling mythic mounts from current raids. They say something along the lines of "you will pay us 1million gold if we loot you the mount, do you agree?" that way if they loot it to you and you dont pay, you're a violator of the terms and the other way around too.
---
Lets make this the meta that everyone rolls need on epic BoE items.  Everyone needs gold, just because you have a level 11 alt warrior doesnt mean I can roll on skullflame shield as a hunter because my alt needs it.
---
exactly this is why i go 6/8 on my feral. i also cant justify paying 300g on my server for devilsaur. wrist,belt and hands cost me like 50g total to so.
---
Ice cold

Another gnome fire mage here. I feel you, bro.

Yeah that wouldn't fly in a PUG lol
---
Im sorry that you put yourself through that, next time you'll know better my man.
---
If you don't realize that leading the guilds is moreso to engage his community and have stream content I don't know what to tell you.
---
Sounds like the Cult of the Damned....
---
I'm guessing we gotta look for Icecrown Citadel on the North Pole soon.
---
They aren't both right. Non sequitur fallacy. 
---
Guy 1 says: trees don't produce or reduce oxygen
---
Guy 2 says: no, because trees take in carbon
---
Statement two has nothing to do with statement 1. It doesnt matter the truth value of the statement, in this context it is fallacious, and he was wrong to respond with a truthful but inconsequential argument.
---
I think it's pretty simple... if you'll equip it, it's a need.  I think the basic social contract of respect requires more nuance than that (onspec &gt; offspec &gt; pvp), but that's what need means. 
---
If you just need gold, bc we all need gold... that's greed.
---
BattleNet friend, not a real friend.  They may have ran a group together once, who knows.
---
I said same thing, pretty easy set up like the " hey I found this funny review on an item " when they wrote it. I'm surprised the guy offering didnt see them on AH for the 4G and buy them before OP. Cause hes obviously watching AH also.
---
And quit a week after because you played through it. :D
---
Me: "Sure Priest is slow but it's easier than Warr and this way we'll always have everything we need for a guild run :)"
---
The rest of my guild: ["Anybody levelled a DPS alt yet?"](https://imgur.com/yBkSYln)
---
Yeah, Roy's gonna split whatever gold he makes from it with whatever guildies were in the group. Everyone else can go get fucked.
---
Did my man really roll need and then not even try to post them up on a bank alt? A fucking idiot imo
---
Seems to me like this wasn’t a loot rule as much as a trick. He said all greed so everyone else greeded, and he could need. Still super scummy, but it’s not like he said he was included.  But either way, dick move.
---
Thanks for the leatherworing pattern, guildie!
---
If you haven't got one already, get a wrist brace. A better mouse (an MMO mouse with lots of buttons, maybe) will help too, but I absolutely recommend a wrist brace for prolonged sessions of PC use with wrist pain.
---
The pain will only get worse if you don't take care of yourself now.
---
There is no rolling in a true ninja loot.
---
Do you enjoy said ass smacking?
---
if you can't handle the vanilla pve "grind", how will you hack it in pvp? honor decay is ruthless
---
Commenting because I also need to know. I made bags mostly because sell better than white equips at vendors but never checked the profits of green boe equip.
---
Nobody "needs" BoEs as they're liquidable assets.

This

This is the correct answer.
---
And you would 100% be able to do that with my suggestion. You'd get Classic+ content, and then when Classic TBC was out, you could chose to not move your chars to TBC.
---
Enjoy healing at 60.
---
The old naxx isnt in the Game anymore after the new one came out though.
---
Always nice to give "payback" to people that didn't have anything to do with it. Oh, and obviously funny because he didn't seem to think it through what "pvp server" means.
---
A Guildmate mindcontrolled a Dwarf off the boat in Booty Bay.

The Dwarf deletes his character(s) on a PvP server to create a lvl 1 and [whispers him this.](https://i.imgur.com/3q2cOhr.png)

Reacting to other people's stuff. Sounds like you just described every news organization in existence. You might not like the business strategy, but it is legitimate and allowed.

Someone's reusing this

In classic you dont queue :)
---
The victim here isn’t a random though apparently. They’ve been friends since actual WoW classic came out.
---
I've never ninja looted in my life, and I will put on blast anyone who ninja loots. I just don't believe that banning people for that is appropriate, nor do I think need/greed system is covered by Blizzard's rules on ninja looting.
---
As an added note, I think that people complaining about these systems is why the need/greed system has been replaced with shitty forced personal loot so I think it's fucking stupid and ironic seeing people complain about ninja looters.
---
If there's an example of him not being sarcastic and saying "of course don't ninja guys even if it helps the guild", then that would classify as sarcasm.
---
Asmontard is the classic "hurr Durr I'm only pretending to be retarded" comic irl
---
na that mage just sucks, one arcane explosion just then and shaman would have been dead, bad player.
---
I bought a "strategy collection" off of a seller on barnes and noble website for $10 supposed to include an atlas, dungeon guide, class guide, and maybe a couple other books.

They send me the "not for resale" beginner guide that was included with the battle chest around wotlk times.
---
I can’t see the number of upvotes on the post, but I would be surprised if it’s greater than 50% of the ~300k subscribers to this sub.  Different people upvote different things, and causes this inconsistent hive mind effect you’ve noticed.
---
"all greed" should only be used when something has the potential to be used by someone in the group, in case they want it, and it's an item that's not so expensive as to override anyone's need to equip it.
---
This is one of those items that's too expensive to just equip right away (someone could benefit from equipping it, sure, but everyone could benefit from selling it), so you really should be going "all need."
---
Still this guy's an asshole for setting rules and not following them and as a party member it would be hard to just say "no I'm going need" at that point. This is exactly why personal loot exists.
---
36% is the correct answer. Two independent events with a chance to occur are not additive (if it were, shamans would be guaranteed to get a WF proc every 5 attacks).
---
Doesn't sound like classic is for you.
---
Born feral, we get it.
---
I still make 'yo mom' jokes in /1
---
I personally make anywhere from 20g - 60g an hour fishing, but that requires a skill level of 300 to do, which takes a long time to get to.
---
It’s all about that investment in your character.
---
It needs to be in the addons folder, the first one you said. Could be you need to take a folder/folders out of the sevenleaves master folder.
---
There's always one person like you who sees two comments by people going "who cares" and the rest of the 9000 comments are positive but decides to focus on the negative ones. It's good karmawhoring tho.
---
If it's BiS for their damage, yes of course.
---
What server was this on?
---
Are you claiming that he never changed his opinion on Ninjalooting at all? That he still encourages it to everyone in the guild and promises promotions to all who ninjaloots?
---
I'm not sure if you catch that you are actually making more harmful claims about your idol than i am.
---
Here is the layout I always use for every class, tank, heals or dps.

Bars 1 &amp; 2 are setup to page to 5/6/7/8/9/10 by using shift, ctrl, alt; this gives me 48 buttons in 2 bars space. Most of my rotation is on \` 1 2 3 4 q e, and then the same but modifier versions.  
---
Bars 3/4 are stuff like buffs, professions, pet summons, other utilities and just fade in on mouseover.
---
This is the loot they need and they don't have better options, even tho I am sad AF that wars take away items from me its fair and nothing to be angry about.
---
Yeah, though I guess some (eg ninja looters) could say that the drama of ninja looting is part of the experience and contributes to server communities.
---
It really isnt
---
Yes? It’s just as good for warrior  as it is for rogue, probably more useful than a Druid having it. In classic the gear isn’t as streamlined, some leather REALLY is best in slot for warriors.
---
Idk why you blanked their name id let it be known cause i fucking hate these random pms from people who's guilds are filled with the worst types of people 90% of the time.
---
Might do that as well.. Thanks
---
Sad there needs to be a policy against humans being filth, but I guess that's the way it goes sometimes.
---
Someone's reusing your post!
---
Guy spamming reddit should get penis cancer
---
Blizzard probably won't do anything. Just a greedy, horseshit company that will just reply with "unfortunately, due to the massive amount of dicks we gag on 24/7 we are unable to help you with your request."
---
Even more sad, you'll get this message after 3 days of waiting.
---
Are you upset that people ask once you're in group? Why wouldn't we ask?
---
So if it's going to be an issue, maybe we leave Kara for Classic TBC. I don't see a problem with that. There's plenty of other cool things they could add in Classic+.

100% he wont care, He will laugh and say I would have done the same thing

###YIKES
---
from me fam
---
In groups I always tell the healer not to worry about me, I'm going to tap for mana but I can eat/drink/bandage/drain/pot/stone. I also keep a ss over your head, refresh it on CD, and never pull aggro, so I should be the least of your worries.
---
I play healer too, so I know how few healing spells this Classic mana bar can hold. You won't need to waste them on me unless you really want to.
---
Yes, it is okay to roll need on all BoE blues/greens, I just don't think most people do it as they're just vendor trash for the most part, and I don't care to put them up on the AH so it's easier to simply roll for who gets it. And fuck yeah I'm rolling need on expensive BoE Blues. If you think i'm gonna greed on an assassin's blade you're out of your mind.
---
So let’s say you sell each of these for 50g..
---
22,000 gold right there. That’s sick.
---
one could argue them doing this is part of the classic experience
---
"most people" - wow, that is some claim.
---
Imagine undercutting by 70g though wtf
---
Yes it is possible. I believe the level requirement for BRD Is 48. A good group of 52s can easily clear to Lord Incendius.
---
Yeah I clearly shouldn't be arguing statistics. Especially with this massive hangover. That was just ridiculous.
---
&gt; Yeah, Blizz customer service has traditionally been great. Just a simple:
---
Next joke please.
---
Yeah, I wouldnt have a Problem with it either. Just wanted to clarify that we didnt have 2 of the same raid at the same time.
---
Triple nice
---
Grr how dare someone have the fucking audacity to ask me a question.
---
Okay if I say I kick you for being a useless party member, then that's how it is. Get over it.
---
Lol dude needs to get over himself.
---
I have a warrior friend with this mentality.
---
He spends hours trying to get into groups. Be prepared for that, because in the same way you don't want to heal or tank, they don't want a druid for DPS.
---
I play a druid, and I have sympathy, but I'm also realistic about it.
---
Lol cry me a river. Welcome to devilsaure farming salty boy. After the "I'm telling your mom!" Did not work you try the name and shame on Reddit lol.
---
If you do this with everyone who steala Devilsaur leather off of you, you will make 10 reddit posts a day.
---
My vanilla experience was trial and error. Do what works best for you.

Signed,

Someone from the shadows that hasn't played in years.
---
Paying attention to your threat in leveling dungeons as a warrior is irrelevant tho. If the mobs are hitting a mail/plate target, then that's good enough tanking. If you're trying to not pull aggro on anything, the pull is going to take twice as long and the healer will be oom from healing some nonsense that dragged on way too long.
---
tiananmen*
---
So? One item. Cool
---
hahaha, nicely done by him! Playing WoW for the first time, and I love ninja loot drama :D just love it when people get their time and effort stolen in a game and they cry about it 
---
also the loser typing REDDIT in chat xD
---
Threads like this pop up once every few days. If a high value BoE drops everyone should need it. That item is worth an upgrade to everyone because of the items value. The item is just a vessel for gold so wether someone equips it does not matter for a BoE. If people roll Greed on BoEs this can happen.
---
So bothered you had to post twice?
---
How fucking stupid do you have to be to be in olympus and ninja loot.  Let alone that.  I've watched a bunch of clips of asmon kicking people for ninjaing.
---
LOS is real though...
---
Go back to LH we dont need your toxicity
---
Ain’t nobody white knighting him, buuuuut you still haven’t gave an example guy. If you’re gonna try and shit on my comment, at leaaassttt try and answer it to validate the point made.
---
So you... actually think.... he promoted people for ninja looting? I'm legit shocked you're this dumb
---
Yea, asmons a shit person who hangs around shit people and you went and joined the server they all said they wanted to shit up.
---
Pro-tip, never play with his guilds, if you dont present yourself to get fucked, you might not get fucked.
---
Why would they work on classic+ if they can just launch classic TBC and people will play it?
---
I'm not seeing anything (besides trunk farming) that is profitable about fishing at the moment.  As far as I'm concerned, fishing has been a bit of a disappointment so far.  I am just at about 250 though, and haven't yet fished in Azshara which is where the money is supposed to be.
---
What you're saying is that you would rather your group sit around for what could be 45+ minutes waiting for a tank because you prefer clicking the shred button and not swipe. If you just wanted to play only dps all the way to 60 why play the class thats expected to flex the most?
---
Highly recommend getting cloth (i.e linen, wool, silk etc) from instances. The drop rates outmatch those in the outside world.
---
You think a leveling DPS warrior is adding 50% of the group damage if he can go all out?
---
Besides, this isn't only about leveling.
---
Enraged^2
---
99% of things are liquidable assets, wtf are you even talking about.
---
&gt;Just like Priest needs on Plate items cuz he 'needs' the vendor money
---
Just stop.
---
PS. I like how you ignore most of what im saying to continue to hyper focus on the specific topic of ninjaing BoE's. Ill ask again; Now what about the other 99% of the time?
---
The dirty little neck beard report him he will get a temp ban it will drive his little fedora wearing head crazy he will probably smash up some of his prized anime figures
---
I see how it is. Carry on.
---
Try being a warrior who can't tank. I pretty much only dungeon with guildies.
---
I'm getting nauseous with someone not remembering something counting as any sort of evidence whatsoever, and the mentality of *anything* seemingly negative about the game "probably" being introduced in some late patch just before TBC because there's no way vanilla could've had any flaws.
---
To be fair, they did change accounts to repost
---
Because then you can't sell BoE's wut do you even play this game
---
I'm on BB as well and this has been my experience. As a tank, I've rarely had trouble with rude/stupid/impatient people in dungeons (ok, maybe a couple dumb mages) and everyone is generally chill and nice. I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen spellcleave groups advertising.
---
On the flip side, the bulk of the population is still leveling up. There isn't much of an endgame scene yet and the endgame economy hasn't grown significantly. I can't sell my Arcanite transmute most days. Also, there are so few 50+ tanks that when I'm not around, my dungeoning group generally can't get a run going because they can't find a replacement.
---
They completed the quest, and then the egg drops on the ground. Anyone can pick it up.
---
I realize this, but I'm more interested in their personal choices and reasoning that led to them having to walk everywhere.
---
the guy is clearly a dick
---
The won’t make new content only reshape old content that can fit into classic...goood luck with playing new content in classic.....
---
Looking forward for the time you lose a massive bow upgrade to the warrior that need a good bow for pulling.
---
I assume you're talking about while soloing?
---
Health is a resource. While I understand the impulse to use TC to reduce incoming damage, think of what it costs you. It does very little damage, and because it reduces your damage taken, it also reduces your rate generated. That means that not only does spending rage and GCD make inefficient use of rage and GCD, it actively reduces your kill speed afterwards. Thunderclap is worth using against multippe mobs, but in a 1 on 1, unless you actually need the damage reduction it's a total waste.
---
Not true at all, just deleted the old one that said the exact same thing.
---
Yeah I thought whoever rolled same highest number last wins if group loot rules apply.
---
Cool argument of "lol ur dumb", really gonna get far with that one. Aight prove the clip wrong! If he's an upstanding guild leader then it should be easy to find evidence of him kicking or discouraging ninja
---
What are your professions?
---
I would spam dungeons for all the gear you need, plenty of gold to be made doing that, along with the occasional mining if you have, and killing bats in EPL(high lvl ones near stratholme backdoor) while waiting for dungeon groups
---
A lot of servers have the so called "Devilsaur Mafia" these are two guilds on both sides who work together for control of the leather. They wont attack one another but will attack every other player farming devilsaur leather.
---
Is there a public plan for the phases like when we might get bgs?
---
Heard someone else on here say tie goes to the person with the first name alphabetically.
---
cope
---
Hm, I am playing WoW for the first time and I would define need and greed as followed
---
I just need, on what I want. I dont care, if its more tailored for your class or something along these lines. I also dont care that you have less time then other people and justify your need for it. Just press need if you want it, and be done about it. RNG takes the rest. I lost so many rolls on items I could have really needed, but my question is:
---
WHO THE FUCK CARES?! I will just do it again until it is done
---
Thats why when people cant stop spamming group chat with rules and reasons how to roll, I will definitely ninja the shit out of them if something important drops
---
...and then I will reap the sweet sweet tears of neckbeards and fat tumbler wales *.*
---
Druid is amazing. but no, you are not a dps.
---
you are a bit of everything but not particularly good at anything (and that doesn't really matter for low dungeons anyway)
---
all you need is 5 points in furor, and to swap forms as you need (you should be popping in and out of cat with furor for mana-&gt;energy conversion anyway as pure dps...)
---
if your healer is low, you pop out of form and you heal.
---
if your tank loses aggro and mobs are charging on the backline you go in bear and taunt them off the dps.
---
if you play cat only then you're just a really bad rogue and doing druid completely wrong mate.  
---
raiding they only really viable as boring healer, but in dungeons honestly the best way to play druid is this "i do whatever we need at the time" style and they really excel at being an off-dmg off-heal off-tank all at the same time. very versatile.  
---
but yeah, pure cat form is just a really bad rogue.
---
I liked the system before the forced PL better, but the reality is forced PL only affects Mythic guilds. 
---
In PuG world, there's no reason to allow for even an inkling of drama with bullshit like ML.
---
Now of course, PL wouldn't work in vanilla, hell, not even later armor class based systems would work, cos there's a lot of completely legitimate need rolls you can make (ie: DPS warriors in leather, Holy Paladins in cloth etc). 
---
So it's a flawed system that's the result of haphazard itemization that wasn't fixed until TBC. There isn't really anything you an do about it and in pugs ninjas will occasionally happen. Ideally, they get punished by the community..
---
Druid tank here, can confirm
---
Asmongold is the cancer of WOW.
---
Because I think it's stupid that the same community that talks shit about modern WoW and it's issues comes to Classic and complains incessantly about people using it. Banning negative social interaction is how we kill all social interaction to begin with.
---
And yes I agree with you entirely! I am not defending ninja looting nor am I trying to normalize it! I think it should be entirely on people to shame the person and refuse to group with them, but banning and crying to GMs every time someone takes your loot is absurd.
---
Reminds me of yesterday. I was like "Now we just need a tank" "Vein has come online" "well there he is"
---
The person that made this deleted their original post in the old one.

https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/daulhr/fyi_if_i_say_i_am_a_dps_i_am_a_dps_i_do_not/
---
&gt;Why does this happen 9/10 times? Why can't I just play the role I like without being questioned?
---
Becauae finding tanks is a pain in the ass and youd save everyone 20 minutes by agreeing to tank. Tanking and dpsing in low dungeons is basically the exact same thing anyways. I floored that you're upset by people simply asking you to tank.
---
Why of course I want to spend money to gear your alts
---
If you're a Fury warrior, you do not have the gold to spare to buy it at the AH.
---
Mark of the Chosen proc gives you 250hp for 1 minute. Bit better than reducing damage by 25. What's your other trinket? Force of will is decent for aoe tanking iirc.
---
Shame about the male night elf.
---
Everyone should roll need on all BoEs. They are BoE people, if someone really wants it and needs to use, then have the people in the group trade them the item. This way you have a chance that it goes to someone willing to actually trade it/sell at a lower cost to the group member. Otherwise you always risk it having it be ninjaed by "that one guy".
---
yeah but thunderfury isn't an axe
---
Literally talks just like him lol
---
I have guild invites set to auto decline. I get the pst i say "inv" they say your on auto decline, i ask how to remove it, they blabber on and about how to accept guild inv while i pretend to no understand meanwhile im really jst questing wherever i am. Finally i tell them "I know its on auto decline. April fools. Haha" some are angry some just lol
---
My thoughts about low-level content is usually this.....
---
How often did the tank die because I couldn't output enough healing?
---
How often did the tank die because I ran out of mana?
---
Choose the gear which will help with the most common problem.
---
That's your fucking problem though???
---
Oh you have fucked up
---
By looking at the other lanes the cars in his country drive on the right.
---
And by looking at his position in the lane he is in the right of the car.
---
Which means yea hes in the shotgun seat
---
Fuck Royson.
---
I’m pretty sure they originally needed rep, but it got changed later on
---
That's not how percentage works.
---
But they aren't going to ban them because 99% of what people call ninja looting isn't actual ninja looting as blizzard describe it. You need have written rules stated in a public in-game chat like raid chat which are then clearly broken.
---
Needing on an item and vendoring it or switching to master loot if no rules were established is not bannable. It's not even bannable to say there's no reserves on discord then taking something as a reserve later because third party clients don't count.
---
This is just wasting GM time.
---
Gromsblood is super common, black lotus is super rare.
---
One again you cherry pick a hyperspecific example of an item that cant be vendored.
---
How about Hand of Justice? A priest could totally roll need on it just to piss off the group. Should that be allowed cuz he "needed" the vendor money, or is it clearly ninja looting because priests obviously dont use HoJ?
---
If everybody went by the logic of needing things for the gold value, everybody would need everything - BoE or not.
---
Yea, says much about this human relationship :D
---
I dont really think this guy considered him as a friend...just a guy who plays WoW the same time he usually does...
---
also the defintion of a friend is really widely spread along you reddit guys
---
Miss click happens.
---
I always used Star for Sap, Diamond was Banish, Moon was Hibernate, and Square was Poly. Maybe I am a weirdo tho. :D
---
Forced PL cuts out social interaction in loot. It's a fucking awful system that kills looting and makes it an incredibly unfun process that only works if you play singleplayer. You're right, it's good in a world of PuGs, but Blizzard shouldn't be catering to PuG players in a fucking MMO.
---
It is pretty callous to see another player getting stomped by mobs, and you can help them, and don't. You don't have to, but it's callous. If you don't like being called callous... then either be more, or less.
---
I literally never saw people doing it until epic BoEs and recipes in 50+ dungeons.
---
We had someone get mad we were asking once lol.
---
We were trying to grow our guild. GM made a contest to recruit people. Get like 3 points for max levels. 2 if they are 60. And 1 for the rest.
---
My wife and I both went crazy with it cause this was cata and at the time both saving up gold for mounts, I was trying to get my...i forget the name. The sandstone dragon mount? (you turn into it).
---
Anyways. Dude wasnt even in a guild guess i asked him after my wife. Simple as that but he freaked out, then swapped to an alt and went into all chat raging about our guild lol...I mean I suppose it gets annoying but how are we suppose to know your alt was the same?
---
I'm a mage and I'm for sure using it he can go and right the fuck off. Sure the other setup probably better but only slightly. That dude needs to get over it and run it again. Shit drops every other time and if you know what you're doing it will take you less than 30 mins to clear it.
---
Something warriors specifically can do is to tank stuff for compensation. Be it the first Strath Orb, a certain amount of Gold or all the unneeded greens by the group.
---
This is why all epic boe drops have been on a need basis
---
And if someone needs it because it's equipment, what then?
---
So he can't win? 
---
'dont so anything' - just as scummy
---
'do something' - lol he just wants more subs (well duh, obviously he is a streamer...)
---
[There you go, retard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ednAs_l4zuw) Now can you name all the players he promoted because they ninja looted? Don't bother replying, you won't have an answer.
---
So? He literally has stolen from his guild after saying he wouldn’t accept anything. You’d know he said that too if you really knew what was going on
---
It’s a video game, so you should only play it if you’re enjoying it.  I’d stop playing and start playing again if the itch comes back.
---
I dont like this :(
---
A new Path of Glory.
---
Get this man his breastplate stretcher.
---
This is why its always ALL need. That way you prevent a ninja.
---
It's clearly ninja looting because it's a BoP?? How is this even relevant? 
---
If a priest rolled need on a HoJ, I'd sure as hell be pissed, probably ignore them and blacklist their name on the server, but I'm sure as hell not gonna report them. That's fucking stupid.
---
Holy fuckin' shit. I *think* ;)  I knew this guy in vanilla/BC. I swear to fucking god.
---
He played a Troll Rogue on KT and was a bit of a legend back in the day for his ability to re-create a "dolphin sound".
---
It was uncanny.
---
&gt;I am one of the best healers in the game
---
No healer currently in SM is "one of the best"
---
You deserve a medal
---
What’s the first orb?
---
He, he won the roll, the rest lost. So what? Why they make a reddit post to cry about it? who cares for your lost item? I think he just tricked them for his own benefit and thats good enough in my book. Obviously the item/ gold for selling is bringing him more joy then these so called "friends"
---
It just says more about the quality of his "
---
friends"...
---
Oh my god, the REDDIT REDDIT message. Dude is practically crying MOMMY MOMMY HE TOOK MY TOY!
---
Too funny
---
The mage looked like my awkward cousin at a party.
---
I don’t care if it’s better or not for the warrior. It shouldn’t be ok to roll on every type AND expect equal priority just because it’s better for you. I wear leather, if a cloth piece drops that is an upgrade from my leather, i will let the cloth wearers that ONLY wear cloth to have their chance first, then proceed to roll if the item is still up for grabs. If you chose to disregard that, you’re no better than the hunter.
---
Do you even play the game?  A fucking mount is not a hand of rag.  I don't even like Asmon but you're whining like a bitch
---
Until you FD and the mob gibs the healer because you didn't let the tank pick up the mob.
---
What do you mean "my"? Wow is created the way only the loot from the mob you tagged is "yours", skin is free game. It was always this way in vanilla and will get way worse when layering goes away. 
---
You might google Devilsaur mafia if it helps, should be some remains of it here and there.
---
No one's coming around. Reddit posts stuff that is anti asmon all the time, his viewerbase is doing just fine and he thinks it is hilarious to see reddit complain about him, if anything you may convince a few people, but his viewer count has never hurt because of stuff like this
---
Roysun has a megamicropenis so he is now trying to be a hero online - where no one can see his tiny prick and lough at him. 
---
Just report it, Blizzard will take care.
---
It's not relevant in the slightest if I don't play retail
---
It's 1.5 speed, with no usable stats for a rogue. Pretty bad if you ask me.
---
FTP
---
You must be the guy who read the tooltip and never actually used it
---
You forgot hunters.
---
That is so ass backwards I don't ever want to meet you in game. What a neckbeard thing to say.
---
Stairs are the bane of all ranged classes, not just hunters.
---
where are the rules of the loot in this post?
---
I'd probably stop bragging about this and uninstall the game. Or do some research in hunter stat priorities.
---
E.g. Int/spirit should be at the bottom of your priority list
---
The Mafias are frowned upon a lot. I for one dont really care, Ungoro is pure anarchy, people will steal your devilsaur leather all the time constantly. People will do that Mafia stuff, etc. 
---
Arguably, the Mafia stuff is more fun as you will at least be able to PvP against someone for it instead of just waiting for the corpse to rot.
---
So I only pull half the instance since I lack the bag space and throughput to clear the 2nd half (post wolf + bats).
---
After that it depends on your bag space and AH prices of cloth. The wool cloth can sell for 30s a stack on my server, silk for 50s a stack. I come out of there with about 1.5 - 2 stacks of wool per run. The raw money you pick up is bit over 1g per run if you clear the whole thing. 
---
Most of the greens and blues that drop don't sell for much on the AH so I just vendor them. But if you are an enchanter and the mats go for more, try DEing and selling on the AH instead. In total I vendor stuff for around 2 - 3 gold a run depending on how lucky I get with greens. 
---
The walk back to SS can be a brutal time sink but in the end, if you are looking for an easy spot with no chance of competition, I found soloing SFK to be worth it.
---
Keep in mind I'm now lvl 43 as of writing this. So at 49 you should have faster clears, with possibilities of even faster clears once you gear up at 60.
---
where does he declare the rules of the loot in chat?
---
Not to be that guy, but isn't this witch-hunting? I don't see how this thread stays up.
---
I've just about had it with Whitemane but I feel like I'm forced to pick between a server that is going to die as Alliance leave vs. transferring to a server that is going to die due to Blizzard neglect...and also possibly because of faction imbalance. 
---
How's the balance on AR? What's the population like? Do you get layered when you accept a group invite / crafting invite or is pretty much everybody on the same layer?
---
Why would you label it like that?  Truly what a weird thing to do you're not saving any space you're just making the legend more difficult to read...
---
Idk I love tanking. DPSing pugs as a warrior is kinda boring.
---
Asmongold is a weak man.
---
Thanks, I’m actually dumber after reading this.
---
This is why I just put ML on. If a BoE drops everyone rolls, I'll hand it out.
---
I just can't be arsed with people ninjaing shit or dealing with loot drama. I know I'm honest and fair, I've given tons of stuff to other people despite wanting it myself.. but such is life.
---
WOW
---
So you're calling anyone that buys your purple stupid for actually equipping it? An item is still an item.
---
Wow, this dude is pure trash
---
No, they are not comparable no matter which version of the game you're playing. It's still vender gold vs hundreds of gold. Not comparable. Your goals in the game do not matter. They are still not comparable.
---
Fast swords don't really exist in epic form but they make up for in high damage Sword spec.procs. which can trigger weapon enchants and procs. And yeah posions make up roughly 20 to 30 percent of your dps
---
Is mount gold the only thing he's had given to him? He knew he wouldn't be able to keep the hand without a ton of backlash anyway
---
Green quests give the exact same xp iirc
---
That’s a pretty good pvp build.. IMO not taking spirit tap is hurting your self. But that’s just me. When it’s all said and done. Play how ever you want to!
---
Jesus lol what a piece of shit
---
Yeah you’re an idiot.
---
Well Reddit taught me mages are the new hunters. So far that has not been wrong.
---
Nothing is ever deleted, just logically deleted.
---
cool, didnt know that. thanks
---
Lolol
---
Nah i think classic has brought back the Huntard. But In retail ive been saying this exact same thing for a few years now
---
Oh interesting. How did they know you were in a stroke? Did they stalk your reddit account?
---
Yeah fuck streamers
---
Yikes.
---
It's crazy how a lot of people from these guilds never got any more mature. Watching asmonds twitch and listening to his officers I'm like wtf
---
Righteous orb for crusader enchant I assume.
---
No point in being pedantic here buddy. When a whole raid is ”looking cool” the numbers suddenly make a difference. And as I said, if you wanna look cool while raiding, more power to you, I was just trying to explain to you why people theorize and discuss min/maxing. Based on your first comment it seemed like you didn’t understand the concept here.
---
If you dont understand humans are biased toward cooperative behavior and that the 'rational' response in your quoted matrix is actually demonstrably inferior the majority of the time in human interaction, I dont think you should be beating someone over the head with the aforementioned concept.
---
As a healer, tank threat really doesn't matter if it's just 1 mob slapping a DPS. I'd prefer higher group dps.
---
No, not that clip.
---
Insecure much?
---
If randoms are all you have available, it certainly isn't a bad option. I just prefer to generally roll with the people I know and trust as it completely avoids the drama you see in these situations.
---
Ah shit. I always play horde so I’ve only done the alliance dungeons a few times
---
it actually can be construed in that way.   If an item drops and someone says "Can everyone greed" that's a shorthand way of saying that they want to need it.  Of course the pass function is there so it's a little suspicious.  If there was a another post about some pre-agreement then we could see a scam but I don't see a clear cut blizzard banning scam, even if he is scaming, we need more information (that blizzard has anyways).
---
Obligatory "just do a screenshot" comment
---
Why would you care unless you are doing this yourself or know people who do?  This is purely being dishonest with the honor system.  I can imagine every little thing, no, but a 600 gold item?
---
Well you're free to make that decision to not roll but no one would fault you for rolling on gear you need.
---
Mods, delete this post for witchhunting.
---
Thats a raiding build, like the title of my post says
---
Fuck that imma need every BoE I see. Its a video game, of course people are going to lie.
---
I meant for retail
---
Most hybrid classes could in Wrath. I managed as an offspec enhancement shaman with little difficulty - it just took a while. I strongly suspect most classes had a way to cheese it.
---
Haha that is so smart, I will have to try this in Blackrock Mountain when people jump down to the BRD entrance!
---
Essence of Fires and other drops like these are a bit of a middle ground as they come from specific mobs. I will say though that if someone was needing on Essence of Fires I would just need on them too.
---
If the intention is to vendor, then it should be rolled off imo as it's a flat amount of money. If it's a valuable BoE that has a lot of potential money, then you should roll need as it saves getting ninja'd. It's purely safer.
---
You set the loot rules, by usually talking before starting a raid or dungeon. You know like setting free for all, round robin, or rolling for loot.
---
They aren't game-written rules, but if you call loot rules in a group and then break them, Blizz will enforce your called rules.

Mobs in live part of Stratholme (in a church to the left off main entrance) drop Righteous orb, boe component for the best melee DPS weapon enchant in the game. The price is established in 15-25g range, check your AH first.
---
I just deleted my level 52 rogue to create a shaman.

Would anyone like to spare 1g?

I love female dwaves for rogues on retail, sicne theyre more hobbit-like
---
Duo questing with a priest Is the best. We can mind control humanoids. Even solo. I did a chunk of elite quests by myself. Just gotta use the power of the mind!
---
If one mob is attacking a DPS player and they end up dying then your healer is asleep. Classic is easy as hell and DPS can actually stay up with one mob attacking them.
---
Holy crap, diablo1903 wasn't kidding, you just run around trolling and getting triggered.
---
Stuff like this needs to be a thing for people like you.
---
Healer only, huh? Man, the 80 million warlocks and mages I've seen running around with it sure must be stupid.
---
I'm curious what server this absolute douchebag is on.
---
And I do both
---
Ya know what else is ugly? Getting feared :P

He has to repeat things a lot because random people keep asking the same questions, "Why are you living your mom?" being one of them.
---
I seen several streamers getting really frustrated by it eventually.
---
By the looks of it he is the kind of guy who is pure cancer to have around if you are not friends with him.
---
Nothing unethical about it and It’s a good idea, just need to change the variables around in one of the current lfg mods on what keywords to search for.
---
I had 800ms yesterday consistent for about an hour and didn't notice the difference when it finally went back down to 80. But that's only in Pve. In PVP it probably would have been a bit different
---
I AM entertained
---
Stats are secondary on a weapon its about the damage heres some examples 
---
Bis 29 main hand sword has intellect (zealot blade)
---
Bis 39 main hand mace has +healing (hand of righteousness)
---
bis 59 offhand mace is has a proc only spellcasters would benefit from (hand of edward the odd) and more int
---
So what happens when your BiS drops and I need on it, following your logic.
---
Let's go with the example of you are a rouge and a weapon drops and I am a preist.
---
I am going to roll need because it's a good BoE.
---
That's fine yea? 
---
lost a tie when i was last, so nope.
---
Now you're just intentionally missing the point.
---
I get the whole BiS, and I have no issues with seeing a warrior in leather doing great dps, that’s great. But how your getting it is a different story to me.
---
Yea I was laughing too
---
Imagine wanting an item...and then pressing greed. I mean, I play WoW since classic launch, so I am an enormous noob, but...
---
How can you be this dumb? Just press need and be save. Beyond me surely
---
I hate it when people say this. 
---
Hunters are fun, especially in pvp. 
---
Plus you get to have a cool pet friend. 
---
Everyone knows terrible players pick druids and rogues,anyway.
---
That's because a blindfolded monkey can play a Mage.
---
He was obviously joking but classic wow subreddit is what it is.
---
Why should you automatically get Edgemasters because you can equip it when I could turn them into a Warden Staff or Truefaith or any other BIS boe?
---
Sheep is fucking broken right now without the pvp trinket in the game. Enjoy your sheep ap pom pyro combo while it's as strong as it can ever be.
---
Nah no tank involved this time. I was going to draw a dead mage on the ground but 
---
A) there's been enough anti-mage salt in the comments of the last few and 
---
B) I will take literally any excuse to be lazy and leave details out of a drawing
---
Yes but this is scamming not ninjalooting
---
Its best in slot for a lot of their gear.
---
&gt; Because they do this they're a certain age bracket
---
Alrighty kiddo.
---
Because vanilla itemization is limited and weird. There aren't enough items to give every spec of every class their own set of epics specifically tailored for them.
---
You should stop looking at it as "this class wears these items" and start looking at it like "this role wears these items". You'll find a lot more items in common between a fury Warrior and a Rogue than a fury Warrior and a prot Warrior.
---
imagine not clicking need on edgemasters...
---
Yes you can change your professions at any time, but keep in mind, if you drop a profession all progress will be lost. So for example, if you're level 100 in enchanting and you decide to drop it for tailoring but then decide you don't like tailoring and pick up enchanting again, you'll start back at level 0.
---
Enchanting and engineering are two very expensive professions. With enchanting you're essentially destroying valuable items that you could be selling for gold. The flip side is that enchanting in higher levels can be very profitable, so you're sacrificing gold now for potential gold making ability later. But that is essentially why people tend to choose gathering professions for leveling their first character, in order make some money during the leveling process. That said, there is no right or wrong answer, pick the professions you enjoy and play the game however your like; just know you're likely to have some pretty empty pockets early on with those professions.
---
Nah. I’m still low level (alchemy at around 130 at level 20) and am finding that Swiftness and Swim Speed potions are the money makers at this point. They sell for 20-40s a piece.
---
Everyone on his server should send him at least one in game mail expressing their feelings.
---
In most situations
---
Where should I look for groups when trying to get into a dungeon group? Should I go to ORG or to the zone the dungeon is at?
---
I guess it’s the emotional/empathy pull of feeling for the person that really would equip it right away, who really really wants people to just let that person have the item.
---
People get upset when guild members help each other out in ways that seem unethical to them, whether right or wrong. If you ask a few people how things should be or are usually done you’ll get multiple different descriptions and then they get upset when their expectations aren’t met.
---
Three cheers for NOT playing on the streamer server.
---
LOL this guy isnt instantly a pillar of the wow community just because he is an officer in some streamers guild. I wouldnt listen to some random chump tell me to greed. That is exactly how you get scammed.
---
People are giving this guy too much credit for nothing, and everyone that selected greed on that roll is gullible.
---
Link me other items that of that level that do the same physical damage. Actually a warrior weapon too.
---
Oh that's that shack on the coast in alterac mountains on the way to SM isn't it?
---
Mine too! Anybody got a lap top for me too?
---
U always roll need on epic BoE u just got tricked not his fault u ppl are stupid.
---
But the game is running on said PC, yes?
---
Limit your FPS or move your sound to the ports on the front/back, whichever you aren't using right now.
---
Can someone recommend me a Pala guide? I am new to WoW and am playing Warlock right now but other than this class pala interests me somehow.
---
Or maybe another tank (if there are any?) but Druid or Warrior don't interest me.
---
Hey it's all part of the eleborated "authentic classic experience roleplay". 
---
Or any other excuse. Flippety-Floppety I don't give a Fuckety
---
He’s selling the item, not using it. That’s not the intended use case.
---
yeah that will work up till about level twenty. not really worth doing since it just teaches bad habits.
---
Barrens Chat welcomes you
---
yikes
---
Just burn the motherfucker. it is not rocketscience.
---
It has been Blizz´s pov from ACTUAL vanilla that if you declare lootrules, and then do this, your ass is history. has happened many times before and will happen again.
---
also, sup with streamerworship? asmongold has always been carried, so his actual effort is questionable at best.
---
Some people in this game are control freaks. Crazy.
---
"literally half"

Your conclusion after 1 highlight video?

Pretty sure on reddit they still remove threads because if the identity of that person is known it can lead to cyber-bullying/suicide/other harm. Not that I want it removed, but I thought identities had to be blurred.

Why is this FOOL still BREATHING OUR AIR? UNACCEPTABLE!

I hate gnomes

That's not what that means and you know it.

Yup; this is directly against TOS and should result in a ban/flag.

You talking about your own? If you need CC while running leveling dungeons then you are braindead.

"I showed you I'm a dick, please respond"

if you're looking for easy karma, just comment on how shitty Asmongold is but you've never actually watched him stream before.

Honestly I’d play warlock. SPriest is kind of a 1v1 one trick in PvP. If you’re interested at all in premade BGs you should be aware that most “meta” class distributions for premade WSG and AB do *not* take shadow priests and shadow priests also have a harder time in AV than warlocks or mages. So just be aware that you’re ignoring 2/3 of your class so that you can do one thing (1v1 PvP) very well and everything else you’ll have a hard time grouping. That’s not to say you can’t be an SPriest only and get into raids, dungeons, and premade PvP it’s just going to be a lot harder than if you just played a warlock.
---
Agree 100%! But to add, it amazes me that like you said we are all older then why do so many give their time to these types of people?
---
I know the feeling, I was one of 2 druids in my vanilla raiding guild, left my first mc run with full t1 lol grats man
---
There are two mechanics at play here: happiness and loyalty. Feeding your pet raises it’s happiness, and you don’t need to feed it while it’s happy. So feed your pet when it drops to content or unhappy, and make sure you wait for the feeding buff to run its full duration (ie don’t jump into combat immediately after feeding). 
---
A happy pet will increase its loyalty over time, and an unhappy pet will lose loyalty. Low loyalty pets (like ones recently tamed) lose happiness pretty quickly and need to be fed frequently to keep them happy. High loyalty pets stay happy for longer and don’t need to be fed as often. 
---
So having a picky pet that only likes a few types of food is not so bad once you’ve had them for a while and gotten their loyalty up. But they can be a pain early on.
---
TradeSkillMaster (TSM) in classic. AnS was the best sniping addon when I played retail a year or so ago, though TSM works as well.
---
Thanks, ive heard the jaguars have a rubbish drop rate atm on classic compared to vanilla. Not sure if its intended or blizz will fix.
---
So we're expecting heavy storms. Thanks man I'll grab an umbrella.
---
In a perfect world, we'd distribute the gold evenly by default, for less variance in income.
---
so this is a healer staff cause some rando ahole you had the misfortune of stumbling across said so?  i dont think so.  some random person on the internet gets to decide sweet f all.
---
i feel that i have missed the sarcasm in you post.
---
It's a big deal when you're raiding and pulling gets a fire breath all over your raid.
---
Under what circumstance would they get banned
---
I think in this place youd need have it in chat that you were going to do that.
---
Yes, he said that people should stop ninja looting in the guild because he is receiving so many complaints about it. I don't see why he wouldn't act on it. But yeah, i'm sure that someone like you that probably doesn't even know him from the youtube days can judge his character.
---
Sure. But that's not the context here.
---
The context here is that the staff dropped and the mage rolled on it and the priest flipped his shit because he thinks mages should be allowed to roll only on the dagger and offhand regardless of whether they already have them.
---
Except that one guy who is legitimately needing because it's an upgrade. It's 2019, we're no longer maladjusted teenagers, we can behave like adults and we can out you on general. Used my brain.
---
doesn't seem worth mentioning at all until such time as they do a hypothetical TBC rollout.  Just going to confuse noobs with stuff like that.
---
Btw, as you mention downranking. Do not downrank your heal spells for mana efficiency reasons! In fact below reasonable amounts of +healing (like 200+) the higher ranks are the mana efficient ones.
---
Mage was once a respected and feared class now it’s just a meme
---
I see now, so it was just bad timing that they decided to strike?
---
Good point. Not like my guild is a bunch of hardcore raiders who will make use of me having it lol.

The only time he does not roll off tank gear is when the other tank is a druid.
---
If you needed it why haven't you bought it?

When it kicks off in the Weatherspoons

RPers will seldom be RPing in the places you frequent to do actual game stuff, so it's really not a big deal - if you do see some people RPing somewhere, just leave them alone. 
---
I'm not a big fan of talking in /say in general. I never understood those people who sit in some spot in the city and talk in /say about their day or what loot they got or whatever, but then again I'm a bit more private, so I dunno. Just don't do that. 
---
Obviously, if you see some people RPing, don't go around casting spells or AoEIng on top of them - actually, just don't do that to anyone, it's obnoxious attention seeking. 
---
You don't have to do any accents (and honestly, I generally consider the whole accent thing to be a bit hammy, but I get it, some have fun with that) - all party chats and world channels are completely OOC, and anyone who tells you otherwise is talking out of their ass. 
---
It's really no different from a Normal (or PvP if RP-PVP) server at the end of the day, just leave the /s and /y channels alone, especially when you're in a RP hub like Stormwind.

Why did you roll Need for a shield if you're Fury?
---
If she shows interest in PVP, suggest starting off on a Normal server while she learns the ropes and let her know she can transfer servers later if she still wants to.  PVP can be super frustrating when you're trying to learn this game, let alone having never played an mmo at all before.

This really clears it up! I've hit an absolute wall while questing and have just been losing motivation. I was questing in chartreuse, when what I wanted was clearly yellowish green!!

---
I realized DPS is generally missing when randoms started asking me, a hunter, to DPS for them. No one ever wants a hunter!
---
I think I know why.
---
Do people typically farm the mats for this to make the potions and sell them, or work for tips with other peoples mats? 
---
I’m just trying to find out what the most efficient way to make money off of this is.
---
Ok.
---
Mages still don't have a pet that they can forget to dismiss when utilizing skips in dungeons causing wipes by pulling dozens of mobs.
---
Hunters have Volley and use it over-confidently just as much as any Mage might use Blizzard because "muh feign death," except when they do it, they aren't slowing the mobs down nor are they doing as much damage.
---
Hunters are much more likely to break CC with Multi-Shot than any Mage is with anything in their kit.
---
Hunters can pull threat much more easily and routinely from tanks than Mages with instant cast abilities and white hits as they have much higher amounts of crit from Agi early on than Mages from Int.
---
Speaking of threat, Hunters have a threat wipe, so they'll dps as soon and as much as they want; Mages have no such luxury with Ice Block, so they are forced to hold back if they want to do more than eat the floor.
---
Man...you're a keeper.
---
And he’s kicked ninja looters from the guild already and other members for much less, we’ve yet to see what he’s going to do about this because he’s at twitchcon. So if he refuses to do anything or commends him for doing it then I will agree with you.
---
Yeah I was kind of thinking this. I didn’t want her to be frustrated with pvp while she’s learning general game mechanics.
---
it's refunded if it sells, right?
---
I think he’s saying the ninja gave up a friend just to gain a BoE.
---
Well, you are in IronForge and when you say dwarf and don't specify... things kinda escalate

I've been playing a bit of Resto Druid in dungeons (level 26 atm). Some questions about the UI:
---
* Is there a way to see which of my HOTs are active on an ally without clicking their name and looking at their buffs?
---
* Is there a way to see how long my HOTs have left to tick on my allies? 
---
If there isn't a way to see that info with the default UI, what is the least intrusive add-on that I can use to see that stuff?
---
Please forgive me but you gotta switch up that yee yee ass iBuypower keyboard.
---
All jokes aside my brother had one of those and it ghosted like crazy after a few months of use.
---
The turbo autism of the asmon hate brigade never ceases to amaze me. What's next? Olympus guild member goes on a killing spree and it's gonna be his fault too? Epic. Simply epic.
---
If something as mundane and typical as this situation upsets you this much then there’s not much advice we can give you.
---
I don’t think you were way out of line or anything. You needed the gear, and you usually tank. If you wanted to make sure you were polite, you could have asked the tank if it’s okay if you roll need. I’m a hunter, but I ask if it’s okay if I roll need if something is more suited for another party remember.
---
&gt; If you join a group that has a specific item reserved (and as such has master looter on), and a BoE epic drops only for the raid leader to take it for themselves, that is scamming and against ToS.
---
No, it's not scamming unless he specifically said that boes were up for roll.
---
The implication being that greed wouldn't bind it to your character. It's what Blizzard did on retail a few expansions down the line.
---
go to wow forums and scroll down.... tadaaa!
---
VC stands for DireMaul.
---
Because then "greed" has no meaning.
---
But more importantly...we're not all psychopaths...we should be able to trust people to abide by a social contract that need means "i'll equip this" and greed means "i want money".  It's pretty simple.
---
Your approach assumes everyone is psychopaths.

No reliable method to farm tons of gold, free food costs mana, can only sheep one enemy player at a time, have to instagib people because we cant wear plate, never have a fun fight against a warrior, cant socialize on airships cause we just port everywhere, balls shrink during iceblock, being the title of every damage meter etc.

P.S. At level 53 i got ganked by 2(two) hunters only cause i farmed their devilsaurs. Hunters are still the worst!

Asmongold is a toxic, elitist piece of shit. I mean, he doesn't hide it. The fact that you, with that information, draw the conclusion that therefore his personal character also is toxic just shows how lost you are. You are completely free to draw that conclusion, but it just shows how retard you are.
---
And no, it's not a bad analogy. It shows that people play different characters w/o any influence from their own life. If that is too difficult for you to understand, well too bad. It's in line with that low intelligence of yours.
---
The general rule of thumb for me is that if I'm playing a leather/mail class and cloth drops, the cloth wearer gets first dibs. If they don't need it, I will go ahead and need. It's the same for people rolling on BOE's for their "alt". 
---
If you start needing on cloth other cloth users need as a non cloth user your asking for petty shit to happen. When that nice dagger you need drops in a few mintues, don't be surprised when the priest needs it to disenchant because you rolled on cloth. 
---
With that said, if it truly is a minor upgrade for the cloth user, just ask and most will give it to you. Its the shit communication that causes most problems.
---

1. Why is asmongold popular? I watched like 2 of his videos and I want to stab him in the damn throat. Guy is unbelievably narcissistic over WoW.

2. Ban hammer can be applied for silly stuff like this.
---
Honestly it’s really no big deal to lend people mount money. I’ve lent varying amounts of 15-30g to 5 different people in my guild. The fact is for me, gold I just sitting in my bags accumulating. It makes no difference for me to lend 30g and get our back within the week. But it makes a huge difference to someone who can now get their mount a few days in advance.
---
Imagine thinking this actually will happen
---
Sure would be nice if idiots like you knew the facts and linking a post from 2010 doesn't help your case. Bottom line is loot rules should be stated beforehand in in-game party/raid chat. Anything that deviates from those agreed upon loot rules might qualify for a some level of GM involvement. Considering Blizzard already stated that loot support would be very limited in Classic chances are nothing happens.
---
I think the hunter stereotype is that hunters roll on every melee weapon when the vast majority of their damage comes from their ranged weapon. That's a little different because they'll only get marginal benefit from a melee weapon compared to a melee class, whereas with armor everyone gets more or less the same benefit from it.
---
Nope.

You’re probably right. It’s still hard for me to remember that there are players new to this no matter how many times I encounter it. I’ll add an edit.
---
He rolls off everything. The only thing he did not roll off was the binding.
---
(Assuming you meant, “a part”, not “apart”)
---
In short - for straight levelling, no, it shouldn’t be. The reduction in time between attacks is negligible and you need to be getting hit to generate rage.
---
At your level: Charge - rend - OP as it pops up otherwise autoattack and HS for rage dumps. 
---
You could try using the Hamstring method but it takes a bit of practice and a swing timer. Imo it’s a handy tactic for reducing downtime but not worth the effort so long as you’re pulling conservatively. YMMV. 
---
If you get a few extra mobs on the pull and they’re hitting fast, and the HS-spam-and-run-away approach isn’t an option then sure, chuck out a TS as a Hail Mary. But it definitely shouldn’t be a default part of your rotation.
---
Edit to add: ‘stacks of SA’ should also definitely  not be in your rotation for standard grinding.
---
If a high value item is someone's BIS, it doesn't make sense to rob them in that opportunity. Especially if its a pre-raid bis. Imagine failing that roll and future of these "all need boe" rolls. (Since the odds of winning are lowered by there always being five needs.) Why create an arbitrary decreased drop chance in the name of greed.
---
People shouldn't ninja loot. If it's a concern, and you and your friends are in the majority and just have one random, master loot and then just asign to what is actually someone's BIS.
---
It's just an act. I'm on his server in retail (not that I've played it in ages) and while I've personally not interacted with him (and that's by design) I know several people that have. He acts like a giant douchebag but if he thinks he's legitimately upset someone he'll privately talk to them about it. 
---
I don't see the appeal of his persona myself, but it pays his bills and it's easy enough for me to just ignore him so I don't really care.
---
Just imagine if they removed the dot limit!

Warning: Opinions to follow.

If you're running engineering on your main, you MUST have mining unless you have a high enough level alt to feed ore to your main.  I wouldn't even try this if I got to play 12 hours a day, however I suppose it could be viable after your main hits 60.  Engineering and Enchanting as your professions is a stacked deck against you making gold since you disenchant things that normally you could vendor and make gold off, and need gold to buy materials for engineering.  
---
Engineering is a fantastic profession, and it's usefulness isn't over stated (although it is constantly misunderstood).  It is misunderstood because in order to get the maximum benefit out of it, which is what everyone is talking about when they gush about how great engineering is, you've got to use a ton of consumables like sapper charges, and grenades.  If you're miserly about using consumables for whatever reason, you're going to have a less of a fun time with engineering.  If you don't mind farming materials to keep yourself constantly supplied with explosives, and don't bat an eyelash at using them on cooldown, then engineering is going to be a lot of fun for you.  However I can only recommend it if you have it paired with mining so you can be self sufficient to some extent.  If you don't have mining, you can't farm for your own mats (unless you do it on another character of course).  To farm mats with an alt, you're going to need an alt at a high enough level to access the content your main is on - to have access to relevant ore.  
---
You can drop a profession by opening the skill tab and selecting the circle with a slash through it to unlearn it.
---
This is legendary :D
---
Arugal?
---
I don't agree, if someone needs it and can use it doesn't matter if it's BIS as long as it's an upgrade and they actually equip it then they should get it. This whole everyone gets a fair shot a gold mentality is dumb at when people can actually use an item. If no one needs it then ya sure roll for gold

I love shreks, i mean they are my absolute favorite. I love their run animations , the way the look in armor, how their sexy green skin shines in the sunlight.

Why is it okay to name and shame this person for ninjalooting/scamming but it isn't okay to "start a witch hunt" and name and shame other people even with evidence?

Then he can trade it, knowing someone else didnt ninja it
---
Exactly.
---
No idea who he was til classic while waiting queue. She’s toxic and trash and rude.
---
Because he's a warrior and being a warrior he may need to tank dungeons in the future?
---
Don't listen to anybody op, rolling need on a shield as a warrior is beyond A-ok regardless of your role is in that particular dungeon.

if you are a lvl 38 rogue, she's just a toothless cat :D

Lol pipe down asmon fanboi. Toxic assholes with public personas dont get to act like pieces of shit and then just be left alone for it.

&gt; that's a pretty huge dps loss, you can turn off succubus's lash of pain auto cast and still have her autoattacking instead of having your pet just be a brick.

True, I didn't think about that.

after you finish affliction go into destruction. get improved shadow bolt, bane, shadowburn to start out with.  Early demo has absolutely nothing of importance, that entire tree is just placeholder talents and filler people have to take to get to sacrifice and soul link, it's not a relevant 2nd tree for affliction.
---
after you hit 60 respec to a viable endgame build if you want to raid, in raids lifetapping isn't really a big deal and dark pact isn't useful compared to Ruin.
---
True but neither of those spells last for two hours and a rogue wasting all their combo points for a few extra seconds of CC is not always optimal.
---
I couldn't agree more. If you're rolling need  on "off spec" gear, that's a paddlin. I'd at least ask if the tank cares before needing.
---
Maybe your just more of a snowflake now
---
&gt;But please make sure it is actually ninja looting and not just your weird definition of ninja looting

thats the sad circle of life for words. they get water down until they lose all there meaning. internet has accelerated it like crazy.

---
What a naive and silly person you are.
---
Everybody wins then
---
Sounds like a mage to me.
---
Complete idiots are going to do the former, less idiotic people are going to do the latter, smart people are going to buy the mats.
---
But to answer your implied question, there isn't an objective "most efficient" choice to be made right now, it's a matter of personal situation, will getting those 600g now make a big difference to you? If so you should sell the recipe, if not you should learn it and reap bigger rewards throughout the rest of the lifetime of your character.
---
It's not like 'do nothing' and 'act like a retard' are his only two options.
---
Where along in development (of original, retail, or Classic WoW) did terrain block line of sight?  I feel like that hasn't always been the case.  Or was he also behind a broken pillar or something?
---
You need to read tanking guides and learn how to switches stances to generate rage and hold threat.
---
Man, I had forgotten about that site...

Why would Jaina be saying that? She's a mage. Shouldn't the person behind the counter be like...a hunter NPC or something? I doubt Jaina would want her class to be called "magetard"

This gilded comment is gilded.

I have a macro I spam at the start of instances I run with the looting rules for BoE blues and Epics. If there are any pugs everyone rolls need in my groups. The drops are just to rare to need before greed them in my opinion and gold is very valuable in this game.

Shaman is fun. I'll probably go on the  windfury memes until last levels where I'll go serious resto

Not the best one but you could create a macro with something along the lines of:
---
/target tank_name
---
/assist
---
Drag then the macro to an action bar slot and make a keybind for it. Using "T" would be a good way to memorize it and its close to your left hand fingers. It's also close to the default "f" assist keybind for regular "click target assist" manually.
---
You would have to manually write the name of the tank (tank_name) prior to starting the instance though.

this

its the equivalent of telling the teacher that buddy hit you in the schoolyard so he gets detention instead of beating the crap out of him yourself.  Bunch of pussies playing this game.  Probably still living at moms house.
---
What a piece of shit
---
You need to look at warrior guides and talk to warriors. There have been a lot of great posts about tanking written by people who really know their shit.
---
I recommend finding a good guild. And by good, I mean full of people with good attitudes and good skills. They don't need to be the most elite group in the world.
---
As a warrior main, you should only need on on tank loot as dps when the tank doesnt need it or he says that is okay.
---
Try to talk more with your party members this is a social game after all
---
Played before honor system came out and until mid tbc.

You can still find old post from scam forums about warnings about getting banned for enchanting scam. Ppl who did this alot did get banned.

I have no clue if it is the highest, but he's easily hitting over 50k viewers per stream. It just seems like the cool thing to hate on him but even playing on a server that doesn't have any big time streamers you still see this type of stuff happen
---
Some people just like a particular aesthetic.
---
I wouldn't do it, but I have a friend who insists on levelling druid as balance. Why? Because he likes the spells balance has and wants to cast them; and he can't cast them if he's spending all his time as a cat.
---
He doesn't care that it's an inefficient way to level, but he does care for the stats that go with it, and so will roll on gear that's good for what he's doing.
---
Act as if it's not you, it's your character. Write a short story of their life, define their likes and dislikes, what they fear, what they adore, what they hate and act accordingly. Well, it's kinda difficult for me personally, cause I'm tragically unable to play a role, but most of people don't have this problem. It's easy when you get used to it.
---
P.S. it's better to make your character's story as earthly as possible. It's more natural to meet in Winterspring a grizzled war veteran then a sidewind son of Nefarian and Tyrande. Also it's kinda difficult to roleplay a half dragon when there are no possibilites to do so in the game.
---
it's inefficient if your other dots would kill the mob without immo getting its full duration in.  you're already putting up 3 other dots if leveling as affliction and immolate doesn't get bonus from shadow mastery or shadow damage gear obviously.
---
What a fucking twat.
---
Oh man, checklist gearing has literally becoming so cancerous that you can't avoid it, even if you want to.

I mean, yes?

---
Selling gear 
---
Picking a quest reward 
---
Targeting mobs 
---
Spinning the view 
---
You can set cycling through mobs as a key bind and spinning the view to maybe q and e while you get your hand fixed or if it’s not totally un Useable just use the arrows 
---
The rest, it isn’t in combat, so just put the mouse on the left ad use it as and when :)

I wouldn't say useless, since I'm a warlock and was able to cast all my dots and spells without a problem. I did this as a joke, friends, please calm down
---
LOL I described to a guildie as "panic healing". Especially since we *did* wipe as soon as we got into the instance (underleveled + new to the instance + inexperienced tank/dps and we accidentally aggro'd like half the dungeon), so I was hyper aware of sucking. But we stuck it out and the rest of the dungeon was increasingly better. 
---
Except for the lock's health bar, lmao. He never died, but he scared me multiple times.
---
EDIT: Just to be clear, we had two druid tanks, but one was DPS and one was the actual tank... at first. That first druid had never tanked before, so it was a learning experience for him, which is normal and would have been fine had the rest of us also not be unfamiliar with the dungeon and playing our respective classes for the first time lol. So the tanks swapped after the wipe and the DPS stopped using whatever fear spell had the tank pissed, and things went much better. 
---
I just reread what I originally wrote and it seemed like I was just throwing people under the bus.
---
On the bright side, this goes the other way around too. The more you try to act kindly, even if you don't feel like you're being genuine, the more you will start to act that way naturally and it will become genuine.
---
So, he wants to sell the item for gold to buy the same item?
---
Uhm?
---
I killed mobs 4 at a time to level, easy as hell because you can just drain them, they die fast as hell because succubus actually does *anything*
---
Everyone needing means everyone has a chance at their own be bis pieces.
---
Definitely because of guilds that are "Fun and goofy" and as soon as you criticize them in a legitimate way, they go "eat ass"
---
And this is why your character named needs to start with an "a"
---
I've never charged for water. It's called a tip for a reason. I was tipped 2g in southern Tanaris for saving a Paladin a trip back to Gadzetzan though.
---
That all may be true. But if someone genuinely needs it then it's a dick move to roll need just to sell it. Even if you sell it to them. There's no guarantee they have enough money for it.
---
checking out guilds before you're 60 is mostly a waste of time. everybody's leveling in their own speed and being in a guild with not enough lvl 60's when you're lvl 60 sucks.

Some serious words have been said over cruel barb and cookies wand.
---
you could just buy the bags and gear for cheap.  the only thing that requires tailoring in the game right now is robe of the void which isn't even much better than robe of winter night.  it's easier to just mine and skin or herb and skin, sell what you gathered, buy what you want.  Tailoring does have some limited money making with turning felcloth into mooncloth to sell to other tailors but that's about it.

Does anybody know what UI Shroud uses?
---
So u say I can play WoW on my Iphone? If so how can I install it?
---
What a sack of shit.
---
a single persons anecdotal evidence is useless.
---
Looking for a range indicator addon - back in vanilla/BC, there was a simple addon that added a little box you could move around, that simply displayed the range in yards of the selected target. I can't find anything about this anywhere...thoughts?
---
Thank you. The way you countered my arguments was very impressive, and made me re-evaluate my position.
---
Should I use a soul stone bag? Is it worth it? I’m herbalism so I have an herb bag as well
---
I prefer standard bag because when I’m out of space I can always throw away a soul shard and put something different in that place. It’s not possible with soul pouch
---
There a lot of retail cry babies since there’s not personalized loot they get butt hurt when they don’t win....keep it going!
---
No nobody needs gold/mount? If I was in a guild party, this whole argument is different. There's a significant difference between vendor price and auction house prices, and if someone in the party genuinely needs it, why can't they buy it from the lucky winner?
---
If you're bringing a melee hunter along in your dungeon group, then you should expect him to roll on melee loot.
---
You're free not to bring him along, though.
---
As a healer in low-level dungeons, your biggest issue is generally mana. It’s important to save mana in case your group accidentally agros extra mobs, etc. At low level mobs won’t hit hard enough to 2-3 shot DPS so if one pulls agro it isn’t always a big deal. 
---
So how do you play around this? If a DPS pulls agro, read the situation, maybe it’s a rogue and they dumped their energy before tank got agro, but it’s only one mob. You’re probably fine to simply not do anything, the tank will get agro back shortly/rogue can pop evasion or vanish. Other classes have similar options.
---
What if a mage/lock/hunter is AoEing and then ice block/feign death, wiping threat and scattering all of the mobs onto everyone? Now you need to be more proactive, renew whoever is taking damage to buy yourself time, keep yourself, tank and best DPS alive, heal other 2 when you can. Shield people who are getting low, you’d rather not have the rebuff on them if you can help it/PWS is expensive. 
---
Tanks will struggle with agro at low level, esp if you have a lot of AOE, try to LOS mobs/stack up on the tank so if someone does pull agro, the tank isn’t forced to run around grabbing each mob. (Most wipes happen because people panic, YOU CANNOT OUTRUN MOBS, running to your tank/healer is always better then doing the headless chicken dance and pulling another group or 2, 1 person dying is better then a wipe, just Rez and move on).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ednAs_l4zuw this is him saying stop fucking ninja looting.
---
You might see my panda cub out and about.
---
100% accurate. Guildies ran SM with mage and I (group's priest healer) until we both got this staff. He rolls against me with my absolute approval and enthusiasm on anything with int/spirit that is an upgrade for him.
---
♥ my Shaman, it's all I ever pvp'd with in vanilla before I quit in 2007, that's a wild crit roll with windfury.
---
That mage has a lot to learn after this.
---
Under the circumstance that the loot rules are agreed upon.
---
Blizzard is extremely well known for actually enforcing agreements between players. Let this be for loot or paying gold for services.
---
Avoid PW:S as much as possible. It is not a very mana effecient spell.
---
It is a good spell however if you know alot of damage is about to hit the group and in emergencies where you need that instant heal on someone
---
Why  would you ever agree to greed haha. This is like life 101 level stuff here.
---
On thx I'll check that blade out in ah.
---
In full you mean doing all 10 quest?
---
Bro shut up and don’t comment than plain and simple
---
Ok thx a lot guys
---
in the launcher, happens on retail which i dont care about
---
What I've done in the past is, I'll put a target icon on my target, this way when they spawn (usually behind some form of cover) I can see icon through. And casually follow.
---
Eh, I don't like the dude that much, but he's an entertainer that gets his money through donations. You don't really get to choose how to act in that case.
---
He's not a dumb dude. I'm sure he did some research into his own stream and found when he acts like he does, he gets more money. So that's what he does. Realistically, 95% of people would do the same thing in his case.
---
The way you can tell that he's not like that normally is when something breaks him out of "character". Usually with a large donation or the like. He'll immediately switch personas to what, I assume, is how he normally acts.

Ran the fellhunter quest at lvl 31-32 just for the 16 slot bag not even the demon doggo

scummy bummy stuff
---
Help me ascend to the ranks of a keybind chad. Any good guides out there?
---
Even more terrifying he got upvoted just because people love to hate on the guy... No yall, asmon is not a psychopath.
---
just going to chime in with this piece real fast. This is what you get with the classic looting system. A lot of people kept saying how great it is and I don't mind the system, but seeing ninja looters becoming more of a theme with loot I wouldn't mind having a different system implemented in future updates.
---
Are you extra sensitive?
---
Illegal
---
Imagine being blind.
---
😂😂
---
people get so hung up on loot its ridiculous. Especially pre even 50 or anything.  Like wow, that staff with 1 more intellect and 2 more dps is something you a mage need so bad that you're going to call the priest slurs for taking it because it's a bigger upgrade for her? People need to get a grip on reality. It's a video game. If you need it, roll need on it. If you don't, don't. People don't always follow this rule but it really shouldn't be something to harass people over until you get to the end game where people grind ubrs 40 times. People get so obsessed with "wow it gives me 2 more x stat i neeeeeeeeed it" that they fail to realize they'll just replace/sell it in a few hours. idk. I could be horribly wrong. I just feel like some people take it way too deep.
---
Classic.wowhead.com
---
Regretable decision.
---
Lol I googled them "the most wanted gloves in Classic WoW" haha what a choad.
---
So basically, if I have a +20 shadow spell damage piece, drain Life will do in increased 2 damage per tick?
---
What party frames do you use? If you're not using any addons, I highly recommend going to Menu -&gt; Interface Options -&gt; Raid Profiles and check "Use Raid-Style Party Frames" in top right. These frames are much more functional than the default ones, and you can then play around with other options in the tab (class colors, health display, adjust size etc). These frames also show your buffs, so that should solve your problem.
---
It and addons like it have been staples for healers for years now, they really do change the game.
---
Doesn't count as a weapon, unfortunately, so warriors and the like can't use skills with it.
---
Is there still recent data on server population via census? I can't find updated numbers (i want to see the transfers impact on faction balance)
---
Then stop responding. You’re done because you haven’t got an argument.
---
This is me returning from work. Glorious feeling
---
I saw an intersting thing but i havent posted it yet because i need to wait for the next elvui update to see how it really works. Badically you can see when the latest version of elvui was released and how many downloads the "this" file has. Im am just not sure if by this file they mean the classic addon in general or just the specific version since it is on the same sentence as the the version info.by how its written i think its the version but im not that sure because if that is the case then classic wow has to have a lot more players than we think. It said the latest version was released on the 26th and the file has 600k downloads(it said this on the 27th) If those downloads are just for the latest version then player numbers are way higher than we think. 600k downloads in a day (the day subs ran out) for an addon that not everyone uses and doesnt even update automatically for everyone would be kind of insane.
---
Why can't he be banned for promoting thousands of people to Ninja? Why does Blizz allow this shit.
---
Dps or not you’re allowed to roll.... I see Druid dps needing healer items none stop and I don’t say shit and neither do most people....we all understand you can not go prot or healing as leveling spec so going a dps spec and grabbing tank or healing gear is the meta
---
Pog brain damage
---
back to retail pls
---
Don't tar us all with the same brush as this little oxygen Thief.
---
If you roll need on krol blade as a mage you simply land on my ignore list, nothing else.
---
Sulfuras is rarely full these days but always high capacity I've found.
---
Ok so I need your bop items because it gives me also gold. And I need gold.
---
There is no difference between boe and bop. The only difference is your arbitrary rule.
---
&gt;These videos excite me about my shaman but I keep thinking "I only wanna go enhancement. But I also want to raid."
---
Then stick to enh, you won't get jack squat as elemental.  Resto is viable as well, my shaman was resto at 60.
---
100% me as well in Cata. Helped me become a better person
---
Nobody is really out of line here, but if you're filling a DPS role and plan on rolling on tank gear - that needs to be set out from the beginning as soon as you get an invite to avoid this situation.  This is not a "not sure about wow classic" "really bad experience".  It is more of a misunderstanding of group manners, and not defining expectations.  As u/moeronscamp emphasized, if this is a "really bad experience" to you, you're in for a rough time.
---
Do they get automatically ranked down? I'm pretty sure it just refuses to cast higherb level buffs on players that are too low a level.
---
Next time take your keyboard from desk when watching Pornhub, it’s easier to clean desk without things on it
---
Thanks a lot!  
---
Already wearing the Shadoweave Set, it's awesome!
---
I'll follow your other tips, too :)
---
We are great off tanks. That's why they did it. We get mail at 40. I mean ita all right there no mystery. I go into groups and let tanks know they I am spec'd off tank shammy and will happily help them tank some of the damage.  I can heal myself so I tell the healer to ignore my hp and we run the dungeon a new way they is really fun really. I actually just tanked "the den" quest in stonetalon a few night ago with 3 other randos and we had a blast. We didn't even have heals I just made it work.
---
Is there an addon or macro to cycle between mining and herbing on the minimap?
---
the last one is your neighbor isnt it?
---
My 12yo daughter asked me to set her up her own account after watching me play for the last month.
---
She created a NElf (I usually play horde, but okay.) refused to pick up more than 1 quest at a time because she didn't want to be confused, stopped looting because her bag got full and she didn't want to run to vendor, and got frustrated and quit in about 30 minutes and went back to Roblox.
---
Oh well.
---
Just hover over the skill do see what rank it is and make sure it’s what you want.
---
splatoon colors!
---
We learn from our mistakes
---
He will.  He specifically said on air, "stop fucking ninja looting" before this happened. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ednAs_l4zuw
---
i spent all my energy on arguing loot drops for leveling loot in vanilla,
---
there's no way I could ever give a fuck for it again.
---
I meant the title as "how could they find this useful FOR levelling up, i.e to help with the grind
---
I've only scanned the one realm which is what flagged some of the info as odd to me.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll have a look at the calculation when I get home.
---
We do what exactly?
---
Something about that assertion and knowing they truly believe I find DEEPLY amusing.
---
It's actually amazing for hunters, nothing else at that level comes even close.
---
??
---
That wasn’t the point of his post at all.  He didn’t say anything about waiting to 60 to start, he’s questioning the benefit of that profession to his class.
---
They are only dangerous during phase 3, and even then, fire only comes out of it when she does her mass fear.
---
Why can only Warriors so this?
---
Because he's a turd and it's in line with how he acts at other times.
---
No, just makes no sense for someone to comment with a statement that gives zero advice or help to OP.... that’s the point...negative attitudes or comments are not needed and you’re wasting your time and others
---
Isn’t it interesting how the game hasn’t changed, but the people have? Maybe I am being forgetful, but I don’t remember people being so focused on themselves 15 years ago.
---
If only there was a classic version of SimCraft.
---
I got some really good swords for lvl 22, lets hope he starts feeling a bit better or im just gunna keep going with hunter as i find something more enjoyable. His team play is quite nice because his damage is very high so im trying to lvl at least once more so i can run dm a bunch to help get my lvl up for the next zone.
---
would have been cool to have some single player rts games on the side continuing the story and just have wow take place during those times. Honestly even just using the wc3 engine would have been enough
---
Always, ALWAYS have the group roll need on BoE's like this.
---
Easy way to avoid assholes.
---
yes every time I visit, atleast once per session.
---
I last night cleared the scan data before as well, and still it's showing prices that aren't there
---
It's honestly baffling that there's so many people that think 1 player out of 5 should get to walk out with an 800G item without giving anyone else a chance, just cos they intend to equip it instead of sell.
---
Wir Wahren Helden is the dumbest play on words
---
Depends what you're looking for. I personnally used a combination of wow head and icy veins. 
---
If you're not looking to tank raids, paladin tanking is great and super fun (at least imo). It can be a little rough to start (like getting used to not having a tank and learning to manage mana) but i would recommend it if you think you will enjoy it
---
Lock here, just hit 41. So much fun. Lots to do in combat from dot managment and having your pet grab more and more mobs. And when you make it to dark pact you just dont stop moving. Very little down time
---
Not word good?
---
You know I'm going to level a lock just because you keep mentioning it :p
---
By telling someone what I said, that IS the advice. You are triggered go away.
---
Personal opinion: streamers/streaming are a cancer to video games in general, with few rare exceptions, and the entire culture/concept has done a great disservice to the hobby.
---
I don't know, maybe at 33 I just "don't get it" like my dad didn't get me sitting in AOL chat rooms for hours when I was a kid?  I just don't see the point.
---
Oh I've heard of it all, but nothing is really selling for what I would consider to be a worthwhile price to justify the amount of time it takes to fish it up vs herbing or grinding.  The highest I've seen a stack of any fish going for was 2.5g, and that was mightfish (I believe).  Anything less than 5g per stack isn't worth it at this time.
---
Also staff of westfall &gt; ember stone staff
---
So I am spec'd as a off tank shammy. I did this for my own enjoyment I know it is not optimal in any way but I like it. That being said... I like to offer the tank that I'm a off tank and will happily tank some of the trash to help the healer and tank out. I typically get taken up on the offer since I can heal myself. So the healer has one less to focus on and the tank overall has less stress. Btw I just dinged 30
---
"You think you do but you don't."
---
Why people attacking and mentioning Asmon so much in unrelated thread, serious complexes.
---
&gt; think Asmongold is a toxic piece of shit but don't actually watch any of his content
---
What kind of logic is that?  If I think someone is a giant douchenozzle, I don't support their business.
---
I'm feeling like I've wasted enough time checking back here. Your levels of self-righteousness entitlement will never actually let you see any kind of reason. Sadly you remain a perfect example of what has happened to our society. A huge chunk of the population that somehow think they are special and the rules don't apply to them.
---
What you fail to get into your head is that even though it's a game, it's a multiplayer game. Your actions affect other people. But you don't care, because 'other people' isn't something your brain thinks about much.
---
Also, even more unforgivable, you are not entertaining and have wasted my time. I feel as if I just tried to explain software development to my dog.
---
Some reputation factions are bundled, e.g. capital factions or the steamwheedle (did I type that right?) cartel. Gaining or losing reputations with one of these impacts the others as well.
---
Perfection
---
spirit regen doesnt matter that much in combat if you're not utilizing the 5 second role, thats how it was in classic for a long time anyways.
---
so the argument for this being a healer weapon is even weaker.
---
I’m not a big fan of asmon, but this subreddit is full of retards, and asmon gets more publicity the more you cry about him.
---
He's pulling it out of his ass.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/36765-need-roll-tie-why-did-the-other-guy-get-it/
---
“Doin a 69”
---
Sounds legit.
---
What addon is that for player/target frame?
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/aycxWsFMD_o) give you a decent idea. Death and things related to it like skeletons etc are taboo in China so for the Chinese client they replaced and removed a lot of the gory things and bones. The best bit is when they replaced the stolen severed arm the Abomination waves with a French baguette.
---
You are the stupidest person on the planet.
---
Imagine getting that loot on a tauren only to know you have to reroll to be taken seriously in PvE.
---
This is literally what FAQ's are for.
---
Then again, yes. Not caring about your threat on a warrior easily doubles your damage. Recently I did a few armory runs, and the difference between waiting on threat and not is roughly 90 dps vs. 170-200+.
---
Greed = Gold, Offspecc, Not an upgrade. (Aka Greed)
---
Need = Need - Will use and is an upgrade (Hence a need)
---
Claiming "All greed", to then roll need, and then slapping it on Auction House (Greeding) is the definition of a con man.
---
It's not fucking science, the three roll alternatives even has their purpose/meaning in their name, crazy right?
---
Dude I got the Not a Rogue item too. It was cloth gear but a decent upgrade from my current shit. So I needed.
---
Two randos with my IRL Guildies and me. The two wouldn't shut up about it. We all just laughed. Some green headgear shit too.
---
Played to 30 in BC/wrath back in the day. So basically super noob here. Never played retail, but sure got told to go back to retail 😂
---
I mean i understand why, i rolled a tank to start because my mains in other mmos are generally tanky, i started a dungeon run saying "guys im very new to wow and this is my first dungeon ever, if im doing something wrong please tell me and ill try to fix it" not 5 min later someone said "tank is a retard, leaving" then 2 left. Will never play tank or healer in this game.
---
Alch is generally more useful in classic then later expansions, potion that is a PvP trinket, clear DoT, invisibility, a lot of people like the extra utility it provides/it’s a “fun” profession to certain people.
---
Yeah, warrior is much better unless the Druid significantly outgears the content. One sunder stack on each, and if I keep tab targeting I won’t lose aggro. More sunders on the skull, followed by the X, then trickle sunders on the others. EZ
---
Where should I quest at 35 solo? I’ve done almost all of Thousand needles, I’ve got some more in Arathi, I’ve got some in Stranglethorn and desolace. I’ve got quests for RFK, RFD, SM; I’m just overwhelmed and confused about where to go, with so many options. 
---
I think I should
---
1. Finish going going guano
---
2. Do RFD or SM
---
3. Finish Arathi for now
---
4. Finish Thousand Needles through Stranglethorn
---
5. Do Desolace
---
6. Stranglethorn? Alterac? Swamp of Sorrows??
---
It’s overwhelming to have so many options but still feel limited.
---
It's similar to trade. If you specify in chat with someone what you're trading for what and they violate that, Blizzard will enforce that agreement. Same with loot rules.
---
To be a-faiuuur....
---
So like, the ah ?
---
Well, not really. You might finish a MC run 10 min faster with pre-raid bis on everyone compared to cool looking lvl 60 gear. The difference is so minimal it doesn't matter in any way or form really.
---
Mage in chat: *LFM super duper 50k xp per hour ZF spell cleave*
---
Me: looks up to xp/hour addon, doing 55k doing regular run.
---
Ok then
---
Is there any way to target a dead friendly player who is not in your party?
---
Say a friendly dude who's not in your party dois near you and then releases. It's not possible to click on their corpse to target them for a Res. I've tried /target (player name) but it doesn't work.
---
Damn democrats
---
this 100%
---
Honestly hope you're a kid, judging by the rest of your posts, you probably are. 
---
If you're actually an adult.. what can I say, just scum.
---
they have there own addon updater for elvui/tukui
---
You have not used it if you think it is reliable
---
Herod
---
It makes thread like these absolutely hilarious to me. People literally foaming at the mouth because of their inability to detect satire.
---
If you have spirit tap Staff of Westfall is better until you get the sleeper rod from BFD. Always prioritize spirit over other shit (unless it literally has no int) for leveling. Less down time drinking and more pew pew. 
---
People will tell you int is better but I literally just solo leveled a priest from 1-60 and zero downtime is better than sitting and drinking
---
This!! It blows my mind how upset people get over leveling gear!!! I get the anger at people ninja looting (actual ninja looting) but when you just lose to someone in the same class or similar class, just keep it moving and hope for better rolls next time!
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Mana potions reduce downtime drastically while grinding on a hunter
---
You roll for the gear you're qued at, it's not fair to take tank gear as a Dps
---
unless! You ask if he minds you needing on it, or if he can't use it coz he has better gear.
---
Asking is key here.
---
What a boomer..
---
Sure buddy.
---
Maybe you should try to take a brake and stop playing for few days. &gt;_&gt;
---
This is such a copout for anyone in a position like his. "Oh I wasnt serious, I was obviously joking. I only constantly act that way as a character duh." Its just a lazy way of brushing off your fans following what you lead.
---
Oh thank God daddy Asmongold will handle his petulant children. ^^^/s
---
Mana potions, agility elixirs, transmutes, free action potions, ~~water walking~~, water breathing...  yeah hunters couldn't use any of this stuff.  Alchemy is useful for everyone regardless of class, there are so many potions and elixirs with various effects.  Also, alchemy is one of the best professions for making gold.
---
I'm an alchemist herbalist hunter - it has been fantastically useful so far.  You're probably upset that you got outrolled for an alchemy recipe in a group by a hunter.
---
Go into a Molten Core pickup group (where performance week-to-week will have absolutely no bearing on future success or access to loot) and expect to simply sacrifice four hours of my time for the good of people I might never see again? You clearly have different standards of how to spend your time well than I do.
---
&gt; and it's in line with how he acts at other times.
---
Yes, like other times when he is sarcastic and reddit doesn't get it because he doesn't say /s at the end of it
---
You don’t need them as a target. 
---
I’d you have no target and click res your pointer will light up, you can click the corpse while hovering and it will res them.
---
A lvl 30 quest in shimmering flats sends me to hunt lvl 35 snapjaws that kick my ass brutally...
---
Meanwhile, in Ashenvale a lvl 30 quest requires me to slaughter a whole bunch of sub-30 mobs to assemble a shredder manual...
---
I'm starting to suspect that picking quests according to my character level is not very helpful...
---
As a Warlock you need 918g (900 for mount + 18g for training), but you'll want to have extra gold in order to learn all your spells at 60. Generally 1000g total is enough to train all your remaining spells + get your mount.
---
Dude, gross. Suck it up. Yes having a ninja looter in your party fucking sucks but it's part of the game. Please stop reporting everybody that farts in your general direction or go play retail if you need the GMs to hold your hand 24/7. Back in the day people simply made sure to let the whole server know about the scumbag so he couldn't find groups anymore, without crying for a GM to wipe away their tears all the time ffs.
---
Because it's fun.
---
I wonder if agreeing on not rolling on something (aka locked items) and then rolling on them regardless would be considered ninja looting by a GM. Trade/service scams are accknowledged as such.
---
Priests have a pretty easy rotation while leveling in the open world, but yeah, they’re pretty boring until 40 when Shadow becomes viable.
---
Don't forget to report the stupid names, they break RP server rules :)
---
You click res then click the target
---
I installed WeaponSwingTimer for my hunter, but I have no idea when to use my abilities to effectively weave. Do I basically just use them right after the autoshot goes off?
---
Bonus points if you can explain the value of melee weaving to me. I saw it somewhere but it seems insane to run around to get to melee range.
---
Stop this is harassement
---
Mods, delete and ban
---
What about people needing (bop) stuff they can't use?
---
"When I was saying someone should go and mass report that guy who killed me in pvp, I obviously didnt mean or want it to happen."
---
&gt;What addon is that for player/target frame?
---
Z-perl?
---
No, it's hyperbole. Sarcasm implies he means the opposite of what he's saying. He very clearly means exactly what he's saying, which makes it hyperbole, not sarcasm.
---
The increased hit chance is huge
---
Weapon skills are tied to your character.
---
This is not great, good tanks will be constantly cycling through tossing sunders and revenges on multiple targets as needed. Most decent tanks will mark skull, x (kill order) and moon for CC. I've seen diamond used for fears as well.
---
&gt; so what's the harm
---
You don't learn who is a ninja until much later in the game.
---
I'm a multiboxer so I never group with random ppl anyways. Just see alot of complaints so wanted ppl to know that in some cases its considered a scam by blizzard and temp banable.
---
He watches twitch all day so he's the expert why argue /s
---
No. Don't use PW:S pre-pull unless you're in a higher level spellcleave group. Pre-pull PW:S is the worst thing you can do to a tank needing to generate rage, especially at lower levels.
---
Like relationship outside of games aren't "traded" way worse anyways, OMEGALUL.
---
Not justifying any of this at all - just sad really but this doesn't even make it to the top 1000 list on reasons people ruin relationships.
---
dont use ahdb, im not using it and plan to remove it. it doesnt use any algorithm for prices it just lists the lowest price last seen.
---
use Aux, Auctioneer, or TSM
---
Hooooooly fuck. Sorry you had to endure this kind of bottom feeder piece of shit human. Clearly asmongold and his officers all deserve each other. Trash.
---
I  bet you're sad you didn't join.
---
This isn’t true you still need to replace the spell on your bar with the higher rank version
---
This is why in open roll groups BoE is all roll need to prevent stuff like this.
---
You can click on your res and click their corpse. You can't target them, but that will cast res on them.

.Org by far

My conclusion after watching him pre Twitch days and coming back to see what he has become from time to time. 
---
Don't defend him, it's true, the guy went from being a great content producer to the YouTube/Twitch equivalent of "The Chainsmokers".
---
Hello! I'm leveling with my friend who's playing a holy paladin, we're currently lvl 38. Any suggestions on specs and play styles for duo leveling? Currently using the rain of fire talent + concentration aura to channel without interruption, and burst single mobs down quickly.
---
Depends on the agreement beforrhand.
---
Uhh if u use this as a warrior you are kind of retarded since there is corpsemaker, ww, and ravager all in this level range
---
Mobs above 60
---
That's not an insult, it's more like the youth version of "Bye, have fun"
---
Fuck this jackass up. Entitled punks think they can do what they want cuz that are friends with a streamer.
---
Lmao that’s not advice....your basically saying “since this situation made you feel like the bad guy due to other people your fucked since you can’t take the heat”
---
I mean maybe they didn’t post it with the bizarre title of “face tent”?
---
But but but but something something streamer something
---
They still lost 40g... also that's pretty clearly just a rationalization to not have to care about other people.
---
The hypothesis is that shadowcraft is better. It doesn’t change that, it helps the argument. Shouldn’t be difficult to wrap your head around.
---
Yknow, in Vanilla I played a Mage and didn't understand why people hated my class so much.
---
Now that I'm playing Classic 15 years later as a Warrior, and browsing this subreddit....
---
I understand now. Fuck Mages.
---
"It was only a joke, I was just sucking a dick LIKE I wanted to do it, but I did not actually want to."
---
She's gonna respawn any minute now
---
Cool, Ill have to check out bartender next time I play.
---
Awesome!
---
Yeah its a great shaman weap, im leveling elemental so I would roll since those are the primary stats
---
Damn lol
---
Yeah you let me know how that works out at Chromaggus +.
---
but you know who they're talking about. Come on.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate you filling me in I was so lost. 
---
Also the fact that the NPC tags him at the end so he takes durability damage is gold. Lol
---
"gravity-defying death"
---
I think if you macro all your skills, they automatically get replaced as you level them up.
---
For instance, as a warlock, I have pet attack macroed with my immolate, so everytime I upgrade immolate, it automatically uses the highest version of that spell.
---
So? It's either something relevant to the franchise or nothing at all, blizzard isn't developing the launcher for you specifically so ignore it if you don't like it, some people actually play both believe it or not.
---
Fast offhand is good for more poison procs.
---
Wow you went from 0 to 100 real quick. I hope your day goes better buddy.
---
You could still buy the racial epic mount it’s just more expensive.
---
I ben trying to find some stupid dwarf's lucky pick far too long in bad lands.
---
And i am mage...i aoe thsie dwarfs but still no luck
---
That black parade song is a pretty solid tune
---
Makes me remember and laugh at the idiots claiming World PvP was being destroyed by a lack of skeletons
---
Is this the path ally use to get to SM? Thought you guys swam through the lake or something
---
It's bind on pickup.  GO to the instance and kill the boss for that weapon/offhand combo.
---
Hey man first off relax it's not a big deal!
---
Also if you need it then need it simple as that. Unless rules are established before hand you're good to go!
---
As long as you dont roll on a wand for example now that's not cool
---
You ARE one angry old dude
---
This may be a dumb question buy if everyone is agreeing to all greed why wouldnt everyone just all need? Then there is no way of getting ninja looted? This guy knew exactly what he was doing...
---
To be fair, there's way more 35s. The lower levels are a little smaller, look in the areas where theres a lot of them.
---
&amp;
---
Wait, snapjaws are the turtles, right
---
Not the basilisks? If it's basilisks i'm wrong.

DUNEGON
---
You're just being petty and not understanding
---
Level 55.5 druid tank/healer here. I've done all of the epl and most of the wpl quests. I feel like I've hit a leveling roadblock. Doing the early BRD bosses seems like it doesn't give much xp/hr. What should I do to get the rest of the way to 60?
---
It just feels like I'm stuck in the mud.
---
ok sweep that's good to know.
---
You sure you're using the highest rank spells?
---
Why do people slow down and look at car accidents?
---
u only use pummeler on bosses its like a consumable- he is still going to be using a normal wep 95% of the time
---
That guy's a dimwit but interrupting your day? C'mon now.
---
Not sure this is who you're looking for...
---
How do you become an officer in a streaming guild? Donate a thousand dollars? It would make sense why an officer ninja’d then. Brainless people doing shitty things.
---
When you level warr you spec in arms or fury and tank that way....everyone does it!! He also states that he tanks mostly when in dungeons... point being you didn’t take any time to figure out the situation and than gave bad advice! You are uneducated in proper leveling specs/ tanking metas...please sir if you want to give advice... KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
---
As a 60 mage AoE farm spec, what dungeons can I solo for most profit?
---
Whenever stuff of value drops like a boe epic I just say all need, so theres no confusion or anger. Nobody feels like they got robbed. If someone will actually wear the item and not sell it then maybe I wont roll but it really depends on the situation. But yeah, hitting greed on an item like this in a pug is pretty risky.
---
I mean can you find a source for the 2nd roll?
---
It’ll be removed soon.
---
Asmongold, his friends ,  his fans ....all are COMPLETE cancerous to the WoW gameplay . I actually enjoy his content , and i genuinely think his influence on the game is more negative than positive. ( Just my opinion , could be wrong ) ,
---
Cept macros were in vanilla. Nice try though.
---
Am I wrong now or is the ui different in classic? I noticed my pet teleports to me when I jump down stuff now
---
Power Word: Kill
---
Rerolling hunter now because reasons... hope lag doesn't fuck me up.
---
Ok will do that thx.
---
Double check your resolution settings. Few days back, I have my graphics preset to 7; but every time I relogged it would make my resolution settings max, 200%, something like 3480 x 2040 or something. Anyway, that's like ultra wide 4k. It was hammering my 2070 lol.
---
That's not at all how it works
---
Because Asmon glorifies ninja looting and often tells stories of how he ninja'd stuff all the time and the only reason he doesn't now is cus he streams.  OFC the kids following him around licking up his footprints will ninja cus their idol has already given the go ahead.
---

---
I use it on people who stond on top of the auctioneer with their fat kodo mounts.
---
On the other hand you talking about killing him over some BOE. It's quite hard to keep living without oxygen...
---
Huh, I am heals and had a mage give me the exact opposite argument.....I guess this staff isn't for anybody then!
---
You’re still responding to this? He is a dps Rolling on a tank item. Period. So now YOU are wrong.
---
Good job
---
I don't think you understand that needing it for "gold purposes" is the very definition of greeding.
---
On an even playing field, everyone wants gold and loot, but there is gear that is there that people are actively hunting for. Instead of gold farming to get that in the auction house, which would be a guaranteed recievak of the item, they are actively choosing to help you go through the content to help you get your gear for your spec as well, expecting the same in kind.
---
Ergo, people should receive priority based on gear and spec. Because everyone would expect the same in kind. They aren't spending time in the dungeon just looking for gold lottery tickets. They are trying to improve their character, and while gold could do that, gold is also necessary for numerous other things in the game.
---
Just accept that you are greedy and stop trying to act like all needing is justice in any way. Literally this is just ninja looting to be unfavorable towards randoms in your group.
---
There is something I couldn't figure out for years.
---
As a Hunter, if I train something to my pet, let's say, Natural Armor rank 3, rank 1-2 disappears from the list. But the training points only get deducted for the Rank 3 skill, instead of Rank 1-2-3. How the fuck does this work?
---
They should ban asmongold along with him since he promotes it with in his guild.  https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulBreakableWrenchUncleNox
---
Uhm vanilla's best/most wel known main tank was a tauren so what you on about. If content could be cleared with a tauren MT 15 years ago it surely can now
---
Don't forget to activate Windows!
---
Yeah that's the point of this post - to publicize him.... as someone who facilitates ninja looting. You can't just let this kind of behavior become the norm. Ninja looters need to be named and shamed.
---
I don't think it's that beyond reasoning. The officer obviously valued the item more than the relationship, which probably means he didn't care for the relationship much at all anyways. In which case it was a bad relationship and op's friend shouldn't feel so bad about losing that. That's a positive way to look at it at least. Losing the item sucks tho.
---
You're not wrong, however, if you go to OPs instagram page, OP clearly states that they draw furry stuff. So, guess the 16 year olds were right this time.
---
I had never heard the guys alias until today, and no I have no be idea what his real name is or where he's from, so no I don't.
---
You can respec and actually play the game
---
BoE items that can be bought and sold on the auction house or through trade has the same value for every member of the group so everyone should always roll on expensive items.
---
Unless it was specifically stated that the for example the Edgemaster would go to the DPS Warrior ahead of the run, then it's not ninjalooting.
---
The only edgy thing I see here, is you with your stupid post, „aLlIaNcE iS bEtTeR“, like you could compare it directly, when you can play only on one side.
---
I found a hidden moonwell in Ashenvale, but I had to turn round quickly as I was looking for something else. I felt under pressure to get exp.
---
It honestly feels wrong to level slowly under level 30.
---
Bro you just proved my point.. he states that he is a tank in almost every other dungeon, not only that it’s fucking RFK....the gear doesn’t fucking matter!!!!Go BaCK tO ReTaIL
---
Totally forgot that nobody dickrides any of the Horde streamers like Shroud, Sodapoppin or literally the whole Fortnite crew. Lel fur the herd
---
I'm pretty sure that doing all the quests will easily bring you to 60. It'll involve travelling around a lot and doing dungeon quests as you level but I'm not sure how you'd manage to run out of quests entirely. Maybe if you only do orange and yellow quests and don't complete prvious zones before going to the highest level ones.
---
Off the top of my head the following give XP all the way to 60:
---
Zones:
---
Felwood
---
Azshara
---
Winterspring
---
Tanaris (not all but a few high level quests)
---
Un'goro Crater
---
Silithus (only 1 quest line atm)
---
Western Plaguelands
---
Eastern Plaguelands
---
Hinterlands (Elite quests)
---
Burning Steppes
---
Blasted Lands (demon quest line)
---
Stranglethorn Vale (a few elite quests)
---
Dungeon quests:
---
Sunken Temple
---
Blackrock Depths (multiple runs to complete all quests)
---
Lower Blackrock Spire (multiple runs likely for UBRS key)
---
Upper Blackrock Spire
---
Scholomance
---
Stratholme (at least two runs for quests)
---
Maybe for the “huntard” portion of a hunter’s reputation. But as a holy paladin, I’ve been getting a shit ton of people complaining that I’m a “loot whore”. I’m sorry that cloth and leather items are preraid BiS. But paladins are now the new loot dumpsters.
---
When you’re both just leveling up go ahead and need as well.
---
From what I’ve read, it depends on weapon speed. Any 2H that is faster than 3.4 use righteousness , slower use command.
---
If this info is incorrect then I’d like to know too.
---
I use a mix of life tap and dark part, cuz life tap much faster. I use DOA and corruption on single target. I add siphon life on top of these to other targets rather than my focus when multiple mobs.
---
It's clear you have the mindset that any change to the game that fixes small problems is going to lead to 'retail'. So there's really no point in discussing anything with you further. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Queue London Calling.
---
It's a bank alt, so it's at the auction house while I'm playing my main.
---
 It would make shard bags super useful if they prevented the despawn of shards.
---
damn... horde has a lot of idiot mages, but alliance has idiot gnome mages. i feel for you.
---
Do you have a website or something with the info. perchance?
---
just got it myself, someone has it up on my server for 250g atm. Going to wait for p2 when people have more money i think.
---
That's kinda stupid though. What difference would it make if a pvp realm went up against a pve realm?
---
Factual... opinions?
---
most mobs, even casters with low armor, seem to die to SoR at the same speed or faster, maybe SoC if you have a brand new on lvl blue. I specced holy into cons. then went prot for aoe lvling on the PS and even when i switched to ret for 1-2 lvls and used the seal in ret it didnt overwhelm me, judging command before going righteousness was my preferred, increased righteousness dmg in holy was nice as well.
---
Lmao. Pathetic fanboy.
---
You should be judging crusader then switching to SoR (or command if you have it). A lot of our judges give utility (like wisdom, light, justice) but crusader is for damage!
---
Exactly. But the failed attempts, coupled with the fact that he would only kill bosses if he could facetank them completely, while rolling the odd ability every now and then just shows you everything about his stream.
---
SoR for weapons lower than 3.5 speed, Command for weapons with 3.5 or higher and crusade for fights that last 30s or longer is the general rules. However when i leveled my pala i used seal of command on all 2h weapons above 3.0 as you a not in a constant fight and i felt i got more benefit from that.
---
Lol says the guy who sees a comment posted literally right after the thread was started and accused me of not reading the other 9000 comments in order to “karma whore”.
---
I may have gotten defensive, but you’re a dick.
---
Nah Im saying you dont get to convey thoughts to a large group of people but just act like nobody will unironically follow what you say. But good attack directly at me.
---
Doesn't surprise me that this disgusting balding troll promotes that behavior.  He is literally what I imagined a person looked like that was a piece of shit in this game back in 05.
---
[Yes, I can.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/3657615000#6)
---
&gt;If the highest roll for an item ties with one or more characters a **secondary determination** is made by the system internally. 
---
A blue post from 2011.
---
Edit: Some more clarification, in case that was too ambiguous for you. [From the same thread.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/3657615000#20)
---
&gt;How the system works can be determined by the visible results. You tied, **a tie breaker took place (obviously internally)** and the person who won it received the item. Simple as that.
---
/r/theydidtheclimatemath
---
Well they really can't do it in retail since personal-loot.
---
Ohhh got so many alliance that ran through here
---
Yeah drops in MC
---
Probably multishot
---
Best high population pvp server in eu for alliance??
---
I know this is steam link, but will that work on a iPhone?
---
Hol up. In retail, people just bum rush a chest and the first person to click it gets it?
---
Retail is worse than I thought.
---
Your abilities are dickshaped
---
This seems to be the case with pet abilities. Warlocks also only need to learn the highest rank for their demons.
---
People take him far too seriously. He feeds off this nerd outrage and its fucking hilarious
---
you really dont get what add ons are or what they do.
---
Not every streamer guild is like this, mind you. Cosmic God gamer MOONMOON_OW, AKA Wetnappychan, son of Thrall, lord and savior of &lt;Redacted&gt;, formerly known as &lt;Guano Gang&gt;, formerly known as &lt;Guild CFCPW&gt;, formerly known as &lt;Guano Gang&gt;, refuses to take any handouts and frequently goes out of his way to help guildies. The guild heavily discourages being a shitter in the community, and punishes people accordingly.
---
wow, you are incredibly dumb.
---
Afaik, you don't use Crusader ever. Unless say, you're trying to solo a world elite or something. 
---
I think it has some use as a Shockadin for PvP, too. But general PvE use? Nah.
---
&gt; just for the sake of some gold.
---
You make it sound like a pittance, but some of these items go for absurdly high amounts, if we're talking about the Edgemasters Gauntlets that that guy ninjaed, those are anywhere between 500 and 1000. 
---
Don't you  think it's a little unfair to not allow the other 4 people in your party a chance at a free epic mount just because you'd rather equip that item? Would it not be more equitable that everyone gets a chance at such a big ticket item? 
---
We're not talking about some Staff of Jordan or something that you sell for 90G or something (which is still not nothing, but OK), these things are worth more gold than your average player will make in many months of play.
---
What I'm saying is;
---
My name and my character name aren't the same. The sub RULES are about not starting a witch hunt. If you posted EITHER my reddit name, real name, or in character name, it's essentially starting a witch hunt against me. Which against REDDIT.COM terms of service and could have this entire subreddit shut down.
---
You don't need a whole lot out of brd, arena for the belt. brs/scholo/strat all have good stuff. Tailoring is a nice early boost for spell damage gear.
---
Oh boy, I had that drama on around lol 18. It was rogue item, rogue start (I was priest). But my slot was equipped with gray +8 armor (or smt) no Stat crap. So that blue, shiny thingy was a huge upgrade so I clicked need. And the shitstorm occurred. O. M. G.
---
Yea pve isnt hard dude. Nobody gives a shit about his race
---
Do you have a screenshot of that? Would make for a good thread.
---
That's up to you on why you should care.  If you know what kind of person asmon is and still watch him more power to ya.
---
Have everyone roll need unless you are all friends and can figure out what you are doing with it.   
---
For instance, if edgemaster’s handguards dropped you could say that these are warrior BiD and they should have them.   Or you could say that this is a robe of the void/devilsaur set/freezing band.   Everyone in the group contributed to the kill and everyone should have an equal shot at their reward.
---
On Retail no one cares about chests, theres only garbage on them
---
Need is superior to greed.
---
If everyone in your raid "greeds" an item except you (you do "need") you will SURELY get that item.
---
Items are dropped randomly between the people who "needed" the item first and if no one "needed" it it will drop randomly between the people who "greeded" it.
---
First time player here, I chose Mage as my main because I'd heard that they were pretty simple to use but still useful in dungeons with Polymorph, freezing effects, an endless supply of free water, and eventually portals.
---
I was just recently kicked out of a WC group because I'd "probably spam blizzard and end up killing everyone". We hadn't even entered the bloody cave, nor had we met before.
---
Looking forward to how this plays out, got the popcorn ready.
---
Bigotry? Is this a word you people use wily nilly?
---
As a Horde, you get a quest from a forsaken in SM where you have to kill the woman living in the house. Said woman's husband is a boss in SM. 
---
In doing so you'll also have to kill her father in law, thereby effectively wiping an entire family off Azeroth. Pretty brutal.
---
Not a major city but you could also sell ports in the town in Badlands! A lot of 60s have their hearth there because of MC and the dungeons. So they usually want a port to a city.
---
he told them to greed and they did, I don't see a problem 😀
---
Paladin tanks are meh in PvP because they just dont deal any dmg. They dont die either you basically just ignore them.
---
I believe any damage dazes you with aspect of the cheetah on, so you would have to time around rend ticks, and any damage abilities like hamstring, and deep wounds
---
Like the hunter who needed on caster shoulders last night in SFK and tried to argue his way out of it when all 4 of us were like, just accept that you don't know what you're talking about.
---
If he needed everything in a run with you then you would probably feel towards him the way we feel towards people who say all need on boes.
---
People are confusing trade scamming with ninja looting.  Blizzard has always been extremely lax with ninja looting.
---
I think I do remember reading about an add on that let you bind herbs / mine to commonly used buttons so it had the effect of switching you every minute or two as you ran around. I don’t think it could switch automatically for you or that would violate TOS - for automating behavior like botting. I will do some searching and if I find it I will edit this post.
---
**Edited:** This is the best I could come up with: [using a castsequence macro](https://reddit.app.link/6OBjZgEDn0) with a modifier so that for example mouse up is Herbs and mouse down is Mining, or *key* is Herbs and *shift + key* is Mining. You will still have to do the switching yourself.
---
It is a crutch for them
---
/u/SkwiddyCs one month from now:  
---
&gt; Why are there no Horde on my server?? Classic is shit.
---
what looting rules?
---
what does greed mean? you want it for the selling price, or some niche reason that isn't really core to you.
---
What does NEED mean? that you NEED it for yourself as in stats/stuff are an improvement for you.
---
You are not violating the ToS by doing that unless you accompany that with lies/promises or otherwise make an agreement.
---
Excatly what am I looking at?
---
That staff drops pretty much every run, the guy could just run Library again and get it 15 minutes later. If he’s the best healer in the game he won’t have problems getting a group.
---
There are like 6 videos of him reading in game mail from
---
People complaining about ninja looters and he kicks them.
---
Totally forgot about this as well.
---
this and the VC staff are great for hunters. you likely will not have any decent stat-sticks to dual wield and the int and spirit are arguably more important while grinding out levels solo
---
Interesting, thanks.
---
Pick up ALL the shit you can loot no matter what, I used to sell grey and bad green items to the vendor, good green items are sold through AH
---
I69 in MI
---
which classic server has highest horde numbers in EU?
---
Sure, that's fair.
---
Doesn't change anything though.
---
Depends on the dungeon. SM for example you find people best when looking in the dungeon. ZF is easy in Tanaris, RFK and WC is best by looking in the dungeon and in the barrens.
---
Jesus.
---
This why the current loot system on Retail beat the classic one everyday. From classic to a few xpacs afterwards, I've had some amazing drops ninja'd either from loot master or people rolling need on shit they don't need.
---
And you care why
---
Spell batching existed in Classic
---
Leeway existed in classic
---
The other two have a minute impact on the games soul long-term but do make it infinitely more playable in the short term. Layering will be removed in the next phase regardless.
---
I am not sure I entirely understand your entire post. If you got banned I’d ask for further clarification. Your sub running out is nobody but your own fault.
---
There are hardly any skeletons there compared to what it would be if they did it right. It is ruined. It's a non-classic change literally made because Blizzard is SJWs who don't want people possibly writing bad words in a video game with completely open chat in which you can type anything.
---
Other way around for me
---
Joking right?  Agility beats int and spirit for hunters.
---
Just read the entire thing... bit odd that that was your take.
---
I don't really like Asmongold. I don't like the attitude I've seen in any of his videos or that he's shown in any clip made. But I also admit I don't watch him stream and have no interest in doing so.. maybe I'm not getting the full story. But that "essay" was well written, mature, and a genuine attempt to provide a community what *every* community always claims to want but frequently spits all over: honest communication. 
---
There might be other stuff out there to prove your point, that post does not.
---
Irrelevant
---
That lady has a terribly important secret that many ppl have no idea about what it is. But i wont share the information regardless. Im selfish.
---
Drops from various bosses in MC.  Several people on my server have it.
---
Im pretty sure if an agreement in chat has been made and someone breaks it in that run, it will be considered by the GMs as such yes.
---
Yep people multibox.  Why is this a thread
---
It drops from MC bosses:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=18259/formula-enchant-weapon-spellpower
---
.8-1.3% chance depending on the boss.
---
Can you imagine how long of a quest chain you could do with all that extra space?
---
Making a healer drink twice because you refuse to use the water I traded you between pulls is not being a team player. You’re wasting everyone’s time, and if you’re not grouped with a water vendor, your priests money.
---
Let me know if it works for you
---
I don't care, I thought it was wild enough to share. Thought at first might be a guild farming outfit or something but they all jumped exactly in sync every few minutes.
---
It attracts a toxic community because mostly only kids and teenagers care about streaming. That South Park episode was fucking spot on.
---
It's common because people don't know what to do, I reached level 40 with 100g easy
---
If it's that simple, do I really even need a shot timer? Can't I just like... watch when I shoot?
---
Who would've expected from an officer in Asmongold's guild!? Yowie wowie! Maybe you shouldn't have joined a run with him.
---
Olympus players are actually just scum, it's so cringey and pathetic
---
Well, sort of. Difference is people still want a Mage in their group—water, top notch AoE, polymorph, nice caster buff. 
---
Hunters just bring DPS and a pet to accidentally aggro adds at inconvenient times. And they’re *still* Huntards in addition to Mages being them now too.
---
Funny how people said healers are always in demand and you'll have no trouble finding groups as one. And now there's basically negative demand for healers - lots of groups looking for tanks and dps, and lots of healers looking for groups. Somehow mentality changed so much since classic.
---
It's a 2 hour drive each way, the baby sleeps and my wife jams out to country music and drives, what's wrong with doing a little gaming
---
one of the best healer in the game, still doing SM getting triggered over leveling items
---
hahaha
---
I am sorry for re-enabling your ptsd.
---
Was temporarily in a guild where a guy bragged about how someone gave him a dungeon BiS drop. The giftee was being generous for whatever reason and asked the guildie to bind it. Guildie refused and "dogged" him saying he was going to sell it on the AH for 20g. 
---
Turns out this guildie was the Raid Leader. Ten people pretty much left this casual guild as Officers tried to protect their own and cover up for their buddy.
---
He says he would promote people who ninja loot. That's an exaggeration in a way that makes it clear that he uses sarcasm. If you don't get it, talk to more people who don't say /s after using sarcasm
---
He doesn't make YouTube videos, last one he did was if him talking like a year ago
---
Also forgot warriors who have a shit weapon, if it's an upgrade expect everyone to roll on it.
---
This might seem vindictive but this is what made vanilla/BC good. A sense of community
---
You all are funny fucks
---
Fel hound is my favourite. But his use is very niche :(
---
Actually I like old Wrathguard too because he's one of the few sexy male demons in WoW.
---
Ohh, wow this is good. I must've remembered it wrong. I leveled a warlock to level 20 about 12 years ago and I thought they despawned. Must've confused it with health stones then.
---
If everyone just defaulted to need rolling on everything, everyone would have an equal shot and no one could ninja unless your the loot master. 
---
Every 5 man I'm in, even if it's just for questing, I tell the people I invite to need roll on drops. That takes ninja out of the equation. I learned that a looooong time ago when I was in a group and rolled greed on everything and then realized I hadn't won a single roll and then looked and the guy I was running with was just needing everything. 
---
Making items won from need rolls soulbound should have been introduced day one of Vanilla along with trading items won. As long as it stays sb. That way if you're actually running with a decent group of players (rare) they can trade the item to you if it's a legit upgrade to what you have.
---
I hope more people use this forum to shame shitty players because I didnt have that outlet in vanilla
---
I dont have enough time to play to sacrifice it for strangers. If I need it I'm needing. Shit like that is how you burn out
---
Thanks. It's a nice laptop. I wanted the 15 inch but my boss is 53 and needs the big ass 17 inch screen, and we had to order 3 of the same laptops for accounting to be able to capitalize the expense.
---
I'm aware, never saw it to this degree.
---
This is allowed. What is the issue?
---
Yeah I I purposely to try to avoid servers with popular streamers they're cause so much shit sometimes
---
Not in the game yet.
---
He wont get in trouble because of his connection to asmonbaby 100%
---
To be fair, this was before Classic even launched and he has since then stated he doesnt want any of his guild members to ninja items.
---
As far as I understand it if no loot rules are clearly stated prior to the run beginning in in-game chat you can need on everything you want and be safe from any punishment. Still a really scummy thing to do.
---
Can't speak for everyone, but when I post lfg, I take the first people to whisper me in whatever role they want to fill, mostly. Underlleveled rogue and a hunter message at the same time, I'll opt for the hunter, also try to avoid having another mail wearer. But I'll take a shadow priest, sure.
---
People just unaware than druids paladins and wars can tank. Ho and of course shamans for the horde.
---
If only they would do priority targeting and let the tank aggro first.
---
Taunt is for noobs, change my mind.
---
And what *practical* difference is made? None.
---
To answer the second question first - no, it is up to you to determine if it is a useful item for you.  Now the difference between need and greed is, one is if you need the item and it is upgrade for you or your professions and one is if you just want the item or nobody can use it. Need rolls take priority over greed rolls. So if one person's rolls need and 4 roll greed, the need roll will win every time.
---
For example if an item is an upgrade for you, you would want to roll need on it.  Or if a mail item drops and you have no mail wearers in your group you would roll greed on it.
---
That being said most parties will roll need on epic or rare blue BOEs so everyone has a chance because they sell for lots of gold.
---
Rolling Need when you cant use them item is considered ninjaing the item. Dont do this.
---
Will do.
---
It's great. Wish I could have gotten the 15 inch, but my boss and his boss are both old and needed the 17 for remoting in.(the purpose of us getting laptops for work)
---
I've had it for almost a year( we preordered it and got it on release). Wish I would have went with the zephyrus, but the scar ii Is great too. It handles everything almost as good as my desktop which has a 1080 and 1440p
---
this reeks of EU
---
They absolutely will temp ban for it.
---
A good friend of mine got a 3 day ban for rolling Need on an item in a SFK run when the group mentioned 'all items are reserved'.
---
He needed on a BoE blue drop and won.  Less than two hours later he received an email and a 72 hour ban.
---
In his plea he mouthed off to Blizzard and they changed his ban from 3 days to indefinite.  He was banned for a total of 7 days before he could play again.
---
Name is a reference to this clip
---
https://youtu.be/plQIf5fS8xw
---
It’s hilarious
---
No, spirit is top tier when leveling and int is also good as a hunter since it means you can pull more mobs before needing to drink.
---
lmao What’s the item name?
---
Was tanking sm last night. Charge, ss, def stance, demo shout, zerk stance, ww bloodrage spam cleave a bit till ww again... i was spiking up to 500 dps on details, and over the dungeon run was accounting for the low 40% range. Healer was on point that group though. Like 4 runs with that guy till he had to leave, got a new healer who was 42, like 3 levels higher than the prev one... he couldnt heal me with sword and shield doing 2 pulls of 2 enemies without going oom.
---
Sounds pretty selfish to me.
---
Why is your gold more important than their upgrade?
---
And just because you've decided that's the case doesn't make it right to roll need on things you can't use.
---
That's the only point I've ever tried to make here. You can roll need on things you can't use as much as you want, but it's still wrong, still abuse of the loot system, and will still garner you negative rep in realm.
---
It seems like people are really insecure in holding the belief that you're defending, because they're scrolling through days old posts to start arguments about it. Just accept that it's wrong and move on. If you're selfish and do it anyways, oh well, just have the balls to admit you're being selfish and doing the wrong thing
---
And the druids casting sleep can be annoying unless it is handled with a normal pull. Getting a pull with 3-4 druids would be a disaster.
---
It's a colcar's grain sack)
---
Thats mega gross duuuude. I had that picture of the amount of dwarf spit that would be...
---
Cool, thanks!
---
I thought I logged in on your friends list.  My character us Dankheals.
---
&gt;I gladly take non-intrusive non-RP folks over the jumpy annoying meme-roleplayers.
---
There are servers that cater to this.
---
Nobody really cares about boe drops. They arent even rare drops. There are several on the ah at the same time as the one he posted. You always did take your chances in pugs. Just because this person may be well known doesnt make it worse.
---
I was tanking a BRD run the other day and before the emperor the rogue changed it to Master Looter.
---
I refused to pull until it was back on group loot.
---
(nothing ended up dropping)
---
No issue, thought it was wild. Never imagined 5 at once. I blocked out the name, no server.
---
  Hearthstone
---
When I was bringing up my alt to replace my old main, my gear wasn’t perfect for raids so a flask really helped me keep up with the better geared DPS that skipped flasks and pull my own weight.
---
We weren’t pushing world firsts but we cleared BWL, AQ40 and some of Naxx before BC came out.

Thank you for this comment. I didn’t fully understand the legend at first glance and you made me realize that it was a scale from bottom-top, just missing the ‘tens place’ digit for most of the numbers.
---
Why post something like this? A normal guild sure, but when the leader of the guild ninja loots shit all the time and then uses his guild members as content when they do it?
---
You're just giving him and his 6 Asmongold reacts YouTube channels content.
---
Yeah, some things are just a coincidence
---
ZF at 44+. I usually invite people that are level 45. It is easily clearable with some level 43s but it is too slow for me, 45 is good though.
---
Mara would be around level 48.
---
You mean he's been building a persona over the years that entrenched this character into a MASSIVE community that likes his character? 
---
I agree that Asmon is toxic but that's kind of the point? He's douchey, loud and obnoxious and not particularly good at anything. 
---
FilthyFrank built an entire channel over being THE most cancerous YouTube channel available. Everyone was convinced that's who he was because of how deeply embedded he was to his characters, so much so that when he moved on to other things he lost fans because he wasn't "being the true FilthyFranku". 
---
Asmon has always been a community enjoyment/Thorn in our side because of who he is. Hate him or love him, what he's doing is working and it works really well, and whether we agree on it or not, his twitch, yt, Twitter sub counts don't lie. Someone likes the content.
---
A human cant even get windfury
---
Yes, the turtles. Thank you.
---
+healing seems useless unless you stack a good amount of it and it wont happen till 60. Take the rod.
---
I've always been a bartender/perl lover for the customization.
---
Not to mention bartender you can do /kb which makes key binding a breeze.
---
Yeah but not everyone uses it. I've been using elvui for years and dont have the update and my friends dont either. Isnt it even a paid thing?
---
I'm a bit torn apart between playing my warlock or my warrior. Currently both are around 25, so not too high. I've always been a lock and love both the playstyle and solo potential but I'm also super tempted by the never ending potential of a maxed out warrior (In addition to finding instance groups super easy). Another point is my mate, who is playing a priest. Shadow-Priest and Warlock work great in combination, but having a pocket healer is quite nice, too. Anyone got some thoughts on the topic? thanks!
---
That’s greed. You don’t *need* it. You want it, for cash, because greed.
---
I installed bagnon yesterday, it works for me.
---
Eh. I'd grab the early holy stuff up to consecrate, then go prot. It's a great skill to have to aoe kill stuff and the other talents increase survivability.
---
I guarantee he just finds it funny, he doesn't care.
---
that would make sense but it is not how my brain works.
---
How is it nonsense. There are like 5 videos on YouTube from the last week of him kicking ninjas.
---
Jesus. Hell of a monthly payment!
---
care to define need in this context?
---
Barbaric Loincloth
---
No you don't. Lower ranked skills cease to exist once you learn the new one.
---
Unless it's an addon issue. The default hot bars update themselves automatically though.
---
And the benefit of the profession while leveling is exactly that. Not having to go back to older zones later
---
If you are speed leveling or doing the same quests for example all the way to 60, how much /played time difference is there between the fastest class (hunter) and slowest (warrior)?
---
The reason I ask is I'm maining warlock with paladin as alt and the paladin actually seems similar if only a bit slower overall.
---
Is it only in the 40-60 range that the slower leveling classes really fall behind?
---
Was grouped with another mage doing the elite quests at Dun Garok in Hilsbrad and he was pulling everything.  He kept telling me to learn how to sheep properly when all I was doing was trying to prevent us getting overrun.  As soon as he got all his quests complete he dropped group and hearthed.  So yeah, I kinda agree.
---
No, only a paladin with reckoning could actually do that.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Reckoning_Bomb
---
Ok... why?
---
There are so many videos of him kicking ninjas .
---
Please dude.
---
Exactly. Just like warlocks would do more DPS in raids using all their dots. It's about playing as a team, sacrificing individual glory for the good of the whole.
---
Have you been met with much success in life by living by these rules?
---
More dumb mages mean less cloth for good priests and warlocks.
---
Good find. Did you post in blizzard's bug forums?
---
I'm not 100% sure I'm accurate here, but the way I understand these seals to break down is you just want to pop Seal of Crusader then Judgment on bosses once then go into a damaging Seal, otherwise for adds and mobs just use and Judge Righteousness (or Command when you have it) because the DPS increase that is given by judging Crusader just doesn't matter because you kill them fast enough the additional holy damage is less than it would be for you to just Judge Righteousness or Command right off the bat.
---
In terms of safety the retail system is brilliant, but it kills the MMO aspect of the game. This system promotes ninja looting or dishonesty and it's amplified since back in the classic it was perfectly fine to ninja shit. Only punishment was social if someone took the time to spread information about scammer.
---
Out of curiosity did you monitor how much data was used? I've never looked but I've always wondered how much data would be used per hour of WoW.
---
That is a good idea, except that you'll only get one of your key aoe grind abilities at around 51 (Holy Shield).
---
On Deviate Delight-RPPvP Horde side, it feels very much like a PvP server with a very light touch of RP. I was hoping for more RPing but nope just feels like a normal PvP server
---
That’s true. The only way it’s a more efficient allocation is it removes the need to pay deposit at the auction house. But it triggers a larger question. Does this not apply to BOE greens too? Do they really “need” that green more than a twink who’d pay 5 times as much for it? Why not have everyone need and auction it off to whoever is willing to pay the most for it?
---
Getting loot is fun. Getting loot you can lose is funner, and I think that should take priority. But I don’t think that applies to world drops/epic items, because the risk of ninjas is too high.
---
Naming policy is absolutely not enforced. There are people I reported back in August that are still running around.
---
Good find, submit it as a bug
---
This is a bannable offense. Stating clear loot rules in chat, and then not abiding by said loot rules is bad. 
---
Make a ticket.
---
If the item is sold, the buyer will keep the item, as he is innocent, and the seller Will Lose the gold and get a well deserved ban
---
The mats from disenchanting this item will be around 1g (a bit high i think)
---
What is those names? :O
---
That's classic yes, gets better over time as people who still need dungeons are less rushy and pushed about it (since if they were, they'd be finished by now). Overall as a nonhealer/tank the prebis part of the vanilla grind is IMO the worst, and the dungeon leveling meta(which wasn't in vanilla btw) is trash and makes you basically start the prebis grind..from as early as lvl12.
---
For leveling stick with swords as your main goal. Take sword spec talent. And pick up thrash blade as soon as you qualify for the quest.
---
Hold up.. where is this teleporter?!

It's great. I've never been a laptop person but my work gave me 2 grand to buy a laptop and not gonna lie it's been nice to be able to game when we go to the inlaws every weekend or upstairs watching tv with the wife instead of my basement desktop lair.
---
In my experience when I played paladin in 2006 was that you get picked for raids, but mostly for the buffs, also retri is kinda weak IMO but with a good build it's kinda nice. Don't care about the memes imo and just go with the one you wanna play the most.
---
Actually I was trying to give the guy encouragement but sure.
---
Rolling using the system in place and taking an item you dont need is not ninja looting.  Changing the loot and taking without rolling is.
---
/u/Kantalop3 is saying that this post will do nothing. Royson will at most get a 3 day ban and item removed, all of Olypmus will praise him for making to the front of Reddit, Asmon will have content reading all of these comments, and nothing will change. People will still hate Asmon and he'll still be popular. Asmon advocates ninja looting so obviously he wouldn't care.

There are many reasons this sub doesn't allow things like this. Now, it does talk about being able to discuss public figures. But an officer in a guild ran by a "public figure" is not the same thing as being a public figure. I don't condone what the guy did. It was a stupid thing to do. But you can't say "no you can't post that screenshot of your chat with the guild leader of &lt;insert guild name here&gt; spamming you with guild invites and harassing you in /tell. You must block out their name."  then turn around and say "yeah it's fine to name drop someone and the guild they're in because they ninja loot'd"

Rules are rules my dude.

Since you'll be spamming Sinister Strike, I would get a slow mainhand Sword (since they're easier to come by) and a fast offhand dagger. If you find a slow mace, that's good for mainhand, too.

Congrats! What a feeling, right?

Wowwww it's one thing to need on a Boe for money..but to state loot rules and then immediately violate them is actually scamming I believe
---
It does sound simple, doesn't it?  I'm no expert though, I'm just a level 47ish hunter who has watched a bunch of youtube videos.
---
Yeah, that’s what I said.
---
colcar is a primitive tribe, i didn't expect to find mandala inside))))
---
When someone says all greed on an epic, you have to be a fool to not think he is going to ninja. All need, all epic boes.
---
Ah I see u sleep like the zohan
---
Especially considering that the staff drops all the time. When I farmed for the hypnotic blade I had to go in there five times for it to drop once, all other times it was the staff.
---
You’re right on the larger point, but you’re misusing game theory. The results from the prisoner’s dilemma aren’t guaranteed to be equitable, and they are necessarily not the most advantageous outcome for all parties.
---
what skill? there's no mount skill in the game you just buy the mount itself for 900g
---
Most people jump into the lava, so I doubt you'll find much success
---
Yeah, limiting the fps worked, thanks!
---
Edit: Just weird how it never happens in other games.
---
1.59 is 8s a cloth and puts the runecloth bags as a 10s profit at 3g a bag.  That's probably why that's your threshold for selling.
---
Pretty sure it’s BiS for warriors through the entire expansion. At least for fury not sure about other specs
---
Not surprising for one of Asmongold's cronies.
---
At lower levels it is especially if you spec into Arms.  As fury it is that much worse.  But yeah it's a nice use of rage as an opener, so you get all its ticks.  Does more damage than a single heroic strike for sure and heroic strike is very costly- 15 rage + not earning rage from your melee swing.
---
The baby won't be a baby forever. Good practice to grow into the dad who points out the scenery and help develop a young mind. You do you but it's not how we do us. There'll always be another moment in game.
---
You can set the loot to master looter, where one person handles where the loot goes. Typically happens in high dungeons/raids where you're trying to gear your team and everyone is after something specifically. This way, you're guaranteed the item, or, everyone who wants the item /rolls to win it and doesn't have to worry about someone "need" rolling when they can't even use/don't plan to use said item.
---
Yep, that's exactly what happens. If you try and cast a higher rank Blessing, for instance, it justs says 'Target is too low level'
---
It is so so very true
---
This is what I did. It works great - thanks!
---
I used my  work phone on verizon last weekend and it used about a gig per hour. 
---
I used my tmobile hotspot(they are doing a test drive promotion right now, send you a hotspot, you get 30gb for 1 month to try it) and I user 6gb in 4 hours, so I'm thinking it fluc.
---
Honestly thought it would be less data for gaming.
---
Sounds like you are having a cry coz you ain't finding groups for loot as a rogue?
---
Make your own group. And join a guild both of these options will solve the issue of issues with reserved loot.
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
I mean, there's some relationships I'd trade for a bit of dirt.
---
It’s 9 procs per minute so proc rate depends on weapon speed. From the in depth tests from beta on Defcamp/Melderons video it looks like he also got Flametongue being consistently last in every single scenario.

They are neckbeards

It's a pretty decent weapon in pvp.
---
WC has a great staff from quest rewards.
---
Write it without the . 
---
It shows the tooltip of the spell u choose, if u leave it out it won't show the tooltip
---
Sucks being colour blind sometimes haha.
---
Yes, but the AH still takes a cut, which appears to have a different formula that is based on the size of the sale.
---
Something like listing cost is 40% of what the vendor would buy for, while AH cut is maybe 5% of sale?
---
I seriously doubt that they're doing anything more than verifying that the algorithm flagged the account. [Remember that Blizzard fired a substantial number of their customer support staff earlier this year.](https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-have-reportedly-begun/) 
---
I went to eastern Europe for work from Sep 8th to Sep 18th. About a week after I returned I was suspended for 30 days. I've appealed and offered to provide blizzard with itineraries, passport entry stamps, photos from the trip with metadata and anything else they wanted to prove that it was in fact me logging on europe. They don't care, not in the slightest.
---
I personally like checklist gearing, because I like specifically farming for the best gear I can get.
---
They can and they do. Sales happen. They action when you scam.
---
Man, if a purple drops and someone NEEDS it (as in they will immediately equip it on the spot), I wish people would let them have it. Not this (everyone needs gold bull*** angle".) It's so rare and it sucks to see something you will use immediately go to a class that can't just for the gold, it's heartbreaking. I hate this "everybody needs" crap. This is how *I remember* vanilla being played.
---
My thoughts exactly. I went tailoring and now kind of regret it... No real point except for bloodvine set bonus when it comes out... in multiple months.
---
I think it's referenced as the Sunken Temple by some quests and NPCs, not sure though
---
Gold isn't an issue for me lol. Plus it's going for around 400g on my server and I didn't have to farm it with a group for a few hours.
---
I wouldn’t go past Ruin, that’s the 21 point unlock.
---
Affliction is fairly boring, I agree - But I think it might be faster leveling as Affliction because you can pull so many extra mobs at once.
---
I’ve heard INT + Spirit is actually BIS for hunters leveling, 100% serious even though it sounds weird.
---
I mean Un'Goro/whatever are minor issues in the grand scheme of things but yes seems they didn't.
---
I would ask if I could buy it if I really need it. If it is not worth to spend gold to buy it then it is probably not that important. If it is BiS it should really be something to grind gold for, if it is a twink item it should not be equipped on a character you plan to level up.
---
On my server it's going for buyout at almost 400g so I think it's a good deal.
---
He ninjad T2 helm from ony lmao. He’s a piece of shit.
---
It's https://wow.gamepedia.com/Samwise_Didier he made all icons and much else from atleast Warcraft 2 and onwards
---
I wouldn’t be mad at source
---
having a defeatist attitude will not serve you well in terms of forming groups in classic. learn how to talk to people, or maybe play a class that is capable of more than one thing so you have some flexibility in forming groups. assuming you're a rogue like fragmatikz said, you're boned because you're fighting a bunch of other classes for gear so no one will want to group with you unless you have a reputation as an excellent rogue or you're willing to make some comprimises. that's life, you picked a selfish class so people will give you that back in return. my advice is: spend your time farming/doing something else while looking to fill out a group
---
I mean. The AH exists. Some people prefer to not have mining and make money for the mats elsewhere instead of farming the mats
---
some key factors if it is ninja looting or not. is it must be stated in party/raid chat what the rules are and for example if an item is on reserve.
---
so if a tank rolls need on your leather bracers for off-spec it is not ninja looting by blizzard standard as no rules around loot was made. if rule states only roll on highest gear you can wield or main-spec gear then it is ninja looting.
---
the biggest issue i see is a lot of people just assume that the general rules of looting applies rather than having it stated in chat. thus a lot ninja looting isn't ninja looting to blizzard but it is in the communities eyes it takes time for said people to be punished by the community.
---
when i ran my most of my alt pug runs in TBC and WotLK at the start i clearly stated the loot rules and if any items were on reserve (i almost never put an item on reserve unless it was the one item a guildie needed inorder to make the swap for it to become his main). when the rules are stated blizzard can act when clear violations happens.
---
an example ulduar was out and i was running naxx25 man alt runs a dude who had done the run on his priest the entire way swaped to his main for KT for the 226 weapon. the guy had passed on better weapons from ulduar many times so i saw the play he was making so before i invited him is clearly stated if he joins he will be rolling for the item as an off-spec item he agreed we killed KT the weapon droped he rolled on it as a MT i reminded him he was rolling for OT tries to say i was a ninja looter he rolls off with a pug healer the healer wins so i hand the weapon away. the guildie spews shit at me calling me a ninja looter and not having guildies backs etc. etc. and gquit. nothing happend to me since i covered my ass he got a week ban for threatning me.
---
&gt; It's still unfathomable to me that people can make thousands of gold buying and flipping. It seems like the most profitable method is finding an item and resetting the market by buying it all up and relisting for 300% MV.
---
I made a killing in retail flipping herbs/mats on the AH. Prices are always cheaper on weekends as there are more players putting things up, and they are more expensive on Tuesday as that's raid night. You didn't have to buy anything out, people would just end up far below the market price on Weekends as they keep pricing each other below market value. 
---
I don't know how consistent the market is in Classic, but it was very easy to make a profit in Retail.
---
It's https://wow.gamepedia.com/Samwise_Didier
---
Let's say I am tanking ST on my feral druid, which I plan to do throughout all of classic, and the Warden staff drops.  Do I need the Warden staff?
---
Bad players cleared all the content in blues and greens by like week 3-4.
---
It doesn't fucking matter what you do.
---
Maybe in a raid, but in a leveling dungeon? 
---
I mean technically they're both 'off spec' rolls.
---
Just because the fury Warr was dosing doesn't mean he shouldn't roll on a shield.
---
you should try a corsair scimitar. just because classic is out doesnt mean to use classic PC parts.
---
Agree. Need the sauce please.
---
Sure, but if you're getting asked the same question enough that it's frustrating you on stream you should probably start a list and just tell people to read the FAQ. Obviously it won't stop 100% of the questions, but it's better than nothing.
---
Not everyone in life has there shit together.
---
Can confirm this is true
---
Boomkins can solo Mara pretty well, if memory serves.
---
Upvoted so everyone has to deal with this.
---
You need basic riding to use the mount. Since Warlocks don’t need to buy it at 40 you have to buy it at 60.
---
I never keep more than 2 extra shards in bag when lvling
---
Only in classic+
---
Please leave classic how it was/is
---
You’re gonna have a bad time as a Resto Druid if you’re never going to look at cloth pieces.
---
Some terrain does, some terrain doesn't. Some trees do, some trees don't. Some buildings do, some buildings don't.
---
Welcome to classic.
---
Usually people who want classic+ dont want TBC regardless of when, thats why
---
You're a monster!
---
Seems foolish of him to bring a DPS warrior. I always build my own groups as a warrior and absolutely exclude other warriors. If you’re not tanking you’re not in my group as a warrior.
---
If you are going solo, I'd personally go Desolace, especially if you are Horde. Arathi is full of those group quests at Stromgarde and Stranglethorn is best as a late 30 to early 40. Alterac doesn't have much, but you can finish up most of those quests as a late 30 pretty easily as well.
---
Definitely run SM library and Armory a few times, and hit up RFD as well.
---
Whenever I get like that I just find a dungeon I haven’t done yet and make a point to find it and a good group. That group instance play always had me hooked and pushes me to the next set of leveling dungeons.
---
Thank you so much... I find guides with things like weak auras on it, but for some reason the more utility stuff is missing (they might have assumed I'd already know about it lol). I knew I was missing something, though, because I've seen screenshots that made the healing process look much different than it was for me.
---
Fair enough, I was always noob so Paladins = Imba in wotlk for me.
---
I didn't know there were enemies past level 60 in classic till I had almost finished lol
---
that bit is for lvl 60 -64
---
Every mmorpg has always had some kind of meta (builds, group composition etc.).
---
I think balancing patches etc... are good, but most importantly it's up to the player to create its own fun by joining with like minded players.
---
So to answer your question, trying to "bust the meta" is exagerated. Trying to balance specs, sure why not.
---
the world of azeroth really starts to open up to you at around level 40. group up with people for questing, especially in contested zones. GLHF
---
TellMeWhen
---
You're right that it will show people the type of person Asmon is(or well, the people he hangs with) but I have my doubts it'll do anything is all I'm trying to say. Will even more people know of his personality, antics, and what he encourages? Yeah but at the end of the day nothing will change.
---
Best case scenario is that for once he actually takes this seriously and kicks Royson which I think he actually might do as he does actively kick people ninja-looting in Olympus if he gets mail regarding it but I feel it might be a different case with Royson since he's pretty much like a mini Mcconnellret(One of Asmon's friends) so he might let him off on a warning.
---
The tanking warrior while leveling should be arms, so they’ll SS into WW into cleave as well.
---
Censored down to their first two letters so I don't bring too much flak down on guildies if one of my dumb memes gets taken too literally by the community.
---
I work in IT support as a day job so blurring out names in screenshots is sort of a habit.
---
Might be a bad angle, there were hills around the missing slice of water so it was hard to grab another shot. My head is well below water level, and that croc stood no chance cuz i was evading everything in that spot.
---
Or you just dump 500g into edgemasters and not have a care in the world.
---
Sell tank runs for lower level content. Sell them for like 5 - 10 gold a run through like SM Cath, or ZF, you can make decent enough money selling off mats, and boes. 
---
Not the most viable route, but it's something
---
I totally agree with you tbh, but there does seem to be guilds who don’t care/don’t want to give loot to “sub-optimal” specs like a moonkin, when it could go to an “optimal” mage etc.
---
I only gather the easy reachable quests, but at least I stay next to the dungeons. When I grinded monastery I logged out there and had my hs in southshore. People who are to far away ill kick out of the group
---
Joanas leveling guide, helps a lot
---
There are most definitely optimum specs, but most of rogue will depend on what your best weapon is right now.  You might want to be a dagger rogue, but if you have a great sword, you're going to use it until you can get a great dagger to replace it.  So you may end up switching specs back and forth.  For example, if I got a really nice dagger, I'd switch to a ambush/backstab build instead of hemo.
---
Your life as a rogue is your weapons. They define what spec you use.
---
I could do the same argument for retail. If you want new content you cam go play retail but you can choose not to and stay in classic as it is. People want to keep playing this game, but they wont if the game goes in a direction they dont like which in this case is TBC. Doesnt mean people dont want more content
---
I like ark inventory because you can then split things up into categories. It's nice to have my soulbound greens/blues in 1 spot so I know when to just vendor old gear
---
It is not even a good healing staff. There is a way better healing item from the boss of Cath. Or if you want a staff, the GY boss of ZF.
---
BoE world drops have literally nothing to do with the dungeon you're running.  No teamwork was required to get it, just luck.  As such, equal rolling is the way to distribute it.  It's hard to believe the hypocritical audacity of someone demanding everyone else in the party bow down to their wishes and abstain from the item.
---
Dungeon loot does NOT go to whoever needs it "most" it goes to whoever can make use of it, distributed with luck based rolls.  In the case of BoP items from dungeons, that means whoever can equip it.  In the case of BoE World drops, literally everybody has equal ability to use that item.  All they have to do is make a character.
---
You can hem and haw about how the loot system "*really*" works but the fact that you people try to argue that you and only you deserve to get it completely uncontested because you happen to be on your mage when freezing band drops or on your hunter when edgemasters drop is fucking asinine and truly the selfish viewpoint.
---
Sell it, give it to who can equip it, send it to their alt, DE it or fucking trash it right there.  Everyone advocating a party wide need roll are the ones wanting to be fair.  You are just selfish.
---
Grow the hell up, you don't get everything in life handed to you for free.  Every time a world epic drops for a full party there are 4 disappointed people.  Everyone has equal opportunity to make any character and everyone deserves an equal shot at that BiS for that character, or whatever else THEY decide to do with the item THEY won.
---
Wanting the item is not selfish.  Telling other people they don't deserve or qualify to roll on it absolutely is.
---
SHAME 🔔 SHAME 🔔 SHAME 🔔
---
Idc what anyone says. Blue and purple boe hit need.
---
If campers annoy you, then you should play on a normal server. 
---
Otherwise there certain levels that are boring, you just hit them and have to push through. That's why the game is harder because it's a long grind to level 60.
---
OHHHHH UUUUUUHHH
---
Same. Except horde
---
how can a rogue gank you with a Faerie Fire?
---
What surprises me is that the people who joined this guild should have seen this coming a mile off.  What happens when you put the loudest, most arrogant and most toxic people with no affiliations for anyone but themselves together in a guild?
---
They can, the healer in this joke is being unreasonably petty in the same way my tank in the other comics is unreasonably edgelordy. 
---
Don't try this at home unless you want too get a bad rep.
---
Yes and because of our laws of conservation, whatever CO2 the tree fixates into sugars and whatever glucose isn’t used for gaining mass gets released at night through the stoma as CO2
---
Yeah anything you make will disappear. HS, SS etc.
---
Good catch
---
And it would capture the cat? 🤔
---
Its not a couch casting. It was from the Ice Poseidon stream. Her name is Lindsay aka Dragon
---
Being too cheap to buy upgrades from the AH doesn't give you the right to grab loot that is much better suited to someone else.
---
Run to get new flight paths.  See some new scenery, run through some dangerous zones, expand your options.
---
Your mentality doesn't work.  If you actually needed a BoE epic, you could pay for it with gold on the auction house.  You cannot pay anyone for BoP loot.  It has a fixed gold value - vendor or DE mats.  If I could pay vendor or DE mat price for my BoP items, I'd gladly do it but it's not an option.  
---
Plus, your goal when grouping up for a dungeon is never to get BoE world drops.  Everyone hopes they drop, sure, but it's not realistic to expect that.  Your goal when doing dungeons, in regards to loot specifically, is to hopefully see the piece you want off a bosses loot table.  It's realistic and achievable.  Clear difference between random jackpot BoEs.  You realize the same system exists for BoEs, BoPs, greens, blues, and purples all should follow the same system without any nuance?   Go lead some pug raids without master looter, see how your weirdo utopian views end up playing out.
---
Blizzard fault for not making good Leather and Mail drops. Mail wearers only wearing mail, etc. only becomes a thing in BC. My shaman right now wears 70% cloth and I don't believe a single piece of mail.
---
Exactly. There's literally never a reason to say all greed except to trick stupid people.
---
I had whitemane's chapeau as a hunter in classic. No one else in my group needed it and it was far better than anything I had previously but got some salty whispers while playing from clothies.
---
Nah. He really just fucking enjoys being a leader in the community. I didn't like Asmon at first but I think he's actually really good for the WoW community as a whole.
---
Really? Haven't noticed any of these things in O2 been there since the beginning. Now maybe I'm not looking at guild chat enough but never seen it myself.
---
Lol well that's just funny haha.
---
Probably for the shard. It's a dick move but I've seen people do it that are close to 40 and don't have mount money yet.
---
What a wangrod. Get that douche suspended for sure.
---
Repair before logging off
---
Wow what a piece of shit.
---
Well nobody wants to see screenshots of two people having a need-off and being cordial about it. 
---
"Need roll 82."
---
"Need roll 83."
---
"83 wins item."
---
"Ah shit man good weapon there"
---
"Yeah I'm lucky af"
---
"cheers mate"
---
Sounds like the classic experience to me
---
Sadlife shaman. All my Pre Raid BiS is mana per 5 stuff.  Items that don't have good mana per 5 instead get Healpower. Items that have neither need int. spirit is my least useful stat.
---
Don't be in one of those guilds if you care.
---
420Lolololololololol69
---
&gt; I've met people in their 30's who say shit like 'pepega' out loud
---
please tell me this isn't true.
---
This is the correct response.
---
Before SS+Cleave or Whirlwind everything u spend rage on just feels bad. But oh boy when u get sweeping strikes and whirlwind pull 2-4 mobs and just mow them down it feels so good!!
---
I thought that until classic. Hes been a pretty huge piece of shit since it launched.
---
I did look to make sure I wasn’t shamelessly reposting, and didn’t see it anywhere. Perhaps I didn’t look hard enough.
---
He is within the top 100% of healers.
---
Hunter reputation also comes from basically every state being beneficial to them so while leveling they roll need on a ton of shit because it's minor upgrades or different stat composition from what they have.
---
Thank you, it’s all good now she did end up calling the morning after
---
Sounds like this is losely linked to that post about the officer from Olympus making a very obvious ninja on a BOE epic.   
---
I hope blizzard will uphold temp ban rulings on cases like that along with very obvious common sense ninja loots. Like a Druid rolling need on a mail/plate piece. Cause someone being banned because they rolled on an upgrade that is not strictly loot for them (random example being a weapon with agil/attack power being won by a hunter when its a huge upgrade for someone else) would be too far.
---
Well, guilds that actually participate in end game content are communist in nature. 
---
We are talking pugs now. MC ingots are not handed to those that need them in pugs, it's all gold.
---
It doesn't make it seem harder, it makes it feel like more of an adventure. And there's almost always something else to do along the way. 
---
The only thing that's gonna make it seem harder is me dying over and over to an enemy I can't kill.
---
Do it
---
I leveled fishing and cooking for several hours yesterday, felt good, and the weather was crap, so that helped.
---
That’s why there’s an emphasis on “trying” to gank my friend.
---
That's not Royson, it's Roysun.
---
This is Classic WoW. Advocating anything other than Classic WoW is the antithesis of what this is supposed to be
---
They’re pretty good as a flag carrier in WSG (although a Druid or warrior is probably a bit better). They can be decent as a flag defender in AB as well since they’re basically impossible to kill. But yeah I’m open world they just can’t put out enough damage.
---
I don't get it. At this point surely the power levellers should be done and those still levelling playing to enjoy the experience. I don't understand why people are still obsessed with this AoE shit.
---
Good travels friend
---
An Asmongold lemming is an asshole?
---
I'm SHOCKED.
---
Do you play on Firemaw-EU? I've seen that guy a lot in world chat.
---
You forgot to say no homo
---
They wouldn't unless they intended to ninja it. These guys were being idiots.
---
But then you give the ring that actually belonged to the forsakens wife back to her. So it's kinda sweet.
---
Then you poison those prisoner farmers upstairs.....
---
No what i mean is rogues don’t have Faerie Fire so how can one try to gank you with it??
---
Damn, how about DD Pala, is that any good? Or is Pala just bad in general.
---
Yeah, honestly anyone who signs up to that cancer of a server almost gets what they deserve for being so stupid.
---

To be fair, it was a noticeable scam from the start. I wouldn't have needed a pic to prove anything...Furthermore a pic really doesnt prove anything or provide any security.
---
Why would you do it for us? We have seen it about 100 times now, lmao
---
Paladins are picked for raid groups. As Holy's. Holy paladins are OP af. They are one of the reason why the best raiding guilds are alliance.
---
believe it when I see it.
---
The AH sure does exist, and you could speculate and flip items for 100% of your income.  But you can't deny that having a gathering profession, especially while leveling and coming across herbs/ore constantly, is a convenient way to make extra coin (or level your profession).  Thorium bars are going for 80s a piece on my server.  If my engineering is at 250 and I don't have mining OR a fortune with which to pay for thorium bars, my engineering is going to stay at 250 for months until prices fall.
---
Gosh talk about low effort karma farming. We get it ok. Everyone here gets it. The game is a success. Please stop littering the sub with this low  effort crap.
---
Oh sorry. No I mean they were trying to gank me (a Druid), and I caught them out of stealth by casting faerie fire on them.
---
No gnome oh
---
You need a guild. The group is static the tanks will gear fast so the dps can follow.
---
He is wrong.  Normalization means the attack power scaling will be the same.   If I have a weapon at 0.1 attack speed and 1-1 damage and a weapon at 3.0 attack speed at 30-30 damage with 14 attack power (enough to add 1 dps)
---
 The first weapon will hit for 3.3 and the second weapon will hit for 33.2.  
---
Slower weapons are still better.
---
Guy named Alfk on kromcrush needed on a boe 19 twink item at level 27 in RFK. We asked him to equip it and he said it was for his alt. We promptly let him die when he refused to discuss the matter and pulled next mob group. Then kicked him and reported him to his guilds gm.
---
Dont wanna seem like an elitist but I avoided SM because I genuinely didnt want to spend hours upon hours spamming the same dungeon just for XP and the odd item and every time I got whispered as a paladin it was to tank SM farm runs. No screw that im going to actually enjoy my leveling experience instead of spending 8 hours + in a 3 dungeon wing daily until I hit 40 so I can spam more dungeons to 60.
---
I had a mage named pantyshot way back when the game came out. Must have pissed off the wrong person, one day when I went to log in I was forced with a name change. 
---
However, I still have a pandaren monk named Fuhqueue.
---
''permanently guild'' sure buddy continue to belive most guilds cesspool guilds dont only care about member count, also my bad, i dont know my english grammar, its my 3rd language
---
In vanilla you always gear the MT first
---
Your on fire Ricky bobby
---
Imo, the prices is only going to go down. I’ve been seeing it go for 600-800g right now and it usually falls down to 200g roughly.
---
Tanking in Classic is easy as well. I haven't seen any glaring issues.
---
My only true question at this point is, why are people crying about BiS stuff? Theres been a lot of guilds that down raid bosses and the raid was full of people not even level 60 yet much less having BiS pieces.
---
Surely having BiS isn't too big a deal right?
---
*\*Laughs in PvE server\**
---
Sadly if you were in pvp combat and got killed by a pve enemy it still counts as a pvp death. Distracting people off cliffs does give them durability damage though (and you don't get a kill)
---
Balanced
---
I main a shaman myself, so I feel you. Resto at least gets manatide, I went for Elemental... (Not planning to raid though, so it's fiiiiine.)
---
The only reason I ever say all greed is if someone accidentally greeds quickly, but for boe epic sorry dog shoulda waited
---
Orbs fluctuate between 20-35 gold depending on time of day on my server, but they always sell very quickly.
---
Currently leveling a dwarf hunter and was running deadmines with a NE hunter. During some of the tunnel stages i could not get LoS, but he was standing next to me shooting away with no problems. It was awful haha
---
I've already compromised by often passing on gear up to lvl 60 already just to get into groups in order to finish my quests and to level. Now I try as hard as possible to negotiate in order to get bis groups to start put people would rather throw a coin and take their chance instead of working together. I'm defensive because comments like yours assume that I wouldn't have already tried those things, it's frustrating.  
---
As I get other people to know it's getting better obviously, but it's still far from what I remembered or expected.
---
I use daggers and have no trouble leveling. Level 50 now. Love it used same in vanilla
---
Asmons a pretty good streamer. I think you're unreasonably upset here because of what one of his guild members did.
---
The idealist in me hates to agree with you, but he's associated with a WoW celebrity so the cynic in me is screaming that what you've said is exactly what will happen.
---
I look forward to the cynic being proven wrong!
---
What should I do with extra linen cloth/bolts to make the most gold?
---
I mean he is playing fury tanking now so he doesnt need to do much other than sunder and dps and needs to stay in defensive
---
It was before personal loot became the only option.
---
It does, in the later versions of the game. Vanilla didn't have this feature though so Classic doesn't have it either.
---
NO unless it’s a close friend you keep that to yourself and sell it, you won’t win many of these so take the win while you xan
---
Yea I do
---
DD Paladins are situational. They are decent in group PvP. But they just aren't good in 1 on 1 fights, because the enemy will simply flee when they are losing. You can't really do anything about it. You don't have good slows and you don't deal the damage to burst.
---
Im just pointing out that you dont MUST have mining (like you said, caps lock and all. Im not saying that one is better than the other
---
If this is almost making you quit you should play sth else 
---
Preferably single player offline games
---
My point was they declared it non-actionable in retail a few years back.
---
 Imagine falling for the "all greed" scam in 2019
---
gawt dayum
---
The posts are all made by invisible rogues
---
Ah yes classicwow, the sub where u can't have any criticism of vanilla
---
I'd say DPS warriors are right there with them. They dont let tank get aggro and are always eager to overpull.
---
Yep.  The meta is what we love about Classic.
---
Being a lone wolf sucks. I joined a large average guild and it’s great for grouping SM, Mara, Ulda, ZF so far.
---
I think you are looking at the game through the most cynical and depressed lens. If you take it less seriously you can ignore the bad META crap.
---
&gt; "OoOOoooh" crack
---
I can hear this comment
---
I enjoy when he talks to other creators like pyro who does wow lore. He 100% drops his persona then
---
Royson is an officer from olympus not Roysun. You got jebaited.
---
I would have DE'd something right in front of them for the ultimate lulz
---
Wow thanks. I'm playing druid, and I've been trying to follow [this guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/feral-druid-melee-dps-pve-guide). It says the best stats are 
---
1. Hit chance until 9% (Hit Cap)
---
2. Agility;
---
3. Strength;
---
4. Critical Strike Chance;
---
5. Attack Power;
---
6. Intellect;
---
7. Stamina;
---
8. Spirit.
---
Should I just follow what it says or is it not that good of a guide?
---
Also if I want to mostly play feral, do I have to respec to resto every time I want to go healer in a dungeon?
---
That’s why you ask them why the PMs weren’t shown in the text box.
---
Not that I know of, but more guilds are hiring than advertising. I just asked in trade chat for a guild with a black tabard and lucked into a small group of great folks!
---
Is it Festivus time already?
---
This is the WoW version of "date me! I'm a nice guy!"  "But I already have a bf"  "Fucking piece of shit slut!!! I hope you get raped!!"  
---
Why are people like this??
---
But dal rends set is BiS for hunter weapon in phase 1...
---
I assume every priest under 40 is disc. After that, shadow is the best for leveling. But here I am, disc/holy specced. Makes dungeons easier to heal so worth it.
---
Never in the history of wow has all the specs and classes been balanced fairly, and there has always been a "not optimal" lookout. Only difference is that in classic its known in advance what is good and all classes can play their setup fairly stable
---
The logic seems fine to me.
---
Elemental shaman is better than rogue in BGs, rogues are better in wpvp. But as an ele sham you will be doing plenty of healing unless you're a really bad teammate.
---
But it takes so much skill.  Do I kick, gouge, or kidney shot your feeble attempts to cast things, as I wail on you with restorative potion running?
---
all need, why should a hunter have more chance at the gold just because he can use more items?
---
So how does it run?
---
Not all shoulds are followed
---
Proof?
---
Must be a shit bot, they were far more advanced than that back in original Vanilla &amp; TBC.
---
I level as pvp specced hemo daggers all the time. I don't know what people in this thread are actually on about though, caster daggers (even with dps increase) are leveling caster daggers.. You will not see those dungeons more than once leveling normally, I would never need on a caster dagger, those are very few and far between, with hypnotic blade being EXCEPTIONALLY good for a very good amount of time (until zumrahs vexing cane or some other upgrade in your early 40s)
---
They did have these rules in Vanilla and things were done in Vanilla.
---
I used joanas guide and followed it to the T and I ended up at 11d 20h time played, as a warlock. Personally I think the aoe grind is the best.
---
I'm not faulting anyone but guild leader. Because of that I'm saying how to protect yourself.
---
The spellcleave dungeon meta, if executed correctly, is super effective and the fastest way i ever leveled. Including full heirlooms retail grinds.
---
The problem is, that really bad players or hardcore casuals (so basically everybody who is not yet 60) try it in random grps and ofc fail, because they are bad players per se.
---
This is reddit, if the hivemind dislikes something/someone. They will just move the goal post over and over again.
---
People SUPER underestimate how good spirit is leveling for every class. I was grouped with another warrior in my guild the other day for a quest, and I was healing to full between mobs while he sat and ate. The sheer amount of food you need as a warrior to level without spirit is insane, whereas relatively minimal amounts of spirit make a huge difference to out of combat regeneration
---
I feel like multi shot was instant, are u thinking of aimed shot?
---
It's really weird that 2 people said the same thing.
---
Guys, I'm not excusing the behavior.
---
But this is like someone asking to hold a gun to your head, saying yes, and then being surprised when they pull the trigger because you trusted them.
---
There's no reason to bring trust into this situation when it can be resolved in everyone's best interest by simply choosing need
---
I have had some groups like this, but worse thing so far has been poor pulling and aggro discipline, people pull while healer is oom, people nuke mobs before tank can establish aggro, the group wipes and its all the healer or the tanks fault.
---
Priests are pretty easy to kill, especially in lower levels.
---
So it's okay for you to need out of greed, but not for other people?
---
No, I get it. The distances are more spread so that even with a mount you still have to travel just as long.
---
Doesn't fucking change a thing, dude. You're the one that needs to read.
---
And btw, you need a mount because distances are more spread, not the other way around. You seem to not understand that it's an RPG.
---
Because your stat priorities are agility &gt; stam &gt; int &gt; spirit.  Not int &gt; spirit &gt; stam &gt; agility (like most casters).
---
Your logic regarding spirit is the same as EVERY class that can cast spells, which is most of them.
---
That doesn't make this something the hunter should be rolling against pure casters on.
---
Eh, you're assuming people didn't wait more than two days before deciding to play. My group waited for a week after release, so our first month subscription is still active for quite a while.
---
It is. They can see chat logs and will check.
---
Mouse over macro or just click res then the corpse
---
Next level to be able to steal from guild banks in vanilla...
---
I had Boots of Avoidance drop off of the first pack in Zul'Farrak, the group just said grats to me before I even clicked need.
---
It's low priority and should get bumped off easily. And really, MC is easy mode what with all the theory crafting and experience rolling around now. Our first clear was with sub-30 people. Just because a single debuff slot might get eaten by Barman's isn't going to make a difference unless everyone in your raid is just awful.
---
You can say that but my mouseover macros have downranking built right in, plus some of them have dps spells so if I'm mousing over a mob, it's still the same hot key.
---
I have 2 bars, and a decent party/raid frames (I use grid because that's what I have always used), but I contend, good mouseover macros are just about there easiest things to heal with.
---
Do us a favor, stop attempting to lie, reread comment above and go play a game you actually enjoy instead of trying to fit into a game you dont. Its fucking sad
---
I'll try breaking it down for you. 
---
People don't want to just wait outside an instance, wasting valuable gaming time (theirs might be limited) with the possibility that they don't ever find a team at that team, i.e no tank
---
People are simply too lazy to get all the quests before hand and it is very easy for people to share eligible quests. 
---
They may have not intended to go to the dungeon at that time but saw a post where they needed their specific role and thought they'd go along. 
---
Accidental hearthstone could explain why they are in a different place. 
---
Last option is they simply don't care about you waiting for them. 
---
Pick one
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
There's a gnome that doesn't skip legday.
---
If you see SW:P on a mob and the tank died... you might have a mediocre healer.
---
You can say that all you want buy blizzard feels otherwise.
---
Wait...I literally can't play the game if I think he sucks?  What's the logic? 
---
You Asmon fan boys are something else...
---
I always need one bow epics and encourage everyone else in the group to do the same, that way it’s impossible to be fucked.
---
The joys of playing a class people know they will never have to wait to find more of, no matter how big a douchebag they are. You don't get to find out what people are really like until you give them carte blanche to act like an asshole with no consequences.
---
=P
---
Yeah pre level 30 is just spending rage, screaming at the mob as you take endless hits, and outlasting them.  RARELY improved overpower will make a good number pop up.  Then it all changes and you become god-tier for a few levels
---
Precisely. Max level hunter is fun but leveling hunter is too much of a chore to me personally
---
Gz
---
If you have to say you're the best healer you most likely aren't
---
Generally you’d go with the “open trade” for proof.
---
Hasnt joana been restarting once he hits 60? I thought he's hit 60 with multiple toons.
---
Who greeds on boes... just need roll and never get scammed
---
Or just generally leveling really, I'm at around 110 skill in my 40s because I keep accidentally doing quests with mobs that disarm you, it's aggravating
---
You're disconnected from leveling vs max level stats.
---
Great video
---
We found Royson ^^^
---
If a priest is under level 60 and is asking me to heal my group- I am assuming he is shadow and there is nothing wrong with that. It really is not necessary. 
---
I know times have changed , but in my BWL clearing guild in vanilla ppl could spec however they like. Though you did have to heal as a priest, and could not dps.
---
Then own it... you are selfish and don't care how it impacts others, own that. 
---
Don't try to hold the high ground on me just own it. 
---
We all need gold, that's what greed is for, but you're turning greed into need...you ARE the bad guy to most of us.
---
I'm not attacking you.  I think we agree that even if he isnt being serious people will take him seriously and do it.  I just dont think it's really his fault if some of his viewers dont realize hes not being serious.
---
Dude that is fucked up
---
i wish i was this famous where the most petty irrelevant stuff is interesting news to ppl
---
With that point, why is anyone mad then?  This comment is ridiculous.
---
I couldn’t find it for classic.. where can you get it?
---
When do you think boomers were born?
---
The Chosen One!
---
Keep us updated on wether or not Asmongold kicks this trash from his guild
---
Just be ready to find an alternative to AOE grinding depending on server pop/ spot popularity/ and prime time. 
---
For example Murlocks in swamp of sorrows at midnight on a Monday ill have the spot to myself and get great xp but pirates during the same time there will be 5 alliance and 8 horde questing and 3 mages trying to AOE. 
---
When I am at a level that only has one good AOE spot I will just spam dungeons and get some gear while I am at it.
---
I don't even use LoP, makes her a lot less useful as a mana battery.
---
I'll take "Reasons to play on Herod" for $300, Alex.
---
Definitely a gnome, though
---
I miss your twitch streams Josh!
---
Its okay to not understand the definitions of things. And I'm really sorry you'll never get a boe epic lmao
---
Here him playing him on stream. http://www.twitch.tv/roysontv/v/487382121?sr=a&amp;t=2s the group was all guild members though expect the one dude he is selling it and splitting profits to guild members least that's was was said in discord
---
Also check to see if your realm has a Discord server. Mine does so I’d assume they all do.
---
ok? what do you want me to say? hunters who roll need on shit they shouldn't are scummy, just like rogues and warriors who do it.  its just a stereotype because hunters did it more often and there were more hunters back in the day to increase the pool of selfish people. stereotypes usually exist for a reason
---
To each their own. I really do enjoy questing, but I also liked farming SM, especially Armory for Ravager and that sweet mail gear.
---
Questing can get quite boring, so I do some dungeons. When I get bored of them I do some quests again.
---
I've seen Asmon enough times to know he's a piece of shit. Funny and good wow content sure; but the dude is a piece of shit.
---
If you download the questie addon can see all quests across the world map that are a relevant level to you
---
Is there a demand for these shards?
---
ElvUI Setting&gt; Bags&gt; Uncheck Enabled.  Reload UI
---
Then every item in the game is that way.
---
Sorry warrior, you want ravager? I can vendor it and buy bags for myself. My upgrade through gold is equal to your item upgrade.
---
To be fair rolling prot warrior is kind of constraining yourself. Makes doing things solo even slower than it previously was.
---
It's not an item, it's a sack of coins. Which particular purple item dropped is entirely irrelevant. Its just a sack of coins in the shape of an item.
---
Awww look at you angry boys, it's a game guys, it's not worth the energy getting someone banned over that lol and it probably wont happen anyways, blizz doesnt have time for that.
---
I’m not sure which is more sad. Someone being a dick and ninja looting. Or right after it happens someone saying “REDDIT! REDDIT”
---
Found a way to complain about SJWs in a post about WoW skeletons, impressive.
---
No, he teaches you not to have any business with asmongold crowd. I for one would never if I was on US realms
---
Gz. Can drop off a lot of things specifying it won't make a difference though!
---
Crusader is also nice for leveling weapon skills.
---
Druid noob boi here.
---
I've got 1 button form macros for all my forms but i've just gotten travel form and it's not working with the setup I had. pls help.
---
    #showtooltip Cat Form
---
    /stand
---
    /dismount
---
    /cancelform [noform:3]
---
    /cast [noform:3] Cat Form
---
When I go into cat form the macro button properly inherits the cancel form button, like [this](https://puu.sh/EmNGC/71163a083e.jpg).
---
But when I go into travel form the same behavior is not there so I cannot press the button again to [cancel my form.](https://puu.sh/EmNJj/0865581bfc.jpg)  
---
I use bartender for action bar paging but there's no option for [travel form.](https://puu.sh/EmNMq/233555838f.png)
---
Aah that explains it. Thank you!
---
Ah nice! I figured it was one of the artists just putting himself in the game :)
---
DPS, the new one is better, end of story.
---
And people want to play with these guys? I'm confused
---
Or.. they are just in the middle of a big laugh.  Bears are pretty notorious for their inner comedic monologue.
---
You're ignoring that while this particular piece is a nice upgrade for hunters, it's an enormous upgrade for pure casters. 
---
You're no more a pure caster than my feral druid is...yes, I cast spells, quite often. And spirit is a big deal, but it's not the same for me as mages and priests.
---
No, you can't. But I wasn't really suggesting that you can conclusively say that he's a psychopath based on that one statement alone.
---
However, that statement, mentality and justification is ***heavily*** associated with psychopathic tendencies. No exaggeration.
---
No. What doesn't make sense is that you think mages shouldn't  engage you in close combat, when really that's their best chance of killing you.  There's nothing they can do to your felhunter besides nova.
---
And that's how you get kicked as an officer in 30seconds.
---
What about paladin
---
Yeah those damn stupid noob min maxers. We the casual ret paladins and boomkins are the real classic players.
---
This type of behavior is designed to bring them revenue and viewership. This is a top post of all time in this sub. I wish I could see data for how much money Asmon made off of this and how much he gave Royson for this little stunt. What's more, the guy who got ninjad is a streamer himself. You guys are getting played like a fucking fiddle.
---
Agree to disagree. 
---
Were I op I would have asked. Were I the tank I'd have said op should roll. I haven't really had a situation like this end up with flaring tempers so if that's op's goal (it seems they're taking this pretty hard) I'd think before needing on something I could use.
---
Am I missing something? These guys net like crazy. How are they not doing that at all?
---
Lol people will downvote anything positive about asmongold
---
That's a problem for the alliance filth to sort out.
---
Well, you’re advertising in world or lfg or looking for group chat. It’s to be expected. Not everyone plans on running a dungeon.
---
 I, for example, am a warlock and in desperate need of Felcloth due to robe of the void. I’ll be in Aszhara doing my grind the I see “LF2M UBERS | tank and dps. I know  I need to finish the Onyxia attunement, so I pop them a whisp and as for an invite.
---
What I’m sayin is, it’s purely situational for the person you’re inviting. If you want someone near the entrance then advertise in general chat at the instance.
---
Arh okay males sense
---
Its part of the game now, but it wasn't in actual vanilla because it broke the terms of service. Now those have been replaced with an end user licence agreement which doesnt seem to prohibit cross faction collusion. People are complaining because Blizzard released the old patch, but with new rules that make the game different.
---
? has always been a bannable / punishable offense, ive gotten many people punished for it.
---
Are you new to WoW?
---
You can't fix the "Meta" by changing the game. That just changes the meta. They'll always be a "Best" Class, it just might not be your class, but there will always have to be something that's mathematically superior to another. That's inevitable.
---
Personally I think the whole thing is kinda stupid because coming up with BiS gear or the best raid talents is always based off a number of assumptions that don't necessarily match up with real life.
---
The only real change I could see blizzard making would be the debuff limit for raid bosses. It makes a lot of specs and play styles not just sub-optimal but actively hazardous to the raid. That's just bad game design, but if they took it out they'd likey have to re-balance all the fights so I'm not sure how likely it would be.
---
No, Dal'rends give roughly 0.5% more crit.
---
but muh 1% increase in deeps for 10 lvls
---
Idk man I find this discussion more interesting tbh
---
I love this! This made my day LMFAO!
---
Damn almost 12g with the crawfish just sitting there.
---
If that's greed, then everything is greed.  You could bring people to raids and sell bop gear.  Hell, I see people selling blue bop items in chat.
---
Shiit if you're on incendius I'll buy those
---
I followed it as a warlock and ended up around 6 days . What the fuck did you do for 5 days?
---
That's exactly what I wanted you to say
---
While he laughs at all the idiots who give him content?  Yeah that will be great.
---
That is weird looking Mulgore.
---
I get whinged at for rolling on cloth as a Shaman a hell of a lot. There is no healing mail people.
---
Thought botting was supposedly shut down.  Kinda sad to see that it’s still a problem.
---
However in a good group a dps should always be willing to pull and set the pace, when playing a Warrior I even prefer it since then I can use charge to build rage. Druid tanks excel for pace-setting though since they are exceedingly good at pulling.
---
Shit's expensive, yo. That's why we farm.
---
This whole map is cancer
---
Actually, after looking at it, it appears that Kalimdor might have cancer....
---
Only Warden's net, so you intentionally dodge them. That's why you see me checking what mob types they are in mid. Whether a mob is a Warden or not, is mostly RNG. But the mobs in the first part can't be, and the mobs in the outer circle of mid can't be either.
---
They had it coming.
---
If you’re on high pop I would recommend AoE dungeon farming over solo AoE out in the world.
---
And he was on around 3 days /played at level 50. So speedwise it seems to go decent. He hasn't been playing that much though
---
All those old people are boomers duh XD XD XD
---
He's already changed this stance during all the drama mail he got at the last MC. He basicly said "Only need shit you fucking need, if we find out you're not doing this you're getting kicked"
---
To clarify, this isn't just a completely random convergence of player behavior. Horrigan is the GM of what many consider the most toxic and vitriolic guild on the Alliance side of the server, so he's engendered a lot of bad blood by encouraging and/or justifying his guildmates' behavior.
---
Joining a dungeon party without loot rules is not a scam or deception.
---
Establishing loot rules in game and then breaking them is.
---
How is this difficult for you?
---
One person saying "Everybody greed" after an item drops is not established loot rules.
---
well, depends on the mage build, since you *can* spec for wand in the same way that Priests can.
---
it's just that mages have alternate effective methods while for priests, wanding is pretty much the only effective way.
---
Dude, I had this convo already before.
---
I was were you are.
---
Fckn zoomers everywhere!
---
It's pretty clear that he's talking about use the loot in general, not for literal BiS items you ass
---
One of the best healers in the game, still in SM, and worried about loot that will be obsolete in 10-15 levels
---
Spell cleave...
---
Mage tries to face tank a dozen elites and is surprised when I can't heal him though it.
---
For sure this isn't the way to make a successful guild, I was only commenting on the previous commenter's attitude that the idea of making a new top PvP guild isn't possible.
---
Being in a discord with a guild from the opposite faction so you can call in hits on people from your faction is not supposed to be part of the game.
---
If you're good at aoe grinding it's faster, Joana will probably get you to around 4-7 days.
---
&gt; don't be surprised when the priest needs it to disenchant because you rolled on cloth.  
---
Come on, that's not even remotely comparable. This isn't retail. Armour type only restricts what people can wear, it doesn't make armour types more or less viable on classes that can wear more types. I mean, for real, look at Paladins. Half of the shit you want as a Holy Paladin is Cloth, and yet you can wear every armour type. Are you saying Holy Paladin players should just be unable to need on upgrades with a clothie/leather wearer in group because it isn't Plate or Mail?
---
Dagger and offhand is better for dps and healing anyway
---
Hi, /u/MASyndicate

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dax7uf/cant_decide_on_na_realm/). 
---
Blizzard already answered this one. The 2% hit bonuses on your gear are broken. You should be able to bandage fix it by equipping them in the right order. ( can't remember what it was. Just try either first.)
---
That’s great to know! I’ve been passing over a few of the early shards because some of them haven’t had much purpose. Thanks, my dude!
---
They have usually one at a time.   Twins are auspicious for them.
---
Seek help bud.
---
Dreadmist has no +spell damage, it is all raw stats which don't boost your dps nearly enough.
---
That puts you on the way to a tasty mount
---
This makes no sense. You're saying mage aoe is bad because it's too good not to pull threat? You can easily tone it down and still do way more damage than a hunter. Also you can spec into 30% reduced threat. If you do pull threat, you can easily just ice block and theyll go back to the tank.
---
I mean yeah?
---
That is the idea.
---
Anyone can buy a boe at any time, so a boe = gold.
---
That seems off. I got 9d 3h on my warrior where I even was deep prot between 53 and 58 while beginning to farm my bis gear in brd and LBRS.
---
Followed no guides and had no xp farm groups. Just a lot of ordinary dungeon runs.
---
That rogue is now gonna make so many groups reserving HoJ meaning no other melee dps can join.
---
Honestly. That only reads like a mental breakdown if you already hate the guy or are looking for something to poke at.
---
To me it reads like in depth explanation. Not a mental breakdown. I think you’re either projecting a ton in this case, or are actively trying to seek fault.
---
wow the eye of the beast trick is some 300 iq shit
---
I've played an alliance priest to 43 and a horde mage to 40 (always been an alliance player in the past) and in my experience so far it is far more likely for alliance to gank you with a high level advantage or group advantage. That being said alliance players are actual dogshit at PvP so it usually turns out ok.
---
Just because you were too lazy to read up on the context of the discussion via his original comment, does not mean that /u/blablabla22d is in the wrong.
---
ToS says "go to bed now" ?
---
Yes?
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this guy is exaggerating his abilities.
---
I get that, they don't have to skill prot when they're lvl'ing. Fury works for most dungeons as long as they keep their defense high. It's just later on where the demand for tanks is high yet the supply is little, so they come up with wanting things reserved or be paid which creates more issues in the long run.
---
im having same issue now and earlier. chat works normally. i guess its issues on servers in some places
---
Babies always have the chubbiest thighs.
---
Is there any additional addon for bagnon with focus on sorting the items? The bagnon auto-sort is horrendous ^^
---
i did this. our tank kept ninjaing loot and saying YOINK when he did it so i just said lol and hearthed halfway through the dungeon. saw them advertising for a new healer for a good 20 mins in general lmaoo
---
Locks can be stupid good at 2v1 too. Seduction is really mean.
---
Dumb question but why use master loot in 5 man dungeons?
---
Using the loot in general, like using it to buy other items...
---
Or your mount...
---
Or anything...
---
Everyone can use a boe.
---
It doesn't have spell damage and healers act as your mana batteries, so having a bunch of extra int/stam doesn't really do a lot for you unless you have no other options.
---
Well if your focus on playing is hitting 60 as fast as possible I think you're quite late, also just join groups that are indeed AoE pulling
---
You could make bandages and sell to vendor, create bags if you're a Tailor. Otherwise you can sell stacks of cloth on AH when there is less of it up for sale.
---
Human, level 32, doing holy and discipline.
---
No lol this is character #1
---
Fucking lucky! Grats
---
Nice mate, that's like 15 copper
---
It's not even an act. He. Is. Sarcastic.
---
He doesn't play a character that thinks ninja looting is great. He just sarcastically says that it's great. As a joke. You don't have to act to make jokes.
---
Damn those edgemaster's prices tho
---
I’m not. 
---
Trust me. You’re not missing anything.
---
That doesn't mean it's suddenly ok to need on someone else's upgrade because you want the gold.
---
Anyone can sell anything to a vendor, so BoP = gold. See how that's a stupid argument?
---
That doesn't even make sense.
---
Most people? Highly doubt that maybe that's your experience but not everyone's
---
Wouldn't the Dagger and Off-hand that gives extra healing and spell damage, be the preferred healer items anyway?
---
You can turn whispers off in chat settings, or move whispers to another chat tab
---
Dismiss Pet reduces your pet’s happiness. EOTB has always been a good way to avoid that loss.

Basically says nothing tho :( since you gain more and more exp the higher level you get :(

retail yes

---
Dude what? We can do this?
---
Layer hopping, dead server, no competition.
---
Comparing the underlying principles of two scenarios does not mean equating them. I know this must he difficult for gamers to understand. It's called victim blaming, for the uninitiated.
---
Blizzard has had this stance for a long time, I remember them moving item from one account to another in an ICC raid
---
He wants his loot back
---
Doesn't Skeram have like 80% Horde? Why would any sane ally even go to BRM
---
HesRightYouKnow.jpg
---
I was. This was also a month ago, this would be a terrible spot now.
---
What is the best way to 24 lvl get from Stormwind to BFD?
---
What's the problem here?
---
He told the rest of his group to roll greed. No where in those screenshots did he promise to also roll greed.
---
All I see is 4 sheep who followed that guys instructions with absolutely zero context, they just blindly pressed that button. The guy in question did not make any promises, nor did he specify any rules. All he said was 'roll greed'.
---
He deserves his loot because thats how the game system works. I am all for banning people who intentionally mislead and deceive people for their own gain.... But this ain't it chief.
---
This is the kind of thing that happens when you have 4 people with below average IQ in a group... they lose their loot because they don't have the IQ points to press the correct button.
---
Hey guys, I just read a bit about the honor system. Achieving the blue set seems pretty hard for the average Joe. Is it true that a more casual player will never achieve rank 7-10?
---
if you dont plan on running a dungeon then why run it at all? if your goal is farming felcloth then do that. when you are ready to do blackrock spire, go there before looking or forming a group
---
Find a buyer and mail them cut out the middle man
---
Going guideless takes the average person 10d played.
---
Were you afking? That counts against time played.
---
Thank you so much for sharing this.
---
I’ll still be there, alliance on Herod. I think it’s fun that there are so many red targets out in the world.
---
This is OP’s origin story of his hatred towards gnomes
---
Mageweave sells for so little...
---
What a fucking asshole
---
iM oNE oF tHe BeSt HeAlErS iN tHe GaMe

What a loser.
---
Don't let this neckbeard make you think you ninjad. Dagger\oh might be superior stat wise but that doesn't mean this staff isn't good for you also, especially leveling, it will be replaced eventually. Not endgame, not bis, dude is just raged he didn't win a roll.
---
Imo report him for harrassment.
---
All loot is hunter loot if you ever played Vanilla.
---
I'm impressed.  It must take a mythic retail raider to get your own head that far up your own ass.
---
Turns out some people know what they're doing and some don't.  Very little to do with your bullshit brand of elitism.
---
Welcome to Classic.
---
The products of these professions are actually helpful and in demand in classic. A food buff makes a difference. Not in retail.
---
Get fucked losers
---
Again, it's very clear that he means "use the loot" as in, "equip the loot right now" 
---
You're just greedy, so roll greed.
---
They find you in a basic /who search. Probably searching for Warriors in the right level range
---
Pushers are the worst for me. I also hate other Mages that do the same thing at the end of video.
---
Meanwhile, I'm just chilling with my Frostbolt, Ice Nova, CoC, CS, Poly, sometimes Fire Blast and Arcane Missiles.
---
As alliance on stalagg, how come there aren't groups set up to mind control you into lava or warriors set to charge you as you jump the ledge to ubrs/lbrs so you fall??
---
This is correct.
---
Reddit WTF, a days ago I was told this is normal and downvoted for saying its ninjaing?
---
So you can raid undergeared
---
I don't know, maybe banning all the black emotes instead of actually fixing the problem the right way?
---
Agree, don't give it to the tank, give it to the healer. Unless it is a shaman with ankh
---
Meanwhile, I'm level 40 and have 200+ profession skills.
---
It's shellfish, not crawfish. They only have once use and it's horde only. I deleted them all out of my inventory.
---
Clicker!!
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I can't stand his personality. But then again it's most likely him overcompensating due to low self esteem.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant. The totem is bugged at the moment, I had a few fights where it took 6-8 seconds until it finally applied properly, before that spells just hit me left and right. Not sure what causes it, might be a layering issue?
---
How did he go from having the world record on a harder version to taking over a month on an easier one.
---
I git a guildie named Gankbeard, now that's bold
---
So Reckoning having no cap on stacks was a bug, but WF proccing WF wasnt? 
---
How do you determine that?
---
But the same logic can apply to any combination of rolls. You get the same odds of rolling 22-37-48-75, etc etc. Not a very interesting statistic.
---
You'd want the odds of everyone rolling X or higher, which would be (7/100)^4 ~ 1/42k.
---
Yes people get a déjà-vu because , it's almost a copy-paste as this post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7cnf6/important\_milkshake\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7cnf6/important_milkshake_data/)  . But it's not the same , so shame on them
---
Oh no, please don't cross post me for criticizing the underlying principles of ones logic! I don't know how I'd live with myself if my Reddit account suffers such an affront.
---
If you don't understand what victim blaming is, perhaps you should pull out a dictionary.
---
Lol at all the people who play on streamer world's.
---
What’s a good leveling spec for a new lock?
---
Then it is already to late because the item is gone and your next chance for it to drop is a week later.
---
The fractions are coming together? I wish i paid more attention in math.
---
We do too!, just got my jumper cables
---
i grouped up with asmongold in pugs during wod a couple of times. and everytime he was a twat. first time was tagging a rare mob. he didnt feel like waiting for everyone to get there to tag it, he just went in and killed it and left group. that was the first of many twatty fucking things ive encountered with this douche 
---
if he really wanted to stop ninja looting and stop getting so many complaints he would enforce it and remove said people. instead of just let its roll off and continues playing with the same scummy people
---
classic.
---
And here I am getting my BIS ring with a 54 roll against 7 other people...
---
I use QWERFZXC and 1234 plus shift/ctrl as my main keys, ASD to strafe/backpedal and both mouse buttons/autorun to move forward. my summons are bound to alt+1234, which are the only alt keys I use. I have 5 side buttons on my mouse, the top one is bound to ctrl, the other 4 are bound to pet attack, pet ability 1/2, and pet passive stance. works pretty well.
---
the change to WF proccing off WF was worded as more of a nerf than a bug fix iirc
---
Eat ass? Okay I'll join!
---
Yeah while leveling you will have lots of options so just generally look for itmes with your preferred stats on them, but once you get to the higher end dungeons I suggest figuring out what your best in slot (BiS) items are so you know them when you see them.  Easy way to find is just google 'wowhead BiS classic' and select your class page.
---
How bad are certain server faction balances? My server (Skeram) was saying that it might be 90H/10A because all the alliance have free transferred off.
---
Vanilla raiding is honestly so easy you can get away with off meta specs, you just have to have a group of people with the same mindset.
---
im not sure blizz can do much about ppl on discord
---
No... It's literally the only gear I get. You want a naked healer with no int?
---
Sorted
---
Bukkake that spit all over me Dwarf Daddies
---
I get paid to have this
---
How much Runecloth did it take
---
It drops off of basically anything in that level range, just with an obscenely low drop rate.
---
For realmobhealth, you have to have killed the mov for it to have data on its hp. It records your damage from your combat log to estimate the HP.
---
Most people quit post vanilla due to the game becoming something they didn't want. As much as people started classic for nostalgia, they are staying because it's a genuinely good game that stands the test of time.
---
Most people who played private vanilla did so because it's a different type of MMO that basically doesn't exist these days.

Not like anyone worth their salt isn't running that dungeon until everything gets DE'd anyways. How can you get so salty over something like this?
---
Disagree. Logically, something that can be purchased is the same exact thing as a pile of gold and if that gold can be used on gear I need, I need it exactly as much as you. Sure, for BoPs I agree because gear is blatantly more valuable than enchanting mats or a few vendor gold, but a cloth BoE can just be turned into a mail or leather or plate BoE easily.
---
Dude just leave those kind of groups and go for another. The adhd retail kids with their brainafk cleave meta can play by themselves and jerk themselves how they play like their favorite streamer. WC is one of the most popular dungeons in game, you'll easily find another group for it, with people that actually wanna play the game.
---
I had a similar experience last night where a warrior I thought would just join as DPS wanted to cleave the dungeon. Neither our healer nor our dps could keep up with his big pulls, so after almost whipping twice (thank god for Resurrection) we convinced him to just run the rest normally and we cleared the 2nd half about twice as fast as the first, because a) we didn't have to drink after every fight and b) we didn't have someone die on every fight.
---
Hey ninja I just saw this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/daqh8j/psa_asmongolds_officer_royson_teaches_us_a_lesson/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf I thought it was a funny read. Love you xoxo
---
Guildies no, but go and get all you can from anyone else. Nowhere sounds like sarcsm to me but sure lets just agree to disagree then
---
I like to think of it like a real party of adventurers. If you and your friends were hunting mythical beasts and an amulet dropped, you'd give it to the person who could use it to make the group more survivable. That's about as far as I get into the rp mindset.
---
They use Fear too towards the end. Although I think it's the big walking swamp elementals that do it. 
---
Plus the boss hits like an absolute truck.
---
I did never think of  using Eotb for that, will give it a try!

i love that build!!! 
---
okay ive been hearing bad things about SOTC though, and that with regular mobs it doesnt take enough time to kill them to see the benefits of SOTC. are u using it just to judge to set up for a holy shock blast? or how do you use it? otherwise i might put the points from the elsewhere.
---
The main thing is you need to let the tank get a few sunders down. At low levels 2 sunders is likely enough to hold anything since no-one will do enough DPS to pull the mob off before it dies. So give the tank at LEAST 10-12 seconds before you cast shield. Even then it's not super mana-efficient even if you've stuck points in the talent, but it does make a decent panic button.
---
However, don't use it if you've gotten adds unless the tank is going to die without it. Again with an add, the tank has no aggro on the new mobs and shielding the tank right as he needs to get threat on adds will likely end up with all of them punching the healer, which is you.
---
PW: S is pretty situational for dungeons anyway unless you're just slapping it on a hunter who decided to multi-shot right as the tank pulled. On a pally tank is doesn't matter as much as it does for a warr or druid, but again it's still not super good. You're almost always better off just healing.
---
 I had it dropped literally every time I ran Lib, its not even hard to get.
---
Missed opportunity not calling your pets shake and bake
---
wow hope his ass gets whooped(?) at some time!
---
That is probably the worst a person in his position can say in a game like WoW!
---
Guys, can we stop upvoting the "But horde are the bad ones!!!" or "Alliance sucks!!" comments? They're no different. Sucky people do sucky things, nothing to do with the faction. Silly to imply otherwise.
---
That's not true food definitely is still relevant in retail for raiding.
---
Shaman is either the worst mediocre leveler, or the best bad leveler. Play hunter if you want a smooth experience.
---
Enh 2h windfury is garbage unfortunately. It's broken by the nature of what it is. You can't have those crazy crits/WF proccing reliably or it'd be invicible in pvp. And the alternative is a class that's incredibly reliant on RNG, they just basically stall hoping WF does something neat.
---
In a game with a pretty short time to kill, that just doesn't sit very well.
---
Sure, but by that time they had fixed itemization for the most part.
---
Basically I just kill anyone from his guild on the spot, I usually spare lowbies because there’s no challenge or honor in it.
---
It's because potatoes can run WoW, so your machine runs it so well, it causes the buzz.
---
Bad tanks get angry when dps try to pull.
---
This is exactly what a slow tank said when I did a "sap pull"... "Pull again and see what happens"
---
Level 9 warrior, first time playing the game. I heard Arms spec if I want to do both PvE and PvP without having to re-spec so I think i’m going arms. Can I tank dungeons as arms, and if so until what level?
---
what are you on about mate
---
So you’re saying alliance should skip BRD, LBRS, UBRS, and MC? 
---
Big brain time
---
Thanks. I like their Title better anyway :)
---
Oh I see the other isn't a huntet
---
Be in my groups and you can be sure to get repair money from me, heck I also pay healer lol.
---
thank you it all makes perfect sense and i appreciate the feedback. ive never played retail just classic so i can only imagine what the class is like in that game now
---
One of the few servers that has Alliance majority on PvP so that's good. But the issue people wanted to avoid is still there.
---
I assume you are Horde on Stalagg and looking at the population over the past 3 weeks it seems alliance are dipping out from that server.
---
This doesn’t count for any other drops, greens, cash drop, or specifically the Slime Covered Bags full of like 10-20s and items
---
This is why “all need” makes more sense in groups you don’t know.
---
Yeps look for yourself https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023
---
Thanks for wasting that time for me.
---
Have to ask another question since I can't really decide.
---
I want to play Paladin but there are so many informations I can't process it as a newbie.
---
I was going to follow this guide:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhfZc9mxuUw
---
But someone wrote that this is for Vanilla and not for classic because of the /sit macro or something like that.
---
I also read many people saying Holy or Protection Paladin is also very good.
---
I want to play on a PVP server with atleast one teammate 90% of the time. Which pala should I play when I want to make damage? I heard that DD Pala sucks though - or is it only because of 1v1?
---
He didn't say that. He said something more specific that appears to apply to you. That isn't an attack. Like observing that someone can't read isn't an attack calling them stupid if you are simply commenting that they can't read and not being insulting.
---
I'd like to see people who need the gear maybe get two rolls where everyone else gets one. I might implement that idea when I get to high tier drops.
---
Nah man, I'd rather take a photo, grab a USB cable, upload photo, then move that to the folder. Taking screenshot is too easy.
---
No server transfers and no name changes, he's gonna have to level up a new toon to 60 for 420 gold that he wont even get to keep, literally lmfao what a fucking mongoloid. He should do that thing that we are not allowed to type out cause we get banned.. you know when you.. you know. Cease to breath OUR air..
---
You’re wrong, stop being wrong
---
Is that allowed? You're basically getting players killed with no consequences or chance to fight back. Sounds just as unintended as avoiding guards via terrain, and we know how that ends.
---
Indeed, I’m a regular at Mahalos barren fire camp :)
---
My cat has never reacted to video games or tv at all except that he goes absolutely nuts for my Palico in Monster Hunter. It’s so weird.
---
I still run ZF. And I have just taken my time. I choose to not to sit in a dungeon or power grind through one mob for hours on end because I would put my head through my desk out of mind numbing boredom. 
---
Don’t presume that just because people aren’t 60 yet that they are not skilled or above average.
---
Hah yep super annoying
---
My bad, I read the op still missed your point. I’ve learned that crusader is only useful on fight that last longer then 30sec. And then just to judge it.
---
Unless you play incredible safe and pull one at a time of an equal or lower level mob, there will be a time they're useful. I've found a lot of mana and health potions while leveling and gotten some as quest rewards and ended up using Every one. 
---
This is like as long why a hunter has feign death or wing clip. They're obviously useless due to your pet. Right?
---
Like I said raiding but that's about it
---
Leveling a warrior alt it's been AMAZING to be the tank, finally I can lead these fuckin groups, I'm not some god tier player but it's crazy how a bad tank can just destroy a groups efficiency. They are totally the QBs of the 5 man dungeon group and you get a fuckin Tom Brady tank it's ez.. on the other hand if you don't... Yikes
---
Fish on
---
Ah that makes sense.
---
Taking a locked chest isn't ninja.
---
Blizzard screwed up by not making items bind to you automatically when you roll need. If you truly need it, it shouldn't be an issue that you can't sell it.
---
Should definitely do it druids are super fun and you can fill any role at moments notice in a dungeon if anything crazy happens.
---
I did not equate the two. The results of said actions are not the same. But the principles that caused the perpetrators to arrive at their act is. Sorry this is hard to understand.
---
Wow retail player?
---
I also as a part time healer love when cc and useful spells are used, cause When the tank is eating a shit load of dmg and then the  mage take a shit load of dmg I run oom in a few seconds the mage dies, the tank barely survives I have to rebuff and rezz which takes more time then doing some good cc!
---
This is the dumbest statement that I've read on this subreddit.
---
I made it to the end as a paladin tank, BUT the mage was pulling, tanking and finally ninja looting. The warlock feared the mobs into more mobs, I had 30 silver rep costs, while the hunter got the weapon I wanted... I guess I play a hunter now and avoid dungeons. The priest told me that she is rerolling warlock. If many do this, there will be a severe lack of tanks and healers in no time.
---
Seems pretty unreasonable actually to spite yourself because he doesnt know how to do things in moderation. 
---
The 30 to 40 bracket needs a few SM runs to push you to a point where you can stay in the green zone of questing where you get good xp for an easier effort. Then you also dont run out of quests at 58.
---
That's the plan!
---
That's why you should never join a group reserving shit. Even if it is items you don't need.
---
Jed/Rend runs(MH reserved) = You are gonna be running 1-2 melees at most and you have to roll against 4+ others for 1 fucking trinket.(because MH got reserved)
---
(Why would any sane person join a group where people reserve and value their time more than yours)
---
Same with Arena/Anger/Golem, Isn't it better to do 30 runs each day by having maybe 2-3 people who need HoJ than to try and convince every single cloth user that they should ALL roll for 1 item.
---
 What happens when every cloth user gets their jed trinket? Suddenly it's taking you 30-60min just to gather 6 people.
---
On link 1 he didn't ninja loot as he called "warr tanks" and he was the only warr tank. The second sentence has nothing to do with bannable offenses so it's just there to try and get people to emotionally support your argument since factually you're wrong.  
---
I don't like the character asmon puts on either but don't fucking lie, you just legitimize the character more.
---
Exactly my thoughts hahahh.
---
I even read this post in his voice.
---
As a healing priest id expect you to... I don't even have staffs learned and i'm level 55, off-hands ftw. And I ran to undercity to learn how to use daggers for this insane mp5 one I picked up the other day.. I can't believe how stupid some players are.
---
Glad to know that my investment in a dwarven hand cannon was worthwhile after all.
---
I've used Bartender extensively, but at the end of the day, switched to Dominos which seems to be updated more often and is super easy to use.  Think either would work though.
---
55 wlock here and im going to hold on to that draintank build from wowhead all the way to 60 and then respec. But thats my opinion. Also dont consider myself a veteran either regarding warlock class.
---
Dude it is a fucking video game.
---
Yes and no. If there was a damage meter that attributed WF procs in the party to you, it would be much easier to gauge the value of imp. WF totem, and enhancement shamans in general. As is, I have a hard time keeping up on DPS with guys sometimes 5 levels lower than me if they know what they're doing and playing a hard DPS class.
---
It's not unheard of to have on in melee groups so depending on how much melee dps your guild has, they might decide improved WF is worth it. Personally, I use normal WF and nobody seems to notice the difference :P.
---
Last, your raid gear kind of doesn't support that preferred style and as a result, people can often be reluctant to take somebody that can bid/roll for gear that is kind of going to waste :/
---
Very good for ele. I ended up getting it on greed roll and the high end damage was worth using with WF procs
---
holy fucking shit lmao im so glad i dont play on this goddamn server
---
Its pve.
---
Lol what? That sounds wack. Ghost mushrooms are an absolute hell to farm, I'm on Gehennas the most populated EU realm
---
TIL people are held at gunpoint and not allowed to make their own groups
---
Right on. I'm sure this is the extent of my WoW luck used up then!
---
Im like, 99% sure he was just being sarcastic with that and pretty much everything else though.
---
&gt; You mean horde playerS, cuz they always kill me when they are a group of 5.
---
You red, you dead. Doesnt matter if it's 1vs100 or 1vs1.
---
Most people don't have food 1-59 either. To think otherwise is complete delusion. 
---
Hell, my alch so far has only given me an elixir that is weaker than a mage buff.
---
i think it would be ideal if everyone was already at the entrance before they started forming or looking for a group. it takes more time for people to run there then it does to put together a group
---
what a piece of shit. seriously.
---
All good then, dont feel bad about it.
---
The only thing to improve would, be more open to the group and say right at the start:
---
I usualy tank do you mind if i roll on the shield
---
It’s not just “having to ask” before hand. 
---
Any ninja looting is a reportable offense.
---
So like for example, let’s say the raid starts with group loot. There’s been no verbal rules to what loot is just that it’s group loot. 
---
Then half way through the raid leader changes it to master looter then takes an item. 
---
That is a reportable offense.
---
One thing I know for sure is that invis potions are not the same as stealth. A person with invisibility cannot be seen by any level, unless they have a special buff to detect invisibility
---
Well as surprising as that is i did infact attempt to make groups and was swiftly pmed by tons of mages and priests who were only interested in farm runs .
---
Now add three more scary clowns and switch it to Horde
---
Your group will despise you, roll a warrior and win
---
Are you going to roll on the green +int cloth gloves as a tank and explain to the casters about "liquidable assets"? Or would you roll greed on that BoE green that dropped and let people who need it need roll?
---
I don't think you have the blanket consideration for BoE's that you think you do.
---
Ree ree reeee
---
Couldn't they follow the.... breadtrail ?

I’m wary of aucioneer’s DE value in classic because it gets the DE mats wrong a lot of the time. Notice that green armor from 20-25 should say Soul Dust but it doesn’t.

Let's be honest, for a very long time it won't change at lvl 60 either
---
What type of realm?
---
Follow the bones... the bones know the way.
---
Plz re name guild to Public Transit
---
imo stopping the video and talking about it is the only acceptable type of "react" videos. Going from start to finish without stopping it or talking over it, that's just stealing content.
---
Lookin' cute!
---
Yes it is, rogues are expected to use their abilities for the team, not to hog loot
---
Eat a weiner with your snowflake generation shit.  I am in my 30s and played actual vanilla wow from start to cata.  I don't remember running into this problem way back when.  If every quest location place you go to has just you and 5 of the other faction, and even half of them want to attack you at all times, you're gonna have a hard time completing quests.  When this happens over and over, every zone you go too and it actually slows down your leveling over many weeks--yeah you're gonna start feeling inconvenienced.
---
Not to mention, if you \*are\* of the majority faction on your server and aren't having this problem, you have no room to talk.  Go transfer to an off balance server and be the minority and then talk.
---
You have to have the original collectors edition of WoW.
---
printscreen
---
If you are friends with someone for a long time, one instance of ninja looting is not enough to burn that to the ground.
---
Now that obviously isn't the case in this particular scenario, but for friends you have had for years, and gamed with for years, to just dump them cause of a single ninja loot means you folks need a reality check.
---
And he stole something. Not only did he steal something, upsetting 39 other people, he stole something with real world monetary value from his "friends".
---
Why on earth you would defend him or want people like this in your life is beyond me, he is clearly trash.
---
Faction\*
---
im selling used single bubblegum for 10 mil $. limited quantaty... anyone interested? my point is someone selling something for silly price does not mean it will get sold... at those prices people cant even accidently buy it... its just someone trolling to get responses like this one...
---
He wanted me to run around in Bear Form and do [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=779/swipe) the whole dungeon.
---
So instead of doing 42 damage per second just autoattacking in cat form, he wanted me to do 18 damage every 8 or so seconds while I try to build rage while *not* tanking.
---
Yep, and it’s really easy too
---
/cast [@mouseover, exists] 
---
Is the simplest form of the beginning of the command, but there are multiple ways to write it for different criteria to cast. Also don’t forget to add spell rank if you want to downrank.
---
There’s a ton of information online. Enjoy your new found freedom!
---
Sorry for the off topic question, but how do you get the quest tracker like that? Longer and movable? Mine is overlapping with my side bar
---
Right.  It doesn’t matter what race you are for PVE.
---
I pretty much only use PW:S if I need to save someone right now and don't have time to cast a normal heal. I will heal the DPS if I have a lot of spare mana or they are dying, otherwise they can bandage/eat between pulls. If you don't heal the dps when they don't need it (they are not dying) then you will generate less threat and it is less likely you will pull aggro by healing. 
---
And try to do all your healing in short bursts so that you can get out of the 5 second rule and regain mana during fights. It is a balance between not letting people die and being mana efficient so you can heal for longer/reduce downtime. 
---
Intellect is good for short fights that are intense, but what you want is more spirit gear so you can get more mana regeneration. Spirit is way better for solo play also.

Rogues are not invited for opening chests unless you mention that beforehand.
---
Yes, they will. They always have. They don't want people scamming their players. Going against loot rules will get you in trouble. Offering to make bags / other item, having someone mail / trade you the mats, and then keeping them, will get you in trouble.
---
Anything that deems you a "bad player" will get you in trouble. Killing someone over and over through game mechanics isn't that (griefing). You actually have to be doing something un-sportsmanship like.
---
Is there one that make the Action Icon bigger so it's easier to click?
---
Maybe its the bar that shows how much rep u have with a selected faction? It pops up after 60 to replace the xp bar. You probably can disable it in the settings somewhere

Your shaman likely blows then.

&gt;As a healing priest id expect you to... I don't even have staffs learned and i'm level 55, off-hands ftw. And I ran to undercity to learn how to use daggers for this insane mp5 one I picked up the other day.. I can't believe how stupid some players are.
---
He's actually incredibly wrong it's hilarious. As a healing priest I literally don't even have staffs learned and i'm almost 60, using a mp5 dagger and a high spirit offhand. The fuck is wrong with some people.. I'm not running all the way to Darnasus to learn how to to use staffs as an undead LOL.
---
Yeah man. It's brutal.
---
I played pretty hardcore back in the day, and I never made it. From memory, I think I had 2-3 pieces of the blue set. 
---
Back in the day, I used to just aim to get enough for the set bonus for the blue PvP set, same for the MC gear, and then just fill out with good blues from 5 man's. If you're about that PvP, and you know how to play, that's plenty good enough to hold your own.
---
Grab the Rig Wars quest from the engineer trainer in Orgrimmar.  He'll send you on a short quest that ends with you in Booty Bay with a Goblin Transponder that will teleport you right into Gnomeregan

You really need internet stranger validation to know the Gnome is an idiot?
---
I am not defending this particular instance. I am defending against the idea of dropping a friendship because of something like this.
---
In this case, fuck him, but the idea of immediately throwing away a friendship just because of ninja looting is weird to me.
---
Should mages that dont port me to UC be blacklisted too? And what about the priests that dont spend all their time buffing stamina on all of Ironforge?
---
I lost that staff to a hunter my first run through...
---
Huge difference between a couple of runs and farming the same dungeon for xp.
---
No, It's true that Alliance had majority in vanilla. Nobody cared about what was "good" back in those days and they played what they thought looked fun.
---
Horde has a very strong advantage in classic and these days more people care about min/maxing.
---
That is your rep bar. Looks like you are using bartender, which should allow you to both move and turn off this bar. In the original blizzard UI it is attached to your experience bar, disabling the blizzard art can leave it floating behind. I use shadow unit frames which also has an option to disable this bar, I would imagine titan, Luna, etc have this feature somewhere as well
---
Love it.
---
Totally guilty of this last night in 1kN on my Ally druid and don't care.  Same shaman (though equal level) tries to gank me like 3 times.  As a druid I just cast Nature's Grasp and outrun him and continue questing.  The fourth time he tries though I got sick of it...  I just go stealth and wait.  We are both level 35ish, he sits down to drink and boom, 1.1k ravage crit.  He keels over, pops Reincarnation, thinks he can take me, boom kill again.   10 minutes later there are like 5 ?? Players hunting me on mounts there. 
---
I just hearth to quest at Desolace instead to let them waste their time looking for me.  I found it hysterical that he was supposed to be able to gank people but if someone touched him big brother and big sister were showing up haha.
---
Your thighs look a little chafed.

Filthy clickers.

People who act like blacklist are a real threat should fear the blacklist.

...hold on
---
The warris who refuse to tank are total idiots. Dude you can 2h tank like 90% of the dungeon and just go def stance + shield for one or two bosses. Come the fuck on, is it really worth making everyone wait an hour for a tank?
---
I hope that bitch falls down several flights on concrete stairs.
---
Stop playing semantics, a priest who is invited to a group and doesn’t stamina buff the members of the group should shiver in fear of the blacklist.
---
Difference is when you are in a group be a team player.
---
Aoe dmg in bear form but it only hits up to 3 targets. Its decent but not great

Come to Fairbanks and watch the horde 3v1 Alliance. Ya'll are terrible at WoW on that realm, and shit stains to boot.

Doesn't matter if its in game or not.

Ugh, this elitist "if you haven't been 60 since week 2 then you're a noob" attitude is really pervasive on my server unfortunately :/ (Incendius). Like okay, just because I had a life and full time job and wanted to actually play the game as it was intended means I'm terrible? Everyone on my server went full idiot mode with SPELLCLEAVE SPELLCLEAVE ONLY MAGE ONLY LF3M MAGES ONLY SPELL CLEAVE 24/7 SM GRIND SPELLCLEAVE bullshit and now they're all bored at 60 and complaining that everyone who is still currently leveling is bad somehow. It's such a joke.

Yes, take a look at the SilverDragon addon.

Yeah but then you have to use the reddit app.

Blame Vanilla's shitty itemization that forces Warriors to have to use mail and leather.

Psychic fear, bubble, renew, and start running.

Depending on the class you're fighting, there'll be lots of different things to do from there. In general though, learning how to move - utilising distance and LoS - is a big deal for caster PvP. If you just stand still and try to heal through their damage, you're totally on the back foot, and will die sooner or later.
---
I use questie. It might be movable with that add on
---
Lupos is a standard wolf. You will need a spare stable slot open to learn skills while leveling.
---
Is if you all agree /roll on all chests and then the rouge just takes all locked one's which is most dungeons i'd consider that ninja looting
---
I was leveling affliction and I respecced into SM/Ruin
---
So the specific school of magic bonuses are just larger overall (+10 spell power vs +15 shadow)? But they are applied with the same logic?
---
Also, what you wrote isn’t the formula for +shadow then (because searing pain wouldn’t get the bonus), rather the formulas you wrote are for any applicable bonus damage for the listed spell (everything gets +spell, but they only get their specific school bonuses) ? I hope that makes sense haha, can’t think of how else to write it briefly.

Tanking for orbs was a standard 15 years ago there is nothing new there
---
Thats all fine and well, play how you wish. But the literal rules of PvP say that anyone flagged is free game. I kill every single horde player I see and I've played the same way for 13 years.
---
 Some of the most fun I've ever had was camping flight paths in Val'Sharah with a dozen other rogues and ferals for hours on end. Have your honorable duels if you want, I'm going to get PvP titles and gear asap.
---
How much would that be?
---
“83 copper.......per household.......after postage” *giant grin*
---
Tactical comment. Please tag me
---
You can see on Quin69 and Esfands streams. Even with decent loot priority 1 item for warriors scale like crazy, While 1 item on a ret means nothing.
---
Bet we are gonna see Esfand full BIS get outdpsed by a potato and still he will try to convince everyone he should have loot prio.
---
Aoe farming is very strong, but you are not going to be be able to reliably aoe farm while following a fucking guide for questing as a hunter.
---
Ok, and now you feel balanced?
---
Oh, I used that for a while, whoops?
---
Set up macros that mark the target you are focusing aggro on and hope your group follows
---
You can easily make a group and find 3 DDs at any point in time. Then you have to queue up for a tank and hope one of them prefers you to the other 30 groups looking for them.
---
Guarantee you he knew that and was betting at least somebody on the server didn't.
---
Why isn't it DeM and DiM for Deadmines and Dire Maul respectively?
---
I think you might want to stick to single player games if lack of control over all characters bothers you this much
---
I expect every member of my group to be a gentleman/lady and adhere to proper dungeon/raid etiquette otherwise no one will group with them ever again and WoW becomes a single player game to them.
---
This guy is a dick and can fuck off. He isn't really a friend, he is someone that shares an online personalities spotlight.
---
I am talking literal actual friends. When this type of shit happens, you talk to your friend, not immediately burn it all.
---
I spent a bit of gold on the AH buying spirit+stam gear ("of the Whale," I think) and oh man my leveling experience has been so much better
---
Warlock is a high skillcap class.. there’s a million buttons to press and know when to hit them and the best pet synergy is nuanced. Also, you can increase your mobility by getting nifty stopwatch and going engineering to get rocketboots and netomatic projector helps with preventing melee from getting to you.
---
Hunters will probably be easier to hear up right now though becuase their gear competition is lower right now
---
190g is the market price man. Just because people list it for 400g, I can assure you rarely are people spending that much.
---
Is there an addon that will automatically switch my stances as a warrior? 
---
example-I'm in battle stance and want to use disarm. I simply click disarm on my action bar and it automatically changes to defensive stance
---
I know this can be done with macros but i'm curious if there's just an addon that works the same
---
It is, Frostadamous plays with Chinese UI
---
I’m gonna respec into soullink for PvP cannot wait!
---
honestly it's not a big deal for hunters, but dwarven hand cannon is prebis for dwarves yes. The main reason for weaponskill is the glancing blows which hunters don't have to deal with and once you get decent gear you will find youself battling to get DOWN to your hit cap, not up to it.
---
&gt;Wether its ninja looting or not, the actuel rule that's broken is the scam/deception rules that's in the EULA.
---
The EULA is only broken if it IS ninja looting.
---
You can't say "well whether it's actually against the TOS or not it's against the TOS."
---
You're mixing Blizz defined ninja looting with colloquial term ninja looting which is a terrible idea.  It isn't ninja looting unless it is Blizz defined ninja looting.
---
In some ways, low skilled players flocking to play Mage instead of Hunter has several benefits to the whole group:
---
* No Feign Death. When a bad Mage screws up and wipes the group, they die too. It's satisfying to watch.  
---
* No Pet. Controlling a pet takes some awareness. The most brainless of mages won't accidentally pull half the dungeon by forgetting to dismiss their pet before jumping, or accidentally pull another group by sending in their pet before moves close enough to the tank.  
---
* Most mages are specced frost, which means when a bad Mage pulls aggro by attacking the wrong target the mob takes longer to get out of the tank's melee range and is easier to catch.  
---
* More reliable cc. They probably won't use it on their own initiative or refresh it before it wears off, but it's more reliable than getting a bad hunter to use a trap.    
---
* The healers are never short of drink.  
---
* Much less likely to pull before the healer is ready - Mages go through mana like crazy.  
---
* Less gear competition for Rogues, Feral Druids, Shamans, and DPS warriors.  
---
* Despite the increased popularity, you won't see absurd numbers of them in your dungeons - they typically gravitate towards spellcleave groups which are not generally open to other classes in the same ratio.  
---
It does come with some downsides though.
---
* Frostbite procs trapping mobs in awkward places leading to pats pulling.  
---
* Freezing mobs that have aggroed onto them near the healer or other vulnerable classes. Frost Nova is a reflex that is hard to overcome.  
---
* Intentionally pulling more mobs than the group can handle "because thats what we did in all the spellcleave dungeon runs". Using AOE whenever.  
---
* More gear competition for clothies (the most overrepresented armor class).
---
* The big one - A bad hunter who does dungeons will typically be informed of how to play their class properly by their frustrated group members. Lots of bad mages will level through spellcleave and hit 60 without ever having run a proper dungeon or learning about threat. That's going to result in some bad habits developing.
---
Damn, too late
---
Turning on a webcam, watching a video and sometimes going "huh" is not content. That is straight up stealing.
---
One of the animators I'm subscribed to put the text "reaction videos are lazy and bad" very noticeably in their video, so reaction people couldn't make a reaction video on it without being called out.

[Blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buff-cap-and-hidden-auras/297178/2): The third issue we found, which actually explains your lost +hit bonuses, is actually a bug in Item Set bonuses. Set bonuses that have the same benefit as item effects are actually overwriting the identical item effect, but only if the set bonus is gained after the matching item is equipped. An example is the Wyrmhide Spaulders, and the Devilsaur Armor Set bonus, which each have an incredible +2% chance to hit. If you equip both pieces of Devilsaur Armor, and then equip the Wyrmhide Spaulders, everything works fine. On the other hand, if you were already wearing the Wyrmhide Spaulders, and then equip the Devilsaur Armor, its set bonus will overwrite the Wyrmhide shoulders bonus. At that point the 2% hit bonus from the Spaulders is gone, and even unequipping the Devilsaur Armor won’t give it back. Only un-equipping and re-equipping the Wyrmhide Spaulders will fix the issue.
---
Yeah it would be ideal but not everyone thinks the same as you, as I've just said. You will accept it sooner or later.
---
Skip the server LUL :D
---
For the sake of argument, if everyone need rolls, it's a greed roll.
---
I'm on Grob Alli as well. Loving the culture of the community on our server!
---
Same
---
You’re not alone.
---
Wow, you're incredibly dense.
---
anything below 50-60%
---
Grobbulus has been amazing so far
---
True, but so far all the big events on the server that I have seen have been Horde! Which is a shame.
---
Name 1 other motivation you have for wanting it other not wanting to pay for it?
---
I just don’t like people who love to hurt others in an mmo by stealing loot or purposefully playing the wrong spec. A group should not be traumatized by their encounters with you.
---
We the classic wow collective have the power of blacklist
---
Raw Greater Sagefish is used for food at end game. You could fish it and sell the raw fish for people to cook themselves, or cook the food and sell that.
---
Similar story for raw nightfin snapper
---
Stealing is not bannable.
---
Breaking terms is.
---
Hmm, ZT is majority Alliance.
---
If you need on a BOE, you equip it immediately. That’s my rules when leading. I’m not going to accept you to need an item when your intentions are only to sell it on the AH instead of using it or letting someone else in the group who would actually use it.
---
If it won’t be an upgrade to anyone, then everyone will need it and best roll wins.
---
&gt;If you're hitting people with the weapon, the DPS is the most important stat of the weapon. No exceptions.
---
Weapon speed becomes a very important stat for warriors, but not really until after level 40. You want slow and hard hitting. If you are choosing between a 40 DPS 3.8 speed and a 45 DPS 2.8 speed, you take the 40 DPS 3.8 speed. 
---
It will be especially noticeable in dungeons when you're whirlwinding packs. It'll be a difference of hitting each mob for 200 with the faster higher DPS weapon or 300 with the slower one. That's potentially 400 damage lost every 10 seconds (40 DPS!) because you were only looking at a weapon DPS. And that's only 1 ability. Sweeping strikes, cleave, mortal strike and slam also all benefit from slower hard hitting weapons. Edit: forgot deep wounds too!
---
Edit: can't believe I'm being downvoted. If y'all want to lose 50+ yellow damage DPS to gain 5 white damage DPS be my fuckin guest
---
That's a fair point if no one required it, but if there was a person in that group who could benefit from those BiS gloves it'd be shitty to roll need against them.
---
Me too dude. I’m 52 at the moment and will probably go soul link once I get a few more pieces of high level gear.
---
Hunters leaving their pets on aggressive are just bad players/oblivious if they refuse to correct it I could understand not inviting them again.
---
Rogues looting locked chests is not ninja looting. You don't need to unlock the chest to complete the dungeon and the rogue has to dedicate his/her own time to level up that "profession". You don't /roll for mining and herb nodes or skinnable creatures unless there is another with that profession. It's up to the rogue if he wants to share or not.
---
"Meme Specs" should be easy since you say your role before the dungeon even starts. Technically if you refuse to run with a non-cookie cutter spec you're already blacklisting before the run starts. Even then once they respec and gear to the "optimal" spec you'd probably invite them assuming no other factors.
---
No, not immediately burn it all. This isn't the kind of thing that you suddenly learn after knowing someone for 10 years. If you are not good enough friends to notice the toxic behaviour leading to this point, you are not good enough friends to bother salvaging anything.
---
If any of my good friends pulled this, I would be concerned with the sudden shift in attitude, I would talk to them, ask what the fuck is going on, and probably be done with them if they didn't have an extremely good answer.
---
Download Character Notes addon and add notes (good or bad) to people you meet. That way the next time you see them, you can pull up your notes to see if you've been with them before and if they're a good or bad player. There's also a small notes icon beside their name that will pop up when they talk if you have something written for them. It's what I do to keep track of bad players, good players, and ninja looters.
---
I am using bartender and the rep bar is turned off already so idk why it's still appearing
---
No, he meant Alliance because yall do this too.
---
I dont mind it though, that's what PVP servers are about.
---
You are absolutely stupid, sorry but I had to say that.
---
Most of the Leather/Mail ends up being for Melee with STR/Agility stats which does jack shit for a Healer.
---
Even if you head out into the world and do quests you will still end up picking mostly cloth rewards as the Mail/Leather alternatives are suited towards melee.
---
you do to use frost nova bud, unless you get a frostbite proc. Either way, ice shards only increases damage of frost spells, so frostbite proc frostbolt+fireblast shatter isn't as much damage as frostbolt+coc. l2mage
---
???
---
Remind me why I care what the icons for buttons are lmao.
---
You can set a button on the interface panel where you enable autoloot, that when pushed, stops the autoloot. It's basically a button you can hit when unlocking stuff, or when I'm questing with a fellow miner, we do a /roll, and the loser is allowed to tap the vein purely for a skill point and not take the loot from it.
---
I discussed that with someone who'd never heard of it before, and they were ecstatic with the idea of losing a roll, but still being able to skill up their mining 😊
---
That's very constructive.
---
Same here
---
Your etiquette isnt universal. That’s why you verify ahead of time. Some refuse reserved loot others thrive on it. 
---
Some want to never work with mages others love them.
---
Some only allow specific tank or healer classes even while leveling. 
---
Heck I’ve seen some do any non needed bop blue goes to the enchanter and shards handed out later while others say no I wanna vendor it or I don’t trust enchanters.
---
Get an energy add-on. Only hit SS when you have 40 energy, don't mash.
---
You might need 6 button presses a mob. Relax
---
Females sense aswell.
---
And no one does basic checks like "can you cast holy nova before we go in?" even when healing talents do matter from uldaman and onwards especially with all the warriors levelling as fury.
---
Yes you can.  You can tank as a warrior as fury or arms until you get to the 55+ dungeons.  Even then you could probably do fine if you had decent gear.  You don't need a prot spec until raiding....and by then the meta might have shifted again where prot isnt needed until BWL/AQ40 and Naxx.
---
If everyone ninjas, no one ninjas.
---
The people who complete the quest line will be able to roll on loot. Others won’t
---
This is why you look things up on wowhead if you think farming it might be worth it
---
PVP happens?!
---
OR leave out all the unnecissary steps and just let the Tank die.
---
I grabbed skinning at level 32, and power leveled it. Then I went to shimmering flats and did all the quests there and skinned everything. There are plenty of people who quest there and don’t skin so you can also skin their kills. Once you can effectively AOE the basilisks south of the town (about 35) just grind a few hours there a day and you’ll get mount gold in no time. 
---
When you get bored go farm SM. I had 5 gold at level 30 and 105 at level 40.
---
Or!  Check this out.  Since your on your computer already, you could just ctrl print screen.  Alt tab over to reddit.  Make a post and ctrl-v.  Done before you can bring up your phone and take a pic.  
---
Also!  If you are using 2 monitors, alt-print screen will take a screen of the active monitor.
---
I am one of the best healers in A game (?)
---
Which is funny because on the Countdown to Classic podcast, he specifically mentioned how he doesn't respect that version of timing speed leveling (since it's easily manipulated via rested XP and having help from already leveled people) and that he's really in it for a low IRL-time once Classic launches.
---
Hey, don't drag a whole class into your life choices. Lol.
---
Just use feign death that’s what it’s used for mostly. Takes agro off you
---
What's YOUR point?
---
A BoE is an item that you can equip as an upgrade, therefore it has value other than just gold.
---
I believe someone said **Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Wind Seeker**
---
That's ninja. Nothing decided beforehand and the chest belongs to the Rogue
---
First step is awareness, you're welcome!
---
Well, a lot of them probably looked up a guide and saw IcyVeins says "Be a gnome, they're the best!"
---
Nothing wrong with that inherently, but casually reading a class guide doesn't necessarily imbue you with the knowhow to play the game.
---
And that says a lot
---
No you won’t, alliance are terrible at pvp.
---
I do when they offer information (such a threat meters) in a way that doesn't alter the gameplay. I don't when they promote laziness and risk malforming how community interacts.
---
I'm perfectly fine with them doing this in retail which has already killed off everything related to the matter. Leave Classic out of it, we waited 13 long years to get back the inconvenient gameplay which we enjoy.
---
This dude buying gold?
---
BGs will be crossrealm, so your ques shouldn't be affected by the server you're on.
---
Classic and BFA aren't the same game. They're both MMOs, but they have very different design philosophies behind them.
---
I don't think they're really comparable other than being set in the same universe. Some people played modern MMOs because they were available, not because they were a type of game they liked as much as older MMOs.
---
Asmon will have rank 14 from people feeding him kills or griefing the competition.
---
Hmm, that does sound weird. I'm just saying something some one else said, not something Joana himself has said
---
It does for rogues. Not all poisons have an internal PPM, so crippling poison on a 1.6 dagger will apply more often/faster than a 2.2 sword.
---
Might wanna change that mage icon then ;)
---
Alliance has no other option for a +20 fishing pole besides doing those crates or winning the fishing tournament in STV.
---
I updated Bartender4 and it fixed this issue, thank you for everyone who replied!
---
Yes, so hilarious investing time and energy only to be kicked by a 13 year old on a powertrip
---
At least he didn't take a picture with his phone
---
I didn't see it mate.
---
I haven’t gone back. No desire to do my daily chores over there.
---
Can't seem to find an answer anywhere. Is there a quest for Stitches in Duskwood?
---
Did you know you can compete with your friends without wasting 100g+ on consumes
---
I play a gnome warrior for the added flavor.
---
Kinda, didnt guess that i got the runecloth and gold so fast, i thought it will take longer
---
classes should roll on gear that strongly benefits them. dps warriors benefit and use the same stats that rogues and hunters use and don't benefit from stats that tanks use. this is very basic gameplay stuff but have fun grouping with only plate wearing warriors lol
---
Not when you realise it's not a character you want to play. I have a lvl 20-ish hunter that I won't be playing. It's so much quicker get there after your first character.
---
Ooof. Man, they had plenty of time to tell you that, what the hell?
---
I wouldn't mind getting told "Sorry, doing 3 mage" upon asking for an invite, but c'mon.
---
I dont know *her,* but I am familiar with the situation.
---
Dude don’t feel bad you’re actually helping ppl this guys an act
---
You can raid undergeared already.
---
Got extremely lucky and won Second Wind and Burst of Knowledge on my first brd run at level 53. I think that's in the realm of a 0.0056 chance. (.05%) And that's just for the drop, too. Not even counting players rolling against me (which were all level 60).
---
Probably just Graveyard spam. Gives you a ton of trash.
---
I intend to!
---
Would it kill you to write 51, 52, 53?
---
Because they indicate what they're meant for.
---
The Greed button is gold for when you just want the item for gold.
---
The Need button is for when your character can actually use it.
---
The only reason everyone rolls need on BOEs is because assholes exist.  It's like asshole insurance.
---
I’m gonna have to check that if I ever log on again to my hunter
---
As a colours blind person everything is 1 zone now
---
 Nice
---
Mind sharing where you fish? I'm on vacation atm and I wanna do some fishing in the evenings
---
I recall questing on the islands in that lake and just seeing streams of ally going past in the water and being very confused...
---
Or when your a lvl 41 shaman farming sm arms and the 34 warrior you hard carried gets mad you are also needing on the mail helm because I was the 'healer'.
---
Should note I tanked most of it and second in dps that run.
---
I think the person healing should get first go at the healing gear.
---
I was in a group yesterday with a priest healer and a druid was there for dps. Shadowfang keep. Both the int/spirit cloth robes of arugal and shoulders dropped, and the druid outrolled the priest on both need rolls as he needed it for his healing set.
---
Understandable, but kind of a kick in the nuts when the person healing the dungeon doesnt get the healing gear that drops.
---
Faction colab like these examples are actually completely against TOS and is reportable from what I understand
---
misstakes were made
---
"Traumatized" is a strong word, but it is irritating. The best course of action for me is to just move on with my life. If everyone who didnt bring flasks or allegedly has their mouse batteries die just before their living bomb goes off or rolls need on every single weapon with their hunter was blacklisted wow would be a very lonely game.
---
Wayyy too many other mages on the farming spots for it to ever be viable.
---
Thats you fault for listening to him
---
Honestly, it has the best interface. I just had to stop using it because it randomly wouldn't load anything for days.
---
i dont even understand how this suprise u.. i would never play in any group with these guy… not even Asmonmold u know u will lose anything there is a good item
---
This is a common tactic to try and fool people’s ah add ons into thinking an inflated buy not outlandish price is good.
---
That's my big concern
---
"Bro, a shaman doesn't need a staff. Reported."
---
Never let someone trade through discord period. If they scam you and you have no in game logs blizzard isn’t going to care as you have no real proof. In this case I wouldn’t believe a photo either way since he could easily just trade and show you the gold...
---
Lastigx you’re calling on deaf ears with these idiots. Don’t waste your time. 
---
Any good tank / healer will want dps to push limits.
---
You wouldn't be able to do the dungeon without the team would you?
---
I will never understand why Need doesn't make the item you rolled for untradeable and soulbound.
---
Human garbage. Perm ban for toxicity
---
Cultural appropriation, the Trolls would like their  raptor back plz.
---
I do too but I also lie about not having any depending on the situation. I'm not about to waste money on a guy who is too lazy to corpse run with everyone else
---
He has seemed to change his mind about a lot of things with Classic approaching, like the pricing policy of his guide etc. - I don't really know or care, dude just gives off an iffy vibe for me. But I think it's no surprise people who have been practicing these past years are easily beating him who hasn't played the game since BC launched.
---
Warlocks think they can tank now? Lol, first it was shamans, just roll a warrior!
---
Did you not save at all leveling? Lol
---
I meant questing with Joana's guide. Not AoE farming with it...
---
Keys get crazy expensive in late game, to the point of never being used.
---
You can scale the action bars in bartender.
---
I don’t get it.
---
as in a pvp wont do as well in raids as pve spec? cause thats actually balanced
---
nah BFA is much harder than classic, doesn't make it better but it is more difficult
---
Addon called interuptAnnounce
---
Engineering is more pvp oriented. So if that's what you plan on doing, engineering is great.
---
Unlike private servers, this shit is against TOS which is why it wasn't in actual vanilla. I hope this gets more attention and blizz is willing to drop bans for this, like they did with the rooftop camping.
---
Probably because you were reporting something they don't consider ninja looting. It has to violating explicitly agreed upon loot rules. If no rules are stated and the ML takes an item, in blizzards eye he didn't break a written agreement a c they can't enforce it.
---
Never played original wow, but decided to give it try now as classic launched. Picked mage, because it's ok to solo with it and they are useful as DPS in dungeons.
---
Don't like spellcleave, because it feels unnatural. Being careful with aoe skills, trying to sheep extra targets. Maybe I had good and experienced teachers in early dungeons that showed me what to do. 
---
Never had problems (expect spellcleave groups being too confident) or people complaining.
---
Still not feeling very good at mage and trying to improve to get a better results in dungeon clears.
---
So, sorry, I can't understand the issue. Also havn't reached lvl 40, so maybe I will understand later.
---
Seems like you don’t watch him cause you can go on YouTube and see like 5 videos of him reading in game mail complaints and kicking ninja looters
---
"use swipe for aoe cleave runs" lmao.
---
Feign Death plus goblin jumper cables (xl) is also a pretty nice  combo
---
That came about because of warriors wearing armor pen leather in ICC.
---
I use it when I'm about to die and a big outburst of dmg will save me. Or when I know rage will decay by the time i get to the next mob, or during pvp, when they are almost dead and know they wont survive it.
---
It's not stealing loot. Get over your entitlement.
---
Well there must've been a bunch of stuff right as well, considering he got so much money.
---
(#)Nochanges please. Or at least (#)Nochanges to class balance. 
---
The people who pick sub-optimal should feel bad for their choice by being at the bottom of the meter, and feeling like they would do a lot more for the grp as healer.
---
How can face powder open locks? 😝
---
Yes I'm aware. That other guy seems not to be. For single target you are going to be way slower than any hunter is ona guide that is already slower than cleave leveling, so cleave is unfortunatley the clera winner.
---
Maybe (depends if they turn it off after being asked), yes, not if they're honest about it (they just won't be getting as many groups).
---
Social games have social rules. It's not all about the individual here.
---
Link?
---
Some 30-something loot will last almost all the way until level 60. Hypnotic Blade is the best for mages probably until they get the sword from Maraudon (which is hard to get, so they may reach 60 before they get it), Silverlaine's Family Seal from SFK is hard if not impossible to replace until at the very least late 40s, maybe even later, and if your spec relies on rare randomly generated stats you may never get a replacement (at 43 I'm still mad at the mage that needed on the backpiece with +nature damage in SFK).
---
I find that hard to believe, not the inviting back, but the part where anyone would feel safe or comfortable to raid/dungeon with him.
---
Dash and claw for pve. For pvp dash, prowl for stealth and rake for bleed against rogues and high armor targets
---
Nice joke, BFA is pay to win and for people who like free stuff
---
Thinking there is a defined skill increase by race choice is hysterical.
---
Sooo... you are the underpants gnome.
---
Hey! That's illegal!
---
I started Lvling a hunter as an alt and I think i stopped and healed like once or twice in the first 15 lvls compared with my main that is a warrior and I had to eat every or every second pull and if i pulled 2 or more it's probably a death.
---
I cant believe how much faster a hunter is leveling in a rough guess i would say 3x as fast because i barely have any down time
---
Link 0 - what dumbass starts counting at 0. In character in response to a trolly forums post.
---
Link 1- scripted. 
---
Link 2 - in character. 
---
Link 3 - scripted. 
---
Jesus fuck your sjw betas are spreading. If you can’t realize the difference between content and real life you need to get a life
---
It's harder pre-dark pact as you need siphon life and dark pact to keep the resources more sustainable. Are you max talents in fel concentration and improved life tap? How often are you suffering from push back? Are your ranks of corruption and curse of agony too high for your Mana pool? There's hardly if any spell power on gear at that level. These are all factors in play for this build style.
---
Just remember that a pair of 47 mail gloves that give 7+ weapon skill after bis for warriors untill AQ. And getting the axe which would be better than the sword even without the +5 weapon skill. But your choice, play however you wanna play.
---
I see the mods really loosened up those rules on low effort memes after that kid raged about spending 5 hours in MS Paint
---
Lets be real, he was going to give the gold to Asmongold anyway.
---
What unit frames add on ru using
---
Yeah, I agree with this.
---
Gold has a lot of value in Classic, and an item like this is a really important upgrade for anyone that gets it whether they equip it or not unless they've mastered the AH well enough to have their own mountain of gold. Most players aren't that wealthy and will have to put in a lot of effort and time to get a 100% mount.
---
How much you want to play a character or not doesn't change what I was saying. Like yes, of course, you can abandon a character you don't like. Level 36 though? As a mule? That is very clearly a person that has a lot more time they can invest.
---
For mobs with a high melee speed (cats or dual wielding humanoids) yes
---
For other things, not really
---
Well that has nothing to do with items that has to do that their class just generally does bad dps. He doesn't have to convince them when he is guild leader and they joined knowing he will give it to himself. 
---
Only video I've seen of good pally dps was spelladin which I guess comes into itself until T2 with MCP procs then switching.
---
Doesnt mean those items are bad for then just better for others. It's likely still their BiS.
---
There is literally no range in the game where you can use both. That’s why the dead zone exists. Come on.
---
Shaman can tank yeah. It is just very slow because they constantly go oom. And their AoE abilities aren't the best.
---
Don't expect the lowest level cloth to make you crazy money. Personnally i just vendor because the prices on AH are not worth it
---
wow tokens are a required evil against chinese gold sellers and boosts  while imo bad don't matter because the entire game is centered around end game anyway
---
Thank you! 
---
If I’m trying to dps raids at 60 is arms still the best until later phases or would i do better respeccing to fury?
---
5g is 5g, but 500g is 500g.
---
Not had a bad experience yet, I'm paying it forward too. I've helped people do quests that I've already finished just because it's fun to help people out
---
Had a fun time all around
---
So you say this is a one and done run and only accept the people who are interested in that. It’s not hard to make non-farm groups.
---
Predatory strikes is also bugged you need to add cancel auras for both into the macro

---
I did, in fact the entire party did, especially to prevent ninjaing
---
Drain tanking is a leveling build for warlocks tanking mobs as opposed to letting the pets do the tanking.
---
Although there are some destro builds and meme specs that can hold threat and drain life for emergency tanking a few mobs.
---
Apologies if this is somewhere else in the thread... So, basically, you can specify the loot rules at the beginning of the instance?  "Do you all agree that we should all greed on BOE blue drops?"
---
Or do you think you have to be the party/instance leader in order for it to truly matter and be enforceable?
---
This is a very interesting mechanic worthy of discussion :) it would greatly improve my enjoyment of the game, because I've been blindsided by ninja looters way too often so far. I've seen people needing on twink blues like crazy. Like, I -guess- it's okay if you equip it after winning, but if I check the AH and see it is listed (which has been every time)... that's not right.
---
I usually wait till there’s a sunder or two on the tanks target, then start aimed shot.  I don’t put serpent sting on first, because that’s just going to add to my threat.  Aimed, serpent, then multi if it’s safe, then another aimed if there’s time.  
---
There’s no controlling autoshot crits.  FD if the mob switches to you, disengage if you get a mob on top of you, and distract if the mob switches to the healer.
---
I can't really relate to this since I quit in late Cata but  it is hard to even do a comparison of the two since the design philosophy has changed so much with the game over the years.
---
Even tho I quit ages ago the recent drip stream of cinematics from  the lore progression of the game has me playing with the thought to try  retail (or wathever you want to call it) purely for lore SP play.
---
I no longer remember  where I was going  with this....so yeah, here is my 1 cent of thought before my brain went 404
---
Play a warrior, we are the best class for dps and tanking.
---
Shaman is only good at healing like other hybrids cuz hybrid tax. Warrior is the only hybrid able to perform top on two roles.
---
Healing is the biggest head ache because you are blamed for everything.
---
In my experience alliance have been worse than their horde counterpart. At wpvp, could be due to racials or the fact I'm a mage though!
---
I've been watching multiple posts, instances of this happening in game and the last roll has always won.
---
Provide proof or I don't believe your claim.
---
The little hunk even has his own pole!
---
Stop spouting shit. This is literally against the ToS. Speedrunners have been banned for maintaining contact and colaborating with the oposing faction.
---
Warriors wearing leather/mail, or hunters/shamans wearing leather have always existed.
---
Seriously. This entry level “le logic master race” argument he is trying to make is embarrassing
---
Dropped for my guild off shazzrah. Don’t have any more info than that
---
There have been a few times questing and catching shit from mages for killing mobs... damn mages think all mobs are theirs these days.
---
Not 1g50s on a low level item. Source; am enchanter.
---
It’s just fun for them to shit on retail.
---
There’s nothing wrong with playing, and enjoying both games.
---
lol try getting falcon gear. lol eagle is so common, you are absolutely ignorant to say gear is skewd for one class more than another because its all rng on the stats. the chance of whale, falcon, bear, boar is the same. stop justifying your impatience and unethical reasons for loot practices. if you wear mail you are last in line for cloth.....period.
---
All horde will likely have a longer que though. They outnumber on every pvp server.
---
POLLO
---
I check AH for spirit/agility, spirit/strength gear when leveling my warrior. It is super cheap and won't cost much more then the vendor value because everyone underestimates spirit when leveling. The regen is crazy when you start to stack it up and it will probably save you money buying some gear because you rarely have to eat.
---
Ice Poseidon with less hair.
---
* I just did normal questing 1-32 then 32-42 some Gy, Lib, Arms, cath Together with Arathi, STV and such zones for that level. 42-45 was questing again, Then a Bunch of ZF farm at 45+ then i forgot when i left ZF, Maby 48-50?
---
* But then questing until BRD Prison+Arena farm at 52 full runs at 55 and then Strat at 57 or 58 (did not only do Dungeon farm at any level, I did questing and if i saw a grp in the chat i joined)
---
* I got to 60 in like 9 days /played, Ofc not optimal in any way, But i enoyed my Journey to max level. 
---
* Don't rush it, the Lvling is the main thing in Classic.
---
Better farm Ravager in your thirties where you also get exp and not at lvl58+ when its too late and you lack damage for high lvl dungeons.
---
There are a lot of adults that act like children where their entertainment is concerned. Which isn't bad in and of itself, except there are plenty that act like the spoiled, entitled kind, and as adults, the sad part is that the attitude isn't likely to change.
---
For me the only spell which has priority over execute is Battle shout but even this is in case of a raid boss. Aside from it it's execute all the way!
---
I don't get banned because I don't do dumb shit lol
---
When I'm in a group and I see a chest I say "roll on chest" if that rogue then decides to take the chest then that rogue has 60 seconds to leave the dungeon or be ghetto hearthstoned.
---
That was epic.
---
I've been aoe leveling all the way to 60. I just literally run out of Mana before they die in my current gear.
---
Very true, friend. I should definitely go a bit higher pop to ensure a longterm enjoyment. It would indeed be shortsighted to roll low pop on some hope of making it big on that place, no? Besides, I'd have more people likely to join a guild if I roll high pop. Plus, if I get tired of being on the high pop server, I can always later transfer if it stays too high pop, once leveled and geared.  
---
What server do you play?
---
You're right, I forgot about that! :)
---
The mage thought they were with her. Boy was she wrong.
---
I've been way these rolls and seems like the last roll always wins the tie
---
I’m sure you’re very popular on your server 😂
---
Epic / rare recipes / librams maybe some rare pet
---
“Dodge”
---
Was he tanking? If he rolled for offspec on something you needed then that's def a little BM. If he was dps, then I would have assumed he'd be rolling
---
400 extra attack power? Jesus Christ
---
Lol that guy. It has AP against beasts so it's the hunter staff durr, don't roll on the good one!
---
Cool I'll roll need on all the rogue items then, because you would never be able to get that loot without me ;)
---
What aspect ratio is this??
---
No, that's EXACTLY my point, when you can just buy an item winning it represents nothing more than winning gold.
---
Because you can turn off your brain and just spam skills at the skull.
---
Almost as if the ones who are the most interested in PvP picks the racials that benefit that.
---
I'm working on something as a side hobby project.  What kind of info are you hoping to see specifically?
---
Orc or troll. Troll if you want to focus on pve, orc is you have any pvp aspirations. The stun resist is straight broken.
---
Never had this or the chinese spam people keep getting
---
On the cost of the game.. You're correct that it isn't "$15 for an incomplete game". But the game 100% isn't free. Even on a technical level.
---
Classic is $15. If you subscribed purely to play Classic, then it's a $15 per month game. If you subscribed purely for retail, then retail is a $15 game. If you play both. Then both are $15 games, you're just maximizing the value of your dollar.
---
You can't get a "technically free" game for $15. Then it ceases to be free. It's $15.
---
Helping you manage your finances. Having consumers spend money because something is bundled is such a fucking easy con to pull off.
---
Editing was fantastic thank you
---
It seems to me that he told them to all select Greed because he was making claim of them. Totally not ninja looting.
---
Of course he was.
---
the tanking has been fine untill ZF, its like people only want to do AOE ZF runs. i've completede a couple of ZF runs quite fine with a decent grp, just some bad luck occasionally :)
---
Guildie and I tied at 98 for Blackstone ring. He got it :(
---
Leeway
---
Nah, look for things with high turnover like mats, but also preferably under 50%. Look for the underlying reason as to why it's selling at such a high discount rate. Undercutting? Low demand? Just because something sold at twice before doesn't mean it's going to again or will sell as quickly. Also make sure that your price isn't artificially inflated by one guy.
---
Yea do push ups on your knees. Its more important to have a straight torso, and your shoulders tucked in as go down. Its not "easier pushups are better" its "quality pushups are better". And it might be easier to have quality reps from your knees. Nice work, keep it up!
---
If its too easy, do 2x your level from your knees.
---
Difficult while fighting ragnaros or other giant bosses since you can't see the dmg numbers and I don't like msbt
---
Yeah, probably not but we all know who this thread is for
---
Get ‘Im bois
---
The only thing missing were text bubbles with "heal?" above the heads of the Pusher and the Damage-Meter Fan.
---
If you all agree to rules (like all greed) and someone breaks them, you can report them and GMs will take action. This is scamming.
---
This is true. Ive got about +30 spirit on my lvl 30 warrior, and my downtime is at about 30-45 sec from 5% to 100%. 
---
Its weird, my priority is still agi(arms)&gt;str&gt;spirit, but some items are still upgrades. It also helps that im a human.
---
Asmongold can not pvp 1v1 and is carried by the hive mind. Alliance are like Zerg from star craft
---
Yes, if only it was possible to move in this game, darn why haven't i thought of that.
---
The hunter pet is great
---
Who is Roysun??? That ain’t me chief I’m roysOn
---
Maybe we arent desperate enough to enable "friends" who steal from you.
---
Just don’t group with anyone from Olympus. Also report him, hope he gets a temp ban and item removed
---
Go fury for raid DPS, and make sure to bring your tanking set because you'll need to pop into defensive stance and off tank occasionally.
---
There is a bit of a difference between someone in a group and someone not in a group. If you are a priest in my group and refuse the Stamina buff, then look for a new group.
---
This reminds me of a quest in Silverpine. Killed a random Murloc on the way to Fenris, drops a quest item (hardened tumor). Tf quest is this? Check log, says tumor is very rare. Lol!
---
go to the grey area, then when you're finished move on to the gray area
---
Spirit is just  mental on hunters as well because we can literally kill mobs without ever casting a spell, although I do recommend to at least cast  hunters mark and serpent sting, but after that you can afk.
---
There has to be a better way
---
absolutely and unequivocally false. The weight of either action is not the same and therefore context changes.
---
Thanks for the heads-up. My alt will probably be a warrior. 
---
I can't just name a character FrasierGrain and not be some kind of healer though.
---
No. It's the natural product of anonymity. We humans are greedy, greedy fucks when we know we can get away with it.
---
We don't get old and get less greedy. As long as systems are in place where greed is rewarded, we act that way, regardless of age, income or anything. The reason we have rules and laws is to counteract out innate nature to be assholes.
---
You ninja looted. That is not a tank ring. Enjoy being blacklisted
---
2k is a lot regardless of the time you invest into the game. That oh well it isnt much attitude is nasty amd you see it all around with people who have this elitist mindset
---
He made so many good videos back in the day. The “oh so I’m not a horse” video has me dying every time.
---
this is what makes me roll my eyes when i see guilds go "mature guild, only taking 18+".  it's like bro, you don't suddenly transform when you turn 18, most of us don't know wtf we're doing and just act like we do.  i'd be surprised if even 40% of people were more mature than they were at 16 even with the responsibilities of adulthood thrust upon them, god knows I'm probably not
---
Haha he is a Warlock. He just does it for the sexual thrills.
---
What a piece of shit. Not suprising
---
Extreme Sleeping: Azeroth Edition.
---
Out of curiosity, what is the average damage reduction of a warrior? Pre raid?
---
Or say around lvl 30/40 if you know?
---
APES are such noobs that can’t 1v1
---
I hope someone buys his gloves off the AH and the mail disappears because he can't fetch it for a month.
---
I find this quest a lot easier to do if your get to lvl 32-34 and head north into alterac mountains. There's a bunch of white for yetis that can be found around the circumference of the mountain. Less people in general. I got mine within 30 min
---
No it fucking isn’t.
---
The only content that is harder is high m+ keys and mythic raids. Heroic raiding is pretty easy. Normal and LFR are pointless.
---
Hell yeah! Herod horde here, I hope to see you on the battlefield! I'm an undead mage named Unhinged.
---
Ah, right on
---
you recall incorrectly, blizzard will only intervene when loot mode is on master loot.
---
What a tool
---
&gt; One of the animators I'm subscribed to put the text "reaction videos are lazy and bad" very noticeably in their video, so reaction people couldn't make a reaction video on it without being called out.
---
That sounds awful. Now people have to see a shitty watermark just to watch their videos. All because the creator is butt-hurt about free promotion. What a retard
---
So then buy it?
---
As a newbie druid tank: what should I be doing if a dps pulls 4+ mobs? Swipe only hits 3, and my aoe taunt has a long cooldown, so won't always be available.
---
In general when your stream is so racist you have to ban usage of TriHard and cmonBruh, you should really expect nothing less than pure unfiltered racism in any channel were a bot won't immediately ban them.
---
This goes for Esfand as well. Also StaysafeTV. Pretty racist behind closed doors. 
---
Weirdly literally every toxic, racist streamer ended up on Faerlina Alliance. 
---
... and then theres Madseason and Quin in the middle, fucking stranded
---
Been farming these for my mount on my shaman I’ve got 3 +20 poles so far in maybe 3 hours of farming
---
Easy report, telling someone to go die is very much bannable
---
Yeah except there's 40 of them and they are horde screaming go to retail
---
Finally more people need to realize this weapons ability as a warrior!
---
Well, I would roll alliance rogue because all my friends are alliance.
---
Just wondering -- in a situation like this, why isn't it more common for everyone to roll need instead of greed so that no one can ninja it?
---
Can somebody eli5 what ninja looting is?
---
If I am the were a Rogue I wouldn't open it if someone took that for granted.
---
I feel like that would lock a lot of people out of their BiS
---
Because it dropped in the run, in which I contributed equally to, and I actually need it for my character.  Thus, I get to roll need.   The greed button is LITERALLY there for gold sells.  It's self explanatory!
---
So, why not just need roll everything?  Hell, why even have loot?  Just bring in the fucking personal loot system.  The window is pointless, and just helps the ninja looters, like yourself, screw other people.
---
Lezonta is so chill, love him and his stream, all good fun!
---
Do quests always give the same xp no matter what level you are when you turn them in?
---
I had a character named nymph on crusadegaming a while back.... NE rogue babyyy
---
Very appreciated.
---
Blizzard should have made a cooler opposing faction then
---
I don't think anyone gives a shit about playing with Royson.
---
Why
---
I know it's soon so I guess we are still in phase one.
---
&gt;This is not against the TOS or EULA
---
Wrong, this is 100% against EULA. Cross faction collusion is bannable.
---
I hope blizzard make an example out of him and perma ban him. fuck streamers who think they can behave like this.
---
You shoulda added a “wtf no heals” to the mage at the end lol! That’s my experience at least
---
Does Mend Pet generate aggro?
---
Ps: I'd even be up for running with you hunters that are curious to try pet tanking.
---
best name ever!
---
I read that in Jeremy Wade's voice.
---
This is wild to me because I've watched hours of Asmon and I've seen him pass on tons of gear that he wanted because he feels it would be better suited for other class/roles in his guild.  I seriously read this thread and I feel like I've been watching a different person the past month than the rest of everyone.  I'm sure you don't recall, but do you remember when you saw this?  I'd love to go back and review because I'm curious af.
---
I know it's a meme but it always make me mad how one type of class or person always gets generalized as "always dumb" or whatever.
---
I've seen dumb people in literally every spec, class, race, faction, game, life, and so on.
---
There is no "new huntard" just stupid people that have existed forever and always will exist. And that's ok.
---
It's ok to be dumb, be a noob, be whatever, this type of stuff makes the world feel alive. If everyone was smart it would be boring. Stupid people give us funny stories to tell, but overgeneralization is stupid in of itself.
---
Sorry your dad never loved you
---
do you get paid to suck his dick or do you just enjoy it?
---
I believe it's  Krol Blade and Mira's Song, Tharsh is pretty good though I would just farm the set and pray for a lucky Felstriker personally.
---
bad face *
---
&gt; What do you think it's for?
---
I think it's for items you need?
---
I rolled the dots and blueberry tank till about 35 and made the switch to drain tanking then and I struggled a bit until 40. You sound like you understand the concept and know what you're lacking. without some of the essential talents and ranks it's tough to get the full efficiency out of the build early on. Have you joined the warlock discord?
---
This is just wrong and I'm sorry you're so ignorant to how awkward it is to gear as a shaman/paladin healer
---
He said “in a game”.
---
Pretty sure you can't walk on the lava either. Can't levitate on it atleast.
---
No, it's not. Motivating someone do so something that goes against codes of conduct, whether it be laws or terms of agreements, is comparable (note how I said comparable, not *equal*), irregardless of your inability to understand this. This is like saying you can't compare the motivations of two different actions.
---
Galaxy brain takes over here. Please continue to repeat "nuh uh!" like a broken record.

Got something brown on your nose there, bud.
---
This a group invite?
---
That just doesn't seem right. I only ran a few SM, zf, mara and st runs for quests and a couple pieces of gear. Never did brd until 60 and I hit 60 on mobs just starting WPL. You guys must have skipped a zone or something
---
Well with a flask you can raid even more undergeared.. get how this works now? Lol
---
Not IMO, it's not exactly BiS for anyone at that point. Feral druids are the only ones who should get priority on str/stam leather.
---
(Unless it is BiS for the warrior, I don't know much about warrior builds.)
---
Truth!
---
&gt;But you just said it wasn't meant to be equipped.
---
Quote it please. I said boe was meant to be sold.
---
&gt;Okay then you want it out of greed. That's what the word "greed" means. You want a bunch of gold just like everyone else does. No one "needs" that gold, it just would be nice to have.
---
&gt;Listen, I understand why people roll need on these things, as I explained earlier, but that's not how it's intended to work.
---
Well actually I need the gold to buy other upgrades and my epic mount and consumables.
---
The bottom line is that a boe item is equally useful to anyone in the party who needs gold, therefore everyone who needs gold should roll need.
---
Works here as well
---
Kek, I’m white, don’t do drugs but we are cheap. Only one race/religion cheaper that I won’t mention because they super sensitive
---
You think 20-25g is bad as the worst farming class in the game?
---
You realize mara farming is 50g per hour only if you are a warlock, and have both herbalism and mining right? That is legitimately the cap for the most effecient and consistent gold farm in the game right now. Any other gold farm is prone to competition and camping, or just RNG in general.
---
Aside from being triggered by your post, as a warrior your best bet is going to be dungeon spamming, charging for tanking, fishing, or probably just mining.
---
That’s my set up. Not his clearly it’s too high for him but I’m very tall. I look down on that monitor.
---
Unless they're grey, yes.
---
They spent 2 years remaking WoW Classic on their new engine, and your theory is they wanted it to fail? Do you know how expensive it is to hire that many engineers for that long? Well, I don't, but I know it's a fuckload of money.
---
does this mean Herod is not a streamer server? I'm interested in joining you. How is it so far on Herod?
---
Well, I got it on my first kill so you have to help keep the drop rate low :&gt;
---
This shits hilarious and they’ve known Lezonta for years
---
Toxic guy is who Zack is too.
---
What do you expect from Olympus? They are supremely shady and toxic. What is inside them is rotten. This isn't the first time it has happened won't be the last.
---
Only if the others work towards it and agree since they need at least half the remaining party to work for it and have soul shards. To many times have i have had all four of the people not head over because the warlock will summon even if said warlock is the farthest away. I've left groups because of that entitled attitude.
---
Watch out guys, “actually not shit” mage over here xd
---
Honestly pretty cake. Yeah cat is very squishy so expect to pop out and heal after every 2 mobs or so but your mana should mostly regen between those heals so it shouldn't slow you down too much.
---
Usually if I had more than 2 mobs on me I'd hop into bear form and slowly work em down.
---
For something he did in a game?
---
It literally takes one person to create the "need on everything" mentality, which is the typhoid mary of server death.

WHAT?!
---
Did you seriously just lost the favour of ONE OF THE BEST HEALERS IN THE GAME???!!!!
---
Just... just uninstall now... I'd hate to see you experience the unimaginable horrors of a future where ONE OF THE BEST HEALERS IN THE GAME hates you....
---
Years ago we used to make someone who needed  on a nonbinding piece, equip it in raid right away so it would bind to them and  they wouldn’t be able to resell it.
---
thats super interesting!
---
Let's not pretend Classic doesn't hand everything to you on a platter aside for an epic mount.
---
It's a slow paced RPG that necessitates grinding to prolong sub time. Let's not shit the bed.
---
No, it's patch 1.13 which is not equivalent to any previous patch. They selectively included changes in previous patches, so we have class balance and item stats from 1.12, but dungeon drops that were added later in vanilla aren't in yet. Raid loot tables should be their final versions, though (hence why we already have Sulfuras).
---
&gt; Quote it please. I said boe was meant to be sold.
---
Oh for fuck's sake, dude.
---
&gt; BoP is meant to equip. BoE is meant to sell.
---
If you are claiming it's meant to be sold then you are claiming it isn't meant to be equipped by anyone in the party.  You can't claim both at the same time, that makes no sense.  
---
You are selling it so someone else can equip it... therefore it's meant to be equipped in the first place.
---
&gt; The bottom line is that a boe item is equally useful to anyone in the party who needs gold, therefore everyone who needs gold should roll need.
---
A generic green is also equally useful to anyone in the party who needs gold.  The only difference is how much gold it sells for.  It's a lot of gold, and you want that gold for yourself.
---
That is like the textbook definition of the word "greed."
---
I really don't know what part of this is so difficult to grasp.

im telling you how it works, dont care what you want to beleive goodluck friend.
---
It's a dick move but why would you believe anyone when they say all greed? If anything it would be all need. You have a dick and four retards.
---
Still seems that the known set has a much smoother transition. I can see the argument for both tho
---
Does this require a *penance*?
---
The "it's just a game" argument is dumb. Nothing wrong with being passionate about a hobby you enjoy, that you put hours and hours of your valuable time into. It's more of a morale/ethical situation/problem. I agree that it was a garbage move.
---
yeah just like if you're the only skinner and you get that epic hide off of the beast it's yours despite the rare quality. I remember farming that skinning knife just to be able to skin that guy and level the profession. Unless there is another skinner in the group I am not giving up what i worked to get both prof and gear wise. Rogues have to level up their lockpicking in vanilla after all.

well it's the only foolproof way not to get fucked in pugs.

Lol no

---
I don't know how much more undergeared you can be than a fresh 55-60.
---
You can definitely report him for that. What a fucking tool.
---
No surprise considering he hangs with Asmongold.
---
I'd argue picking suboptimal choices (which i'd guess for the majority of players is mostly done in ignorance) is a much bigger indication that a player is bad, compared to one who knowingly picks whatever race is the best.
---
Any indignant responses by Asmongold should be seen as disingenuous. The dude himself admitted that in one of his old guilds he made it a rule that guildies needed to Ninja all the best loot in any grouping outside the guild so that they could quickly get geared. He said that its a no-brainer to ninja loot in order to be the best, and that he didn't care about anyone outside the guild because they literally don't matter to him. The dude is a scumbag with conflicting principals that basically boil down to "what is best for me right now?" Of course he'll probably say he doesn't condone that kind of behavior right now but that's because he's become a super popular streamer.
---
I would never group with anyone in his guild because of his amoral behavior. He's a shithead so of course his guild is going to be comprised of shitheads.
---
I honestly believe it's uniform.  In many cases though for multiparty pvp Horde has the strategic advantage of numbers.  As the surveys and census data has supported, in this case horde will have a natural appearance of being superior with a higher average win rate due to just bodies.  While some other servers may exhibit vice versa.
---
In true 1v1, it's just a crapshoot of who will be the superior player or vastly out lvls/gears the other.  There is no measurable statistic of one faction being superior to another.
---
Which NA RP-PVP server has the most RP going on?

the trick to actually experiencing RP is to start it a little yourself with random people you meet. So i have RP'd everyday with someone knew and people i run into every so often. You have to let yourself have fun
---
So then what in God’s name is yalls objection to moving to range??? Ffs
---
Ah cut is 5% for faction AH and 15% for neutral ah (greedy goblins).
---
I never understood the thinking here, we all have a role to play. Tank pulls and keeps Aggro, healers heal, dps damages... what’s so hard about that?
---
Edit: only Afros can be tanks apparently lol
---
I would argue Shadowmeld is very strong in PVP for all classes (except rogue).  
---
Oh good, the room is empty!  
---
BAM - A charging Arms warrior "out of nowhere"  
---
During Vanilla my realm had a AQ-geared NE shadowpriest who wrecked havock. Until \~1.10 shadowmeld broke at the end of the spell cast, not when you start casting like Classic.
---
I don't think the fireball resets threat or if it does not consistently. We've had warlocks / mages get fire balled in p2 and still die in p3 w/o casting anything in p3. And even if fireball (which it obviously doesn't work everytime) does reset threat it won't hit everyone of your ranged and you'll still have the same problem of some mages / warlocks pulling threat.  
---
And you say you need a 2nd tank because the main tank will have his threat reset by fireballs, well we used one tank and if our main tank got his threat reset then alot more dps would of gotten agro before he got it back, but it was only the mages / warlocks. Many melee didn't get hit by fireballs and weren't targeted in phase 3 without using vanish or feint / just dps warriors. If fireball resets threat and that's the reason the tank loses agro then how come none of the melee got agro in P3? Just the mages and the warlocks.  
---
The more I think about it the more I can't see how your theory can be plausible. I've seen people who got fire balled get p3 threat and I've seen people who did 0 vanishes / feints no gnomish cloaking device / dps warriors who never got fireballed and don't have threat in p3. Hell if the main tanks threat got reset by fire balls you'd have healers who didn't get fireballed be pulling agro in phase 3 but that never happens.
---
There's no real "out of combat" time if you're a warrior, though. You just charge mobs until you're low then eat. Spirit makes eating faster, but doesn't make me eat less.
---
If you communicate through a 3rd party app they can't prove anything.
---
Appreciate the recommendation, you think it’s a vast improvement over Zygor?  I could consider swapping!
---
Poggers I wanna be monster xD or cool zombie!!! XD amirite my fellow 12 year olds? Being the bad guy is so much cooler xD 
---
Poggers we like horde xD

Retail
---
Please follow up if he is punished, i need sweet justice
---
This is the best video I’ve seen on the subject! Thanks for making it. :)
---
They also made an edit and said if someone switches it to master looter before the boss to loot that is a violation of the loot rules.
---
Poor neckbeard, you think rat-man is your friend. This is really sad.
---
&gt; Because it dropped in the run, in which I contributed equally to,
---
Yet you feel entitled to a bigger reward than the rest?
---
&gt; The greed button is LITERALLY there for gold sells. It's self explanatory!
---
No, it's there for greed roll, and as I've explained to you several times, your roll is also a greed roll.
---
&gt; and just helps the ninja looters, like yourself, screw other people.
---
You're the one who feels entitled to money while others aren't, yet I'm the one who isn't thinking of other people?
---
I've been leveling a priest and shaman in classic and always Rez when I see corpses, even multiple. 90% of the time someone will /w or /s something kind or exchange buffs. Most of the time it leads to grouping for the quest nearby or fighting against the other faction in PvP
---
I am on Bloodsail but never give up hope! A lot of threat management is needed for shamans to successfully tank. Staying on top of your DPS is the key for Shaman tanking. With rockbitter/earthshock (for non-nature resist mobs) its like applying sunders for threat..   
---
For those that are immune / resist there is still rockbitter/flameshock.
---
This would mean that they could roll higher than 100. Like 100.89 would win against 100.035 which I highly doubt they would do. Its just another roll with whole numbers.
---
Yes.
---
All the quality of life without the dead community.
---
Pretty sure epic fros are not in retail nor is world pvp.
---
So much hunter hate on this sub. Messages like “hunter is best leveler stop complaining” or “Imagine having trouble leveling as a hunter, yikes”. Now the hate is going towards Mages. Why’s this sub so toxic?
---
Blood Elves?!
---
&lt;looks around confused&gt;
---
What are those?
---
Warrior is my favorite class but I’m also leveling solo and it’s such a drag...
---
After all, laziness &gt; anything else. Let's all ignore how it's still faster and easier on PC though with higher quality.
---
Fucking contrarians.
---
Yep, its healing.
---
That STAYING at range prevents me from using my melee weapon?
---
*cries in Skeram*
---
&gt;it isn't meant to be equipped by anyone in the party. 
---
Sure, I mean if they win the roll they can equip it, but generally the item is boe because it is meant to be sold. Why would it not just be bop if it wasn't meant to be sold?
---
&gt;A generic green is also equally useful to anyone in the party who needs gold. The only difference is how much gold it sells for. It's a lot of gold, and you want that gold for yourself.
---
Yeah, that's true. But realistically nobody cares about greens so we all just greed or pass or whatever.
---
Also yes obviously I want a fair shot at that gold. I mean I thought that was obvious. Everyone rolls need on the item and we all have a chance at a big payday.
---
Your stubbornness is obvious and looks like you're not willing to have a true discussion on this topic. IMO a shaman offtank is exactly how class can contribute to a group the most - especially 10 mans. Earthshock a caster, tank it for a bit, toss a heal, drop a totem, wack it a couple times. Shamans are incredible because of their insane flexibility. Trying to force yourself into a maintank role without sklills like challenging shout or shield block is just ridiculous and naive.
---
I’d run SM Cath to maybe 40 or even 41/42 if you got a good group going but after that can just hop to Tanaris and run ZF or zone
---
Since I have mining/blacksmithing they came to good use. ☺️
---
Dont know that guy i guess hes a streamer but man that video is a tutorial on how to instantly dislike a twat.
---
I'm aware of the cvar that flags your client to do the Chinese replacements, but I don't want to play the breadening, I just want the headstones.
---
Woo grats!
---
Except thats kinda not the way shit works. If its your guildie, sure, need. But if you're in a pug, you aren't just passing an item to someone who needs it, you're trading them 400g.
---
If i was the the guy who had this item has his BIS , i would expect everyone to roll need if they were pugs. No fucking way i'd expect people that weren't in my guild and weren't going to benefit from me having this item, to just trade me 400g. Thats just selfish. 
---
Pug group? All need. Guild group? Goes to someone who uses it. In this case though, the guy clearly stated the loot rules then broke them. So EZ temp ban, item and gold removed.
---
Those little legs are fucking ripped
---
Every night I can feel my leggings break. And my arms spec.. Even my finger slots. The durability I've lost.. It won't stop *hurting.*
---
That frost mage played us like a DAMN FIDDLE!
---
Myzrael gang
---
Literal repost
---
&gt; Yet you feel entitled to a bigger reward than the rest?
---
Not true.  Anything could have dropped.  It was just random.   As long as everyone plays in a respectful manner, not ninja's like you, then in the long run it all equals out.
---
&gt; No, it's there for greed roll, and as I've explained to you several times, your roll is also a greed roll.
---
Ima sell this shit is a greed roll.  A greedy need roll is a ninja.
---
#YOU ARE A NINJA!!!
---
&gt;That boe literally translates to an upgrade for me.
---
No it doesn't. It translates to gold, which you'll spend on whatever you want. Even the equivalence you're drawing made sense (it doesn't) there's no way for anyone to know you're not buying an epic mount or something else with that gold.
---
&gt;Yeah a 2g vendor bop is the same as a 500g boe. You are correct, of course.
---
So what's the cutoff then? 10g? If this is actually based on a principle that makes sense and not just your sad excuse to try and ninja loot then you should be able to provide a number and back it up.
---
Those lazy night elf remodels lol.
---
I get my fix killing them through camping night elves. Only good elf is a camped elf .
---
Night elves have some extravagant death animations too.
---
Most people progress mentally beyond 16. No, you don't instantly become wise or a decent person just because you're older, but you do tend to gain some maturity over time. I wouldn't say that most people just stagnate at 16 - that's actually pretty difficult for most people to do, assuming they're functional adults who don't live with their parents and do nothing but play games all day (which would absolutely cause their mental growth to stall or regress). 
---
The assholes I knew in school have all matured. That doesn't mean they're good people or people I'd hang around with - they're mostly still assholes. But they're assholes in adult ways and are able to recognize that they were assholes in school. That's still mental growth.
---
This is a known issue with Tauren. Their hit boxes are massive and melee against them can happen from a basketball court away basically.
---
&gt; the item is boe because it is meant to be sold.
---
Meant to be sold to who exactly?
---
Oh right, the guy in the party you're fucking over by taking his class's item to sell... because you're greedy.
---
&gt; Everyone rolls need on the item and we all have a chance at a big payday.
---
So then you want it out of greed.
---
Seriously, I don't get what part of this is so difficult to understand.  You do not "need" the gold in any sense of the word, you just want it out of greed.
---
The only reason rolling "need" on BOEs is commonplace is because assholes exist who use the button at the last minute to fuck over everybody else on what is essentially a greed roll.  If no one in your party can actually equip the item then whatever... but if someone can actually equip it right then, they should get priority.
---
I guess they didn't test this stuff in the beta.
---
Yeah last night on my rogue I equipped a ring with MORE agility and my crit chance actually went down as my agility rating went up. Really odd. Gonna have to report it as well
---
It looks awesome.
---
You need gold for so many things at level 60 and a lot of people are getting there now. gl finding a group that isnt going to all need a BoE outside of guild groups.
---
Sorry that you had to experience that. I'd honestly make a toon on your server just to run dungeons with you and teach tanking. Have been playing a warrior since original classic (I'm not too tier raider/world first guild player or anything but still)
---
Yeah fair enough. Honestly I'm not backing anything up with specific data, all I'm saying is that in my experience I had a fine time pvping on my alliance priest but I've had more success (in terms of winrate) as my horde mage. I will stand by the fact that this may be in part be due to will of the forsaken being so much stronger than perception.
---
Because of people like you
---
Lookup dives drain tanking guide, it's incredible! Otherwise SM/Ruin works as well
---
Oh no no no. I KNOW shamans are not Main tanks. (ESPECIALLY for raids. Off-tank at best with most BIS. Need that platemail to do that.)  
---
Don't get me wrong, I know the limitations, I just want to DO it. :)
---
Warrior's are fine :-) have fun.
---
Imagine being able to go from classic wow back to world quests in BfA and calling it content.
---
Right, spelldamage + appropriate school. In item budgeting specific school is not worth as much in blizzard's formula so it gets larger amounts.
---
You just need an active subscription. Do not need to buy BFA or anything previous.
---
Thanks for letting me know :) looks like mods took care of it.
---
I only subbed and was able to play

"So at this point even if loot rules are spelled out clearly if they are not followed it is just tough luck?"

"That's correct."

To help avoid having loot stolen like that, if everyone is selecting the same roll then only go “All Need”, if you see “all greed” then you just try to chat ASAP to have everyone Need, or make sure you roll last or the loot is something you can use so you don’t get absolutely swindled.
---
Yes, it dropped in our MC clear last week.
---
when you pass on a BoE epic to someone who can use it, you are essentially trading them gold. Every time a 400g boe drops, that gold directly can massively benefit everyone in the party. No one, besides your guildies, gives two shits about your BIS. They see 400g drop and think 'now i can buy archmage pattern', 'now i can buy an epic mount' , 'now i can buy krol blade' or whatever.
---
It is incredibly selfish to just expect people to pass you 400g, just because you too can use it.
---
BoEs are ALL NEED / ALL GREED unless its a guild group.
---
If you want to play WoW: Classic you only need a subscription. You dont have to buy the game at all.
---
Good, ninjaing gear is always a dick move. Two dicks don’t make a good person, just a good Saturday.
---
In vanilla we all needed on BoEs... because we all had this happen to us. I dont think you played in vanilla and i honestly dont understand how you still have that philosophy in this thread of all threads.
---
For classic you don't need to buy anything, you only need an active subscription to play classic.
---
For retail you can play up until and including the Legion expansion with just a subscription. If you want to play BFA you need to purchase that expansion. All previous expansions automatically come for free with a subscription.
---
But again, classic is it's own game and only requires a subscription to play.
---
Nah, just buy the game once. Regular WoW enables access to all legion content on retail and classic content on classic servers.
---
No need to buy BFA and buying other expansions wastes money
---
Streaming culture is trash.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

All expansions,except BfA, are included for free in the base game. To play classic all you need is game time or a subscription
---
If Jack Nicholson actually killed people while filming a movie where he played a character that is a murderer, then he would in fact be a murderer himself.
---
Yes that's what you should see. There is some variability due to rounding when +dmg is not neatly divisible into all the ticks.
---
I didn't know azeroth had police
---
Your choice of colors is a bit perplexing and very confusing to us color-blind people.  I personally would have done 1-12 is grey, 13-24 is green, 25-36 is yellow, 37-48 is orange, 49-60 is red and use the same shades as the ones in game. Breaking down each zone by levels is nice but not really needed. If you happen to start in one zone in the low 20s and finish in the high 20s then you could split the zone green/yellow.
---
If someone says “all greed” you should all immediately need. No way I’m trusting someone saying that and doesn’t greed roll first
---
Feel free to look it up then. It was in the OLD EULA, not the current one, which Classic uses.
---
'I sense a disturbance in the force, someone needs something crafted'
---
How is it the same?  The person that can actually use the gear that drops ends up screwed because the party is filled with ninja's at that point.
---
Yes to tame each new rank or yes i can tame one with bite 5 and teach it to a bite 1?
---
it does.
---
When the logic goes over your head.....
---
I downloaded an addon to remove these error messages about rage/energy/mana/range. Once they were gone I realized how much I hated them.
---
This is pretty awesome! Thanks, OP!
---
Damn near every mage and warrior I have grouped with does that aoe shit on the pull.
---
&gt;I would let anyone roll on dps/levelling gear but the person actually healing or tanking should get first dibs on healing/tanking gear that drops.
---
So, if I usually tank but I end up with another warrior in the group who demands to tank I am fucked and can basically leave the group right away?
---
I don't think I'm being funny when I post AH items with prices like that. 
---
I think I'm being smart and focus on my target demographic that would spend more money sometimes to buy those specific numbers.
---
You did a sneaky
---
I would def block him out of all chat as well
---
Ohhh I see.  So is it unknown whether those epic dungeon drops have the pre 1.1 drop or post?
---
Gnomeregan is actually a fast run with the backdoor key.
---
I see, I'm looking for pvp server but thank you for your recommendation :)
---
I set up my main 2 action bars as 3x4 because thats how the razer naga is set up, easier to know what to use by the touch of the thumb. the 6x2 action bars are just buffs and random spells that aren't used much, and the bottom one is professions and other things not used much or bound to letters on the keyboard.
---
Flamelash
---
Right, I think so too. Seems like he'd also know that, though.
---
&gt;Exactly. So the ones who are interested in PvP, the ones who get good at it, pick the faction that offers racials that help with that. Therefore it isn't weird that hordes generally are better than alliance in PvP, the game is designed for it to be like that.
---
It's possible the faction with the "ugly" models were given PvP advantages to account for them theoretically being outnumbered.
---
The guy who used to cut himself and urinate into the wounds on stage?
---
If I’m specifically going for an upgrade in an offrole, I normally let the group know that at the start of the dungeon. For example I healed on my shaman an armory run, but was level 40, so I let them know I would be rolling need on the last bosses loot. Personally I don’t really stress over loot though, it’s just a game after all.
---
That’s just me trying to put out a fire before it starts. Typically I will Need if I need an item, unless it’s a BoE then I wait until I’m the last to roll. I’ve had my fair share of people needing a boe when they declare everyone to greed, so I wait it out. If I win the need roll I’ll then have everyone but that asshole roll for it again and trade it to whoever won.
---
Why didn't the mage cold snap and ice barrier coc to finish off or nova and arcane barrier to death? Dude deserved to get shit on disgrace of a mage
---
&gt;and you trade it to the person who actually needs it
---
No. Gold is useful for all classes and nobody is more entitled to the BOE than anyone else, simply for being able to equip it. All roll need and if anyone can use, they can buy it from the winner for a fair price. If they don’t want to buy it then they clearly value gold over the item, which means they don’t get priority.
---
God I hate gnomes with a passion
---
Should be the case, but like I said, nothing to do with the particular realm you're on
---
The very same. Perfect name for an undead rogue.
---
he edited his original comment.
---
Even with his comment edited it's fucking absurd you neckbeard
---
This is why ALL EPICS ARE NEED ROLL
---
This rule transcends all other rules and is immutable. Everyone, everywhere, should always roll need on epics. Then there is never any of this bullshit or worrying about scammers.
---
*Cries in bear form*
---
Just a heads up on the print screen thing: I took this picture a few weeks ago to send to a friend via text. I just joined the subreddit today. I’ll definitely use print screen in the future though!
---
The first 20 levels are rough as a warrior.
---
But once you get some decent gear and a decent blue weapon, you can actually keep on trucking quite well.
---
Two at a time will be pushing it, but is possible.
---
Watch out you gonna end up on his elite PvP compilation where he destroys the Horde with his mad gaming skills
---
You're mad he didn't know everything and had an ability on his bar? Seems pretty minor.
---
Sounds like a situation involving banking a lot of gear pieces to swap stuff out to solve the puzzle.
---
It's still 9% for everyone isn't it?
---
Asmongold is bald.
---
People don't read faqs.
---
I’m telling you, all mages are assholes with god complex

I’ve yet to experience a dungeon without a mage being a know it all jerk, good fucking christ
---
Ton of people are shitting on this because its not good for colorblind peoplewhich apparently is a big deal I guess but I really like it and it is a pretty good representation of what level mobs are in that area.  
---
At first i was thinking why not just label each area like 1-10 or whatever and its because thats not the point of this map, its giving you more info by using the multiple colors. Yes it sucks if youre colorblind and cant read it but cant have everything conform to your disability.
---
Yep that’s basically how it’s been going. Kill two mobs, Heal, Cat up, mana’s back after two mobs, repeat. 
---
You grinding quests or Cleave groups in instances or a good mix? Just curious ;) thanks!
---
Oh you mean drop rates.. yeah we can only guess that they have drop rates from before 1.10 rework. Don't think there's enough data to confirm either way.
---
Been a sub to you since MoP, now that your channel is back all we need is arenajunkies making a comeback.  
---
Someone please...
---
my point still stands apparently... anyone can casually make 100g in profits a day by just spending 10 minutes of your time at the AH and just flipping the right mats and investing your funds.
---
Besides leveling (and maybe wpvp), what content does exist in classic but doesn't exist (or significantly worse) in BFA?
---
Man that's how the horde act lol. Bunch of honorless pussies.
---
Appreciate the recommendation!
---
Can I use this?
---
bro if ur dumb enough to greed on edgemasters you deserve to not have them
---
Wow, grats!!
---
Very cool ty for reply
---
Cheers everyone, really helpful, I appreciate it.
---
So hilarious and accurate at the same time
---
would gladly pay 5 subscription instead of one just i could play there, sadly they chose to shutdown because we got “real classic”
---
Just as absurd and name calling? Victim blaming only exists in terms of rape?  Even if they did edit, you missed the point (and continue missing) the nuance of what the poster is stating. But go ahead and call me a neck beard because you don't get it.
---
that's some serious dedication to blur every single name
---
Unfortunately useless cause of the legend on the right, utterly impossible to decipher that shit. So can’t make use of it at all in any way shape or form but cool picture I guess.
---
Yeah indeed, that is off spec vs main spec. A feral druid rolling on healing cloth that the healer priest needs is a no-no imo.
---
Omg i cant believe pplz are RUSHING!½ this is how you ENJOY THE REAL VANILLA AXPERYENCE!"
---
top5? is the rest of your guild boomkins and retpaladins? :(
---
Dunno, but very interested in knowing. Hope somebody answers
---
It says
---
1.shield slam
---
2. Revenge
---
3. Sunder if no sunder is applied
---
4. Battleshout  for buff
---
5 demo shout for debuff 
---
6 thunder clap for debuff 
---
7 shield slaM (sunder if unavailable)
---
8 cleave for 3 but if single target heroic strike
---
When he said "all greed" and didnt roll... they fucked themselves by not waiting on his bitch ass to roll first.
---
Where the fuck is the legend
---
The amount of "wanna come to X for spellcleave" I get as a warlock is ridiculous.  I'm 53 and I have done exactly 5 dungeon runs (RFC, WC, BFD, ZFx2) and am thoroughly enjoying leveling as Horde after playing Alliance for Vanilla/TBC.
---
Also fuck your mage AoE farming.
---
Edit: Although it would be funny to get in instance and have them find out I don't have Eye of Kilroy trained while down ranking my Imp to rank 1 blood pact.
---
Embarrassingly immature names are you enjoying all your new 12 year old friends?
---
Sad but true. I played on a Star Wars Galaxies emulator relatively recently and no one there had progressed beyond being 15 year olds playing the game back in 2003.  Destroyed what would've been an otherwise fantastic experience.
---
Yup, the most frustrated I got was running cath for the helm as a mage while over leveled for it. Rest of my group was all under leveled. It's a drop that was usable by the other mage, lock, and priest all would have been an upgrade for. Keep in mind I'm like 8 levels higher then the rest of my group. I tell them I'll carry them through multiple runs if they let me have it first drop. They all agree. It drops, they literally all need it and claim they forgot. I'm not greedy with loot, it was the fact that I was intentionally helping lower level players with the expectation I would be allowed my 1 piece of gear. I didn't ignore them though, simply wrote their names down so I can do something petty in the future.
---
Yes, they do. Specifically shadow weaving (sp, the debuff applied to the target).
---
Curseforge is one common source. I haven't had any issues so far.
---
Yeah also farming beasts and skinning is hella profit
---
Is the ring good for his class and he doesn't have it? No.
---
Is the ring a minor upgrade and he doesn't have it? Maybe.
---
Is the ring not an upgrade at all? No, he's a ninja.
---
A most excellent character name.
---
Not to take this further than it needs to go, but in my time I've noticed certain people seem willing to pay overpriced prices for herb, whereas other people of a different persuasion tend to buy in bulk and/or are used to fair prices. I refer to this as the difference between "street" price and "hippie" price.
---
Ah ok, that's not a bad idea! If I still had a Razer Naga I'd try your setup.
---
As a real color blind person not lying for attention, that’s not how color blindness works at all so fuck right off.
---
Do your best in every aspect of Shaman tanking that you can control. You cannot control what somebody else thinks of shamans tanking, but you can sometimes influence them.
---
The side affects the skills as well ref. devouring plague. In other words, if you want to tryhard shadow priest, you fail the moment you pick alliance.
---
I think it changes if you have a fury warrior in group doing buffs/debuffs you can skip I think
---
People go PvP expecting some fun “rain” actions and not stupid camping players while they are trying to just play game and level.
---
I've run library four times, yet to see it. I just know the first time I see it someone's going to snag it.
---
should I use shield block?
---
Looks like some compromise between a farming spec and raiding, not intending to PvP much if at all? I guess Improved Lash is ok for farming.
---
Thanks! It was either that or DippinDOTs since he’s a lock.
---
I mean you're correct but unless you're exclusively spamming dungeons I'd rather have current "of the Owl" mail gear than most cloth blues.  That extra armor is money as fuck for both questing and PvP.  Once I hit BRD then yeah I'm going to start collecting the best healing (probably cloth) gear for instances and have another set that's mail for non-instance shit, but before that I have no intention of taking dungeon cloth gear.
---
But yeah, no idea who that dude is trying to kid.  Healing mail gear barely exists at 60 let alone before that.
---
&gt;*this post will do nothing*
---
&gt;*Royson will at most get a 3 day ban and item removed*
---
That's still something...
---
I dropped another tip in the edit if you're interested, but yeah i feel that. 
---
We've all tanked for groups like that and as frustrating as it is, my rule of thumb is to just do the best i can with what I've got. Im learning to let go of things like that and kind of adhere to
---
"if no ones complaining about themselves having aggro, everyones okay with themselves having aggro" 
---
And there havent been many dungeons like this where i get complaints. I think the DPS usually know what they're getting into when they blizzard / multishot right out the gate. 
---
On the few occasions they DO complain however, i try to frame the solution in a polite manner with constructive feedback that benefits them as well. 
---
"Okay, so i think if we go at that pull again, give me 3-4 frostbolts worth of time to generate aggro / rage before you do a blizzard and hopefully that will keep them on me long enough for you to get another couple blizzards in before they rip off" 
---
You're definitely going to get the "stfu bad tank retard" people, but so far those people have been far and few between and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive about my tanking style / attitude. 
---
I get at least one whisper almost every time i log in now with people asking me to tank because they previously added me to friends. Its a good feeling! Tank on, brother!
---
I’d disagree. I’ve found the mosaic toxic and gatekeeping servers to be rp servers. If your playing in a way the community dislikes, they will witch hunt you until you leave.
---
That’s why everyone rolls need.
---
I’ve encountered more rp than I expected in deviate delight.
---
I'm already experiencing that. Grouped up with a random rogue on Feralas the other day. We fought a mage and rogue in the yeti caves 8 levels above us and just absolutely screwed em because of how trash they were. Plenty of PvP scrubs out there that just aren't in the headspace of classic pvp.
---

---
Wut? How can a dps save the day? Tank saves, by taking agro back.
---
Ninjas suck.
---
Anyone who wants to join a non-politically correct guild on Faerlina that knows wtf it's doing then come check out &lt;Rage Machine&gt;
---
Unless rules are very explicitly stated in chat AT THE START OF THE DUNGEON RUN, you're shit out of luck.
---
Also, Blizzard doesn't have very many GMs anymore. If you think you're all now going to have loot rules for your 5 mans, you're insane. They're not going to have the manpower to look into all 5 mans. Only cases you should rely on Blizzard maybe being helpful is raid PUGs.
---
Otherwise, [follow this philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d8lh1c/z/f1bauyf)
---
It gets a bit better as a warrior but still no where close but if you have a healer you are a beast (currently Lvl 54 on my warrior)
---
Im curious about retail..I know this is what Blizzard wants me to feel whilst playing classic.  On the one hand, I'd like to level a toon up from scratch, but on the other I know all the zones are dead and dont make sense anymore.  I also dont like the idea of boosting a chat to 110 and being overwhelmed with abilities, so i think the best thing to do is just keep playing classic.
---
Most (all?) guilds had a guild bank. 
---
A bank alt on an officers account with the guild's shared crafting mats and consumables.
---
Sadly a quest earlier in Duskwood gives you an offhand with +50 armor.
---
This but unstable triggers
---
Get git? 
---
I already pushed my commits.
---
Depends what you mean by "spec." DPS warriors don't only use Plate items, but a mix of Plate, Leather and Mail since they can equip everything. Paladins are Plate-wearers, but Holy Paladins also don't use much Plate, because Cloth is where the majority of healing gear can be found.
---
It's hard to define what you can or cannot use for your build.
---
makes bandages and cannibalize super effective time and food savers.
---
How do I want no opposing factions when i just openly supported world PvP and I dont give a shit what factions you play that is your choice.
---
Not sure I understand your point.. they never do, in my experience, which I also said.
---
Edit: Try not to take things out of context to prove your point, perhaps that may get your point across better.
---
20% unless the weapon is slower than 3, then it is 40%
---
In the words of Shad, "we all get older, we don't all get grown".
---
My friendlist only shows them playing "WoW Classic".
---
I'm alliance and tried fishing from that little boat and noticed there was a skeleton in it. What's up with that?
---
Never ever ever greed on boe items, everyone should always "need"  it specifically prevents its these idiots from abusing that system.
---
Dude he literally said that.
---
Last time I checked  Ashbringer (pvp) was around 49/51
---
Decent amount of dungeons while leveling but I didn't do the AoE grinding stuff, just regular runs. Mostly I solo quest tho.
---
Could have an Nvidia graphics card with Shadowplay enabled. It records in the background and saves the last few minutes similar to how a dashcam records. Just need to tell it to save the file..
---
Jizzm seems like a nice lad with a sophisticated vocabulary.
---
Also Read the OP and stop being butt hurt you didnt wait to roll last.
---
Woosh
---
it's kind of crucial for aoe farming as a paladin, should pay for itself
---
NECKBEARDS MAD lmao
---
That femur gap tho.
---
Great blueprint! I'll do this!
---
That's adorable.
---
I can:
---
Drain tank it, did this ON LEVEL with princess in Mara last night.
---
Fear leash it.
---
Death Coil, which is just fear leasing with a heal
---
A dozen other things I can't think of.
---
The warlock kit is entirely meant to keep you alive. If you're dead, you have either gotten yourself in a truly unwinnable situation, or you didn't think well enough.
---
I just feel like it would be a complicated ruleset considering a lot of peoples BiS isnt tied to their particular armor class. 
---
Like how warriors can benefit from caster staves while levelling, or how some of their BiS gear for fury is leather / mail and not plate.
---
I get what you mean, and some leather  or mails gear can still be good for resto or ele, but I won't give up a cloth I need unless I'm friends with someone else who needs it
---
Flying mounts did nothing to the community.  Dungeon finder did some damage, cross-realm was the nail in the coffin, but flying mounts had literally zero negative impact.
---
Holy shit do alliance players have the perfect victim complex or what?   Literally the top 5 replies are all like “more like horde, they always gank me in groups of 5, I can hardly quest.”   Lmao bunch of drama queens
---
Now that I can get, but at some point those guildies were random. As was any interaction with any person, except maybe parents siblings and such.
---
That's so idiotic. The only time the aggro doesn't matter is if you are aoeing trash mobs with little to no hp. 
---
As a 60 mage, aoe specced, with some pre raid BiS gear.. wait for the fucking tank to get aggro. They need to tab target and switch thru while using battle shout to build it. 
---
Then only use blizzard so it does damage over time and is Mana efficient. If you are a mage using arcane explosion in a high level dungeon and it isn't a special aoe run and you aren't just finishing off a mob before it runs, you are a dumb ass. 
---
You have no concept of what threat is if you think blasting arcane explosion is a wise choice almost ever. 
---
Please don't speak for mages if you have literally no idea how they work.
---
And typically at least 3 of them at the same time.
---
It's hypocritical to complain about "alliance never fights 1v1!" and then go on to say "Of course a horde 5 man will kill you!! It's your fault!!"
---
Looks like Dark Souls with dinosaurs.
---
[Mee too, but I didn't waste 900g on a ugly Horse before.](https://i.imgur.com/r1sWXeW.jpg)
---
"Ya got my attention."
---
Then you simply don't understand classic itemization. Like not even trying to be a dick. Go look at best in slot pre raid gear for a fury warrior. This game isn't balanced like retail. There isn't a mail or plate equivalent of every piece of leather gear. You need to drop the mindset that dps PvE warriors should be only wearing plate. That is simply wrong. I'm not trying to argue with you, I'm trying to save you from some future embarrassment/getting blacklisted by players.
---
&gt;*Sounds like you just described every news organization in existence*
---
I'm sorry you grew up in the age of clickbait "journalism"...
---
That the level of assholery these guys have. They think they are above the rest of us mere mortals. That dude deserves a fucking kick in the nuts. Waste of oxygen. People need to wise up and stop grouping with these scumbags.
---
If you're shitty most of the time, but go feed the poor once a month....
---
You're still shitty.
---
And not naming himself either Calnaughton or Mikehoncho
---
How the fuck do you people keep your bags so empty? My inventory is constantly a cluttered mess with various pieces of quest junk and other shit.
---
40 in 24 hours?
---
Fury is better once geared. If you frequently play with other warriors and you play tank, you can have the other warrior use battle shout, which means you can skip improved battle shout and focus on using demoralizing.
---
Very coincidental that I've seen the last roller win 10+ times in the last week then. Hunh
---
It's fair, because it makes the playing ground even and avoids ninja looting. Declare ahead "Everyone need on BOE epics".  
---
Ergo, no one gets scammed. Whoever wins roll wins.
---
is it usually easier to sell greater or lesser essence
---
Well, you're in a zone with a group of horde questing in it, and then complaining about being killed by the opposite faction on a PVP server because you were taking their quest mobs. Are you saying a group of alliance wouldn't do the exact same thing?
---
Also artificially creating a shortage of tanks. Warriors are if not #1 the #2 played class If these guys would just throw on shields life would be so much better for everyone.
---
No expansions required (nor needed) to play Classic WoW... Classic takes place before all those expansions so you might need them to play in the future keep that in mind (we don’t know what or how they plan to change to game). Right you just both need a subscription. Although you can have just 1 sub on multiple characters but you guys would need to take turns playing your characters.
---
trees aren't just temporary CO2 storage which after the trees die just releases back into the atmosphere, is the point; they sequester the CO2, as in, take out of the atmosphere and push it into the soil, so there's a net removal of atmospheric CO2, contrary to what the poster said about trees being carbon neutral
---
I'm level 59 and I can't start the quest Little Pamela. I can see marlene but I can't talk to her or accept anything from her - what's up?
---
Sentry totem is the master screen shot totem
---
It rolls an infinite amount of time until someone wins
---
As a druid main guys like this give us a bad name
---
Ughh people should be stopping with this slow weapon narrative. You want high base damage weapon and the speed is irrelevant even though slower weapons tend to also have higher damage. Speed is always a good thing for a weapon.
---
"IT IS WHAT IT IS BOIS" "THERE IT IS" "TRUE"
---
u mad KEK
---
&gt; And yet you're arguing you should be allowed to do it in this thread, taht doesn't make much sense, does it?
---
As I explained to you already.   In the long run, it all works out.    That's how probability works.
---
You are the ninja, because you are screwing people out of loot.  You are changing the probability to work in your favor.  
---
Again, taking your position to it's logical conclusion, the whole loot system is pointless, and you should petition blizz to add in personal loot.
---
But why?!
---
Consecration is mandatory for paladin tanking. Everything else is optional.
---
 I didn't say you were talking about them. I figured that if you found value in the work it takes to Farm consumables, then you wouldn't be asking why certain other people did it.
---
I mean or you could track down every hunter in game and personally ask them why they Farm consumables. Best I can tell you is, they do it because they find Value in it.
---
Very unpopular opinion: Ninja looting is part of the game and should not be punished for or taken care of by Blizz and shouldn't be mentioned in TOS. Pure in-game "crime" that should be handled by gamers only through ignoring the "criminal", excluding from guild, in-game harassment, bribing horde (somehow) to gank him and so on and so forth.
---
No, because their implementation keeps rolling until someone wins
---
Your MAIN way of generating threat will be your rockbiter weapon spell that enchants your weapon with +dmg and threat. Generally your threat is generated by DPS done + ability increase. Like Earth shock which causes ADDTIONAL threat just by landing the spell all together.Just how warriors sunder to get threat, I'd have to get melee swings in with rockbiter on along with Earth shock to generate a High amount of threat in a little amount of time.The key with shaman tanking is DPS awareness and using abilities like fade when your threat gets too high.Its def not something you can just slap in a group and expect to work without thinking about it. Threat meters are a must!
---
EDIT: You have to use multiple ranks of earthshock lower ones for for intrupt and mana management. Highest for your "taunt"

Making someone's name visible in a post clearly meant to hurt their reputation can easily be considered witch hunting. I'm not saying I do or don't agree with it, just that it WOULD be witch-hunting by Reddit's rules, to start naming and shaming them here.

Well it clearly violates the scamming rules. He needs to report.
---
I thought the Taurens were the good guys. Geeze what a way to ruin my childhood memories, murder and kidnapping!?!?

I haven't played Retail in so long I have no idea whats going on. Last thing I remember was that Thrall killed Garrosh.

This is why I hate cows.
---
Do you seriously not consider anyone who doesn't get 30k a big streamer? Because that feels like shifting the goalpost something fierce-- most people would describe that at around the 10k mark, which I'm pretty sure Asmon was around before Classic anyways (though I could be wrong on this). Regardless, his chat has had the same reputation and problems for a long time now.
---
Mm you see this is why, this is why we can't have nice things, streamers, you assholes
---
yes! I do recall the case study from the UC professor evaluating the sequestration potential of massive fields of deep-rooted grasses in California being more or less capable of rendering the entire State carbon-neutral alongside a complete transition in the transport sector from FFs to fuel-cells or electric vehicles.

Jokes on you, I used Slowfall first!

The top left icon on your chat window, it looks like I mic. Click that then hover over your name and click to the right of it, looking like headphones sort of.

The dude deserves a ban. Fucking arse

I think it’s fantastic classic is a great game but we don’t need these post every 2 hours.
---
[Spirit Regen per class](https://i.imgur.com/eb5J1cL.png)
---
That list is for health regen, and yeah, warriors get a huge boost compared to other classes. Quite beneficial to rogues too surprisingly.
---
My none existing gf made me shave it.
---
There is a thing called mage armor. So you must not play a mage all that much. 
---
Also, If the mage is AoE speced, plus dmg doesn’t scale well with blizzard. Most aoe spec mages are going to use of the eagle type items for leveling so they have a larger mana and health pool.
---
I'm leveling a hunter, and i feel my actionbars are getting cluttered. Is there some classic addons with a nifty UI for tracking abilities and pet abilities and alike?
---
No you don’t, unless you’re abusing layers.
---
No. 
---
Greed is a word with an existing definition.
---
"Due to greed, I want this." "Due to legitimate need, I want this."
---
If you roll Need on a BoE you can not equip/use before the group agrees that it doesn't matter if irrelevant people can Need on it, then you are scum in-game. Full stop.
---
&gt;All my friends do it like this
---
Then all your friends are scummy players too.
---
If the Truefaith Pattern drops and there's a 300 Tailor Priest in the group and he links his profession so you know he's not bamboozling you, he should be the only person rolling Need on it unless he says Open-Roll or the loot rules were announced as being something other than default MS&gt;OS Need&gt;Greed at the start of the dungeon by the group leader.
---
&gt;But I *Need* the gold
---
Back to square one.
---
You can Need on every item that drops in the game if you want to vendor it because you "Need the gold". I can't stop you.
---
Just don't try to pretend stealing items is anything other than BM.
---
Yeah, that jokes funny if you're twelve.
---
I thought the same when I posted :) It's more like every 10 minutes.
---
edit: typo
---
Will 320 health make a difference in every single fight? No, not always.
---
Will it save you from wiping now and again? You can beat your ass it will.
---
There is a repeatable quest that you deliver something, cheat showed it back on G4, idr the actual quest still at work. Also runecloth is the repeatable cloth turn in. Good luck and god speed.
---
I’m levelling as a fire mage, which I have no idea why more people don’t... literally shit dies in two casts and my dps in dungeons is great (lvl 46 currently) I’m aware of the need to go frost for mc but fire is a way more interesting build than boring ass frost... not quite as under dog but definitely rarer
---
Destro is garbage for leveling, you don't have the crit nor spell damage to do anything significant with it , rain of fire is decent at 5+ targets but usually costs a lot of mana and forces you to stand still. 
---
A better alternative is to just go deep affliction and triple dot 5-6 mobs while you run around spamming instant sbolts at them.
---
I don't understand Paladin to a great enough degree to know the exact mathematical differences between the items, but the reason it is so much better on a warrior is because of how rage works as a resource. Warriors get the extra proc just like a pally, but they also get more rage from the extra proc, which is why they scale so much harder.
---
If you FD the mohs targets the next highest target in the threat table. If it moves to healer, then the healer was going to be a target anyway.
---
I've read that Shadow Priest is the best way to level, I guess at least if you want to do some solo questing and not just dungeons.
---
But am I correct in assuming that I'll be able to heal normally just as long as I don't enter Shadowform?
---
By normally I mean able to use all my abilities, just not as well as if I had holy spec?
---
My first intention was to write "we have" but then I thought... Yeah, he is right (yes I assumed a gender here). I could be that blizz already reduces layers and keeps the server full although they could just open more layers to reduce the queues.... maybe. We are nor 100% sure about the tech behind the servers and can just speculate.
---
Yes I know, I love ashbringer but actually my alliance is actually there so Ican't create an horde, thats why I been asking :)
---
Yeah meant that x)
---
&gt; As I explained to you already. In the long run, it all works out. That's how probability works.
---
No, it does not, your system rewards lazy people and punishes non lazy ones.
---
&gt; You are the ninja, because you are screwing people out of loot.
---
No, you are screwing people out of loot, I'm giving them the same chance of getting it as anyone else.
---
Herb bag is useless. the only soulstone bag worth using is the 28 slot one, else just use a regular bag.
---
&gt; two sides of the medal

do they use medals for currency in your country? we just use coins, way easier.
---
" I have known orcs who have been as honorable as the most noble of knights and humans who have been as vile as the most ruthless of Scourge. "
---
What a piece of shit.
---
Ppl will offer free enchants while they level the profession. On the AH a lot of green items are available at level 10. RFC and Deadmines are good places to get loot if you want really good items, but questing is normally faster and easier than dungeon runs if you're newer to the game.
---
I mean your dumb to not need. Almost deserve it but he doesn't so I hope they do something.
---
Those options aren't mutually exclusive
---
Idk if it made you a better person if you stopped doing it because you personally got punished, rather than out of empathy.
---
Runecloth is just the best way. It’s infinitely better to just zug zug 60 and farm gold for the rep than to do the quests while leveling, but at least you’ve gotten what you’ve gotten.
---
old.reddit.com master race
---
This is really cool. Love the heatmap idea, it really provides a level of detail I've never really had access to our, even after playing wow since vanilla. It's really cool to see the nap like this. Thanks for taking the time to make this. Looking forward to Future versions! 
---
I was wondering how you did it? Sorry if you explained elsewhere
---
How to make a chat window small? For some reason there's a minimum size for it and I can't make it any smaller?
---
Your stave is mine now Jordan. Sorry for your loss. F.
---
Also, you only meet the people on your realm so your behavior matters a little more
---
Because it's possible to view the interface without personally trying it.
---
&gt; you think you have to be the party/instance leader in order for it to truly matter and be enforceable
---
Usually this, yes. Whoever forms up the group sets the rules, and if they then break them, they'll enforce it. Now they won't enforce every last instance of ninja-ing, I'm sure, but their big thing is when somebody is a party/raid leader and sets rules and then ignores them when loot starts dropping.
---
Say you joined a guild's MC raid, RL said it's standard need before greed, no priority for guildies over non-guildies, but then he yoinks loot without giving non-guildies a shot at it, that'd be enforceable.
---
I don't know the ins and outs, I haven't actively played in a long time and only dabble lightly in Classic, but that's more or less the jist of it.
---
I wouldn’t say herb bag is useless. It nicely organizes my herbs and only was like 25s
---
&gt; No, it does not, your system rewards lazy people and punishes non lazy ones.
---
How does it reward lazy people?  That's just not true...
---
&gt; No, you are screwing people out of loot, I'm giving them the same chance of getting it as anyone else.
---
Not true.  You can sell just about everything in the game.   By your logic, nothing is a need.
---
Did you ever consider doing SM *once* just for fun and quests? Y'know, like a normal human who isn't distressed by how other people choose to play?
---
Next quest is at 50
---
Yeah, that bothered me more than blinking into melee range.  A frost of cone, a fire blast or an AE would have killed him in one shot.
---
Holy shit that's genius. Really should've been like that from the get-go. They should add it to classic to be honest, it's not something that changes the gameplay at all. All it does is make it more difficult to scam people.
---
Blizzard has no idea if Classic Plus would be a success. They have no idea because they have never done that before. What they did do before was burning Crusade and that was a massive success and a huge population increase.
---
Who fuck cares
---
Good to know I’m a terrible player only because my kids and work have prevented me from being 60 already :P
---
Free Action Potions, Pkate with stamina and mail.
---
Fury till lvl 40, switch to arms at 40 and level further in Fury as possible.
---
Druid. You can do everything if you feel like it
---
What is your class? If you are warrior, pala or rogue I recommend to get a new weapon every 5-8 levels in the AH if you cannot get one from a quest. Otherwise gear doesn't matter that much while leveling.
---
&gt; What you've really done in that scenario is the opposite of safe for anyone who actually needs the item.
---
The scenario is specifically for instances where everyone would get use out of the item.
---
Ah, alright. I thought they literally all had 2 letter names.
---
Could be fun with Lo, Ca, Ke, Ve, In, etc. So people could stand together and form words. :D
---
Any item that’s blue and is at the 9th level.  I E. 19th , 29th, 39th etc. 
---
Those were the breaking point of battle grounds.  I remember spidersilk boots selling well.
---
Switched prot at 54 and did all the BRD quests. 56.5, not ready for l/ubers... Going to go quest in either eastern plaguelands or winterspring. Should i spec back to arms/fury(only my 2nd respec every so not expensive) or should i just quest in prot for a little bit?
---
I think people over estimate BiS stats.  The difference between most gear is so minimal you don’t need to stress over (until raid gear).  1 sta is 10 hp and 10 str is ~5.5 damage per hit, best case.
---
So what? That’s just straight up good business. Why would you give the enchant for cheap if only a couple people can do it?
---
I’ve always played a mage. Will not stop playing my favorite class because some scrub on reddit wants to talk down. 
---
Instead of saying anything useful at all your just shit talking. 
---
Why would you even type out 11 letters, spellcleave, when 3 will suffice, AOE.
---
Even better: Shift + Win + S
---
Screenshot, crop, and copy to clipboard all in one step. Then all you have to do is paste it into reddit or imgur.
---
No, buying white weapons is always a bad idea, unless you are talking about throwing weapons. Green weapons on AH are usually way cheaper then the white ones from vendors.
---
Not saying copper can't be used but he spent twice as much money sending those than you could have bought them on ah for
---
Its not even just set bonuses, my mask of the unforgiven was not giving me my 2% hit earlier. This bug is such a clusterfuck. yikes.
---
I have no idea. But it'd probably help someone that does if you specified PvP, PvE and RP.
---
Always search for whelplings. I got one for 7g.
---
I missed "because they allowed it to happen" on my previous read. My point was that everyone thinks it's justified when they hurt others, but it was misplaced.
---
The reaction of Activision Blizzard shows their desperation ever since the success of Classic collided with their current business strategy. In contrast to the common gold standard in the industry, which is the constant feed of new content to produce turnover, in case of classic they released a product without real need to produce content. Instead this game limits their possibilities to stabilize the player demand. The path is laid aka release plan and more they can't do since any alteration might jeopardize the content for the players. This results in utterances of sheer desperation and madness. I think a rather long kaizen in order to bring retail back on track would be a good proposition.
---
But you also don't need offhand dps as much as mainhand, since it only hits for half as much and you don't do special attacks with those. Stats are arguably more important than DPS on them.
---
Repost of a repost
---
Does that piece of shit rogue who rolled Need on my caster dagger in SM count as a ninja?
---
It really is ironic; many of the people who can grind 9 hours a day are in school, possibly younger than WoW (15.) Many of the people who actually played it when it came out have jobs; small amount of them took weeks off for release.
---
this thread reads like old thottbot page
---
no idea why so many people (including the crying healer in the post) are getting so worked up over meaningless leveling gear
---
what's the point arguing about an item that you're probably going to replace before you even hit 60
---
all greed = all need
---
Not sure what is no clear to be honest. Everyone greeding is the same effect as everyone needing.
---
What is ninja looting someone explain to a new player ?
---
What am I looking at?
---
Always roll need.
---
Look at that damage, and slow attack and spirit. My warrior would love this too.
---
Not a shammy but I did lvl a belf pally, troll priest and tauren druid in tbc so I know All about the gear grind and how certain gear is BiS for a class  at a certain lvl bracket but unless you ae lvl capped. Technically there is no bis gear because you will lvl out of it into better gear. Your entitlement and overvaluing of the healer in the group is a classic eletist justification for reserving loot. I am a bg Twinker so patience, research and dilligence is how I gear, Relying on rng to gear yourself is poor play strategy.
---
Literally nobody asks "Are you shadow?"
---
They ask if you will heal.
---
If you break with multi shot and prevent the tank from getting a hit in, then the only one that can be on threat is another dps or the healer. Any healing done by the healer will have certainly put them above the threat generated by casting the cc.
---
If you multi shot and break cc then FD to save your skin, *you are getting your healer killed*. If the healer survives, thank your tank or the responsible dps that manages to save them.
---
Edit: and that completely ignores range based aggro thresholds
---
I enjoy sitting outside SM waiting for alliance to make that run into the instance. It’s like a game trying to kill them before they can get inside.
---
Speaking from my own experience, Flamestrike into CoC and Arcane explosion spam is way more efficient, you just have to know when to nova and back off.
---
It isn't black and white, any good dps should push their limits, but know when to back off. With Ice Barrier and Nova it's completely manageable and our disc priest is perfectly fine on mana. This is level 48 though, can't speak for higher level dungs yet
---
[I dont look much better at 60](https://imgur.com/nsb6Kcj) This is a plate chest piece btw.
---
One thing live wow has that’s &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; classic....personal loot
---
Yeah thats exactly as me but I've been watching Bettet Call Saul on the 2nd monitor
---
Horrigan? On grobbulus? Hey, good to see you man, you’re on my KOS list after searing gorge!
---
I'd say it will probably take till phase 3 till those will start to sell like crazy because battlegrounds aren't in until phase 3.
---
Weapons that are slow have higher base damage than faster weapons with similar DPS. The 2 go hand in hand, you're splitting hairs.
---
This is guide is pretty good: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/best-fishing-pools-farming-locations-classic-wow
---
Please note that the actual viability and prices depend on your server. Some things may sell for nothing where on other servers they are very expensive. The reverse may also be true, so just check current market prices before committing too much.
---
I rerolled on Faerlina with no friends. I’m not a streamer fanboy, but I wanted to be on the best, most competitive server. 
---
No regrets yet. Having a blast.
---
Why not having loot individually assigned to all participants? Allowing loot ninjas only gets you drama.
---
I switched to Destruction a few levels ago (somewhere around 30). It's an absolute blast! Immolate and Searing Pain hit like freaking trucks with +fire damage, and I can still DoT a mob up if I need to be more cautious. And I don't even have Conflagrate yet.
---
Is it as efficient? No. Is the survivability as good? No. Am I ignoring every single warlock leveling suggestion? Yes. Is it more fun? GOD, yes.
---
Not sure if serious? Fury is best raid dps in the game.
---
nah everyone shits on hunters here, because they're not meta.
---
If you bring a melee hunter in classic you are doping it wrong imo...
---
Ayyy
---
Yeah i used to always think spirit was pointless in vanilla on my war. (Was an idiot kid obv) Then i did some research after noticing how strong it felt in Classic. Turns out spirit regen is weighted highest on warrior out of any class.
---
TIL
---
There's no way to know which will make you more money in the end.
---
You'll be totally fine. Go with aesthetics that you enjoy.
---
Completionism!
---
I get it for the fun world events he organizes, but other that that you have to be a moron to be on that server and level a main character
---
*ARCANE EXPLOSION*
---
*jump*
---
*dies*
---
I don't really understand why armor type matters. If a piece of gear improves the job you're doing you should be able to roll on it. The warrior class gets the benefit of being able to wear all armor types, they aren't locked into plate and mail.
---
&gt; When any item drops the fairest thing to do is to treat it the same as every other item. The value of an item should not change what is "fair" to do.
---
Sorry, idc if you want some BOE from a leveling dungeon to wear for one hour, I need gold for my mount. The idea that BOE should go to someone just because it randomly happens to suit the class/spec they are playing at the time is bogus.
---
If it's actually a BIS BOE you're trying to farm, you shouldn't be running with randoms or should have established what you were there for in the first place and made an agreement with everyone in the group.
---
Unless otherwise stated, everyone has a right to roll for BOEs.
---
Fear Ward isn't a necessity, but it does help. I'd just stick with the character you have right now if I were you honestly.
---
Anyone know of an add-on that lets you add notes on *why* you ignored someone? I run a lot of pugs and sometimes it would be nice if to remember why someone is on the blacklist
---
[just purple](https://i.gyazo.com/205f1bb7b5c43c8ef6468a68f8dd2dae.png)
---
After they told me that, I would decide then and there if I wanted to be in that group. If I did not like that rule I would leave the group.
---
The slowpoke needs to be renamed "the inconsiderate fuck"
---
Female or male?
---
Correct, agro doesn't work that way, now threat on the other hand....
---
Some of them are pretty bad. Apparently theres a French one that's 99% allies somehow. Idk if that's real.
---
The one I have most toons on is westfall which is 70-80 Ali. Most servers will swing from 40-60 to 45- 55 % of factions, never perfectly even.
---
Confirmed. Worked for AT&amp;T on the road non stop from 2003-2011. Played WOW since beta until 2016. My 2G data connection via hacked tether was frequently better than hotel internet (300ms typically).
---
Once 3G dropped this became a very viable strategy. In the early days it was just gathering time while on the road as the lag was a bit much to do well with anything else. Worked with 3 others that all played and we'd typically have the 4 of us in a car for a 5 hour commute twice a week. 3 were always online.
---
just stick to the quest bow from mara until u can get a carapace crossbow from start ud
---
Just do the normal stuff. 5/5 cruelty then arms to 40. Respec for MS then get cruelty again and fill out fury until 60. Farm prebis in arms. Respec fury right before raid, respec arms again after because fury sucks outside of raid. 
---
To be honest though you really need to be able to tank as a warrior. Even if you’re playing fury in raid you want to be arms tanking dungeons outside of raid. A warrior who refuses to tank is not a good team player.
---
This meme was so clever that someone actually watermarked it...
---
That’s what BOE are for.
---
Exactly
---
Dwarf because fear ward is too useful
---
Nicely done, Anakin.
---
Holy shit. The Venture Co. Was my server way back in the day and I had no idea that guild was so terrible.
---
&gt; It’s not s given that Reddit users are on their computer already. 
---
But it is a given that they are if they are taking a phone pic of their ***computer*** screen.
---
Doesn't Swipe Max at 3 targets in Classic?
---
Aren't you going to rage starve yourself unless you're tanking to gain rage?
---
So confused.
---
It also is a lot more appealing to warriors than other classes, because you run around often in fury spec. Death Wish pads death ray DPS. Chicken pads yours and your fellow melee groups DPS. Convince your shaman and other three warriors to go engineering and you have a 25 out of 30min +5% haste buff in your group.
---
 You were all wrong. You were all right. You will all move on from this and maybe begin to state chest rules at the start of dungeons you lead in the future.
---
Or maybe you'll just kind of forget about it because it was just one chest and in the grand scheme of the whole game maybe it's not that important. Or maybe it is. Only you know that.
---
&gt;Escape Artist has been argued to be the best PVP racial
---
Maybe by people who huff petrol for a living.
---
&gt; Okay, you're doing ubrs with another druid, you just bought warden staff, but the other druid was too lazy to buy it, warden staff drops, now all of a sudden he gets rewarded with a free warden staff.
---
The odds of that happening are extremely low.  This is nothing compared to everyone ninja'ing everything.
---
You can sell bop items to other players by "carrying" them through the instance.   You can also sell them to the vendor.  A weapon can go for several gold.  I need that 10g that BRE sells for.  Everyone does.  Why are you entitled to use it, when I can vendor it for 10g?
---
Prove it.
---
I played hunter back in the day.... I would have never rolled on something with +healing. My bag space is already full of junk because of the quiver+things needed.  I can't wear +healing in combat(or switch mid combat), so it's worthless to me. If I'm in a spot where +healing would help, I'm also in a spot where I can heal my pet 2+ times if needed. 
---
So yes, "technically" hunters can use +healing gear, but imo it's one of the dumbest arguments that can be made. It ranks below argument of rolling on 2 handers vrs wars/shamans because of the 2-3 melee abilities that hunters have. (heavy agi weapons excluded... those are hunter weapons).
---
I'm not saying it's a good idea, but I was answering a hypothetical.
---
I sure wouldn't bring along a melee hunter unless he was a guildie on an full guild run.
---
What the shit am I looking at OP?
---
As DPS, if you get a chance to save the healer, you just became a hero
---
But as a healer, if you’re in trouble, your first thought should be the tank, not running around hoping some random DPS will notice you
---
You have to buy riding still after getting felsteed.
---
No, that's just false. Whoever rolls first wins in the event of a tie.
---
 
---
That's where you're wrong. Healers actually gets mana regen while in combat if they don't heal for 5 seconds. That's exactly why a lot of healer heal in burst + HOT to have the regen tick as much as possible. 
---
You're not completely wrong tho, Healers won't handle a tank rushing trought the whole dungeon that's for sure but "min/maxing" mana regen, heals and damage mitigation will allow you to go much faster that's for sure.
---
We had a hunter in our PUG last night who would only use Auto Shot twice, then he would run in and Raptor Strike for the rest of the fight. When we tried to suggest he just keep auto shotting and use Arcane Shot (this was WC) and Serpent Sting he told us he needed to reload O_o He did this every fight.
---
Im pretty sure asmongold exists to troll the massives and rake in 7 figures a year
---
&gt; Yea, asmons a shit person who hangs around shit people and you went and joined the server they all said they wanted to shit up.
---
Well said, Mr. Lahey
---
fuck that, no changes
---
Thank you for the info. That's going to be a no from me though dog
---
Check out the Updated Version. Increased Time Alot :)
---
These ones are terribull.
---
Try to snipe Sword of Zeal. Many dont know its worth and put it in at 100g while Krol and Axe of the Deepwoods are in for 250-450g.
---
If you cant reserve and dont have a guild group, run for them as long as you need truestrike. As soon as you have truestrike, ditch the thought about Dal'rends and farm herbs + ores, RFD or BRD pickpocket runs. Even if you do it in a slow and steady pace of 30g an hour, you will have 300g in ten hours of farming. Ten hours of farming is roughly 20 UBRS run purely running the dungeon, not included is waiting, flying etc.. Thats not even enough to make the MH drop once statiscally.
---
And he could use the gold as much as you can use a momentary upgrade.
---
I didn’t even know the guy, also didn’t unfriend him on bnet.
---
Now you learned your lesson. State the rules at the beginning of a dungeon. If you don't like the rule you leave the party and find a different party. Or make a new party.
---
Imagine insulting someone for playing a perfectly viable way.  Imagine thinking that I'm not spending my time "actually playing the game".
---
You don't know how much experience I have in this game either.
---
Go chew on milk.
---
Why are you attacking me?
---
I don't understand why a lot of things bother people, but I'm not a worthless asshole so I still do it the way that doesn't predictably annoy people unless there's actually a good reason not to.
---
Even mentioning the word folder implies that you simply have no idea how to upload a screenshot correctly.
---
Or ya know just use blink.
---
Ally scum on rattlegore that pass through red ridge mountains get tore to shreds. No one is safe.
---
Care meter: 0.
---
How do you know roySUN is me ROYSON??? Hmm? Fake news.
---
Seems like no one knows
---
You literally said if there's a 40 DPS 3.8 speed and a 45 DPS 2.8 speed, you take the 40dps weapon, which is straight wrong. You always take the highest DPS weapon, ignoring weapon stats.
---
Now, obviously, if you have TWO 45 DPS weapons, one 2.8 speed and one 3.8 speed, it's better to take the slower weapon speed.
---
I don't understand how Asmongold can talk so much about wanting to have the best guild in the server, yet he fails time and time again to put his own fucking guild in line. Seriously, how many more people are going to do this before he finally starts properly enforcing rules?
---
You misunderstood - It is the only useful drop for him, since he has everything else but I don't have anything yet. So by your definition I'd pirate him, because I take his only usefull drop?
---
Most likely didn’t train it because of this belief, and didn’t back down once called out because he literally couldn’t. Awkward.
---
Slightly off-topic, but does anybody know when Asmongold react to Captain Grimm's new video comes out? It's been out for 3 days now and I'm dying to watch it, but at the same time I don't wanna spoil it..
---
yeah
---
For hunters, you only pay the difference in training between your pet's ability rank and the new one trained. You only pay full cost if you have none of that ability.
---
 printscreen
---
This. So much this and nothing more to it.
---
Yes this. Now is the time to buy low leveled twink shit. Also we need another word for that
---
A joke isn't 100% factually accurate? Color me shocked.
---
According to some other thread,
---
Holy Fire Direct: (3.5/3.5)*(3.5/3.5) / (3.5/3.5 + 10/15) = 59.99%
---
Holy Fire DoT: (10/15)*(10/15) / (3.5/3.5 + 10/15) = 26.66% - 5.33% per tick (5)
---
im glad im not the only one. seriously it bothers me
---
There are actually many things one can do in the high 40s/low 50's that are considered necessary.  Like getting your scholo key, doing your honored rep grind with the argent down trinket in the open world.  Searing Gorge is super streamlined in quests that will lead into burning steps/BRD
---
Lol. Is that paladin going to heal himself to 60 while solo questing?
---
Are you on Whitemane?
---
Stoneform is a ridiculous racial.  Even just against rogues, I think it's better than perception.  
---
Now would be the time to reroll, you only lost a few days of wanding.
---
I'm definitely a fan of any add-on that passive-aggressively shames lazy party members.
---
Yeah I get it. That’s a reasonable problem. The solution isn’t to never tank - it’s to learn to tank in a way without getting raged at.
---
Tank in guild runs or quest runs, make it clear you’re still learning. And while I think that people who rage at new players are assholes, it really will stop if you play well. A bad tank is miserable but people love a good one.
---
Check the fight club discord, it’ll help you learn how to play and grow a thick skin lol
---
If you are on PVP server, destro has way more burst and is more fun :)
---
But it needs a basis. The joke is based off a gigantic stupid (low IQ) misconception so the joke is really on the person telling it
---
Sell it now and make more money in the long run.
---
200g right now is more valuable than 500 later
---
This is actually insanely interesting and has me asking some questions about the bright pink outliers:
---
What is in the NE Hinterlands that's so high level?
---
What's with the SE side of the Wetlands that's so high level?
---
What's in NE Feralas? NE Dustwallow?
---
this is actually pretty funny even as a mage.
---
Multi absolutely has a cast timer. Source: hunter main
---
As much as we tell people to grow a thick skin it doesn't make the person saying it in the first place less of a shit head.
---
Irl and in games you don't get to say whatever the fuck you want.  Go say random horrible shit at work and guess what you get fired with cause.
---
THIS IS WHY YOU ALWAYS NEED ON BOE EPICS.
---
It's teh only way no one can cheat.
---
This guy gets it :D
---
I enjoy it
---
So glad I rolled a Druid
---
But it is know thing if you win item you should always pass next one! /s
---
Yeah no. The color classifications blending into each other is poor map design when it comes to reading the data. Your alterations to the legend save no time and again, make it more difficult to read. 
---
The scale also doesn't take into account the fact that users are supposed to look for their specific color that corresponds to their level on the map, and is just continuous. For example, at 49 and 50 it's supposed to be red. But because the color doesn't step between levels it's impossible to tell which red corresponds to which level.
---
You also failed one of the simplest rules in cartography, which is ensuring the map is colorblind friendly. Given the higher rate of men who play this game and the higher rate of red-green colorblindness in men, you shouldn't include both red and green in your legend. 
---
It was a good idea in theory but the execution was a bit lacking. Is the subreddit you're referring to r/ShittyMapPorn by chance?
---
Since you’re playing horde, how about one with a half-dozen of you guys standing over the corpse of a lone gnome?  Caption: PvP happened.
---
I'm curious if you can dungon spellcleave with mainly warlocks using rain of fire / hellfire with pyroclasm (26% chance to stun for 3 secs). I'm thinking a composition such as priest/war/mage/lock/lock, or even priest/4 locks
---
I'm wondering if you can rely on stuns as an alternative to frost nova (and 4 voidwalkers+sac to tank), or is it too much of a stretch?
---
I like it for knowing precisely what leeway I have to move if needed.
---
Probably Fortnite
---
Lol ya right
---
Not correct. Birdie was always alive
---
The most impressive part here, is the grapes on the dude to not even send it to a bank alt to auction.
---
Correct, femur is thigh bone
---
Check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6xksk/bis_mage_cape_enhancement_shaman/f0wzohc/
---
I actually got downvoted for this happening to me. Very confusing
---
OP said they are admitting it in chat
---
Attack speed matters for pushback, and possibly also for frenzy procs.  Other than that damage per second is normalized.
---
&gt; "Excuse me, but WF"
---
Fixed That For You. :D
---
Feral cat is the least meme of any possible meme spec. It just takes way more work via farming and powershifting than most care to put in. If you want to cat, it is perfectly viable so long as you realize your performance is tied to constant effort.
---
Most druids go healer, but that doesn't mean you have to if you don't want to. I'd say you'll have an easier time getting a group to accept kitty dps before trusting a random bear to tank for them in raids.
---
I have no preference, just looking for an active raiding/dungeon community. I assume the PVP servers have a higher concentration of hardcore players but I also don't wanna get ganked a million times while I'm trying to zone into a dungeon.
---
I’m talking about Carapace Spine Crossbow. You knew that but you’re feigning confusion. And it doesn’t have way more damage LOL. It’s trading 1% hit from blackcrow for 1 agility and 1 DPS. You’re never gonna win the debate that 1% hit is worse than 1 agility and 1 dps for anyone but hardcore min maxers that never set foot in MC. 
---
I remember talking like you did in vanilla 15 years ago. Calling someone “stupid” for debating loot lol love it. I forget so many of you are here from private realms. 
---
And no I’m not passing Truestrike. It’s a shoulder item that benefits everyone equally. Nice moving goal post though. 
---
Lastly no it is not way easier to farm 700g. Not to mention as I said there’s been ONE flurry axe ever. Oh and my realm fucking sucks as it’s 75% alliance at 60 to 25% horde. They’ve done the calculations in game since the census broke. Horde aren’t gonna be farming for gold anywhere. 
---
Like I said man if you want to call hunters dumb for taking an item they can use go for it bro. Or just tank the dungeon yourself and reserve it if you’re a warrior. Or are you a rogue? Has to be hard being a rogue when you’re a dime a dozen and don’t offer anything to a group.
---
I'll play the game however I want
---
this is amazing, thanks.. combined with the mousewheel tip from a comment it's soooo relaxing now :D
---
I am sorry - are you and balazamon0 misunderstanding the meaning of "all" and "everyone"? 
---
Yes, obviously one person needing and the rest greeding is different. 
---
My point is that EVERYONE/ALL pressing NEED has the same effect as EVERYONE/ALL pressing GREED. The reason I am pointing this out is that asking for everyone (again, EVERY PERSON IN THE PARTY) to press greed doesn't make sense, since that would be the same as everyone (again, EVERYONE PERSON IN THE PARTY) pressing need.
---
shaman tanking is obviously sub optimal in high end 5 man content. In my experience so far duoing with a mage, shaman are good kiting/aoe tanks. Its less about generating threat on yourself and more about managing mob movement and ability to cast. We can pull four elites our level and get them all down with half mana left over each. 
---
the point is shaman can manage aggro and damage on party memebers, but are not great at just standing face to face with huge packs and having a healer focus them like a normal main tank, look for creative group compositions and stratagies, the shaman can bring some form of mob management to any situation.
---
If you look at the top comments, this is a bannable offense.
---
I mean, anyone in that group can just report him.
---
Loot rules in the chat which were violated. Though then again, this is need before greed and not master loot. It'll probably be up to the GM in question though they'll probably be more restricted in what they can do compared to what they could in vanilla.
---
This is me...
---
These are all... me...
---
I'm so sorry.
---
I'd really love for the game to show it.
---
Pretty sure priests can also solo Princess just running around with DoTs
---
If someone said that to me, even in the context of discord, I would think they were just sending a screenshot.
---
My first question would be, why the f*** aren't you showing me this in game? I would never even have looked at his discord video if he wasn't willing to open a trade.
---
Anyway it's my mistake I guess. But I'm certain I'm not the only one that would have made the same assumption
---
If you're Horde, the quest starts in Everlook, not WPL.
---
I was like you too until the fateful day I had to venture into STV. That place... changed me. I used to let lowbies by as I had more important things to do, now I slaughter any horde I see without mercy and spit on their corpse.
---
Oh look, the blizzard stance on Ninja looting is exactly what I tell every person here. State rules at the start. Leave if you don't agree.
---
Now farm Gelkis as ghost up to revered as well.
---
I think they were talking about the prevalent "slower speed is better" statement. Which is bad advice for people that don't know WHY slow is better. The correct advice is that damage range is all that matters. Slow, fast, doesn't matter. Is the damage range higher numbers? then it's better. 
---
Most of the time, it will be slower weapon that is better. But going strictly off speed can lead people to take a 3.0 that is worse for them than a 2.0.
---
Hey. I'm in this guild.
---
Got it! You reply is much appreciated! Time to level up!
---
Wow, you must be VERY new. Fury DPS is the highest raid DPS, its why top guilds like APES takes multiple fury warriors.
---
Seriously, google it. This is very common knowledge. Highest raid DPS goes Fury warr -&gt; combat rogue -&gt; frost mage -&gt; lock -&gt; hunter
---
You aren't going to enjoy the game at 60 if boring and long is a complaint.
---
Your problem is that you think morality is tied to age. It’s not. If someone is an asshole at 15/16 they probably always will be. Most good people would never have done this at any age.
---
I don't heal the DPS because my time and mana are better spent dealing damage myself.
---
If tank has all the aggro, then we have 4 dps, one of which can occasionally drop a heal.
---
If tank *and* dps have aggro, then I have to actually focus on healing if I want to keep dps alive, and the whole thing goes much slower for no fucking reason.
---
being complicit in an act does not make things comparable except in the semantic world you live in where you can separate action from consequence.
---
The Gnomish Battle Chicken, does it follows or stays in one place?
---
Booty Bay is better. Neutral AH, fly to city, easy port to Ratchet
---
Bs
---
BiS mid bracket are usually 100-200g. Depends though, with the strength of gold now it could be an equivalent market of 30-40g.
---
Out of context GM conversations with bad image quality are hardly "proof" of any kind. Bad support provided =/= a rule changed.
---
This community has a really hard time realizing that a person can enjoy two things at once
---
Its obviously more convenient for the person posting to use their phone, so they should inconvenience themselves by doing it differently because people cant handle seeing a slightly grainy photo... seems bizarre to me.
---
Also https://www.wowhead.com/wow-classic-dps-rankings-tier-list-phase-1-molten-core because apparently you're really new.
---
I love being shaman versus basically all classes.
---
Windfury is GREAT against anybody that seems to be playing cocky. But people who are playing it safe I switch to rockbiter for more sustained hits, sometimes frost for the rogues.
---
Wowhead classic has the loot drops with percentages... I know it’s not an addon but I use it
---
Aah the old hybrid nonsense again. 2004, I've not missed you one bit.
---
No. I am on  Blaumeux.
---
no u can AH anytime after a dungeon run when mages port you to Org or UC
---
they have a premium feature with thier client that auto updates (:
---
BoEs have intrinsic value beyond simply wearing them, therefor they don't fall under the need before greed rule, since everyone could use 450g.
---
stop
---
Scrubs. Play with Bajheera or Swifty
---
Yeah ofc. Also a weird youtube video is absolutely not needed to understand bartender. Everything is labled, its really straight forward and easy to understand by simply lopkind at its menue. Just give it a try!
---
”Fineman has gone offline” got me
---
Combuctor
---
Yeah that's exactly what I said you fucking idiot. 
---
How many times can you just repeat the same thing without making any point??
---
So much fail ,Millenial “me first” , retail bull dropping here.
---
Nope. That’s not how everyone works, just an excuse used by assholes.
---
You can get to 60 without ever grouping with other players, so it's entirely up to you. If you want to do dungeons, expect a little flak for not tanking when the group waits 30min+ and you're a warrior sitting there already. But fury dps is amazing so it's fine to just be a dps forever.
---
Tanks can get dungeon groups way quicker, but you can still look to get in as DPS. 
---
All you really need to tank is gear that isn't awful and a 1h/shield.  If you find a supportive guild, have someone take you on kind of a 'trial run' or get into voice chat with you and give you a few pointers.  It's not rocket science, the tough part of tanking is dealing with the four other players not learning the right basic rotation.
---
Like anywhere else. Only slightly more strict with naming.
---
What ad to show stats
---
Not really.  I've been an absolute rabid dog in world PvP since vanilla, played continually from then through the first few months of Cata, and have played a bit of MoP and BFA since then.  I've never found myself wanting for world PvP.  Sure there are a few ways you can catch someone on a ground mount that doesn't apply to flying mounts, but for the most part you aren't catching someone on an epic ground mount if they don't want to be caught, which is no different from them being on a flying mount.  All the times you would be able to fight someone were applicable no matter the available mounts because those times are when they're dismounted anyhow, in which case the fact that they have a flying mount is irrelevant because they can't mount in combat, and if they can disengage from you long enough to mount up on their flyer they would have gotten away on their epic mount as well.  The other thing people complain about is idling on a flyer, but they don't consider that all that did was save that person time.  They weren't going to idle in that location if they didn't have a flyer and would instead have gone somewhere safe to AFK instead.  The fact that you can see them but not touch them instead of not seeing them at all is irrelevant: you were never going to interact with that player regardless.  Unless your idea of world "PvP" is one-shotting lowbies (in which case sure the couple hits you could tag them with on a ground mount before they rode away would kill them while you wouldn't get that chance with them flying) then flying mounts did nothing to inhibit world PvP.
---
Doubt it
---
Name/realm?
---
You should try Azuresong. LFG is very active on that server, and is only High population during super peak times, rest of the time it's Medium. Perfect balance.
---
This. I literally build every group to benifit my rolls. As a warrior i take all clothies and maybe a rogue.
---

---
Kalimdor’s lookin a little funky
---
How lame.
---
Nonononono. He was just noting that all had agreed that he deserved the loot. It was just a typo.
---
Hoping theyll take a look at jagex and how they did classic release. Polling players on the fourms could be good...i think
---
I'd have a kill on sight policy, my word!
---
They wouldn’t be banned from anything though.
---
You roll need on BOE.
---
&gt; ou can sell bop items to other players by "carrying" them through the instance.
---
Okay, fair enough, but you can't simply buy an item with 0 effort and that's the major difference.
---
&gt; You can also sell them to the vendor.
---
But you can't simply buy it from the vendor.
---
How do I do that?
---

little something like that. cant wait to do it in SS/TM :)
---
what a guy
---
Juat don't use em
---
Ain’t that the truth. I was doing Blackfatbom Deeps as a healer for the first time yesterday. After walking all the way through the entrance, the party kicked me on the second pull for some reason. This caused me to have to leave or get hearthed, so I left the instance and died by the alliance looking for another group. 
---
Thankfully I found a dead body on the way back, so I rezed him, and then we formed a group. That party was much better. 
---
My point is, not every group is nice, but there certainly are great ones.
---
You tell em!
---
&gt;Changing the Loot Method   
---
&gt;Should a raid commence under a specific looting system (i.e. Group Loot), and the Raid Leader later swap to a different looting method mid-raid (i.e. Master Looter), this is a direct change to the looting expectations set beforehand. A Raid Leader taking such actions would be considered to have breached the prior arrangement, and any items unfairly distributed in such a situation would constitute a scam case.
---
IMO as long as it's done and clearly announced, I don't see an issue. If the RL wants to master loot a boss and before the boss clearly announces "This boss will be ML. If you do not wish to continue, please leave now." I don't see an issue.
---
there is an elemental a nature one, witch spawns on the diremaul arena, when he spawns he spawns alot of plants on the arena and  from 1 to 3 Black lotus ;)
---
What an original post.
---
Just having the cruel barb sets you up for the next 10 levels
---
I wonder how I forgot about that
---
The Countdown to Classic podcast host actually read through the ToS and cross faction communication is no longer part of the ToS (it stopped being part most likely when b-net became a thing and they couldn't really stop you reasonably from talking to friends using it), meaning that talking to people really isn't against the rules anymore.
---
Bite it! You scum!
---
NSFW tag, please. Come on, no one needed to see that today.
---
You win, your class is the hardest and requires the most skill to play so your special and deserve tk be treated as such. If you dont like the grind go play retail or eso.
---
What?  That’s what they are doing, by what you said.  They entered as a healer, so they should be rolling on healing gear.  
---
Or are you just going to throw memes and random sayings around without addressing anything I say?
---
Git Gud. Run up to close enough to heal the next mob and then sit and drink while they battle until you have enough mana to heal that mob and repeat
---
Sorry i should have specified, i flew over a player in hillsbrad and he told me to watch where i was going. Thought it was a funny interaction.
---
That isn’t the one who said he got kicked chill bruh.

You can do anything you want.

Thanks for telling me what I enjoy because you don't like how I'm playing.

I've already played this game at 60

I started with a dwarf priest until lvl 23 'cuz we needed a healer, then I send him to hell and started all again with my lovely night elf hunter lv 45 now. Just follow your hearth and play whatever you like.
---
Wow....
---
Lol stalking you? I’m just reading through the thread in order bud don’t get excited
---
I thought the lv50 class quests aren't out yet? They are coming out in a later phase.
---
Earth Shock is 20 yd range and interrupts spell casting so if the mage frost novas a Shaman then jumps to 21+ yd range he can't interrupt, only grounding.
---
I wouldn't worry about it.
---
You arent a moderator so it isnt up for you to decide how the rules work. This post is not a witch hint and you might want to learn what that term means. There is plenty of proof provided and this guy is a public figure. So fuck off and let the moderators do their jobs.

Honestly I still vastly prefer classic version.
---
Everyone is freaking out about climate change and I’m like nah fam Chromie will just reset the clocks for us.

---
delete your account. no one wants to play with you
---
I be honest with you , my guild is not hardcore and we are maximum semi hard core i guess if everyone just shows up on time and has his own consumables no world buffs counts as semi hc. And we just smashed molten core got only stopped bcs of reputation and after the first MC guild leader said any spec can go in its so easy you don't have to min max at all we have 2 feral druids we have 1 moonkin and i saw  1 shadow priest maybe they are not on top but honestly no one cares atleast in our guild we having no problem no wipes and i believe lots of players in other guild feel the same RN its super easy to clear no matter spec.
---
Perfect listing. Think they next one will have to include multishot/volley hunters.
---
I’ve been buying twink gear for cheap since day one.
---
Outfitter used to be the addon for this, but AFAIK there's no classic version. Item rack works really well though https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemrack-classic

But then you have to print the screenshot so you can take a picture of it and upload it

And I'm just muting you now, enjoy being a loser.

I suppose I should have said that in between us asking him to equip it and kicking him was an offer to all reroll. He said "let's just keep going" and pulled. There is in game etiquette and then there is just plain human being politeness. Thinking that any opportunity to "get one over" on others at their expense (especially when the very thing you are exploiting is their kindness and politeness) is fair play is exactly why I questioned your morals. As far as OP, not saying it was an example of a ban worthy offense, just rude.
---
Hey someone from Venture Co! I remember Horrigan on there too during Wrath where he had an all-human guild and would constantly spam toxic shit.
---
Then you'd have Impy who would sit in SW and ask for gold literally all day but was one of the nicest guys I met.
---
You weren't kidding. Damn.
---
Wait... Investigated doesn't mean shit. If he was convicted that's one thing but an investigation is nothing. And then I look down and he's not being investigated by police? By CHRIS HANSEN? There HAS to be more to this story.
---
Might be a bit rough if you're spellcleaving BRD because it is very easy for a warlock to get shield bashed by the dwarves who spam it constantly, locking them out of fire spells. Unlike mages they don't have multiple spell schools to AoE with, and don't really have tools to avoid being close enough to get shield bashed in the first place.
---
Could just be they don't want a bunch of people to start doing this and tank the prices of herbs on their servers. Nice guide though!
---
Valiant effort but every time one of these posts is made it introduces hundreds of new subs/viewers. That's why he's always playing up to the drama. He literally has this sub by its nads.
---
Why on earth would anyone want to ~~play~~ be bullied by the egotistical, pasty mofo gang anyway. They's be the school kid that never grew up.
---
Lookin cripsy
---
And GMs possibly do not have information like that as that is inplementation detail of developers and not business logic.
---
Its probably a dev (or PO) that confirmed it. Not a GM
---
I keep my gear current from dungeons. Like I said it costs a small fortune to run them. All the more annoying when it's a Warlock tapping all the time and using my water as free health, complaining about gear!
---
I don't know why you don't have them but there should be buttons on the left. I'd try disabling addons 1 by 1 and refreshing to see if the buttons come back.
---
No, it's because they tend to be solo players in a group game.
---
All quests should be doable in one run. Most people skip Oh Brother, and the union cards quest, because they are actually outside the dungeon. Ask your group if they will do it, or form a group specifically for those two quests.
---
Quests always give a specific amount of exp unless they're grey, when they give a greatly reduced amount. You feel like green quests give less exp than yellow+ ones because a level 35 quest usually has a smaller exp reward than a level 42 one, but you get the exact same XP completing a quest when it's green vs when it's red.
---
I think there’s an AAP Classic
---
Also the Missing Diplomat quest!
---
zf until 52 then brd at 52. as a priest healer you can brd even earlier
---
Spirit doesn't make you eat faster, it makes you regenerate more health out of combat, it literally does make you eat less because you don't need to eat as often unless you just never drop combat.
---
no one cares
---
All of this is such a trivial thing to even debate about. Who cares.
---
lmao. Is this guy for real?! 🤣
---
You are lucky I wish I can find a guild like this that is semi hardcore and just raid for a good time rather than min/maxing every number on the screen. Thanks for letting me this kind of guild exists
---
Yea 6ix9ine look the other way
---
Right now I'm doing a weird (to me) hybrid of affliction and demo. I feel like I'm just putting on some dots and wanding. Very different and kinda boring playstyle compared to retail. Anyone got a decent leveling build and or what abilities I should be cycling through?
---
Why do people farm the Scarlet Monastery in particular for quick leveling?
---
DD shout out.   I love to rp,  but you are sadly right.
---
Asmon himself tells his viewers to fuck people 3 times harder than they fuck you. This is the one time you'll want to take his advice.
---
Tell your friend (and everyone else in the party) to report this to a GM. He set a loot rule and then broke it instantly, which is against the TOS and will get him a tasty little temp ban. They might even delete the item/gold. Also if he does, follow it up for that juicy drama karma.
---
The naxx PTR had the "bis mage" blizz made characters as trolls. Thats always stuck with me for some reason. Trolls were the mages and the priests.
---
Starting with Z, won against people like that.
---
It works!! And it is amazing!!!
---
idk what world you live in where people are immediately redeemed after not being a dickhead for a few weeks
---
It's not nothing though, a simple guideline of planned phases would suffice, release dates once they become available, events like Darkmoon faire are coming... There are classic relevant posts that could take this slot, and you pretending there aren't doesn't change that.
---
Imagine thinking the faction that excessively ganks lowbies is the one that's better at PvP. You can't hone your skills in fighting equals by fighting lowbies.
---
I don't understand the hate. I think this is great. It's no different than a temperature map on the weather channel.
---
Staves are pretty good for warriors at lower levels because they have high dps and are slow and that is what you want in a weapon. Would I roll on it over a caster? Probably not, but if you don't need it I will pick it up and use it.
---
My advice would be farm Sunken Temple until about level 52-53. It’s good XP and some pretty good loot in there. (Obviously do your quests or what not in between runs.) when you hit 52-53, farm BRD arena runs until about 55-56 where you can start finishing BRD. Once you hit about 58-59, you can start farming Scholo and if youre lucky Strat Live/UD. A lot of great gear drops out of these dungeons. As far as LBRS and UBRS go, as a rogue, UBRS is huge for me. But i’m not sure what level you should wait to go into those. Hope that helped, dude.
---
Do not spec SM/Ruin for leveling because you can't even get ruin until 60, so it is silly not to spend 1 point grabbing dark pact for an incredibly enormous efficiency boost.
---
On my Tauren Druid, I found vastly superior pants on one of the harpies in the Barrens. Didn't think to preview them. Same cut-off daisy dukes. Needless to say I vendored them and went back to my old ones.
---
Yeah, I mean if the upgrades in the run are mostly boe to some class for some reason, that class should just get screwed while the other players rake in hose upgrades they get as bops and then roll on the other guys upgrades too, just because they can.   That’s fair.
---
Anyone who says they can’t tell the difference between an old school player  and an entitled millenial are blind as fuck.
---
I'm trying it now. Thank you for the help.
---
i play a druid and nobody has ever wanted me to heal. i always get to tank
---
I couldn't get anyone to bite on even 8g for the shoulders or bow. The axe is on the AH for 4g
---
I couldn't possibly bring myself to care that much over lv30 loot, but he's correct that a DPS caster will replace that with the dagger and OH. 
---
And, maybe I'm out of the loop here, but since when did mages want Spr?
---
They're never outside the 5sec rule in combat, and out of combat their Spr regen is among the lowest because they get free food +drink. Do mages actually wait for regen in the world? I usually see them dump mana and drink.
---
I think my favorite part is where you must have mind controlled without being able to clearly warn her what you were going to do. Like “Hey, please please please don’t take this the wrong way... but...” *MC*!
---
If you're going alliance and like a little rp then grobbulus is great. Horde is starting to get more populated, but it's still pretty close to 50/50 and could use more alliance to balance it.

Good job. Hordes are (almost) all dipshits; they deserve all of it.

Nymph is an early game legend on Myz. Made my Wolfshead helm and hopefully will be commissioned to make my Devilsaur stuff someday soon.
---
don’t stress too much rn. focus only getting 55+ so you can start running end game dungeons for gear. look up where to get your pre-raid BiS and once you hit the appropriate level start grinding those dungeons out bc there’s a ton of competition right now for Pre raid BiS

It’s my third time leveling up a priest in 16 years. I’m now level 38 currently running a Shadow/Disc split (really only 5 points in wand specialization).  You really can’t go wrong with any of the spec’s as long as you have Spirit Tap and Wand Specializaton. I’ve done Holy/Disc (using smite build) &amp; Disc/Shadow (using sustain build). They all have a relatively decent speed in leveling. And sadly, yes lots of wanding to maintain that mana pool no matter which way you go. But, the wand gets phased out around level 40 as you get better Spirit stats from your gear and the spells become more efficient. Good luck out there and enjoy the ride! ~Bagels
---
It wouldnt matter if 20 mobs got pulled on you in Retail since you basically aoe down packs of 6 as every class
---
Uh, what? Takes no time. You go there when you have a mount is just a quick run through Duskwood.
---
They do cus I'm horde and my hearth is kargath
---
I mean just blacklist him. Talk to Asmon and see what he says if he doesn't take action just assume that the whole Guild olympus is a bunch on ninja looters and never play with them again, make the other players aware of this.  
---
But again, you need to see what is the position of the guild leader.
---
Was doing 25 man Naxx with a mixed guild group.  Inevitable Defeat dropped and a warrior from one of the guest guilds essentially ninja'd it from the DK's that wanted it for tanking.
---
Dude got the riot actcread to him by his guild and a GM was able to transfer it to the appropriate DK that should have won.
---
[I see you changed your message from "a few days" to "a few weeks](https://i.imgur.com/mTLzZvB.jpg)", most people who moan about him havent watched him for months, or at all..

&gt;How did that even manage to get out of your brain and into a reddit comment?

Not sure why you don't know the answer... it's reddit...? people say dumb stuff all day long here.

It's literally one button on the keyboard.  If that's harder for someone than taking a picture on their phone then I don't think they should be allowed to operate a computer.

if you cant understand the context clues for leveling bis vs endgame bis, i question your intelligence. some leveling weapons last 10+ levels.

bis literally just means best in slot, its not final piece forever exclusive
---
If retail was worth playing then people would be playing it. Idk how youre failing to understand that. If retail was good then people wouldnt be playing classic and while yes classic will pull some from retail, it wont take them long to catch up when they return to it, if they choose to return. Again, its blizzard's job, to release a quality product that is worthy of people's money.
---
I live in Canada. Is it against the NALA too?
---
Yeah but whatever guide these guys use tells them not to go there.
---
It's easily accessible, covers levels 28 to 42, has good drops for earning gold, has a high density of mobs, gives good exp, each wing is short and straightforward, and the mobs are simple and mostly nonthreatening (no cc, no huge burst damage, no aoe, no serious debuffs).
---
I just moved from Stalagg to Heartseeker due to the imbalance. It seems very alliance heavy and active. Can't vouch too much for LFG as I just switched but it seems very active.

This happened to me in Desolace the other day. I just barely made it to shore with a sliver of health after being chased by a couple naga, only for a dwarf to run past and hit me once, killing me.

Dude it’s pretty simple, I already explained this. Your clearly just looking for reasons to act like it doesn’t make sense, even though I’m pretty sure you understand why it does.

Noob here. Can priests only be healers? Are shadow priests DPS, or are they still healers too? I kinda wanna roll a priest and the shadow form looks cool but don’t wanna get stuck healing.
---
Is there any advantage to doing all the homing beacon quests?
---
Roll for chests. It's simple. I've had some rogues needing on lockboxes, and they have (after ignoring the rest of the group telling them to stop) just been kicked and placed on the ignore list.  
---
Blacksmiths can make skeleton keys, I do that and offer to open chests for pugs for whoever wins the roll. It's called being a team player. I'd readily replace a rogue who just ninjas chests.

Playing as a pacifist on a pvp server is hard. It's a different kind of challenge. I never attack first. I fight only to defend myself or to help someone else being attacked. I never attack someone just because they are lower level, low on health, alone etc. I've been killed so many times for no reason. I've been killed by people who are many levels higher than me, I've been killed when outnumbered, I've been killed when fighting mobs. Was I angry? Of course. Did I want revenge? Most of the time. But it only made me more sure of my choice. If those kind of players change my way, and I start attacking people who have no chance to fight back for no reason just because someone did that to me, I loose and they win. They just make me one more of them. So whenever I see an opposite side player low on health and chased by mobs, I stop and save his life. They always thank me. I like to help them, It makes me happy and it makes them happy. Noone is angry. Every "thank you" I get makes me forget about this group of higher lvl players that killed me 5 times in a row, instead, it makes me remember that one guy who did that for me, when I was so sure that I'm dead, and I lived. We exist on both sides, and we must stay strong, cause we are few. And yes, I've been mocked by my side for this kind of attitude on a pvp server. Mocking also won't change my ways. Stay strong, u/MiniMackeroni you just slipped, it happens. But don't let them make you become just like them.
---
This! especially with lower level dungeons.
---
Chances are if you roll with a priest they're running wand spec anyways.  They can DPS and top you up and not have to worry about anything.
---
I have a pocket priest who heals me through instances as we level, we had a mage going on about how they had to AOE to get their sweet dps up and without it we were going to go too slow. The stupid part was my bear tank was top, the priest was second in the DPS meters even with them AOE spamming
---
This makes a lot of sense. I might actually do that.
---
ye hu cres bout wut it luks like rite? i meen y bothr with presntation longs it gets pont acrs who crs amirite? dnt spnd xtra tim
---
DONT TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE!
---
Alliance side you have bonebiter which you can get by 36ish, not sure the horde have an equivalent quest item to that.  You have excaliboar from rfd both sides can grab.  Ravager also in there but wasn't talking about that as it has no stats so not as good on single targets but nice for aoe.
---
After they get that message, the next one:
---
"You have been removed from group"
---
Won't that switch stances unnecessarily an dkeep you out of berserker?
---
Glad to hear! You can keybind your sets which is fine, but if you can find a way to put them on your action bars please let me know.

I've made it to 50 as a Disc Priest with out respeccing but now grinding quest in Blasted Lands, or really anywhere with yellow creatures, has become a real slog. Finding groups during my play time has gotten significantly more difficult after grinding many ZF groups. Ive gotten ST and Mara done once each. 
---
All I have to look forward to is BRD into end game dungeons at this point. I am not sure if questing will pick up soon because it seems crushingly scattered at the moment. 
---
Should I waste my cheap respec going shadow for 5 levels? My plan was to stay disc till 58/60 then respec for a PvE focused Disc instead of leveling talents. 
---
I am hoping 51/52  Ungoro and Burning Steppes will be easier to quest in.

&gt; It's much more useful to the person that needs the upgrade. 
---
No, it's not, if you need truefaith pattern, getting the pattern represents the exact same 90g it does if you don't need it.
---
&gt; Also not fair to them that they then have to run the instance however many more times till it drops again.
---
They don't have to, they could simply just buy the item.
---
Let me flip that around, is it fair to the person who bought the item  to see someone else get prio on it?
---
Yes you should have, as stated my comment are based on the info you provided. This is a unique situation in the gaming world, There is a huge game knowledge imbalance among players. there are elitest vetrans all the way to newbies that were in diapers when WoW came out. As the Vetrans it is upon us to nurture and culture the new players, We do this by assuming everyone is clueless and breaking it down so there is no confusion. If a person cant take the time to communicate and work together as a grioup then Retail may be a better option.
---
We've had whole rooms pull in dungeons for no apparent reason. Packs that are absolutely nowhere near us will start running at us and bring everything nearby
---
Happened in lbrs and stratholme in the past few days
---
Many people myself included have never used reddit on a desktop.  If I couldn't browse on mobile I wouldnt use the site.
---
Locked chests contains greens, blues or epics. Nodes / Leather are professions only. If Blacksmithing plans drop, a BS can need on them. If two miners are in a group, they /roll for nodes, or take turns.  
---
Your comparison makes no sense.
---
A lot of people have never used reddit on a desktop.
---
I assume they think that it's long enough range that they can't just walk 6 steps away and range it.

If he is 60 he can solo it on a shaman.  I farmed this up before I started raiding on my shaman in vanilla.

🤘
---
I was killing mobs for an hour grinding xp and decided to invite a couple people for a quest In the area. After I invited them I decided to kill things while I waited for them to get there. The very first thing I pulled dropped that staff and I lost the roll. I’m not bitter about it though. I’m NOT BITTER ABOUT IT!!!!

Pretty sure you can get TellMeWhen for classic!

I think thrash blade will replace it but it's good for the forties at least.
---
Are you on Whitemane? If so I was just doing BRD runs with you the other night with a group of gnomes haha
---
Besides playing all the time, how did you farm so much gold?
---
Thats a bad rule of thumb. Especially pre-60. Holy paladins as the other commentor mentions is the best example but shamans and druids have the same issues. A cloth piece with strength and agility is totally irrelevant to a priest past the armor rating. Are we gonna equate +5 armor for the priest to, say +2 str and agil on a rogue? Obviously the rouge gets far more out of that
---
They definitely are for PvE, unless completely geared out, but they are particularly good at farming Mara because it's outdoor. Princess can be rooted and focused down from range.
---
Many people, myself included, never use reddit on a desktop
---
It’s funny. MMO-Champion says “Yes ninja looting! It’s okay and you’ll never be blacklisted and only babies will care! No one would ever go out of their way to post anything about a bad player anyway.”

they sell fast and always fluxutate. you can easily make a 50 silver to a gold by just simply reposting auctions. you invest in a hundred of them you just made a 100 gold by simply clicking a few times
---
Clearly you are confused about how reputation really works
---
What's the next great 2h weapon for warriors after WW axe and ravager? Hit 50 now and think it's time to upgrade
---
Giving the "modern" version of shadow meld and every man for himself would go a long way, if they were to do classic+.
---
I usually give 6 stacks of water too which comes out to about 5g value (from memory may not be exact) at lvl 45 water. I never charge but most people tip 1g because they understand this.
---
no i meant competing with your own faction for the devilsaurs
---
I choose warlock. My main right now is warrior but created a warlock alt. Why? Because it’s extremely easy to level with one hand playing and the other hand cradling a baby to sleep. When baby cries and needs to bed held then out comes the warlock alt. Loving it so far!
---
As someone who got a priest to 60 this is they way I see it, if I'm there as a healer I get first dib on any healer gear, second are druids/paladins who are tanking but know they have to got resto/holy and third are druid/paladins/shaman that are going as dps.       
---
        
---
If the healer is a druid/shaman/pally the get second dib on tanking gear and can roll on dps items same as the dps.
---
If the tank is a druid/pally they get second dib on healing gear and can roll on dps gear same as the dps.        
---
Oh and dps warriors get second dib on tanking gear if the tank is a warrior/paladin.
---
As a 60 priest now I need to put together an int set to be able to farm (right now lvl 58 mobs are hard because healing gear is shit for farming) but I get second dib to mages/locks since we aren't leveling anymore.
---
Haha nah I am on  Blaumeux. There must be another Gnomiehomie out there!
---
Is that an accented i or a real i? It makes all the difference
---
Shadow priest is a DPS. You even cannot heal in shadow form
---
But this doesnt predictably annoy people based on the number of upvotes these posts get
---
Just got a lucky Night Watch Shortsword. Was that a popular twink item? I'm wondering if I should put it on the AH right away or if I should wait for twink items to be in demand.
---
https://youtu.be/DQjnP4XnBJ4 here you go! No mount either 💖 hope you enjoy!
---
&gt; Which you should never prefer to ranged if we’re talking optimality.
---
Oh my fucking god, how many times do I need to tell you, I'm not prefering it TO ranged, I'm prefering it IN ADDITION TO.
---
Why would you stay and wank at range when you can go melee, do something and and be back at range before you had the ability to do anything at range?
---
As long as they are up front about it gear rolling intentions, that’s fine.  But if you’re looking for a healer, a paladin says they will then all of a sudden starts rolling on healing, dps and tank gear; that’s a problem.
---
I mean all the transport in the game is driverless until in the future when a big dragon breaks the world
---
if you're not going to let the tank pickup the mobs then you're better off with another DPS. 
---
What you're saying is hugely dependent on group makeup and level. 
---
And as i said in the other post. If you run a priest who's wand spec you can get better DPS with 5 people, the priest only tops up the tank then wands the rest of the time. The time you "lose" getting into good habits in instances doesnt actually add up to much
---
This is exactly what I've been wondering--how long does the fight have to last for the trade off to pay out? I'm was guessing mostly in dungeons, but couldn't figure if it was better to go SoCr for long fights. I'm not realizing it probably doesn't even matter since I'll be healing in dungeons most of the time. Looks like I'll just keep popping SoCr first on mobs and hitting them with SoR after.
---
So a cheating, whiny, cringe inducing loud mouth has an officer just like him, that you ran with, and your surprised he stole from you?
---
Educate me then.
---
Thanks, sons dying now.
---
Gnomiehomie never misses leg day.
---
everyone who plays on that server is fcuked ... streamer servers are cancer...
---
You are making the claim that it is against the TOS, so you should come up with it. And you are refering to the old TOS which is clearly not applicable anymore.
---
I think that depends on the group and should be discussed before the run.  If it were me, I would prioritize the ring for the guy who needs it since that's ALL he needs, whereas you need MOST of the gear from the instance.  That being said, totally clearing a loot table for a low-level instance like WC isn't all that common.  What I laid out above was more how we did it with raids back in Vanilla, so unless your buddy who wants the ring is trying to twink or something, the loot table for non-endgame instances can be treated as FFA in most cases, especially PUGs
---
I hate you since 2006...
---
Interesting, cool. Are people disappointed when a priest joins party as DPS though? Or if I’m shadow I’m good?
---
[https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/)
---
I think you may find the above resource helpful in the future.
---
Weapons skills is a skill that must be leveled, so is defence. I am hereby charging all of my groups for my tanking efforts.  
---
Your argument is dumb as fuck.
---
He was probably a crisis actor anyway
---
I know that. Gl not healing for 5-10 sec in 40+ content tho. In lower dungeons u can regen but otherwise not. 
---
I am still gonna drink to 100% or close to it if I bring my own water. Otherwise I will spend twice as many drinks and they actually start to cost some gold later.
---
They've been going for around 250 on Kurinnax.
---
24 hour respawn timer on him,  nice find
---
Ye ye in Germany we just call it holland 
---
The npc being called holland is an additional weed reference either way
---
I was doing exactly what it told me to do. But this was also my first experience into classic.
---
&gt; Because while int and spirit do nothing for them
---
false, spirit gives smaller downtime
---
Yeah no problem with that. That's not the issue here though.
---
It's generally not ideal to have two characters with the same profession, but there are exclusive Priest/Mage items that do make it worthwhile. 
---
Mage/Priest BiS Chest requires Tailoring, so if you're going for that, grab tailoring and you won't be disappointed.
---
Herbalism + Alchemy is great, as both your priest and mage will need potions. 
---
Otherwise, Engineering + Mining is a lot of fun.
---
Well, some do, but meh. Lol and agreed, play how it's fun for you.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
Saying that is calling people who *do* engage in the behavior worthless assholes by implication.
---
As a healer I give no fucks. Someone wants to be an ass, self heal. Don’t like me? Spend the next 20min looking for a new healer lol
---
420, 69, 69.  Lol
---
A lot of pug healers I run with think that they need to keep me at 100% at all times, even if it is one mob that I can probably solo. Heal when you need to heal me.
---
100% agree here. I usually pull packs when healers have like 1/2 mana and are currently drinking. By the time mobs are in position the healer is at full if he decided to keep drinking.
---
Can never have enough pictures of cats on desks or your level 15 character waiting for the boat amirite
---
He wasn't open to discussion. This certainly makes it seem likely he knew what he was doing. He ignored and tried to immediately put it behind us. You seem to be trying to apply a "new players dont know" thought process to the situation when him not acknowledging our protests implies the opposite.
---
!RemindMe 7 days
---
For the love of god, fix 'The Grand Masquerade'. Its funny the first couple times it glitches out and Bolvar perpetually fights air or Prestor stays transformed as Onyxia, but the 3rd, 4th, 5th+ times, it's just a massive waste of time.
---
Stumbled on these a few weeks ago and fell in love.
---
The shaman WF attack in the leveling video murdered me.
---
Eyes of the Beast used to work back in the day but in the modern Classic they teleport right back to you when you tell them to Stay after positioning them down the jump. :(
---
I've had better luck putting it at the edge of the cliff I jump off of then casting it or just making it warp to me if I'm lucky with putting it on passive and alternating Stay and Follow.
---
Look up the rest of the NE quests and do them. You can't get to exalted but you can seriously reduce the amount of grind you have to do later.
---
The morrow grain quest is a repeatable turn in at lvl 50 ish. You have to collect un'goro soil by running around the zone and clicking on piles. Then buy seed packets and cultivate one every 10 min. Its like a 50% chance to get 1-3 morrow grain. The benefit is the sack of potions you get with the 50 rep. 
---
The fastest way is to just farm gold and buy cheap runecloth to turn in for 50 rep per stack. Lets be generous and you got every stack for 1g. that's 420g for non-humans to get from revered to exalted and 382g for humans.
---
Wicked 😀
---
stop giving the neckbeard more attention lmao
---
*Laughs in mage*
---
He just sold them now live on twitch
---
Your elf is so cute
---
I see. What is BiS? I've never understood what it is..
---
Did half of Naxx before TBC and we played with PvP specs, no one knew shit about optimizing gear. Like dude, it's not hard.
---
I know im not a moderator, this is brigading absolutely you fucking donut
---
IMO, its a bit of a dick move. I played back in the day and had a decent amount of leather for my DPS set, but i only every took if not needed.
---
Only if you shake my chemtrail covered hand at the end
---
Played vanilla when you didn't even know what internet was.
---
Yes it does. You are obviously not being intellectually honest here.
---
How to aoe Farm this good?!
---
Noob question: how do you grind rep with another race faction apart from zon quests?
---
Hell yea brother! I got my chain at level 52, my first run of BRD in classic too
---
there's no BiS leather for warriors
---
You said it, not me
---
ElvUI
---
I just jump cause I'm bored
---
Luna unit frames is great. 
---
With that u can see how much u will heal each person every time u cast a healing spell too.
---
Okay, how do you know when they fluctuate down and up?
---
I mean I ninja looted the "battered hilt" in ICC and its' why I'm still raiding today. Wouldn't have gotten into raiding with out that item.
---
Unfortunately this is because mobs aggro healers, as soon as you heal, you generate threat and any monsters that aren't managed will go straight to you.
---
The only real way around this is to wait until your tank has a had a chance to generate a bit of threat, then start healing. If you've already pulled aggro, the best thing is generally to run back to the tank so he can get it back again, toss a shield on yourself and run towards him. 
---
Failing that, the casters/DPS at the back should be pulling mobs off you.
---
Necrosis is amazing
---
STITCHES WANT TO PLAY
---
Best In Slot (BIS)
---
Best in Slot look up you're bis items and collect them, or near BiS alternatives.
---
the most hardcore raiders take tailoring until they get their BiS robe, drop it and pick up engineering for added dps.
---
A mount?! Nice job grats!
---
Yeah but better aoe farming with staff so I wouldn't say healer only.
---
Ah yes, additional tip #2 - spool up your hyperdrive and be finished in 20 minutes.
---
Even when I'm outnumbered.  Obviously I favour scenarios where I have the tactical advantage but its a pvp video game lol.  Yes I pvp.
---
Or a female night elf?
---
If you think you can hide your passive-aggression behind flimsy word-choice phrasing, good luck trying to pull that off. Have a good day.
---
Sorry you’ve been so helpful, but if I have 38 Spider can i train him on lvl 8 mobs in Thunder bluff to learn the bite so to speak. As you mentioned before he’ll need to battle until i learn bite 5 for my other pet
---
A lot of pug healers are dreadful, don't dps and don't manage mana well at all. It's still fine to clear the dungeon, but mildly frustrating.
---
Absolutely spot-on with the 100% health. A 50% health fatty still has more reserves than anyone else in the group and a bunch of tools to survive.
---
Horlock?! I think I gave you water on the Earthfury realm at Colonel Kurzens camp! Gratz!
---
--Trixy, Earthfury
---
Blackstone ring from princess is what im working on for my fury war, not sure if it's BiS for hunters but it looks like it from the amount looking for it
---
This reminds me of a story I once heard of a paladin who let his hunger for revenge consume him. I can't quite remember his name... Arthur? Artemis? Anthony? Who knows
---
I just stopped playing classic wow because the community are a bunch of bitter guys who never get laid, toxic as fuck and absolutely no community spirit
---
If you mean while DPSing it is because Mind Blast gives off crazy agro on the meter.
---
Send her leather shoes. Tell her it's kinky. Laugh when she can only wear cloth.
---
*Don't start what you can't finish, short-stack...*
---
Razorfen Downs has a few items you may want as well as great exp. the dagger and shoulders are nice, along with the random enchant leather gloves that drop from the first boss.
---
My poor undead warlock has this problem rn. Under his robes he has a nice green rarity "ancestral pants" dropped from Barrens that has some nice stats....but its booty shorts like OP. It hurts but hillarious.
---
The expression on his face is amazing, great work
---
Gotcha. Dreamweave after shadow weave. Ty.
---
Ahahahahaha
---
It’s worth it 😁👍🏻
---
You’re the one getting worked up over a turn of phrase. Clearly not trying to hide the fact that I don’t like lazy screenshotters, I think they’re lazy and group them with people who refuse to use good grammar even when they know better and aren’t on a phone keyboard.
---
Hope your day gets better.
---
How dare you play something different than the optimal spec established by epic streamers?
---
I'm sorry bro, but if you think there's no difference between being permanently grounded and being able to fly directly to each destination without even being seen... you're wrong.
---
That’s what warlocks are in classic and really just classic in general. 
---
Playstyles are going to feel stale compared to retail, it’s one of the few things that did actually get better over the years IMO.
---
If need be I plan to tab dot which is probably even better.
---
This is it in a nutshell.  I feel like a good portion of us playing classic also played Vanilla, so we are in our mid 20's and onward at this point.  I felt bad that mt druid is only level 18, but then I remembered I have a job, and a wife, and a house and shit now.  Can't play 4 hours a night anymore.
---
yes but it is lvl dependent and exponentialy less optimum as you lvl. While still effective 5 lvls in and better than most greens, it will usually have an equivalent if not better piece available. Also the nature of classic is specialization of class and stat. This all plays into what is defined as best gear in slot. Lvling play is too subjective of a playstlye to say any gear is best for lvling, Bet you didnt know that when lvling weapons skills, it is best to put on full intellect gear regardless of class. As i stated, the term can only apply semantically and logically to a static lvl play style. One note to endgame BiS, It is subject to phase releade as new gear will drop
---
I wish they would also remove the option to roll need on gear your class can never equip
---
Not true
---
R OMEGALUL Y
---
Eating a debuff slot that could be used for something useful to the raid with your barman's because you want those 3 extra dps on the meters is still pretty stupid though.
---
Him investing the money implies he would need to play the AH because there's no stocks or funds to invest in WoW, as far as I know. Playing the AH takes effort. 
---
If he doesn't want to put in the effort and doesn't need the gold right now, keeping the item is better than selling it.
---
Wow upvoted for visibility. Would be shitty if this isn’t fixed before AQ40
---
This as awesome. Subbed right away!
---
On leveling you can still heal with shadow talents. You will just not go in shadow. Late game every raid will have a spot for one two shadow priests.
---
It’s not viable.  It’s half assing a broken system without learning how to play your class as you level.
---
The only thing your doing is giving into temporary instant gratification just to be bored later on when you can’t play right, and piss other people off by wasting their time.
---
You simplify the equation, “howto be as bad a player as possible “ into  imma  “cleave”.
---
Kill it with fire
---
What realm is this? I feel like we need a list
---
Your goal is pvp, dwarf is hands down the better option.   Can you do fine as human?  Yes.  Fear ward alone is amazing then add in stoneform and human just can't compare at all pvp wise.  Pve you can make an argument for human off the increased spirit for better heals and better regen for longer fights but that won't matter for a long time. 
---
If pvp is your goal I would reroll dwarf.  Lvl 30 isn't that far in and you won't have that regret always lingering.
---
Hello fellow Belgian! I enjoyed reading your work! Keep it up!
---
Was about to say. First time wow player here and I dismiss my pet and he still comes back happy :D
---
Hahaaha😂
---
As a shaman i feel attacked.
---
They are single target caster dps. No AoE to offer. They will get into dungeon groups but while leveling most people will want priests to heal just like they want warriors to tank. Mind Blast is a big spell in a Spriests arsenal but at low levels causes a lot of agro that messes with tanks.
---
Our warriorgotn hand of Justice with a 4. Only 3 people but still
---
All OP has to do is show them proof which he'd havr plenty off, at least flight passes. But if he wont...then well..
---
That was me!
---
Just did an uldamon run... i charged in and hit sunder, our rogue hit the mob to my left, mage hit the mob to my right... pulled them away before i even had rage to thunderclap.  I should just roll dps.  Tanking is not fun.  :/
---
I still get the communities out rage... like clearly just avoid that server.  It's gonna have ass players on it from asmon's stream and it's gonna have an ass queue time because streamers... just avoid it.
---
You can tank all dungeons with a normal feral leveling spec
---
No you blame the guy that is an asshole
---
God forbid someone plays the game to have fun!
---
All good twink BoEs usually get also need rolled by everyone.
---
every server is different.
---
If a piece of gear is BiS for two different classes they can both roll on it if it drops.
---
Your logic is leaving me dumbfounded
---
Psychic Scream?
---
Buddy, seek help immediately.
---
Again, I don't really care for greens/blues since they're just vendor trash to me. If someone needs them by all means, but I don't care if someone ninjas a green since it's pennies in the long run. 
---
But a 400g+ Epic? Fuck no I'm not passing up on that.
---
If a non rage user has aggro and is not likely to lose it soon, shield him. For rage users use shield as a buffer if you think you won't get a heal through in time.
---
Shielded damage doesn't generate rage, so warris and bears are usually not too happy with them, but it's still super nice as an oh shit button.
---
Dunno.  I'd have to google it tbh.
---
As a healer fuck them, a new tank willing to learn is worth their weight in gold
---
They drop so often, they're essentially worth it. In fact, the cost to sent that mail would've have been more than a single one is worth.
---
Yup, put it better than I did,
---
Honestly, anyone who is gullible enough to roll greed on an expensive BoE is an idiot. When someone yells "all greed", you immediately say, "no, everyone need". The end. No ninja looting happens and whoever gets it, gets it. The default has been Need all BoEs of any value since Vanilla, and anyone who doesn't follow that rule or allows themselves to be tricked is an idiot I have no sympathy for.
---
I'm not saying don't point him out, he deserves to be known and blacklisted. I'm just saying that they held their purse out and closed their eyes waiting for him to run by and snatch it.
---
How is the best comment the least upvoted one? You nailed it. I think changing your leveling route to reduce the hardcore rune cloth farm at 60 is a lot more fun to do.
---
Back in Diablo II: LoD days, there was a twink community but they were called LLDs (low level dueler).
---
9-30 was the bracket and it was a great community full of rivalry and friendships.
---
I miss those days.
---
Some people play the victim any chance they get.
---
Reflection in screen?
---
Playing on a mobile phone?
---
The story probably: This prick accidentally hit need on my BiS gear in wailing caverns
---
This guy complains about sjws when he stubs his toe.
---
I mean they already have employed GM:s, would be nice to see them do their job. Your nickname is pretty simliar to one of the guys engaging in such behaviour though, go figure.
---
Big oof
---
Imo it doesn't matter what role you're playing in the dungeon currently, because that's not always what you're doing, you're just doing what you need to do to make the team work at the moment.  I end up tanking a lot out of necessity but I'm a dps warrior.  I'm not going to pass on dps gear just because I was playing the tank roll in the dungeon at that time when it happened to drop.  Same goes for any other class that plays multiple roles.  They may not even be playing their main spec right then.
---
Mograine
---
Gnomiehomie likes to party
---
&gt; It's definitely a huge misunderstanding that there's not enough quests in Classic.
---
Pretty sure I read this part of your comment just right. Your follow-up contradicts your opening line.
---
Unless he means PRISTINE Black diamonds then no, they are worth jack shit.
---
They go for 1-2s on my server 🤔
---
Zug Zug
---
That's part of the classic experience. You expected something different??
---
Gatorbite Axe or Theradras's Sceptre. Both are from Maraudon.
---
ninja looting depending on server will have your name passed around and youll never find a decent group that will take you. there are consequences for this.
---
I thought classic was built on 1.12... wowhead says that was added in 1.13
---
What addon is that?
---
We aren't talking about "human interaction" in the sense you're talking about, which is every single human interaction across society.
---
We're talking about a highly-specific and deeply-nuanced single issue wherein it benefits everyone involved to maximize the possibility of success while completely negating the potential for total loss.
---
If u follow the link and watch the full video we did go to SW. Smh it's in the title.
---
I had a run where someone made a similar mistake but instead of saying anything in chat, actually ran up to the chest.  Don’t remember how rough that fight was since the group wasn’t ready for the pull but we did manage to win it.
---
Could you elaborate how that Works?
---
How does getting a should Speed up levelling? And fel domination has 15min CD doesnt it?
---
This is pretty cringe.
---
Questing at the end gets pretty tough and time-consuming.  You're going to end up in the slog for a bit starting around level 50.  Ungoro will be a bit of a pickup for you, though, since the quests are packed pretty densely and the zone is literally a circle, so looping quest runs are easy there.  
---
You'll hit 60 eventually, just be patient.  55-60 in vanilla was a tough grind.
---
They can. Plenty of videos out on that
---
That reminds me to go fishing
---
ud?
---
That’s real cold though needing a spellpower dagger against casters, goddamn
---
Woah there son.
---
Looks like somebody needs a snack, have a banana 🍌
---
But if I unlearn tailoring, do I need to start at lvl 1 again when i decide to pick it up later?
---
”Mald”?
---
I keybinded the skull marker so with one key I can mark the mob I want people to focus. It’s not totally noob proof, but it helps.
---
you need to kill one of the red dragons in Grim Batol for the quest to attune to either UBRS or Ony, I can't remember which off hand
---
„Those kind of players“
---
You mean people who roll on a pvp server and actually like to engage in world pvp?
---
Oh for sure, it's all about knowing if its faster to blow your mana pool or do a Flamestrike into CoC and frostbolts to sit around 50% mana for a quicker next pull
---
Don't woosh my man, that is actually really helpful info
---
Don't cast aspersions when the particulars of the issue are directly analogous to those in the most basic level of game theory.
---
As a healer I concur. Please run to the tank.
---
Outbrained...
---
You might have outleveled it a little bit but there’s a special tailoring trainer near the warlocks in Stormwind/Undercity that teaches you Shadoweave recipes. It might be way below level for you but honestly raw shadow/spell damage is more impactful than straight int/stam gear. Also might consider the dreamweave pieces you can make as well at around 250 from the master tailor trainer.
---
Part of the threat such as the shamans actions you described are not your issue, it’s theirs. Burst, especially immediate, is bad form for dps. Obviously a proc can happen but a shock should then not follow. Keep this in mind and keep up the tanking!
---
"raders"
---
Nah it is in this version, but I'm retarded and have been reading the alliance version of the quest instead of the horde. So thanks for making me realize that indirectly. Solved :D
---
Westfall, Redridge, Loch Modan, Darkshore; start considering Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountains, Hillsbrad Foothills, and Thousand Needles around level 25.
---
It's just a quick run through dusk wood, took me the same as running from crossroads to TB. Besides you have to go there for artisan fishing
---
I used Illusionary Rod on my mage until the early-mid 50s (Zumrah's didnt drop at all)
---
All the little kid fans are still going to love him.
---
Nice repost
---
Try Redridge
---
I mean he's not wrong. If you have problems with certain words being spelled by skeleton bodies in a video game.... How do you even get by in life with real issues... It's a non issue.
---
Maybe a phase 2 date. Don't need or expect much more honestly.
---
The content may be 15 years old but some have never seen it before, making it "new" content for them
---
So you understand exactly why but don’t agree with it, so you throw a fit and and act like it doesn’t make sense that everyone doesn’t play the same way as you?
---
Cmon man, your acting like my little nephew.
---
Exactly man, fucking weird to see people out here saying that the system is better in BfA. Like I can't even begin to understand the logic  of defending forced personal loot.
---
Thank you, mate!
---
Not everyone has a printer
---
I run normal SM groups nearly back to back for hours with no problems on Kurinaxx
---
I tried Item Rack a few weeks ago but couldn’t figure out how to actually bind a gear set swap to a key. As far as could tell there were just a bunch of conditionals I could assign but I couldn’t see any way to manually initiate a gear swap. Do you know what I might have been missing?
---
He Just Brought the An Epic Mount with Money From Them [https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearEncouragingPlumCoolCat](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearEncouragingPlumCoolCat)
---
Convert to keyboard turning, tab targeting and use your number pad for your abilities if you’re just leveling. Only really need to move away from it when you reach endgame or pvp
---
And yet you're clearly upset.
---
Oh how I remember, but I think when I was a kid playing I brushed it off more and now I just wanna strangle people 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
but if he runs it 12 more times he will have like 8 chances  to get it before he can even use it
---
You call it easy mode, I call it uninterrupted gameplay.
---
On my server the regular (green) black diamonds are going for 50 **COPPERS**. I've found it ridiculous people are actually selling them at all when they realize they aren't even worth a silver. I've bought 4 for my librams, each for 50c.
---
Nice! 2g vendor! :-)
---
&gt; Warlock DPS is lowest DPS until naxx. Still great class with nice utility. But if warlocks are out DPSing hunters, warriors, rogues, and mages then something is wrong.
---
Must be, GOD FORBID, there's actual good warlocks out there...
---
[ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org/classic-addons.php?id=2) is also an excellent UI addon.  Used it for years - sleek, non-distracting bar management with tons of customization.
---
Imagine thinking that this is funny....
---
Also, TIL having 400 gold is being "rich".
---
If you can pull off a poly on the lock then it's worth going for the felhunter kill
---
&gt; so you throw a fit
---
LMAO

I feel like you need to know spirit is also for hp/mana regen out of combat, it’s definitely a quality of life thing for mages while leveling out in the world.
---
Everyone is replaceable except a MT that was funneled gear.
---
Whatever your main damage source is it self your main damage source. If you are stupid and go in to make attack as a warlock your main damage is from your melle attacks and you can get fairly good dps numbers if you also dot the target up. Boom a hybrid class right there.
---
+2 Hot Pants of RePheaelyn
---
&gt;And it doesn’t have way more damage LOL. It’s trading 1% hit from blackcrow for 1 agility and 1 DPS. You’re never gonna win the debate that 1% hit is worse than 1 agility and 1 dps for anyone but hardcore min maxers that never set foot in MC.
---
Carapace: 82-124 damage, at 3.30 speed
---
Blackcrow at 77-117 damage at 3.20 speed. Hunter rotation does not favor having 3.2 over 3.3 speed, so the speed is a nonfactor. That means on average 6 damage more per hit, which is way more than having the extra hit.
---
It is way easier to farm 700g. How long have you been farming for rend runs? I've spent over 20 hours. I make over 50g per hour, if I could have bought a flurry + deepwounds as a rogue I would have every time.
---
&gt;If the tank is a druid/pally they get second dib on healing gear and can roll on dps gear same as the dps.
---
Now imagine the druid/pally intended to go as healer but you were unable to find a tank. I'd be pissed if I wasn't allowed to roll on healing gear.
---
They are worth about 50 copper mate. Your pen pal has no clue about this game it seems.
---
Yes. Phase 2 is just for making 50+ leveling zones a bloodbath
---
Could you imagine a show with this style and the Warcraft  universe?
---
It would kick so much ass.
---
That sounds like an awfully easy way of "laundering" stolen goods. Just sell them to your friend with lower value. Later on your friend can give the item back or sell it on proper value and give you the money.
---
You should NOT wait to discuss loot rules until the run starts. That really pisses people off. You can clarify it during the run but you should be upfront with people while recruiting.
---
So if one drops that nobody in the group can use it can go to them in a guild or via the auction house. :p
---
I can be obstinate too.
---
Really though, if I’m with a group of people I know well or have pugged with a bunch and a staff of Jordan drops, I’d love the caster who can use it get it. It’s a great moment.
---
If it’s full randoms, who I’ve never played with before, I’ll need to avoid gold digging ninjas.
---
If nobody can use it and it’s not a guild group, off to the ah it goes. If it’s a guild group I’ll find someone in guild who can equip it. I've also done the raid BoEs go need MS first and then to the AH to pay for guild repairs, consumables, etc. Depends on the situation.
---
There's a whole crap ton of things you COULD do with BoEs, but I'm of the opinion that "BoE always = gold" is a shit attitude.
---
Cool thanks, cant wait to play :)
---
You won't have to do anything unless was gets declared.
---
*Brroooooowwwwww*
---
What was that?
---
War were declared.
---
No? Most hunter pre raid BiS is leather bud. You were in the wrong, and about to wrongfully shame a guy for being a ninja
---
After reading your other comment reply, I’m not sure that’s possible
---
If someone ninja loots just block them.
---
I love your animations
---
It's a hunter item because he gains the appropriate boosts from it.
---
Paladins/Warriors wear Mail all the time, and Paladins even wear cloth if the stats are appropriate.
---
The problem is with raid lockouts. If you only need that drop from that boss and it gets swapped to ML before the pull, and you don't agree, then they have stolen all the time you committed to getting the raid that far. You aren't able to go back into the raid and kill the rest of the bosses until reset if the group pushes ahead without you. So they take your hours getting there and the rest of the week that you are saved for.
---
We're literally talking about the same thing: it's not against the rules. If you read my post, I also said that.
---
What I added is that if Blizzard wants to stop this because it WAS against the rules in Vanilla, maybe they should draft a new TOS for Classic with the old rules in mind.
---
It is, but I mean a mage with some spirit on his gear will last longer before having to drink (while questing out in the world) and have to drink for a shorter amount of time.
---
Actually I’m fairly sure every class in Classic likes a bit of spirit on their gear while leveling for that extra sustain thanks to better hp/mana regen out of combat.
---
Oh man I had a pair of these drop for my nelf, but it was only one armour point more so I ditched them haha xD
---
So passive aggressive, I love it.
---
I mean assuming each class has optimized their gear correctly, it's true that they're below warriors/mages/rogues until later phases. If you look at raids by the top classic guilds, locks are never seen in the charts in MC. They definitely ramp up to be monsters tho
---
Doxxed
---
You said that there are “literally not enough normal sm quests to bother”, while u/shigg claims to have no issues finding normal groups. 
---
He’s not telling others to grind dungeons, just that its possible to find normal groups.
---
Damn, here I was thinking this was gonna be such a heart warming post.
---
Can’t believe nobody got this. I thought WoW was really popular with the military
---
Pvp servers lul
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=10588
---
Lot's of neat items in classic!
---
Wait what?
---
No, I'm saying he didnt have the item that dropped that was an upgrade to what he had so he needed on the item.
---
That's probably part of the reason then 😉
---
i use them both. each have benifits
---
Probably not a good idea to post this in case you ever piss someone off lol
---
Consecration is more important for very early levels. From my experience (leveled 100% as prot), improved righteous fury makes a huge difference. I wouldn't skip it. This is only annecdotical evidence, so judge by other responses as well
---
^ninja
---
There can be situations where tab targetting is more efficient and situations where it's not. The most efficient way, however, is to use both ways for different situations.
---
Ohhh, you did that
---
Cool idea. I dont think I could do this with my A&amp;T account Nice ROG by the way.. I got the  ROG G752VL.
---
Bear tank is much more viable and accepted than cat dps. Most guilds run a feral tank in current meta just so there's less gear competition.
---
That sounds about right for leveling speed at that level range.  Maybe a little bit slow, but definitely not to the point that you need to revamp your leveling strategy.  Unless you feel like really power-grinding, there's nothing wrong with the way you're leveling.
---
As for the PvP, it's just a fact of life on a PvP server.  I played PvP in vanilla, and didn't hate it, but getting repeatedly ganked in a popular PvP area that also has a good amount of quests gets frustrating.  When I started playing classic, I rolled on a PvE server because I just didn't feel like dealing with the hassle.  Once you get over the 40-45 hump, the world PvP tends to slow down a bit too unless you're on a very PvP focused server.
---
I’m a level 41 elemental Orc Shaman and I’m struggling to kill mages in pvp what are something to learn to get better at pvp in general i guess?
---
Ah. Streamers. I've never understood the appeal.
---
I know lol just being pedantic.
---
I see you absolutely haven't or you're completely garbage at it.
---
Healing or DPS?
---
If you're healing, do you cast renew before pulls? That might get you above the tank on the hit list early in the fight. If you then have to heal the DPSers aggro might bounce around.
---
If you're DPS it's probably due to casting an early mind blast, as that creates extra threat. Early game, i like to just apply sw:p and wand once or twice before starting the chain-smite.
---
Do you really think people are willing to pay that much for each run When you can just ask in lfg or World chat for 5 min max and get the classes you need. Stop giving stupid answers.
---
What does PuG mean?
---
Abundantly clear tysm
---
Ohh sting. guess your just not up to the task or your just a troll
---
Hey, you're on Whitemane aren't you? I've seen you around.
---
Nah spirit is not BIS for hunters leveling lol
---
I dunno mate usually when questing I don't spend 5 seconds between mob pulls to even start regenning mana, til I go oom and sit to drink
---
An alliance totem pole.
---
Idk what people are on about, spriest looked so fucking cool with the angel feather run popping Ms and mb on procs.
---
How does alchemy grt you past guards?
---
Apollo is the best Reddit app.
---
Good things the barrens is crawling with shaman. Tremor totem can carry a bad group through WC.
---
Gross
---
Who cares.
---
an all dawi guild you say? where can i sign up. i must add my grievances to the book of grudges!
---
Hello replaceable dps fuck boy.
---
Probably has to do with the 32 buff cap
---
Purgation Isle: no level
---
It's instinct with some people, I run with some irl friends in discord and I'm always asking "where are you going?  Run to me, I'm not going to chase you."
---
Yeah I tried to make a guild back in my day called “Twinks R Us”...not surprised why I didn’t get a lot of charter signings.
---
The stam buff and fire shield from the imp is pretty useful.
---
He said the complains about ninja looting are out of hand and told everyone in his guilds to stop it or he'll kick them out
---
A few people have asked me that haha. I actually play on  Blaumeux. Must be another Gnomiehomie out there!
---
Well if it's so expensive then why equip instead of selling?
---
Only if you had loot rules said in in-game chat that agreed that item was caster only.
---
People don't have infinite time, if you release two games of the same genre which are both incredibly time consuming most players wont play both, they'll play one or the other. I don't think this will be bad for Blizzards revenue directly - it's the same sub for both games - but 
---
less players means fewer raiders means worse raiding communities for both games.
---
Again, happy to be proven wrong as time goes on.
---
Not sure who the troll is here myself. Just try to enjoy the game and if you’re going to pick a battle, you can do better than “I don’t like how people use this term”.
---
crazy idea maybe you could just also not play the game haha it's almost like the whole point of end game is grinding these dungeons for pre raid BiS.
---
Put it on there neutral AH for less than 55s per 5 and they will get snapped up. I check it pretty consistently and I’m sure others do.
---
Okay and the item that dropped can be turned into a direct upgrade for everyone in the party.
---
Why does the person who happens to be able to equip it get priority?
---
Shadow Word: Pain?
---
You can tank in any spec until like level 55 with warriors.  Just keep upgrading your gear and make sure your action bars for each stance are set up in a way that makes them easy to use and intuitive for you.
---
Also, be ready for the slow grind that is leveling a warrior.  They're top-tier in endgame, but getting to that point is slowwwww.
---
Does it always round down?
---
Better question- why are you doing gnomeragan as horde? Are there any quests for it?
---
I had the opposite happen to me.
---
I was trying to buff, especially since I have improved fort and the group started to laugh at me for wanting to buff "useless" fort.
---
Why even decline free stats..?
---
Why are the toxic people I follow and associate with being toxic? That's crazy!
---
Personally I play as a tank as a warrior, but honestly I can understand why those who aren’t interested in tanking won’t fill the roll. Your party can seriously act like a bunch of entitled dicks even when they’re at fault. Sometimes just not worth the headache.
---
Pick a paladin tank. I’m very conscious of my healers mana bar and 9 times out of 10 I have to drink too ;)
---
He made a choice to be an asshole to unwilling participants in order to make more money. 
---
How does that not make someone an asshole?
---
weird setup
---
Asmon encourages this behaviour. The biggest elitist there is. Such a toxin for the community honestly.
---
Oh man, the fan base of 12-17 year olds are going to go crazy for this. God, he's sooooooooo cool /s
---
Riight. "it's just a prank, bro"
---
What raid frames are those?
---
Shooters shoot 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I do agree that there would be a large portion of the playerbase that would be interested in this, but I don't think Blizzard would ever do boosted exp servers simply because it shortens the amount of time players will play, and subscriptions = money.
---
this is the reason personal loot came into the game xD
---
I'm not, actually.  Minimal world PvP encounters were lost due to flying given that everyone still has to land to actually quest or gather (druids notwithstanding on that second one).  People vastly overestimate the number of world PvP encounters that happened (and which could be forced despite the target being on an epic mount) while the person being aggressed on was in transit.  It was a very small percentage of the overall world PvP that occurred.
---
You could always watch a video or two and not be a wimp?!! It’s not that hard
---
And the Sprite dartling
---
Bis = best in slot
---
Nothing else. At any level and any game for that matter there can be an item that is better than any others in that slot
---
Oh you
---
My girlfriend would really appreciate this reference thank you
---
Yeah, casual players will never really get to the top end in the honor system in classic.  It's just too much time and work to put in to get there for most people.
---
Tips for improving performance / playing with less lag on a low quality PC?
---
Nope. Just gotta do it the old fashioned way and jump on a server and start doing /whos
---
Hopefully almost nothing
---
when did vanilla wow have that ui?
---
In single target locks can be top with the right gear. Warriors usually pass in execute range
---
One thing i've seen in classic is that dps try to play it like retail, they pull and then expect tank to get aggro. Thing is, in classic is a lot harder for a tank to build threat so I've seen a lot of tank struggling because of some dps pulling to much mobs and ofc the tank gets blamed.
---
I cannot believe that someone was capable of not only coming up with these thoughts, but then proceeding to write them down and actually press the submit button to share with other people.
---
Great opinion.
---
Definitely interested in finding out how the keyboard is done.
---
I laugh my ass off.  These guys
---
I'm impressed at his aim
---
Should really be flagged NSFW
---
As you should.
---
Which server are you on?
---
Im starting to believe these are actually scripted because karma whores need their daily karma.
---
It's fine damage while tanking because then you actually get rage.
---
As a DPS... maybe if you're doing WC pre-20.
---
What's up with the LocalDefense and WorldDefense channels? I remember back in the day getting spammed with "Placename is under attack!" messages from them, but on Classic, not a peep. Is this a layering issue? I'm on a high pop pvp server so I have a hard time believing people just aren't fighting near NPCs at all, ever.

Find out what a classes strengths and weaknesses are, then play to that.

Mages have amazing damage output, utility and CC. But they have low HP and a mana pool that runs out fast. But in general here are some tips:
---
- Try to keep yourself always healed, mages save a lot of burst for when you're low to finish you off 
---
- Fake cast heals with your hearthstone to waste their counterspell  
---
- EARTH SHOCK the shit out of their primary casting school as this will generally make them useless for 4~ seconds  
---
- PURGE PURGE PURGE, Ice Barrier is a 31 pt talent and blocks like 800~ damage and can be completely countered by a purge  
---
- Try to outlast them, if you are on full HP and a mage drops to like 1/3rd mana, typically there's no way they'll beat you  
---
- Don't let them keep max distance, most mages can shit out damage from 30+ yards, closing that gap is the best way to success (Free action potions shit on frost mages)  
---
- If you have any way of dealing minor damage to yourself (or a DoT) and see a mage casting poly, it can be incredibly useful as poly breaks on any instance of damage
---

Yeah but people aren't rolling them to do dungeon cleave, they're rolling them because they're good
---
First question I had 2 sentences in.  These types of people should be banned so damn quick.
---
What do you think is the least played (or the least mainstream) class? Back in the day, I think the warlocks weren't so famous, but nowadays I've seen a lot of them. Same goes for mages and rogues, even though they have always been a popular, but again.. nowadays, I see a disproportionate amount of them.
---
I have a mage and of course I'm one of that majority. I don't intend to disesteem any class, but I think that the whole gaming experience has suffered important changes. 
---
My opinion is that it has been a decrease in the amount of hunters, an increase in the amount of locks and druids and another big increase in the rate of rogues and mages. 
---
What do you think?
---
My guildy got one today, I wonder if that was you. Stalagg

Snitches get stitches

As a first time vanilla player looking to try dungeons, how can i make it clear that i am a noob and a first time player? Do groups that help newcomers exist?

So?

---
battle???? only one post has actually put up pertinent info, the rest have been troll spew. In vanilla there was no Lvling BiS. The term was coined as a term to describe a single piece of gear that was superior to all other pieces in the game, but that was subnective as it is very dependent on class, talent build, playstyle and play environment, as The term best in slot for character lvl and build is too long so BiS is the paraphrasex acronym we use in leet speak
---
No one ever seems to mention that leveling as holy is just as good if not better until shadow form even more so if plan on running a lot of dungeons. Shadow is just gonna be superior post 40 for solo play.
---
I tweeted this to @Asmongold and asked if this scummy behavior is ok with him.
---
Depending on the level. If you're pulling threat from a 60 tank they're bad 100%. I never have a problem when I'm playing with my warrior buddy that tanks as a hunter
---
Ok, almost nothing.
---
It's not like you become a good tier player after spamming frost bolt and drink for 60 levels while questing.
---
Reading guides for two hours and playing pvp or soloing hard fights while critically reviewing what you are doing good and bad for a few more will teach you more about any class than questing for ten days.
---
336 if you're a tauren!
---
Battle net friends, he saw him login to battlenet 30 sec before logging in to the game.
---
You can easily tank the first two, and Armory shouldn't be too hard either.  Cathedral would be tough at your level, but you could do it with a good healer and good DPS.
---
As a rogue, probably lock. Rogue's still have some downtime especially when facing slightly higher leveled mobs.
---
Join a group and just say "This is my first time in a dungeon, let me know what to do"
---
As long as you haven't grouped with a complete asshole, people will be more than happy to help.
---
I have a ton more screenshots but the beginning of the conversation is enough. This person was so crazy mad and rude because I didn't want to tank, even though I was invited as DPS knowingly, and he had 2 other warriors in the group. I explained it wasn't going to work and said gl and left. I now am getting spam messaged by him calling me a pussy and shit. It's so stupid. This isn't the first time this has happened. DPS warriors probably all get this treatment I can't be the only one.
---
Let just tank as sensitive and try. Nothing sad could happen
---
Not only one person per server gets to be Rank 14, either. It's not even limited to one per faction. And the blue set is achievable by rank 10, which is super doable to get.
---
Sounds like you're confusing quite a bit of information here.
---
Does your keyboard not have the print screen button?
---
Pick up group
---
Weird you say that because the new spec system was introduced in cata.
---
Why would I want to smash?  In now way trying to hop on Asmon's dick but I do realize the difference between content and what he genuinely feels towards the game.  Jesus.  It's not a hard concept.
---
Ya'll just keep playing victim Andy and I'll keep enjoying his content.
---
Whats that mean?
---
It's so rough I was 39 lol :/
---
I think people think you're referring to the R13 set. The R10 set is very achievable if you have the time to PvP for like 2-3 hours a day.
---
It would seem the fool is you
---
Don't think it would, since most of this was me question / grinding solo, so only a few buffs up most of the time.
---
If everyone you see everyone else greeds and you keep the item anyway it's definitely ninjaing.
---
You should look up what Devil's Advocate means. I'm glad I could help you learn a new phrase today! Luckily some other people understand what playing DA means and provided actual replies unlike you getting your panties in a twist.
---
alot of this is because people see aoe style cleaves at the later lvls and try too adapt it (poorly) at the lower lvls.
---
spellcleaves for instance rely heavily on multiple mages with 3/3 imp blizz and nova too allow you too slow and aoe the targets. (as you lvl cone and ae become more consistent dmg though with only 1 mage blizzarding).
---
if you ever find yourself in such a situation where some dumbass mage is trying to force a cleave comp without the required characters, explain to them that its not going to work. saying "i do more dmg in cat" isnt the same as "we cant possibly aoe these mobs with such low aoe/cleave dmg"
---
also melee cleaves are ass anyway, ive known plenty of healers who say theyre nightmares to heal because everyone just takes so much dmg. the only real aoe comp is the spellcleave as it can be done any lvl past lvl 20 (if they have 3/3 blizz). so putting a feral into bear form isnt worthwhile. *if they argue with you. forward them too this comment.*
---
*the following is a msg to anyone trying to force cleave comps.*
---
**stop it. either make a proper group comp for it or dont do it at all. theres is no middle ground, you will wipe your team more often then not. and if you soemhow dont wipe; you'll end up clearing the dungeon slower with a halfassed cleave comp then you would playing normal. its not worth it...stop it.**
---
You roll for one spec as mainspec. You can offspec roll on DPS gear.
---
Usually that just amounts to asking "can I roll?", yet some people cant even do that.
---
I meant you’re choosing to take a stand against people using the term BiS “incorrectly” even though they’re not, you nincompoop
---
I saw two up for 250g on my server and the next day I went to buy one and they were now all listed at 400g
---
FML
---
More likely, the healer gets removed ’cause the idiot DPS was friends with the tank ... :-(
---
Squid has already fallen off massively. Was selling for 1.75g each and now it’s dropped to like 5g for a full stack. Glad I got some of that early bird money but not really worth any more
---
Type /join LookingForGroup (not case sensitive). Later, if you want to leave the channel, use /leave LookingForGroup.
---
Druids. Always druids.
---
Limited to one race per faction, overlooked endgame for anything that isn't healing, and very few top end PvP/PvE druids around.
---
Which is really sad because I think they're an amazing class.
---
Because PvP is my gameplay. I dont enjoy PvE a ton. Grinding isnt the issue to me, its grinding and not having fun thats throwing off my gameplay here. Grinding in PvP IS fun to me
---
There had been this discussion and some of the comments may have what you need. They don’t have a really high opinion of it though. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/83vcpn/cause_i_can_rouge_mace_spec/
---
I am leveling and I am taking mace spec because I find it funny. Usually the random stun procs once every fight against same level mob, and one out of ten you get extras. It has DR.
---
I checked it, its onyxia, only on horde side though.
---
Lmao I’m far more concerned about that dirty ass shirt and Thea music
---
Then you have some fucking mage or warlock at level 60 who never learned how aggro works pulling threat on shit that does aoe fire or cleaves and yanks it into the ranged group because they had to gogogo and couldn’t be fucked to wait for a few sunders, and not make the tank’s job hell because they have to chase shit around now.
---
I think druids are still the least popular. At least on alliance on the server I play on.
---
Yes, the point being that I wasn't some casual PvP player who happened to play on PvP servers and engaged in the occasional duel or gank.  I was the type of player that often got sidetracked for literally the entirety of my play session (possibly hours) by world PvP.  Years of playing this way through multiple expansions, most of which included flying mounts.  So when I say that flying mounts did not impact how much world PvP there was to be had it's not a guess, it's a lived experience from someone for whom world PvP was a *huge* percentage of their total playtime.
---
you have too much free time
---
Lock is definitely easier to play! And not as gear dependent so you don’t have those moments where you are literal poop till you get a wee wep upgrade
---
Not at my laptop but I'm sure there was just a button that said keybind? Might have been updated since you last tried.
---
I love your drawings and I love this one also but 1 little bit of constructive criticism if I may. His left hand looks a bit weird, like it's amputated or almost like a bone. It may look better if you make the knuckles more predominant, maybe the angle of the hand or something like that.
---
Ya that fire shield helps the tank keep aggro. Otherwise I would want to always sac my succ.
---
Nice I'll try it out.
---
They give really good xp. That's reason enough.
---
Dudes face longer than a horse
---
They are the same people telling others that PvP servers are the 'only true way' to play the game.
---
Why? That’s hilarious
---
My guild (Deus Vult, H, Fairbanks) is aggressively recruiting locks.  We have like 25 level 60s!
---
If you’re going to reroll anyways!!
---
I'm not sure why you think the game suddenly got balanced once cata came out?
---
BC balance is leagues better than fucking vanilla - raid design and leveling and pretty much everything tbh.
---
Wrath improved on it even more, and was probably the best balanced everyone was.
---
It takes a while to replace too. First thing I found good enough to replace it with was the lvl 42 staff in ZF. The dagger and offhand in SM isn’t as good as the stick IMO.
---
Holy fuck I could hear the splashes from the drool trickling down this guy's mouth as he typed
---
I would just put him on ignore and move on. I wouldn't want to waste my time in one of his raids. Don't raids in classic take a lot more time than retail?
---
I really didn't care about this because as a former hardcore EVE player I don't really have a problem with scamming or ninjalooting but fuck me this video was just pure cringe.
---
I hover over that damn chest every single time and get momentarily puzzled as to why I get no gold/silver cogs popping up before it clicks.
---
&gt; But if you’re looking for a healer, a paladin says they will then all of a sudden starts rolling on healing, dps and tank gear; that’s a problem.
---
At 60 or maybe BRD, yes it's a problem.
---
Up until that point, you have to be massively entitled to think that levelling healers are robbing you if they roll on levelling gear. What are you thinking, that they are going to go out and complete quests by healing the mobs to death? Do you think they can farm mats and gold by throwing heals on monsters until they drop loot?
---
Half the pre-raid BiS for DPS warriors is leather/mail.
---
What? You can't make an arbitrary decision about when an item drop needs to be used and when it can be sold. 
---
If you think needing in BoEs other people would equip so you can sell them is fair, then someone needing on your BoP item to sell it is just as fair.
---
I’m a 44 warlock am I able to start ZF? I asked to join and group and was told DPS needed to be higher.
---
Ah, correct, spent too much time leveling recently and confused Frenzy with Ferocity.
---
Hey, I don't make changes to my comment just cos I read someone else's comment.
---
Hyperbolic or not you didn't answer the question.
---
He's a dickhead making money, yet you and the other maldy boys are still here... So your point is moot.
---
I’m not your friend, mom!
---
Well, if you have no priest, bonus Imp party HP is nice, plus he can do some fire shield damage if you cast it on tank.
---
No joke, I think in some cultures “buddy” is a derogatory term. Thinking it might be Jamaica.
---
why do we need another word for that, the term works just as well now as it did before
---
But did you pull before that?
---
Depends, you have to be on line of sight of pet to use it so if youre 2 far prob wont work at all. Best you just leave pet on stay and it will auto dismiss when ur like 120 yards away from it.
---
It looks like Firemaw-EU

This was no beg for a laptop, just a hall mary at reddit. I was just venting due to an unfortunate circumstance, divulging my love of classic and my disappointment in losing my ability to enjoy it in the small time I have spare. I can't afford 200 for a new one. It's OK if I don't get another one, it's OK if I don't play anything ever again, I'm just in a situation and am exploring my options and talking about how I feel. Thanks for reading though mate :)
---
Geralt was talking about you the whole time.
---
Same. The instant I got into WoW classic, for the first time playing wow in over a decade, my muscle memory kicked in. If I had played more FPS on the PC back in vanilla, I would have probably rebound strafe and been overall better off, but at this point there is no way relearning that is going to be a net positive for my experience. The issue is, now I sometimes try to strafe in 3rd person shooters with q+e :s
---
I think it can be useful for questing. This is the only map that shows which section of a zone has higher level mobs so you know to steer clear of that part of the zone
---
I Listen to the elderscrolls online soundtrack, depending in which region i am either to elswyer morrowind or the standard ost.
---
Sadly this is something that won't change. The elitist mentality has been brewing on private servers for years and years.
---
There is nothing more important than epics. You should know this by now. People be selling their mothers for Dal'rends.
---
Hunter would be the best for this tbh.
---
Well obviously YOUR anecdote beats out the data, it's YOUR anecdote. :) Don't let anyone tell you you're not the most important thing in the world. They're wrong.
---
It comes off as condescending
---
I hope you find a way back, good luck, if I come across anything that can help I'll let you know. Peace
---
i play lock and feel the downtime after killing mobs for quests is quite high for eating and drinking to get mana back (i use lifetap and just eat food sometimes to regen my mana out of combat)
---
LOL SO FUCKING FAKE  1. I DID NOT BLOCK HIM 2. NOT EVEN ON MY BNET DIDNT KNOW THE GUY 
---
ALREADY SENT THE 100G CUT TO HIM BTW :)
---
His knowledge about the game is average for somebody who has played as much as him.
---
How do you deal the pulls past the beast in UBRS?  The assassins gouge me, and I lose threat.  Not sure if this one is a permanent or just temporary loss.  The large dragon punts me, which seemingly causes me to permanently reduce my threat on all mobs.  Some of them also do a very short stun.  It's more of just an annoyance than anything, but it's painful when I am trying to regather shit.
---
Constant gouge, stun, punt.  It's so hard to keep threat on the whole pack of mobs by myself.
---
Honestly that’s just part of classic. Rotations are much simpler and leveling isn’t always the most exciting. As a combat rogue your rotation is sinister strike 3-5x then eviscerate. In almost every case. 
---
We lost tools from classic/tbc class design and niche spells compared to retail but retail has figured out the rotation variety quite a bit more.
---
Thank you! The balancing is so fun in WoW Classic! I love it. I’ll start looking for more Agi stuff then.
---
Oh re re?  I didn't know that, thank you.
---
&gt;maybe 9 hours of painting the dwarf miniatures i dont have because GW's shit is expensive
---
And because GW benched the beautiful 7e warriors and quarrelers.
---
I will never forgive them for this misdeed.
---
Shit moths Rand. Started as shit larvae and grew into Shit-apillars. A whole pandemic of Shit-apillars.

That's wat I was wondering. Idk why I get downvoted for asking lol
---
I mean it’s not like Lib is hard in any way. I lost my roll on the rod first time and snagged it the very next run.
---
Let's find out  [u/nwordcountbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/nwordcountbot/) u/wallbanging
---
Depends on what kind of damage I'm taking. I'll use it at the start of a pull if it seems like were having a easy time.
---
When you join a raid, the first thing you do is ask the loot rules and if there are reservations.
---
The stories of ninja looting where a player informs you after taking loot that its reserved isn't ninja looting in blizzards eyes. It's your fault for not setting loot rules. (Still a dick move)
---
You essentially need a written agreement in chat in order to have any real claim of ninja looting.
---
I love Mages and I love doing AoE pulls. It's just this mentality that there's one way to do X and if you don't do it that way you're wrong and you should gitgud and watch X streamer to do so.
---
Basically people expecting record times runs ever pug they go into.
---
They only have battle Res, and it takes a reagent, might not have had one.  
---
Or it might've been on CD
---
Yeah you’re not wrong but I’m wanting not to have a million key binds. I’m not an octopus.
---
No you homie.
---
I agree the Daisy Dukes thing is blown out of proportion since it’s literally the drag race girl trope and her shorts aren’t even short by modern women’s clothing standards. But there are pieces that look perfectly normal functional armor for the male model yet are super slutty on the female model. I don’t think anyone cares that there is slutty clothes, just that it’s applied equally to both men and women
---
Right now you can't. And when Honor gets added, you lose it from grey kills.
---
And I bet that all you "KOS" types make exceptions for enemy skull levels.
---
Do you afk while waiting for banish to come back up? I’d love 3p nightstalker bonus for bed pickpocketing
---
I see. Keep downvoting me for being curious Reddit :(
---
Adi bags will nicely organize your bags without a specific bag type if you want to look at an add on.
---
Tank 1 thunderclap slows as much as max rank thunderclap. Don't spend money to rank it up. When solo leveling, I only thunderclap if I need the damage mitigation otherwise your rage is better spent on other abilities. Even in groups, thunderclap at its best is just attack spd debuff as it does no damage and generates no threat.
---
A leather piece has more armour value than your mail piece?
---
You do kind of need it, used taunt and something else about to lose aggro on?  Mocking blow... without tactical mastery you need to switch stance then wait for rage... with it you just use the skill keeping that baddie from going after the healer or whoever.  Got a runner and want to intercept?  Not without tactical mastery friend.  Hamstring?  Nope.  Swap for quick overpower?  Nope.
---
Grom'gol best gol.
---

Do you hit those mobs 3 times more?
---
Well we have saw before Asmon will punish people if they do something wrong and will get to the bottom of it. If Royson a officer did this then he shouldn't be a officer in the guild that's all their is to it.

Hey its My Homie Gnomie with a few Missing Chromies

Same Gear as in Video 1 ( See the end ) except i took the 5 HP/MP Trinket instead of the Healer Trinket.
---
I'd take a temp ban for 420g. I'm assuming they won't confiscate the item?
---
I'm not disputing how easy it is, I was just commenting that each individual person will do what is convenient to them, and I personally dont think the result is that hard to look at that it warrants the rage.
---
Any update? Did you open a ticket and did a GM get back to you yet? Would love to see an update post with what the GM said.
---
flight paths are in all main cities that are represented by a house on the world map
---
Can you remind me what was the name of that ui bar in upper part of the screen? Thx
---
Any update on this?
---
Depends onthr length of the fight.
---
+ spell damage will increase all abilies, + frost will only increase frost spells. Whatever piece of gear you gear that is more depends on what spec you are. If you’re a frost mage then +frost will be fine and + spell will be fine but if you’re a fire mage + frost won’t help you much. 
---
There are plenty of guides that break down what gear you want for BIS (best in slot) for both pre and in raid.
---
Who you calling friend , Mon.
---
If there is a chat log that both parties clearly agreeing on the terms yet one of them failed to honor his/her part, then it is considered as scamming. You should open a ticket.
---
Drain tanking is a great way to kill mobs without expending much mana/health, but it's not particularly speedy and requires an enemy to live for most of the dot duration to maintain that efficiency. 
---
With a healer alongside you, you might consider a more destruction-heavy playstyle. I leveled alongside a paladin and dots felt a bit pointless when we were fighting single mobs unless they were significantly higher level or elite. Despite being specced into affliction I would often just spam shadow bolts at things since it took them out so quickly and I could just tap and be healed.

---
I'm more concerned about the ones in various small towns.
---
Then who has prio then? Because the tank  needs to have enough gear to hold aggro. How exactly did you see it a few hundred times? Servers simply didnt have that many guilds progressing. They dont have that many in classic servers either.
---
Best way to solve this in the future is to all need.
---
Well, keep it on until you get bonecreeper stylus from scholo.
---
This video started out completely wrong.
---
Is there anywhere to find information on what items to save / buy now and sell later ? I am a new player and would like to take advantage of the market but have no idea what is valuable. I don’t even know what to keep with the auctionator add on bc some items say they auction for a lot but that’s only bc it sold once or twice
---
That is exactly the definition of ninjaing. The guy I'm speaking with is saying that if EVERYONE agrees to need blue+ BoE's, they are all ninjas. Literally BFA levels of crazy
---
This is my new motto
---
Cool. Didn’t know this existed for your cancel culture folks.
---
Thanks! Already been doing some of these things, good to hear I'm on the right track. Good to know about swipe vs other abilities.
---
Paladin
---
Well I'll wait to see it but my guess is that they won't do shit.  Have we seen people who exploited layers in bosses get banned yet?
---
Leatrix Maps has flight points on region maps. You might have to enable it in the mod settings or it might be on by default, I don't remember.
---
That makes this a hundred times more egregious. Worst part is, him being a prominent figure, people trusted him and went along with it.
---
Public douchery.  “I want to thank XXX for inspiring me to be the biggest troll I can be” that’s just an awful human being right there
---
Gaining gold per dungeon has only started to happen post 45ish. People still run with a retail mentality which means tonnes of AoEing which is extremely mana intensive for healers. 
---
My largest healing spell is about 480mana I have just over 4k mana, that's not a negligible amount per pull on a warlock, lower rank spells cost less mana but tend to be more mana per hit point healed. Take the last ST run, each pull on a large group can easily eat the entire mana bar due to the large dragons being able to deal out so much damage. This would be less of an issue if tanks used shields, but barely any do so far. I'm not going to wiff money on AH greens when quest rewards and dungeons can fill that void fine.
---
Mostly because this fool doesn’t know how to take a goddamn screenshot.
---
A baby’s gotta do what a baby’s gotta do
---
In endgame raids, Frost Mages typically just frostbolt spam so +FROST damage will be the best since you gain more spellpower from just one school of damage compared to the general +SpellDmg.
---
Int is very important as it determines mana/crit, so you don't want to neglect it, but generally you always want to be stacking spell damage.
---
Ideally though, you just want to get as much +SPELLDAMAGE as possible without sacrificing too many stats.
---
I love your characters name. My guild is actually called ‘hangin with my gnomies’.
---
Ret paladin
---
Hilarious dude.
---
And you shouldn't play classic either.
---
If you need excuses like "achievements ruined muh game" to rationalize a hatred. Then you just don't enjoy it. You're just too mentally immature, so you blame others for personal growth.
---
You have to have something wrong with you to willingly play a hunter. For more than one reason at that.
---
Having the group agree to all roll need, then all rolling need as expected, doesn't make them all ninja looters, what are you talking about? Waiting for everyone to roll greed and then rolling need, like op, is ninjaing.
---
Lmfao
---
Could you please take this streamer drama elsewhere? They are going it to get views. You encourage them to continue.
---
than my previous mail piece, yeah, also, sometimes the stats have a greater value than the small amount of armour lost.
---
So many tanks are identifying as DPS now.  There must be something in the mage food.
---
It's fine for all 5 man content and UBRS runs. 
---
It's long fights and the lack of taunt that kill Pally tanking.
---
I really hate the argent dawn commission bug, it's a persistent annoyance.
---
(it turns off on death/zoning/whenever it feels like it and you need to unequip/re-equip to go back to getting scourgestones)
---
I wasn’t the one that said it’s 3x faster. I just feel like it’s a lot easier, and quicker than yellow mobs. Maybe that’s just a Warrior’s life. 
---
I know I have a lot fewer “oh fuck” moments when I’m doing green quests as opposed to current-level quests.
---
Nono, that is khornite saying
---
Where exactly is it?  Like zone/continent wise?
---
My lock is at 52 right now and it’s really easy. I’m speced as drain tank and I can go through a bunch of mobs till I have to eat or drink. It’s just throw a couple dots up and wand down or throw a couple dots then shadow bolt then wand. Really not a big deal. Life tap and dark pact make you able to go long times between major down times.
---
Well in retail nobody loses on the deal since you can only roll need on your class' primary armor type (warriors ONLY wear plate, shamans ONLY wear mail, etc. from level 1 with very few exceptions, mostly non-cloth healers) but I assume going that direction in classic would be too large of a change since most classes are wearing multiple armor classes at all levels. But to your credit, I think that would only work well with Pawnee's suggestion that rolling need soulbinds whatever the item is. I don't think many people in classic's server communities are willing to take the ninja brand for 2g from the vendor.
---
Playing horde is like playing in easy mode in contested zones.
---
60k a year? Lmao what fairy land world do you live in.

Sub x for whatever rank. Personally I shift click my abilities into the text to avoid any typos. This should highlight if your target dodged and overpower is available.

Yes.  We encountered them on moving to bleeding hollow and they were spamming our officers with racist pics and threatening to doxx people irl.  We got some of their officers banned because they were being anti-Semitic and just general racist dickbags and we put an album together and showed some GMs.
---
If anyone encounters them on live or classic, blacklist them.  They’re horrible people both in game and out.
---
Post the follow up by Blizzard too.
---
I read that some people got banned for wall climbing/exploring like this which worried me a bit, but it's one of my favourite things to do in games. I like finding hidden/secret stuff people aren't meant to see like the karazhan crypts

Classic questing is not linear. After about level 14, zone hopping and sticking with green and maybe yellow quests is how I’ve quested. Trying to quest an entire zone gets you into orange quests maybe even red quests. Then the starting quests in the next zone are grey and worth very little. Joana’s leveling guide is a great example of what I’m talking about doing. The paywall sucks but the guide is great. If you search “joanas original horde leveling guide” you’ll find a free version
---
It's insane how well the game runs on my 7 years old Macbook Air. It's literally the only game apart from Darkest Dungeon that runs on it lol. Best thing about Classic.
---
Ah the fabled Northern Lordaeron. Serves no purpose other than cosmetic. One of the hidden gems of Vanilla. Supposed to be inaccessible ;)
---
Thats what i hate about classic ... Everyone is playing the meta rogues mages and warriors
---
Even with a roster with 3 warlocks to allow curse of shadows, and a priest that is specced into full shadow weaving, a warlock should not be top 5. Depending on the fight, the lock \*should\* be beat by the 6+ mages, or 6+ fury warriors/rogues in your guild, possibly even a few exceptional hunters using mana consumables.  
---
Obviously being more geared than others or getting crazy shadow bolt crit RNG could be the difference.
---
To an extent you're right, i just personally would never take something good for myself if it's objectively better for someone else. Not everyone thinks the same way though.
---
It's a bigger offense that seems to still not have been punished? All I'm saying is blizzard has bigger issues than some guy ninja looting a BOE. I'm not saying it's ok to do it, I'm saying it's not on top of their list to shit to give a fuck about. Takes 5 days to get a reply from a GM these days so I think little timmy over there stealing edgemasters is probably not too worried.
---
I equate boes to gold.
---
Because that is what they are. If someone wants edgemaster's handguards to equip, they can go farm the gold for it. That is what they would do if they *need* it. If they don't need it, then it is only fair that everyone gets to roll on it.
---
If someone wants hand of justice to equip, they need to run the instance 500 times and hope it drops on one of them. The item is only as valuable as the gold the vendor gives for it, the gold you get from selling DE mats on the AH, or the value you get from using it. Since you can only get that item from running a dungeon and hoping it drops, the value of using the item is massively more than any other option.
---
Basically: If you actually need a boe item, you'd have it already because you would be grinding gold for it. If you are in the process of grinding gold for it - then you just want the item so you can pay less gold.
---
[I have something like that on my dwarf Priest!](https://imgur.com/a/nRa0WTX) She looks...very un-priest-like in them. Unless you're talking Judas Priest.
---
Single target spec frostmage typically doesn't have blizzard slow, and has frostbite (?) And randomly freezing mobs in your blizzard can fuck up your pulls.
---
You more than likely need to focus on settings that rely on the CPU.   Shadows for instance.
---
Honestly, what’s your expectations of a healer doing dmg in a dungeon?  Should I be running in next to the tank on my hpally to hit a mob for 70? Or should I be wasting my mana using spells that do very little dmg?
---
it is not kids, it is adults acting like children
---
Either one.  Heroic strike is gonna end up being a little quicker, I believe, but both are viable.  Remember to keep up on your first aid with a warrior.  You'll need it in between fights.
---
I was just swimming around the continent trying to see what that big landmass was on the north-east of eastern kingdoms.. haha, turns out half of the land on the map is just ocean there, but finding this was pretty cool
---
Yeah.... that's a bad look haha. Obviously stun resist, not blood fury.
---
The meta won't last, and if it does it just going to ruin Classic in the long run.
---
It was against ToS in vanilla but that was changer in later expansion and it was never added back to classic wow. I have asked in a ticket and they said they haven't yet decided and waiting for community feedback
---
No, he wants the item that dropped in order to equip that item to make his character stronger.
---
All you have to do is swim. I once swam around the continent back in 2005 or so and found it that way.
---
That’s funny because the vast majority of people at the time hated shadow form, and there was so much excitement when it was brightened to the point that you could see gear/mounts. Personally I’ve always loved the old/darker version.
---
Because it is a rogue ability. Just imagine I would just stop healing you if I don't get the loot, because you can't reach that loot without me healing you.
---
he looks like a prick but
---
1. What he did doesn't fall under ninjalooting by Blizzards standards
---
2. He's only getting attention because he's an officer in Asmon's guild and if this was posted about anyone else it would have died in new with negative upvotes.
---
Meanwhile I got no offers on a BiS 19 item for a measly 4g. I needed that bit of scratch towards the mount, now I don't and hope it's worth more as P3 approaches.
---
It is not against ToS in classic wow. It literally isn't. It was against ToS in VANILLA though. But they changed it later and never added it back into the ToS for classic.
---
&gt; While leveling?
---
No, not while leveling.
---
&gt; However, you’ll be putting so many points into shadow that it’d feel really bad not committing to it.
---
Tbh, I rather like to play healer than shadow. *But* I thought that because I play Troll I want to make use of Shadowguard, especially against gankers ... and ofc I want to try healer in group PvP :)
---
do you like to drink all the time-&gt; go mage
---
do you like to never run out of mana and life on the edge-&gt; go lock
---
Best for what???? best for a generic  warrior lvl ??? or best for an arms dps warrior lvl 19 twink? BiS= best in slot for specific specialized and narrow playstyle determined by class, talents and needs and is absolutely dependent upon a static lvl, When you are lvling you are in flux and slwly building skills talents and lvls so gear is constantly bieng rendered obsolte in a few lvls so . Leave BiS lvling crap in retail with heirlooms and xp boosts. lvling is too diverse and to many variables to say there is any best way to lvl.  The term is derived from maxing dps or hps output in raids or bracketed bgs and arena. The idea that min maxing a lvling build is not absolute and many factors will determine lvling speed, As stated BiS is subjective to playstyle and play content. Best for What is the real question.
---
By your own admission you've played off and on, that's not the same. It's super easy to have knowledge of things if you just do them and are still exposed to them regularly. I used to have every single unique item in Diablo 2 memorized, for example, and that was not intentional. I still have quite a few in memory to this day without playing that game for a long time. If you'd played WoW for 15 years all the time, you'd have a ton of stuff memorized.
---

---
"Am I wrong? No, everyone explaining shit to me perfectly reasonable and with backed up arguments must be wrong! How could I be wrong?!"
---
Jfc...
---
If that were the case they wouldn't be in a group anyway, they would be farming gold to buy the item.
---
usually no action is taken unless you start interacting with other players from your exploited location or advertise it in youtube/twitch etc
---
So because something is a "bigger offense" other things should just be completely and utterly ignored by blizzard? That's your argument here?
---
how is it a part of the game if it wasn't allowed in vanilla?
---
Is this something only tanks/healers encounter? As a lock I've never seen anyone act like this in a group and am surprised nobody has asked me to play this way.
---
😂😂😂
---
You underestimate how poop people are. Got to domo this week with people pulling about 180 dps on average
---
Druids are hybrids and as such are weaker in general than single role classes.
---
Some people think that they have to take the optimal class to succeed. This isn't true and a well played hybrid is a good as a single role toon.
---
They are fun to level and fill niche roles really well. They can tank anything pretty much. Can heal pretty much anything and are good dps.
---
No problem!  I'm going to be making a lot of Guides for WoW Classic.
---
I always thought they invisible walled it, but that mustve been later.
---
That Warrior in the intro was so bad it hurts to watch.
---
Never actually used Dominos, I'll have to check it out!
---
We are both the highest DPS class in the game while also being the best tank. Sometimes Id rather DPS than fuck around with players that just blow shit up instead of letting me get agro. It blows my mind how many people think they are so entitled that people are rude because you don't want to take them through a dungeon.
---
Oh I’m sorry. At 60 of course you can go a few points into blackout. The build you linked seems just fine as a pvp healer, although there are likely better)
---
I’ll try and find you a build I plan on using (as a fellow troll priest) when I get home. 
---
I thought most pvp priest healer specs used blackout? Such an amazing talent with minimal investment cost.
---
Eh I’m 28, married, and have two kids. I chuckled at Fartacus :)
---
ELI5 what's the issue here?
---
You should have an offtank to pick it up. Alternatively, you have your rogue/druid stealth around the area and reveal the assassins.
---
The hunter pet is so true xD
---
Auctioneer
---
The fact we're posting in a thread about Asmongold attests to this
---
You're the one out here saying people roll Horde for the radials. I'm just saying there are plenty of reasons people roll Horde. Alliance players have this weird chip on their shoulder about all Horde being weirdo tryhards when the reality is Horde just has more interesting racial diversity.
---
For real, everyone thinks “oh I did XYZ role in this other game” and it’ll be the exact same. No. Go watch a video.
---
When your squat travels 3" down, it's no problem lifting 900 lbs!
---
Since the ability for rogues and druid to 2 man farm HoJ is now widely public, I think you'll have an easier time pulling that off than you think. Though I'd highly suggest only one reservation per run. Choose the harder to achieve first.
---
Why not both?
---
No he very clearly doesn't mean what he is saying, as evidenced by him kicking ninja looters on stream from his guild. 
---
Exaggerating in a way that ridicules your point makes it sarcastic. Get out and talk to people for christs sake
---
Still doesn't help :(
---
I don't make videos. Just pointing out how pathetic and retarded it is to defile your own work because somebody out there might react to it. If they're upset that somebody is getting more views than them then maybe they are just trash at making content and don't realize it.
---
So this isn’t really relevant to classic but I managed to get one to drop for me at one point during vanilla on my paladin. Aesthetically one of my favorite looking shields in the game.  I know it sucked on a paladin since holy was the only real viable thing in vanilla but I still used it just for the looks
---
You can do a library run in 20 minutes and he has a 50% chance to drop the staff, he is really getting peeved over nothing.
---
But.  Why. Does he.  Talk.  Like that.
---
Mages became the Hunters of classic.
---
I thought we were we "letting people play what/how they want to play". I fully agree with your statement. If the aoe groups are not your cup of tea, start one that is not aoe. We can all coexist just fine.
---
Gnomes sure don't skip leg day!
---
Sunder until you have 5 stacks or the mob is at ~40% hp, then use your damaging abilities.
---
?????? obviously it hasn't dropped lol, I'd love to get a green mail str/stam piece instead of leather, but I didn't.
---
Yeah, that's clearly the way to play MMORPGs
---
Did I say ignored? I said they have bigger things to take care of before and it might go unpunished since we're still waiting to see these "full guild that made 10k gold" get punished.
---
Huh. So THAT'S why I had vague flashbacks while I was farming tiny red whelplings (attuned 4 hoardies back in the day).
---
Lol
---
"Is this some sort of peasant joke that I'm too high on Recount to understand?"

expensive enchants I generally charge 5% of the cost of the recipe as a fee.
---
Alt + printscreen if your rocking multiple monitors
---
Says you, :P some people aren't super computer literate and Vanilla addons can be very obtuse to set up in Vanilla compared to Retail.  
---
Also you'd be surprised how many people are completely new to WoW in general because of Classic and don't know the slightest thing about addons.  This video obviously isn't meant for veteran players who already know these things.
---
Shadowfang is selling for 150g on my server.
---
I know. One is a bid the other has more options.
---
what kind of group are you talking about? this sort of thing would only work with 1warr3mage1healer, and only in a few dungeons, any other kind of group or dungeon will only lead to wipes. if its just some twat who doesnt understand that, which there will always be, just ignore them.
---
&gt;Maybe WoW was your first RPG game
---
I'm curious where that comes from.
---
I don't like CC.   Every time I rely on someone to not be shit, and do something simple like CC, they disappoint me.  
---
Last night for instance, I mark the moon, and tell the mage to sheep it.   He sits there like a minute and does nothing.  I lose my whole bar full of rage I had saved up.  Then he finally comes and literally sheeps the wrong target.  So, I have the assassin gouging me the whole time, and it's a clusterfuck.  He doesn't even resheep it, and I had to pick up that mob too.
---
Is a million dollars the same as 1$?
---
Concrete thinking dingus.
---
You'd be surprised how many new people there are to WoW Classic that don't know the first thing about addons or how to set them up.
---
Eh, it's always the horde though. I've seen one nutty rogue go bananas for no reason.
---
SoulSTONE. He's on about healthstones, no?
---
Lately been listening to blink 182 and Green Day albums
---
You can right click there unit frame and add Battle.net ID AND JUST CHAT WITH THEM
---
I stopped playing retail after WoLK
---
So no, not really. I was MT in a progression guild through vanilla in its totality and a large chunk of BC.  But by all means tell me how tanking mechanics work
---
&gt; If DPS dies on regular pulls, it is almost certainly the healer’s fault.
---
That's the comment i was replying to. My point being if you focus healing on the tank by waiting a second to let them get the mobs, then focus the mobs down properly you end up going quicker because even your healers can DPS, the second you lose at the pull you make up with the 5th DPS. Even better when they pull aggro then run/drop aggro they dont send the mobs onto the healer. 
---
At higher levels its not so bad, because as a tank you have a pile of tools to quickly generate threat and pull them back. At low levels not so much. 
---
Regardless its good habits to get into if you're ever planning on progressing past UBRS
---
Depends. Is it best in slot for you and what you want to do?  If not then sell
---
That’s just an excuse. It’s like saying we can’t ignore our nature. We most certainly can and most people do.
---
These people *choose* to act like this. It’s all linked with growth and maturity - you may be thinking something but you need to make the rational decision if it’s something you *should* say or do.
---
He's wrong. My post about the hidden reroll is correct.
---
Hurricane, bought mine when I hit 48. Fastest attack speed in game atm, so for BM hunters it's really good when you get the right gear. Also the frost damage from it will he one of the few ways increase your dps when AQ comes out. It will only increase in value as well, I got mine for 75g.
---
I have no clue what you are trying to say with this. Did you read my comment?  The original comments premise was that people who play the most optimal race/class combo are more likely to be bad wow players, which is fucking ridiculous. My point was that the reverse are in my view statistically more likely to be true.
---
I dunno, I've never seen Mages rolling on agility gear like "This is for me.  It increases my dodge."
---
You mean it's posted for 150g. Not selling.
---
Let me guess...you could smell the need for leather?
---
Weird, saw a gnomes corpse laid out on the gnomergon entrance elevator, with the name gnomiehomie.
---
If you have the bear talent that grants rage on crits, agi can have value in effectively discounting your attacks.  For example, If your swipe luckily crits all three targets it's free.
---
But the real reason is dodge, crit and armor.  Bears don't gain ap from agi, but I might be wrong.  Only cats do at a 1:1 ratio.

Dear level 60 alliance, please go somewhere else then STV. there was literally a 20+man raid group of alliance ganking there yesterday all on mounts.
---
No. It's a hidden reroll as i said.
---
Not to mention being able to call for help if playing on a pvp server.
---
My friend got this name on Whitemane and a GM made him change it lol. Didn't even get to 15 before they made him do it.
---
Pvp is out. You're thinking of phase 3 when battle grounds come out
---
I don't give a fuck about the karma, honestly. It's just bad form for the community in general. You know what I mean? I appreciate it nonetheless, though.
---
OMG. how in the world did you know i was frosssttttttttttttt?!?!?!?!?!?!
---
Oh another German playing on Lucifron?
---
*E H R E*
---
Hold on to it
---
Will go for 300-500 gold
---
Not sure about phase 2
---
Don’t think it will be that long
---
I'd like to know why a Druid or Paladin tank can't replace the Warrior in your group example and why it would lead it wipes otherwise, considering I've seen the best success with non Warriors in my own experience.
---
Despite being a Warrior fanboy.
---
I stood in stormwind in the mailbox as a level 2 nightelf female for 2 hours dancing last week and  was given a total of 22 gold😂
---
That's me. I've consorted to genocide after being the receiver of dickings for so long for ko other reason that internet bullying.
---
Death to the horde! Murder at all levels!
---
No one cares.
---
"No, that's just false" love how people can so confidently say crap on the internet and call out someone else lol. 
---
Thanks for the correct info!
---
OK? So, have you played wow constantly for 15 years? No, have I, no. Have most people? No. Asmon has, he has the knowledge and uses it to his benefit.
---
On lvl 30 bullova is a great warrior weapon, almost always an upgrade.
---
If you are soulstoned, 1hp hellfire is always the best option.
---
Are you sure a triple swipe crit grants 15 rage? I played bear druid extensively in TBC and a triple swipe crit only gave 5 rage. I'm wondering if it's a classic thing or what
---
You *need* to look up the definition of need.
---
If your broke, sell now.   Hold onto sell later if not.
---
Had to log in from work to do so, but just wanted to say congrats! not every appreciates how cool this shield is.
---
Wow! Content!
---
The game is from 2004/2005, but the community is from 2019. People are just like this now. We'll never get an actual "classic" experience.
---
Best in slot wand at level 5 is the lesser magic wand. That's for any wand user. That is just one quick example. I see you're completely stuck in this way of thinkjng even though literally everyone is trying to explain why you're wrong. But whatever floats your boat
---
Sorry but fucking lol
---
Warlocks scale insanely well with gear.. the real SSJ moment came when +hit became more common. 
---
before then we had a ton of tricks to raise dps (sane amount of +damage, +crit gear for stupidly large shadow bolts). the Biggest issue was threat, hence warlocks (if alliance) screamed for salvation.
---
Okay, which rules do you think apply here then? :-)
---
Sounds like some one is hella triggered
---
Not OP but ok.
---
If you aren't desperate for gold, I would for sure save it and wait for the twinks to come out. If you hold on to it, people are going to have more time to save up gold and be much more likely to buy it at a nice price, instead of selling it for 120 gold or something. 
---
I have a couple of BIS twink blues that I am saving until the BG's hit. 
---
Not sure when the next phase is out.
---
Ah yes a bitchy healer who wants a over geared dps and tank to carry his lazy ass because god forbid he actually work for 5 seconds for all the free gear being handed to him by his team.
---
This gives me hope. Undead going for wolf mount. Currently level 35 and about 3k into honored.
---
The 26% to stun is over the whole duration of the cast, meaning 26% to stun for three seconds every 8 seconds with rain of fire. With four locks that roughly averages to every mob being stunned once every eight seconds though some of the stuns will overlap, further reducing uptime. Sadly pyroclasm is not a very powerful talent, mainly useful for the chance to stun on soulfire in pvp.
---
With 4 locks and priest, vw sac and pw:s and every lock using hellfire and taking the damage it might still be possible to aoe farm dungeons though.
---
those can do just fine, i was only giving example of whatever that aoe shit is.
---
I usually put some smooth jazz on. Its relaxing. Now I just have games done quick up on twitch.
---
Ah yeah I did t read it properly. Info still stands though
---
I played shadowpriest in TBC, and when I got my Amani Warbear it looked so awesome in shadowform. The orange parts "glowed". Rip shadowform 2005-20xx (don't remembner when they ruined it, haven't played my priest after they made shadow an actual dps class)
---
Ahh ok, I'm usually searching for people in the zone, but I also tell everyone away from the zone to get onto the journey to us. Except for when the warlock is half a minute away and 2-3 people are already there.
---
I was a youngin but remember back in the days where warriors cared only about valor, draconian deflector and defense skill. The new age of min/max is something I don’t remember much of in 2004
---
I’ve used my mouse for primary abilities since early wrath. Really reduces hand movements and is super easy to use.
---
There’s absolutely people whose entire life is basically just this game.
---
No I just recently joined a guild my friend is in and he just started it. All of the rest of my friends dont do blacksmithing :/
---
Quick question, I tried purchasing another month of game time with the blizzard balance I had left from a gift card. Howeber now its not an iotion anymore in the dropdown menu aswell as when googling tey say it isnt elligable.
---
Is this a recemt change? I just bought gametime with balance a month ago yet now it wont let me, any way to circumvent this?
---
Tanking is great when you play with players who have above potato level IQs. Hard to come by but it's worth looking.
---
It's a mount from a different faction, which is not that easy.
---
If you are going to use the weapon why can't you need on it?
---
You are level 60, it is not hard to not aggro them. And if you aggro them, it is not hard to kill them.
---
On the other hand you may be doing to much dmg.
---
Was in a uldaman run yesterday as a DS warlock. Using shadowbolt instead of my wand on bosses.
---
The tank had some problem when not giving some time to built threat.
---
Doesnt help that my only threat reduction is dying.
---
Even just for low-level instance grinding?
---
Gnome Homo
---
Okay this is what i was hoping for. Thank you!
---
I'm a bit out of the loop regarding Classic, but it looks like your char has the new high resolution model that was made during WoD. Does Classic give you an option to use high resolution character models?
---
I see the problem. And the solution is right here : expose the guy, expose the guild. No one from the server will invite him and you're done he'll ninja in his guild if he wants.
---
Do GMs have to handle things about stuff being ninja looted? Maybe. Will they? Probably not. Have they not made a post on the official forum saying GMs won't handle these situations?
---
Hunter friend of mine ost the chromatic carapace to a DRUID (who can't do shit with it if you don't know). Everyone reported him. The druid himself even sent us a screenshot of his ticket to a GM to say he didn't mean to and the carapace should go to my friend who was the only other need roll. This was 3 WEEKS AGO : still nothing happened.
---
Is that good enough of an argument?
---
Depends on the level of the dungeon, 50+ dungeons is where you will start seeing players collect their Preraid BiS, and of cause you know why Master looter is used in Raids.
---
Yeah I am sure. We play together all the time, and have a couple of good rl friends who are experienced tanks and are running warriors already. I am sure I would have a great time as a warrior while leveling, but after playing mage til level 38 and rogue til level 20 something, I am sure a Warlock is something I want to main for the long haul.
---
We're also aware of both being cloth. It's the main reason I decided to run a rogue in the first place. But we're fine with splitting gear and eventually I'll need different gear than she does so it's fine.
---
what do u think about pairing it with thresh blade?
---
Doesn't Atlas Loot show them all?
---
Anyone knows where I should send this to?
---
https://youtu.be/gLoqmYg7ChM
---
There’s Anathema, ring of spell power, talisman of ephemeral power, choker of the fire lord, there’s some shadow belt off of domo.... probably more I’m forgetting.
---
In phase two the pvp ranking system comes out. Allowing you to gain honor/ranks for pvp kills, and therefore the pvp rewards that come with them. So he was right, however you are right in saying BG’s come out in P3.
---
Wow 2 people with similar names met on a game. This definitely belongs on reddit
---
With my rogue of evasion is up I ot it. Usually if I’m on it and it’s not marked it’s cause it’s beating on the healer. If it’s the wrong target I can always vanish.
---
4 undergeared warrior dps groups without consumables with only one shaman going in the tank group, mages banned from dpsing due to need for decurses, overabundance of priests with one specced for shadow weaving.
---
Turns pvp servers into pvp servers.
---
Blizzard slow/randomly freezing mobs with frostbite don't matter at all in a dungeon. Ya know because you have a tank.....
---
Tanks and healers exist, LOL
---
I'm talking about items dropped after boss is dead.
---
I'll try to say this again, because you seem to keep misunderstanding or what I'm saying.
---
&gt; Again, personality disorders specifically (and psychiatric disorders in general) are very complex and interwoven. You simply can not say that a particular statement, mentality or justification of behaviour points to ASPD. This is especially true because the mentality and justification you mention, are in fact just your interpretation of his behaviour - without understanding internal motivations or situational context.
---
**I AGREE**
---
&gt; You are casually ascribing a very severe psychiatric disorder you know little about, to someone you have never spoken to and know little about. If you refuse to believe he plays a character and must label behaviour out of your normal frame of reference as pathological - then, as a clinical psychologist I'd say these behaviours are much more likely explained by broader autism phenotype.
---
**No I'm not**.
---
I said "...which is textbook psychopathy". Because it is. It's literally a textbook level psychopathic justification for their actions.
---
I'm not saying that he **IS** a psychopath. I'm not a psychiatrist (or clinical psychologist), I don't pretend to be one and I'm not going to suggest that anyone *could* watch him and assert that he is one.
---
I will happily say that he's expressed such views (in a reaction &amp; discussion format that doesn't seem to be playing a character) and that such views are deeply troubling to me to hear in an individual.
---
Sure, he may be playing a character, but any use that has as a justification ends when he's taking *actual* actions that abuse and/or take advantage of other people.
---
But such feelings are entirely separate from whether or not is psychopathic.
---
He (or his character) is, however, very clearly suffering from some unusual mental issues (that I'm not qualified to diagnose, assess or assert to 100% accuracy), not limited to his addiction &amp; fixation on the game, his ego and his poor treatment of others.
---
If it troubles you for me to say that then I will simply say this.
---
"That dickhead has some seriously fucked up baggage." And we'll call it fair.
---
Yo I used to jam Mars Volta when I was playing original Vanilla!  I'm gonna have to get it going again tonight when I get home from work.
---
Things like this make me want to move off his server but I know this shit happens on other servers too
---
Seal of wisdom is your friend. With it, say hello to spamming max level consecrates and holy shields.
---
at dungeon cleave and their respective roles making them the meta classes
---
You can also press f to select "target of target". So if you select your tank and press f you will target the mob your tank is attacking. You can also select a mob you guys are fighting and press f and it will (hopefully) select the tank.
---
Essentially you can always target the mob your tank is targeting by selecting an attacking mob and pressing f twice.
---
Or hunter flare
---
Shadowprey Village in Desolace has a repeatable quest that gives 55s per turn in. I was averaging 10g per 1-1.5 hours. I started with 35g and ended with 115g by the time I was 38. Very lucrative and you're not grinding mobs. I would highly recommend it.
---
Just block those shitty mages. 
---
I for one love taking a dungeon slow and steady and I cant wait for my 5+ hour long journeys into BRD/BRS as I just dinged 52
---
Imagine being this mad over some random's comments on reddit
---
What an absolute piece of shit.
---
Edit: So, is Asmon going to remove him from the guild?
---
Sure but my point is that Jordan is a twink item and people don't really spend that much on a world pvp twink
---
Awesome. Will do. I've seen other horde leveling in places like arathi before so I know people do it to level and quest. Wpl it is
---
That's not what I meant. I didn't even say "wait". Yes, any important parts of the run's loot rules, such as reservations, should definitely be part of recruiting. Then, when everyone is in, go over all the loot rules clearly in party or raid.
---
My point is that loot rules have to be reviewable by Blizzard when investigating reports. If they aren't discussed ingame, they don't exist according to Blizzard.
---
probs, that or a green BoE
---
/spit I think
---
this, and my bank is completely filled with random mats you might need
---
I was cracking myself up when I saw baby skeletons after a ton of pop outside of SM
---
Wow thanks. That's where I was actually going to go to quest next
---
I dunno about you but I'd like to know when more content is being released. I've got two 60s, and cleared MC twice. I'm really looking forward to BGs
---
Probably the best post on here for a while (although that isnt difficult to accomplish with all the reposts and low effort memes), still, gj buddy
---
Imagine saying something to sound smart but you just make yourself look dumb lmfao
---
That’s not right, it looks way better on my end. Just play with max graphics dude...
---
Man, this has always been an issue for me in WoW (retail). I'm a terrible tank, and I dislike it. I remember getting asked to tank so many times, it caused my anxiety to go through the roof. And of course, I was the 'dick' who wouldn't tank, especially in situations where the tank dropped out. So much drama...
---
In classic, only real other ways are to make the group with guildies or friends. Otherwise, groups are formed using the global chat channels and that's referred to as a PUG
---
Maybe some labels would be nice.
---
Looks like a paint by numbers with no instructions.
---
Pretty sure They have to in EU to give us information of bann
---
Haha. That’s funny. Not funny. Funny haha
---
What is NSFW about this?
---
Yeah druids res is on like 20min CD. Though he could have been a little more polite about it lol
---
Lol, I played 15 years ago on Vanilla and this was just as big a topic of debate. You're ignorant for thinking this is a millennial vs old school issue.
---
context matters and it has nothing to do with them in this context fortunately
---
I was exspecting a tail of how to best friends became enemys but insted you guys are mature and worked out a happy middle spot and its even more beautiful glad yous both got a purp each ;)
---
so much experience you cant figure out where to level?
---
Wow. I've had shit tanks like you. You do realize healers have to buy water to heal, and unless you have a mage, it costs 2g+ for healers to heal high level dungeons. 
---
But whatever, pop blood fury. I tell orcs up front - I dont heal them when its active. If you die, you die. It's not like it's difficult for a healer to find another group.
---
I thought you couldn't link the desktop app with classic servers because classic doesn't have the AH API or something that retail has. I'll check it out. You sure the desktop app shows your classic server? I tried setting this up weeks ago and it wasn't supported.
---
7-10 is achievable if you BG regularly. Rank 13/14 is the ridiculous goal. It took myself and two roommates playing only one of our characters and scheduling it for multiple weeks to hit that. We thought it would be easy and we'd eventually get all three of us R14 via the same strategy. We gave up after the first because it was killing us. Physically killing 3 of us playing the same single character. 
---
Don't go for R13/14. Especially if you plan to do it alone.
---
I do not know. I was just recommended to wait until phase 2 if I didn’t need the girl right now. Phase 3 might be better.
---
I usually don't have issues finding groups, but I also usually lfg with at least one other member of my guild. As with literally any MMO you usually have an overflow in DPS chars. But really, as the game currently is you won't have issues or huge downtime when lfg even as dps. Also, as soon as you have it everyone will love you for your windfury totem!
---
Right because health pots repair costs, stam food, that's all just part of the class for us right? Stop acting like your breaking the bank on water when most healers say *lol I ran out dry guyz*
---
Nah made it by myself!
---
No problem! If you get bored of farming the shellfish you can always quest there like you mentioned! Some of the easiest money you'll make.
---
those poor bats must be so sad when they see an orc or tauren walking up to them
---
That’s a really dumb argument. We’re talking BOE world drops, not the magisters bracers.  An epic mount is expensive. I don’t care if it’s an upgrade for you, it’s a world drop. If it’s a significant amount of gold most of us are rolling need. There’s a reason these things sell so high. You have an equal chance of getting it as I do.
---
The new mount grind 😂
---
Use print screen ffs
---
I once tanked and one kept pulling on his own whilst another moaned that if we didn't pull more we would be here all day.
---
They all died ~_~
---
Unused dungeon. There's plenty. One in SW, and one you can explore in  Deadwind Pass that's real creepy. Probably more I haven't seen.
---
Fuck ye dude
---
If I give most tanks 10 seconds to get aggro, I'll still pull threat from a single Blizzard.
---
Okay good just wanted to clarify
---
&gt; the whole point of end game is grinding these dungeons for pre raid BiS.
---
It‘s QuestLogEx, i‘ll look up the link tomorrow!
---
You can check but there isn’t a repercussion if he doesn’t.
---
There are more issues in that you think being banned is causing you harm enough that you don't "feel safe". Probably just stop playing.
---
sometime during HFC, making a raid for mannoroth+archimonde, then proceeding to ninja whatever you needed or friends needed was common, so we had people state exact loot rules ingame chat to avoid ninjaing. if they didnt, blizz didnt do anything.
---
Seriously. Just casually forcing your healer to drink between trash, just to progress at the same fucking pace through the dungeon. 200 IQ plays right there.
---
You disliking him for personal reasons(?) isn't a point lmao.... My point is youre a fool who, changes his tune cos someone else played a better one.
---
I used to roll as Cometbus.  Nobody every got the zine reference
---
Asmongold is an entertaining twitch personality.   His community is garbage though.
---
Hey me too! Although i'm using one and saving the other
---
It’s validating to see comments like these in a sea of “this is such a good community” praise. The more I play, the more I see forced Thunderfury comments in main cities, or watch as the LFG channel turns into a 4chan thread.
---
Haha. Can’t believe I did that. I always hate when people make that mistake.
---
Awesome &lt;3
---
Damn thats kinda pathetic lol
---
But what if It comes off CD like 0.2 seconds after the auto went out ? Do you still wait or do you cast ?
---
Exactly what I was looking for.
---
Is there any other sequence to worry about? Such as hit from a trinket versus an armor piece?
---
One thing I like about Classic is that I feel like the earlier phase content will stay relevant for longer than it would normally.  We simply don't know what the future of classic will be beyond the final phase, so we aren't mad-dashing to the finish.  Well, not everyone is haha.
---
I feel like an announcement on the release of BG's and raid phase 2 would be good for blizzcon for right now.
---
The headstones are the obvious part. Next time you're in a place with tables and food, try to find any meat. The "breadening" is a meme referencing Scholomance with the Chinese replacement flag on. There's loaves of bread everywhere, including on some mobs.
---
It's an "all or nothing" setting.
---
Virtue signaling
---
I have done about 50 runs so far, haven't even seen gorosh. 0 kills according to dbm. Ogre is appearing 80% of my runs. HoJ has yet to drop aswell and we are two warriors farming them. Fun times
---
Having never leveled solely through dungeons and never with aoe groups I wasn't sure what people are doing at this point.
---
yup works fine for me. Just had to add the realm in your TSM account on the website
---
Was umming and ahhing over the ‘Fuck’ in it. Is swearing considered NSFW? I dunno.
---
Someone posted an image to show the difficulty difference between rare/elite mobs depending on how many wings the dragon target frame had. Can someone please link this to me - I can’t find it.
---
Just saying that the amount is potentially a lot lower than you think
---
That doesn't happen sadly. The ninja will have the gold removed, sometimes recieving an infraction/ban, but you still lose out on an item (or in this case a chance on it). The only thing that comes out of this is you either taking Blizzards word on the case or hopefully in this case maybe find out that he has been banned since you know who he is.
---
When you're in a good leveling grind just type /DND. Turn it off when you're open to some conversation. I get you. Sometimes you're in a good swing and you don't want interruption.
---
:D Reading that put a huge smile on my face. I've tested (I think) every mob in BRS now. The most OP ones are definitely the Arcanoweavers (insane damage), Medics (Has a full priest kit, including PW:F for mana free rebuffing and a Prayer of Healing that healed my party for 1300 noncrit that immediately pulled aggro from the entire pull), Ambassadors (Has a spell damage buff equivalent to an Arcane Elixir that is castable on other party members), and Body Guards (50%(!!!) Blessing of Sacrifice,  Pummel, 5 second stun with low cooldown). All of these mobs hit for at least 200 every swing, too. I honestly think a 2x priest(I was shadow, but theoretically Smite spec with Power Infusion), 2xMage, 1xWarrior group is the fastest/cleanest full clear runs I've had out of 15 or so BRD runs. Emperor is rough but doable.
---
I did ZF with 40 the first time as a DPS, the mobs resisted nearly everything. 42 on the other hand worked fine.
---
Crazy to think that deathwing was already in the established lore and Blizzard knew an expansion would be out for him eventually so they decided to put a few pieces like that in the game. 😮
---
It’s painful because it’s true.
---
Now all we need is Batguy's arch enemy and we have ourselves **Batguy vs Superguy - Dawn of Justice**
---
That dude chill guy needs to report him he straight up admits to doing it, streamer ran guilds are so toxic.
---
Try doing a dungeon at a reasonable pace without a healer.
---
Spoiler: &gt;! It's going to be slow as hell. !&lt;
---
Yup, that's him officer. The one that gave everyone the gay.
---
It’s always funny for some reason when I see a warrior beating the shit out of a random beast with a staff.
---
That’s a fair point
---
Try doing a dungeon at all without a tank or dps. Gtfo  scrub.
---
I played UO longer than any game.  PRE UOR pvp is prolly still best mmo pvp experience.
---
Oh i got that yesterday. Wonder why Shaman did not rage when i won the roll as Warlock
---
I really want this weapon as a hunter. I still have crescent staff and it’s a direct upgrade.
---
Some dps seem allergic to skull. Those dps go to the special level of hell for child molesters and people who talk in the theater.
---
It’s the hen house pvp mall....! :-)
---
Well the blacklist is definetely not for whiny salt bags that see an issue with literally everything they don't do themselves.
---
i used that name in everquest2 lol
---
*laughs in Mage* but seriously, sometimes I don’t even AOE because I wanna show people that single target works great.  Against big mobs like the Ogres in LBRS, I don’t aoe, because I’ll go oom before they die.
---
"Pro"
---
I just add more mages and warriors for easy tanks and DPS that can give me free water
---
I have stopped watching asmongold on twitch because of how he has done classic.  I dont expect any less from his lackeys.
---
Well I'm sure they did, being silenced and all lol
---
You can not scam someone in wow.
---
If the proof is ingame you can ALWAYS get it rectified.
---
You, for using the laziest insult in existence in response to your comment getting called out?
---
Argument would make sense if I was the one getting butthurt. But I’m not. I just roll my eyes and think the poster is lame. You’re the ones getting anal pains over that fact.
---
I use 3  PG27UQ's  and none of them glare. I have 3 VG248's on my work PC and those don't either. 
---
You can't really get better than the UQ's at the moment, so no. 
---
#
---
maybe or peeps are oversimplifying it. So we will all agree that the item  is only best in slot for a certain lvl range and class specialization. That being said when Lvling it should be BiSRN, best in slot right now and that there is no best way to level.
---
This is my first time playing shammy and the toolkit felt so great in WC.  Cleanse the poisons, break the sleeps...so much utility
---
Have you tried deathcoil first?
---
So the quest npc Tyrion during Infiltrating the Castle is bugged on Westfall server. Anyone know if its a reset or until the person who failed abandons the quest?
---
Are you literally retarded or just incapable of reading?
---
&gt;once again I don't dislike asmongold
---
How many times do I have to say this? I think he's done some lame things on stream before but I just don't care about him either way. You're a blind fanboy if you seriously think he hasn't done things pre-classic that might rub people the wrong way
---
&gt;changes his tune cos someone else played a better one.
---
I changed 2 words you fucking dolt, and they have absolutely nothing to do with my point anyways. I'll even edit it back if it really pisses you off so much
---
Sweet thank you. I'll start looking at BiS lists to get an idea of the names and what stats are popular.
---
Can you resurrect players of the opposing faction, just to gank them again?
---
As a color blind person, fuck you.
---
it's way different in a raid, since you use masterloot on those anyways. I used the WC example specifically since it is the earliest source of a ring that you stil use 35 lvls later.
---
Again, it literally doesn’t matter what you use. That is entirely irrelevant. Yes, anti-glare coating exists.
---
And LOL at saying you can’t get better than a cheapo gaming monitor... you are clueless.
---
This. If you make more gold per hour doing something other than mining you shouldn't mine and instead buy your ores.
---
I'm gnot a gnelf
---
What a great day
---
Shout spamming does work in classic lmao... Demo shout to start and then spam battle shout and it gives quite a substantial amount of threat.
---
25k is.....a lot of gold. I don't think you'd have that much just running low level dungeons?
---
Let's say you're making 30g an hour, that's 25000/30  that's 833 hours. 
---
The game has been out a month. That's 730 hours. Total. Leaving zero room for sleep.
---
What's your secret then ?
---
If you have a hunter in your group who needs Blackcrow and you roll on it you're a dick plain and simple.
---
You're more than welcome to, but don't think I won't blacklist you and call you out in chat.
---
I am not gonna react salty or aggressively, but I dont like being called buddy as well
---
Cape of Brotherhood is good for a surprisingly long time.  Until capes start offering +8 Agi with +8 stam, you probably won’t find an alternative easily.  Those stats are for 40+
---
I just call them 19s , 29s ect
---
Most of that stuff was a long time ago or just talk. I've been watching his stream lately and he's been perfectly fair with gear in Classic, even passing on a lot warrior loot for other tanks.
---
Jesus Christ I think the website you're looking for is Facebook
---
Yeah but end game bis is still only bisRN until next raid is out
---
Instructions unclear. still managed a good night sleep
---
Haha pvp I meant
---
When you’re in a group with another player and you duel them, things like FD and stealth/vanish don’t work like they would if you were not in the group. It’s always worked that way. Test it when you’re not grouped if you were grouped in the vid.
---
You clearly have little to no understand about high-end gaming monitors. ~~Done wasting my time on you. Enjoy your ignorance!~~
---
Why don't you try backing up what you're saying then.  How is it irrelevant what I use when I'm giving you a direct example of a great monitor that doesn't glare. Now its your turn to show me some examples, or be wrong. Your call.
---
Still a shady move to take a 2-hander from a warrior. I'm not saying it isn't useful for a hunter...but that's like someone with $4000 taking $5 from a homeless man.
---
Lmao chill the fuck out, buddy it will be alright
---
Nice catch, too funny.
---
I’m struggling with what I guess you could call an etiquette problem. About five or six of us from retail started classic around the same time and made a guild. Now I’m like the only one left still playing classic. A few people bailed, someone else ran out of game time, etc. The former GM made me GM when he stopped playing, which I never asked for. The guild is basically dead now except me and a few randos who I’ve become semifriendly with. I’ve tried recruiting and it’s not going anywhere. 
---
Is it a dick move to basically tell my retail friends that I never wanted GM and to leave for a guild on classic that actually has members? I’m interested in raiding endgame and would rather run endgame dungeons with guildmates. I feel weird just abandoning the guild,  but I never really wanted the responsibility of being GM. Thoughts?
---
Like pre raid bis. Only bis until you get into raids
---
No loot drama for people leveling solo either...
---
The powerlevelers are done, their fucking simpleton followers who are bad at the game and watch them play are now trying it.
---
All the characters have established lore somewhere
---
World first "classic" kill
---
I always rationalized stuff like this lorewise as you fucked em all up to bad in combat so you need to find a good one
---
You have now expended your RNG Favor for the next 100 rolls 😂
---
Yeah, can we not gloss over that please?
---
I'm trying to decide what's the best part for my healing priest.
---
I've got bracers from scholo that are +11 int +12 sta +7 spirit but i've looted +31 healing power green world drop bracers.
---
Opinions?
---
I know I'd get more raw healing, but i'd lose some survivability, mana, and regen, but I don't know how big of a difference the + 31 bonus healing is
---
considering most healers level in their offspec, your point is completely wrong. A group with 5 of any combo of shamans, paladins, druids, and priests could do most dungeons easy. (I say most because 5 priests actually has trouble BRD+ unless you're over leveled).
---
Uhhh wtf??? So because he doesn't want to do something he doesn't find fun he's an asshole? R u high?
---
Great, thanks for the input! I’ll go with the rod.
---
Just FYI, regardless of this dude. I MT ubrs all day as Fury warrior, just gotta have the equipement and it pretty much is a easy until After the beast where you may need 2 tanks for the Big packs or good CC and coordination (even if they're DPS specced)
---
i noticed the same with my gnome warlock. It was a square room with seemingly no LoS but I couldnt get LoS on the healer to soulstone him. Then realized this really low table was breaking LoS because I'm so short.. never had one of those tables do that before lol
---
The those aren't people you need to be worried about.
---
My monitor cost $1250. But you know, whatever accusations you need to make to support your ignorant small mindedness.
---
Also, “high end gaming monitor” is an oxy moron. Gaming monitors are decidedly low end.
---
I'm not colorblind and this is still a better map
---
Next water req lvl 45, u vendor or smb makes you some.
---
It is why the right faction choice is horde. We only get drama when an alliance spy puts it in our group or an alliance stirs it like Serenity Now did.
---
Sometime talk talk
---
&gt; establish loot rules (boe, bop, blue, purple, gathering profs, crafting reagents, etc) once the group is formed. This way there is no confusion if people come from different schools of thought on how to handle this. Make sure to reiterate at the start of a run if you aren't doing a full clear of a dungeon (i.e. BRD arena/anger, Mara full clear starting on purple side, LBRS run for UBRS key gems)
---
As a new player who is level 17 and was considering trying my first dungeon, this scares me since I don't understand most of what you wrote here lol. Sounds like there are pretty high expectations for joining a dungeon group, might be easier to just keep playing solo.
---
If you don't know, "buddy" &amp; "bud" are incredibly patronizing things to call people in a lot of places, only spoken when there is intent to assert superiority (hence why you see people in this thread saying it's condescending). It's like calling a woman "sweetheart," if you're not dating or she's not literally your 5 year old daughter you shouldn't call people that they hate it even though its superficially a friendly term
---
I posted my version here aswell, but mine were taken down by this subreddits mods sadly

No need to justify playing what you want, to anybody. This guy is a dick.

And mine are 1500 EACH. The fuck are you on about.

grats on the 15g lol
---
Hello fellow Myrzael members!
---
And my point is that it's bullshit, that the mouthbreathers who just copy what other people do without a clue about why they do it or in what context they should do things are going to outnumber the people who are actually good enough to make use of that optimization to such a degree that it'll even out.
---
You can complete the instance even if some spells get resisted, its just a bit harder.
---
Yes they do. Onyxia skin is worth more than 50 Gold. Skinners can either bid for the skin or the skin is rolled on.
---
Repair my life into pieces.

Worgens in southern duskwood
---
Its at its best when you say your DPS Warrior and get invited then asked to tank, then having some healer or dps calling you a retard because they wandered into pack of enemies :)
---
Perhaps then we should ask Blizzard to balance out the class a little bit ?
---
That’s a good way of thinking about it. By the last few kills I wasn’t very rational lol
---
Meanwhile Horde:
---
*Kill Gammerita*
---
Sounds like a plan, I’ll run around stv roughing up rude alliance players 
---
And switch to hilsbrad once a 20 man level 60 alliance group shows up at nessingwary(again)
---
You said demo shout spamming, which does not work.  
---
I don't have battleshout to spam, but I doubt that's very effective either.
---
You tank fine with a mix of armor types as long as you have some stuff with defense on it.
---
25% more damage = 25% more threat = all the other DPS can hit 25% as hard
---
science
---
I’m on about not using a VGA cable and calling out your bullshit accusation you made because you were cornered and you know you’re wrong.
---
Follow your heart. Sounds like everyone else bailed, so I wouldn’t feel bad about abandoning the guild. If they come back, y’all can start a new one.
---
Hey it's Jack, from best of the worst.  He's like the 4th amigo.
---
Yea that always gets to me too. Can't even get a chance to explain myself, which probably wouldn't do any good anyways.
---
I was going to post his username, but I didn't want this post to become any sort of "go shit on this guy" post. Yea he is a dick, and I want people to avoid him, but I just don't want people to succumb to the same toxicity by knowing his name and contacting him.
---
What zones are most similar to Badlands in the 45-60 range, so I can avoid them? Badlands has been nothing but troublesome since a ton of the quests are in tiny areas with bad respawn rates constantly fighting for tags and getting ganked for them. Probably getting 1/3rd the xp/hour I would get in dungeons trying to do these
---
Lesser magic wand bis for level 5, there u go

If there is someone saying "no, we should all greed" they are a ninjalooter and planned to need anyway. Fixed that for you.  
---
When an expensive item drops and you tell someone to need and they fight for all greed... Something is wrong.
---
Damn that's bad luck
---
You dont understand, us warriors have to be tanks, because otherwise we're stupid retards for wanting to dps
---
Shocker. Someone in that guild is a scumbag
---
Ahh yes, defense - the stat I'm collecting for my arms dps.
---
Warriors are also the best dps end game. He wants to dps so he rolled a class that can dps. He's not an asshole for wanting to dps and stating this beforehand. People are assholes for trying to persuade people to do things they don't want to do and then shame/insult/harass them for it
---
They drank the coolaid. Suicide gnome cult
---
Again, how am I wrong? You're doing an awful lot of talking but no proving of any kind. If you're so right, prove it.
---
That thing has dropped for me so many times it is laughable. I use one and have vendered like 9 of them. if it does not outright say it increases healing done it is not exclusively a healer item.
---
Edit: Int =  more mana and spell crit.
---
        Spirit = mana regen.
---
           Both something a dps can use.
---
Oh he got us good gal
---
If we were playing WH:O, sure. Sadly in Warcraft it's spelled "Dwarves" though.
---
Those set bonuses are soooooo good. +20 armor? Who could possibly stop you now?
---
Congrats though. While most people love BRD, I have an eternal hatred for it after the number of runs I had to do for HoJ in Vanilla. Thankfully I am a caster this time.
---
What kind of advantage? Just curious, I always thought it was just because everyone rolled Blood Elves (*not in vanilla, of course)
---
1. /m for doing a makro. 
---
2. Then /spit.
---
3. Keybind the makro to the mouse wheel.
---
And if u see one, tab for target and just spin like the wind
---
Can you fax it please?
---
This made me laugh so hard
---
You’re wrong because you asserted that all monitors without anti-glare coating are bad. That’s obviously wrong. You’re also wrong because you’re being a bloody prick to me for no  fucking reason.
---
I get it "psycho", "schizo" and "ocd" get banned around too easily and trivialise the actual conditions.
---
You're right though, I don't know him outside of what he shows everyone, but that's true of everyone, online or off. It's impossible to really know someone's life unless you live it with them every day. And sometimes even then that's not enough.
---
If you really want to get to the core of the issue, we judge ourselves by intents and others by actions.
---
All I can truly say is I hate the actions he takes and the philosophy that he spouts.
---
Even before this I wouldn't say that I hate someone, not even him. That would suppose that the reasons for my dislike are based on things intrinsic to him. People and circumstances change way too much to say that kind of thing.
---
Usually though people don't tend to go through all this deep thought and explanation of their statements, thoughts and opinions on a person though. It's just easier to call someone a manipulative psycho and move on.
---
You might not like it, and I'm not going to say that it's right, but like "literally" now also meaning "figuratively" it's just some shit we have to deal with.
---
I don't think this is true across the board.
---
Okay you downvoted without actually saying anything so I'll explain my thinking.  If what you said is true, then using a single keystroke of a macro to cast multiple abilities which synergize on GCD would be against the rules, because there are multiple actions being automated by a single keypress.
---
CoEx is a big reason why SM/Ruin is good in PvP. you can't even fear som classes like warriors, is your plan to just roll over when you see a warrior or how do you plan to handle them? Imp. lash is pure trash and you should really take any other talent other then Imp. firebolt I guess. I would highly suggest intensity if you are doing a lot of dungeons it will really help your overall damage output. I don't like Imp. drain life ether but it is not the worst, you just don't need it. I would really like those points to go in to ether CoEx or suppression, if you don't raid 5/5 suppression is not that great.

Woooow, haven’t seen penny arcade in ages. 2008 doesn’t even look like a year anymore

Levelling a rogue has taught me that LFM = Looking For Mages
---
Netherwind?
---
After many years of not playing, I forgot about this pet behavior. On a 6 warlock in that cave in the Dwarf starting zone, I jumped down from the ledge halfway in. I looked around and didn't see my imp. A moment later, 5 Frostmane rush me and I'm against a dead-end. My first death on lock, but the most educational.
---
I really.. really hate gnomes. 
---
Playing pvp since 2004 and these weaklings is why we lose to horde.
---
Asmon will more than likely make an example of roy. He overstepped and Asmons not going to humor that
---
Efficient spellcleavea don't have a tank. We played 4 mages plus priest and farmed zf zombies. Way faster without a tank
---
Gnomes Per Second
---
Maybe you should've rolled a tank yourself then.
---
He does not look well..somethings off with his bearing
---
Just leave, everyone will find new guilds. It happens all the time in WoW.
---
elite-Pro-gamers move: Have the mage then cast amplify magic to counter?
---
I don't get it. Where would you ever get a black loading screen in WoW? Every loading screen has an image. The only thing I can think of is before the login screen shows up ... but even then, this is Classic WoW so you'd have to be playing on something that's at least a decade old.
---
It used to get me so pumped playing in Alterac Valley just coming down that mountain ready to slaughter anyone in my way lmao
---
No, I said that (with examples given, something you clearly don't grasp) most high-end gaming monitors do not glare. Coating or not.  And go ahead and link a 40k monitor and I'll tell you why that's fucking idiotic, from a professional editors point of view. Since y'know, that's kind of my fucking job.
---
edit: and don't link any diagnostic monitors, those do not count.
---
You can play the game even without a graphics card.
---
If I saw someone say "ALL GREED" I'd be like okay you first....royson is a piece of shit but these people are dumb for falling for that.
---
So again, they are the easiest class to level to 60, are the easiest to farm with, are amongst the best dps, obviously there are going to be more of them... so they are the meta dps class
---
I changed my video card and now windows wants a other 150 to reactivate, its bullshit.
---
Then there's literally no reason to bring a rogue to any leveling instance in classic. You're way better off with a hunter, lock, or mage in that slot as you'll get better cc, utility, group buffs, and damage from them then you will a rogue. Literally the only thing a rogue contributes that's unique is the ability to pick locks and share with the group. If they're not going to do that then they're worthless compared to most other dps.
---
Lofi hip hop is always a great choice to listen to while playing video games. It can make stressful situations a bit more chill.
---
I'm a bit new to it myself and am stoked to find an etiquette post. I'm guessing this is about rolling need vs greed. If you establish that early on people don't ninja (unless they wanna get booted) and usually everyone ends up with a nice new piece of equipment.
---
bunch of lies
---
guy has probably done BRD once and got unlucky RNG
---
So guessing you mean thermopluggs left arm. I personally want that over corpsemaker. A WF proc with corpse will do more damage but i prefer the slightly quicker more dps not including WF with thermapluggs
---
Idk why, but as soon as someone uses "buddy" or "bud" I immediately want to put them on ignore also. It really sets up a stereotype of condescending players. You j ow, the ones that are like "listen here, kid". Ugh.
---
Because god forbid I get to see slightly larger numbers if it's not hurting the run.
---
I'm about 50% on agreeing with you on that. While yes, it is usually more interesting/complex or whatever you want to call it. Classes lost their uniqueness. Every class can do everything in retail.
---
How do you know the shadowcraft proc rate is 3%?
---
I've been trying to find info on this + valor proc rate without much luck.
---
Netflix in a small window, so it's like a plug in covering my threat and damage meter usually. Don't need that when grinding solo

You should sign up, it's great fun!
---
What does acting like it’s 2004 mean? I promise you the world hasn’t changed that much
---
Man you are stupid. It is bis for tanking.
---
It’s actually a good leveling weap as a warrior for a time. But if you need roll on that over a caster you’re a dick lol. I waited until all my casters had t before needing
---
Fast forward he became a suicidal pacifist willing to sacrifice his comrades bc he depressed
---
&gt;I'd like to know why a Druid or Paladin tank can't replace the Warrior in your group example and why it would lead it wipes otherwise, considering I've seen the best success with non Warriors in my own experience.Despite being a Warrior fanboy.
---
Why use a tank instead of a warlock?
---
There is a fine line between being efficient and wreck less.  In my experience groups that tend to be cautious have more success than the groups that chain pull and think aoe will solve all problems.
---
Another reason why it's safer for everyone if everyone just needs on expensive rare items like this. Everyone gets the same shot at winning the item and there's no risk of scamming.
---
You do realise none of that is Str/Stam gear right?
---
Look man. Go read the circumstances under which I find it reasonable, I'm not face fucking half the dungeon and boss then getting pissed at a healer. And jesus. Repair Bill's arent just from dying man.
---
Therma is slightly better imo. Been ages since I did the math on it, but faster 2h is better for leveling if you're using WF procs. Helps even out the RNG a bit.
---
Why not?
---
I'm a warrior who rolled tank. You're an asshole for presuming someone *has* to utilize a role because they chose a class. Classes do not equal roles.
---
I like the name, my old twink guild was called boondock twinks, way more boring.
---
I always seem to get resurrected when I'm in sight of my corpse. It always feels bad to be close enough to watch them actually dismount and do it too. Appreciate it anyways.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/db29h9/lamest_lvl_60_ding_screenshot/). 
---
During our last raid I har just over 29% crit on my warlock. That is a damage increase of about 9,6% I think that is pretty good for a single point in a tree where almost every point leading up to it is big damage increases.
---
Redditisfun master race
---
More like what he means is those zones are going to be where most of the honor is. Whereas in phase 3 and beyond you can farm BGs for it instead. So 60s will be flooding these zones in order to gain their ranks.
---
 No-one has priority, you gear up everyone, like ever other class. You need 8 geared tanks for Naxx anyway. 
---
Tank gear for holding aggro? C'mon. 
---
And, it was s constant discussion and constant regret on the forums. Go ahead and give everything to your MT if you want, but don't cry to me when he gets burned out running an instance he's "finished" and you've suddenly lost 3 months of Tank progression along with a binding.
---
As inefficient as it would be, wish the census addon would just add spammable /who buttons and make a ghetto census just to see where realms are now. 
---
Wouldn’t go near as fast and would probably be off some due to the slow speed of manually hitting buttons but I’d really like to see how realm health is holding up, especially on the pvp realms
---
NSFW are usually tagged for explicit content like gore and nudity. Language isn't much regarded as that.
---
You dont have a tank, you have a lock to pull with bubbled eye or a 4th mage. Frostbite fucks mob grouping.
---
Thinking about picking up a Paladin. I don't mind healing endgame, but am I required to wear cloth gear? I really only would want to play Paladin if I can wear plate gear, since cloth doesn't fit the class fantasy in my opinion.
---
Tanks level in offspec to. Like I said. Go read what I said about when I would use it. I would never endanger a run because I want to do fat tank dps. If a tank popped rage then waded into the middle of SM tank it out on him. Dont waste my time with your petty grudge and against a faceless enemy .
---
I usually didn't die but killed the arrogant healers instead with invisibility. 
---
Scrub tanks that cant hold aggro.. bah.
---
Around what level can you start to equip the shadoweave set? Also as far as I know when stat prioritizing for lock shadow damage is absolutely king its will increase the effectiveness of dots and shadown bolt.

Hey all, level 23 orc warrior here. My question is: I've been using the axe of origmarr for quite a while now, should I hold onto it or is there better axe I should upgrade to. Furthermore, if I'm going the fury/dps focused route, should I be using axes or some other kind of weapon? Thank you very much!
---
XD
---
The entire point of your argument is that 2s is no different than 300g. The rules, as mentioned above multiple times, are generally reserved for epic BoEs. Sometimes includes blue BoEs. I can tell you haven’t been playing long enough to appreciate why these rules are in place.
---
Yeah true i guess. I would just feel so bad doing it myself. I bought the runecloth and right Mount in that order
---
Depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm content to let the game's music play. Sometimes I'll get tired of it and listen to music of my own.
---
I remember listening to a lot of Grateful Dead and Queen while questing in Eversong Woods and Ghostlands. 
---
If I'm going to Vashj'ir, I like to listen to Pendulum. A lot of their songs seem to fit the way the zone flows.
---
While I’m new to classic, I actually had a 110 death knight and hunter, and used to top pvp charts with my hunter, it just never occurred to me to use tab 🤷‍♂️
---
I get it now, ppl on Reddit just automatically get defensive and jump to conclusions. That makes sense.
---
One of the reasons I love Priest is how  shade Shadow Form looks
---
I tried the drain tanking thing but ran into issues due to the high pop horde server I was on (I was playing Alliance and i didn't have a pocket healer).  
---
I actually switched to demonology around 35 and leveled as a soul link lock until nearly 60.  It was a bit slower to kill but more mana efficient.  Also on several occasions I had horde gank me only to run away once they realized I was Soul Link.
---
That is a very good question. And I cannot give you an answer without going through literal spreadsheets because it varies on a ton of factors. Imo just use it, fuck the minmax, but if you really wanna find out when you should and shouldn't cast aimed on cd, you have to go through some hunter channels and enter in some spreadsheets.

All up to you. A lot of best in slot healing gear is cloth but I think you can find some mail and plate if you're not a min maxer
---
The good old pick-up quests.

**Oh boy! I only have to harvest 7 Goretusk Livers?**  
---
*300 units of Goretusk killed later*  
---
**WTF? How does these boars clean their blood, they don't have livers!**
---
I’m leveling as Feral, currently 43. The best feeling is running past an ally low hp’s on their way out. Can’t keep count how many people i’ve saved. Love it.
---
Naw there's plenty of interviews where those devs have said oh we had to guess on that and it happened to be a buff.
---
Anything with an identical effect as any set bonus. The set bonus needs to be active before those items. If it's not a set bonus then they should all work fine regardless.

Mess about with your gear and that function and see what you get.

Mmff don't tease me
---
But what about what men find attractive, in other men?
---
Hot pants: yes
---
Uniform of any sort: yes
---
Cape: yes
---
The SW chain can be picked up in Auberdine without NE needing to trek to SW. The Auberdine quest is called Researching the Corruption. SW quest is Corruption Abroad, and just has you talk to the guy's brother in Auberdine for the BFD quest.
---
People see it as an Easter egg to blood elves being a playable race if it’s the place I’m thinking of
---
I don't see what you're getting at. If I run a dungeon, it is to get gear for me. That's why we run dungeons multiple times. If I can use the boe, then I need it. 
---
If not, if I am trying to sell it in any way, then that is the definition of greed. That's it.
---
It's great to ignore anything else in this comment thread. But if I die because I popped rage when it was dumbshit to do so. I deserve to die. But I dont, and wouldnt. So let's clarify. If I'm a group and mobs are dropping fast. And the healer is fighting for a spot in the dps because the run is that smooth. Then yeah. I might pop rage on trash. Idky that's so awful. Are your tanks pulling 30 mobs and then popping rage? I'm not that guy.
---
I specced deep into aflick for nightfall then stated going into destro for ruin and its been a ton of fun I do a lot of dps with some pretty good burst. Ive been wrecking people in low level pvp with it as well. I havent even got ruin let so It will only get better. If you remind me later ill share my build when I get home.
---
That dagger is 1.4 spd and therefore it’s actually a very good rogue OH for the level range, despite the caster bonuses.
---
Samsonite! It says so right on the briefcase!
---
Death by secretion, sounds messy
---
They almost drove me over the God damn edge boys.
---
I know right? Imagine they go to a diner and the waitress calls them "Hon," they might have a stroke.
---
Tis not my lad!
---
Sounds like a weird bug, better report it to the devs!
---
Yikes
---
Can you do this more than once though??
---
So you're basically saying that you think it's more likely that a random night elf priest is a better player than a random gnome mage? Or even a dwarf priest for that matter? Because the majority of min maxers are mouthbreathers and the off meta players are the true experienced veterans? Lmao okay.
---
Not sure what you're talking about. I play on rattlegore (PVP) and had no issue getting to Swamp of Sorrows. It's not a particularly long walk from grom'gol base camp.
---
I agree with people saying play how you like. I'm currently playing a mostly elemental shaman with a few enhancement tweaks thrown in. I only power up my healing wave on resto as a backup.
---
You can have a nice balance of spells and melee which is fun to play. I particularly like dropping a few spells on casters, silencing them and whacking them with the old mace. And if you're getting nailed by NPC monsters then drop a stoneclaw and gtfo. 
---
I'm only level 19 (so very much a shaman noob) but I've had more fun playing Shaman than I did as other classes in the past with the only exception being my Blood DK in retail.
---
If you dont carry a 1h+shield and collect defense gear the tank in your group doesn't need, you are really just doing a home goal lol.
---
I really hope to see an update on the status of that losers ban.
---
Disc is fine till 40 but you need 5/5 spirit tap. Would recommend imp shadow word pain 2/2 plus shadow hit 2/5 as well.
---
But you NEED spirit tap. You also have 5/5 in wands, right?
---
Also, frost is better for pvp. If your not going aoe farm build might as well go ST shatter combo mage and wreck in the open world. So frost +2 imo.
---
[Dude already sold them and got his epic mount from the gold](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearEncouragingPlumCoolCat). Hopefully blizz can still take action from the reports.
---
To be fair, I actually hate when people call me buddy. That being said, I don't react like a child.
---
Orcs get an axe racial that is great. At level 30 you get a warrior quest that gives you a fucking sick axe. You will need time and help to complete it though
---
Even in Australia it's kinda condescending.
---
The people with synesthesia are living for this useful map
---
*Bronze dragonflight intensifies*
---
"Gnohomo"...
---
I think because rogues and warriors only gain health regen from spirit it is so strong for them. Everyone else also gets mana regen from it.
---
But yeah I noticed it while leveling my warrior aswell, it's so strong. Basically every point of spirit = 1.25hp per 5seconds which doesn't work in combat but is boosted by 33% while sitting.
---
I’m thinking about bailing out from wow. Playing as a rogue I die a lot. Walking is killing me and group quests where you can’t share a quest are impossible. 
---
I started when vanilla was halfway to tbc. Maybe I’m too old for this. Got a job, Netflix and other games. Dunno. 
---
But I enjoyed so much the classic. Few days ago I was just fishing for an hour with some random folks. The chit chat on boats. (Impossible in retail now). And other stuff.
---
I've noticed in quite a few ulda runs, aggro tends to be extremely messy when the tank is under leveled for the dungeon, especially in the latter parts of it. I've ran it with tanks of a couple levels higher with minimal aggro issues
---
&gt; It’s just easier to call someone a manipulative psycho and move on
---
Definitely, and I realise people do this and do so myself about other things myself no doubt. This is a subject of particular relevance to my field of work so I care about it and sometimes feel the need to elaborate or contextualise.
---
Paladin / warlock epic mount reagents, free action potions and their components (oily blackfish and strangle kelp), and any maybe rare world items like devilsaur leather, black lotus, and arcane crystals that can be extra farmed via layering 
---
Flasks and their components maybe since guilds have to compete for world bosses but they may just save those for p3
---
Dont know if theres any guides but heres my setup:
---
Bar 3: F1-F10 (stuff you dont need as often but you still want to have it bound, eg Aspects F1-F4, feed pet etc)
---
Bar 2: Shift+1-X (less used spells but still important, or downranked spells)
---
Bar 1: 1 2 3 4 5 Q E F T V Z X (Most used spells)
---
Pet attack is R.
---
I think this system makes the most sense, you can change the letters to whatever keys feel best to you, as long as theyre close to WSAD. I have giant hands though, so F keys for bar 3 might not work for smaller hands idk
---
This. Haven't used more than 10 HS while leveling in the last 20 levels. And I used those to dump rage before stance dancing for an OP or whirlwind
---
Plate with caster stats is extremely rare and isnt even that great when you find it. Your tier sets will be plate though but it takes a long time to get the set
---
LOL. There are a lot of lazy and generally bad players out there dude.
---
It's the cycle of hatred. We didn't start the fire. Every ganking asshole was a well meaning guy who got ganked for no good reason and now it's always killing time.
---
funny thing is the only shitty experiences ive had from this are people who dont even really know what the "BiS" is
---
theres a warlock in my guild who got 60 p early and he got lucky and got 2 of the same really good +shadow damage bracers to drop. really good for locks @ 60. anyway he was selling em both for 70g each in the AH, this guys a real nice guy so i asked him if i could buy one of em but masybe for like 30g. he said he would give it to me for free. he also had a +10 shadow damage wand.
---
i asked him if i could buy the wand, he said "lol you cant afford it". i asked "why not?" he said "because its BiS". I simply replied.."it isn't BiS" and linked him to Skuls wand and the one from Gandling.
---
No response, he just put me on ignore. He got so pissed that A. was right B. he was wrong that he just ignored me lmao.
---
But we wouldn't because it was an "all need instead of greed" deal
---
The addon was around in actual vanilla too, if that makes you feel better.
---
That's like saying stabbing a guy witha knife  is fair if he punches  you.
---
To say selling a BoP epic for 20g is the same as selling a boe epic for 400g is ridiculous.
---
That's true, I just figured I'd answer his question
---
Once you complete the first time you can teleport as often as you want. Just need to have the quest item in your inventory. It’s amazing!
---
The increased mana pool is very useful. When a fight is going as bad as it can (without it being an unstoppable wipe) the bigger your mana pool the longer you can keep firing on all cylinders.
---
Is this a variety of "orange man bad"? Jesus y'all are so unoriginal I almost feel bad for you
---
Its not power levelers or their alts. Its people who read about powerleveling on the internet and think they can do it as well. Watched a mage in westfall getting killed by a group of mobs over and over again because he thought they won‘t resist his frost nova (they were 3 levels higher). It was a pleasure to see
---
I didn't know this one, and now I love you.  &lt;3
---
&gt; cloth doesn't fit the class fantasy in my opinion.
---
got sum bad news for ya mate
---
Place holder for Quelathas. Most zones that were planned and not implemented in Vanilla had some manber of place holder that occupied the map position/references of the zone. There's "unreachable" areas for Uldum, Outlands, Dragon Isles, etc.
---
wowclassicaoe.com
---
warlocks are ranked 3 overall in dmg tho
---
Why use a warlock instead of another mage?
---
You are also an immature child congratulations!
---
No, I tipped 5g. Big difference. Also was lvl 11? At the time, didnt want to run as it was my bank alt that was leveling leatherworking, and it was on an alt account i was multiboxing so not like i was sitting around with my thumb up my ass. I was leveling 3 other characters and would shoot a message in trade chat on the alt occasionally when I wasnt clearing a dungeon myself. But yea, assume whatever ya want. Chump.
---
Pls keep telling me what I do and don’t enjoy, I’m loving it. 
---
Also I never said achieves ruined anything, I said AotC is toxic. People don’t care if you have the achieve for a raid, if you don’t have every AotC for irrelevant shit they don’t want you.
---
I was gonna ask you the same
---
Over guild chat I told my guild my favorite piece of the fantasy in WoW is that in WoW, I go to the mailbox to GET money.
---
It's the internet rudeness is a given lol
---
I carry a 1h and shield. I don't expect expect everyone else to. Most +defense gear is needed by tanks so good luck getting any they don't need. How about recruit people for the role they want to play instead and you don't have any issues.
---
Oh, interesting, I didnt know that. Thanks for replying.
---
Can someone not post something cool without people like you trying to ruin it like relax dude lol
---
at least on my server it is already more profitable to just sell the iron ore/bars than turn them into the grenades as the heavy stone is so expensive
---
You can put down the blood pressure meds, classic+ is unlikely to happen.
---
I dont think thats true at all.  People have been quite pleasant the only thing I’ve reverted back to is spitting on everyone.
---
Report for harassment, and gaslight his name. He deserves NOTHING if he harasses people into playing specs they don't want to play. Blacklist the shit out of this mother fucker.
---
I used the staff that was quest reward from wailing caverns. Has 7 int, but also 7 stam and 7 spirit (hugely underrated for warriors until lvl 40). And the dps on that thing is op for that level.
---
World is definitely bugged atm
---
I dunno man.. calling people immature children over the internet is like one of the most childest things in the world lol I think you’re in our camp :)
---
Yes there is. I will call him out on it. And I will remember him.
---
Nobody cares about your comment!
---
My mage looks about the same lol
---
But Staff of Jordan isn't very valuable currently
---
Now THATS a scary punishment.
---
It’s definitely slower if we are stopping every pull or two to drink. When the tank has threat you can often get by on mana regen alone and never really stop. When dps is pulling aggro or the tank overpulls, it’s a lot more mana intensive and we have to wait.
---
They aren't, spriest is there just to apply shadow weaving.
---
Holy shit I'm actually amazed this guy doesnt think anything's gonna happen to him. Hes literally openly admitting that's hes been ninja looting
---
Making some gold on an RP server I guess?
---
Will i do enough damage to join raids with out dal rends?
---
Gee, who would have ever known streamer content was toxic as hell.
---
If only we saw this coming from a mile away!
---
Fuck streamers. Twitch should dissolve. It breeds cancer in the gaming community.
---
lol its like trying to explain work ethics to someone who thinks work is unethical.  not targeting you just a generalstatement.  If we take a screenshot  out of the whole lvling journey than yes there will be a BiS for that lvl, but lvling is not static but rather fluid and there fore we have to see it as a continuos progression from 1 to 60 Not 60 seperate lvls. The cup is only half full if you were filling it prior to your observation. It is half empty if you were draining it before the observation. Its the context of best for what that im arguing. how can there be a best item for lvling when there is no best way to lvl. Just say its a BiS twink item or BiS raid item. when lvling there really is no best just better and optimum. BiS without context of its use is just fluff for the ego. Thus why we say Best in slot for........., not just a blanket BiS.
---
I fully understand what BiS represents and the roll it plays in min maxing, buti n general that is a horrible way to build a lvling toon. Im just saying that using BiS twink gear to lvl faster does not make BiS lvling gear.
---
You think there's no argument to be made for one to look subjectively better compared to the other?
---
Glad he gets what is coming to him. Disgusting traitor.
---
\+7 damage doesnt exist.
---
\+5 does and yes it's better than crusader for your mainhand
---
I’ve made a lot of money on the AH speculating with limited inventory recipes (e.g. Thorium Grenade), and selling them on the AH for several times their vendor purchase price.  
---
People will pay for convenience.
---
Tyvm!
---
If you choose the skulled target with your AR and BF up (rogue energy+cleave cd) then the mob Will die of before you get to Build a 5combopoint finisher.
---
Since in vanilla, your combopoints is build On your target and NOT yourself, you dont get to change target.
---
So its ALOT more damage to build the combo On the X, and let the cleave hit skull.
---
Highest damage output is NOT Always the Best choice - far from, but try to understand the DPS role aswell!
---
Never bow to inferior horde scum.  It only empowers their confidence.  Throw a condescending wave their way and side eye them like COME AT ME BRO.  Never bow.
---
Following the logic of your first paragraph, I guess we’re only allowing people to need on items that they’ll equip immediately?  Like if they need to enchant it or swap out some gear or something, then it doesn’t benefit the group, so they don’t roll, right?  Also if it drops near the end of the run, then the rule doesn’t apply, since they’re not going to benefit the group for more than a couple of pulls. 
---
I mean of course, I’m being ridiculous, but you’re also being ridiculous by suggesting that the 20 seconds the group will save when Johnny gets his 3% DPS increase is even in the same realm of importance as ensuring fair/equal distribution of ultra expensive loot in the long term.
---
Additionally - yes, everyone will benefit from the BoE item just as much the person who will use it, because they can sell the item and buy whatever they need.  I can sell that Warden Staff and buy Edgemaster’s Handguards or Stockade Pauldrons or my epic mount or whatever.  The benefit is going to be, on average, more or less equal.
---
As far as the second paragraph goes - there are real slippery slopes and fake slippery slopes, this is very much a fake one.  People’s actions will always be mediated by generally pro-social attitudes held by most people, and therefore we’ll always be greeding low value BoEs and BoPs.  
---
From my perspective, you’re basically asking me “well if everyone has an equal chance at gear that is roughly equally valuable to them, where precisely do we draw the line between those cases and the cases where the value for different players is exponentially different?”  Honestly, it’s not a question that warrants a genuine response, it’s a ridiculous question that you’re asking to try to “win the argument” and not to try to actually resolve a practical problem.  There will be an extremely tiny minority of cases where this sort of issue is a genuine problem, I’m fine with us merely having community disagreement in this very narrow window of cases.  As it is right now, the disagreement is tremendously broader anyway. 
---
(Side-note: I’d simply reject that everyone needing on all BoEs would really be some terrible outcome, anyway, just slightly inconvenient.  The “need if you will use, greed if not” norm for BoEs is just inviting and causing catastrophically bad outcomes, on the other hand.)
---
Lastly, no, we clearly haven’t “decided the social rules of WoW” as it applies to needing BoEs - the fact that so many people are arguing about it here is about all of the evidence we need.  Sure, we agree that the person in the OP was shitty, shaming him is appropriate.  We DON’T agree about how to solve the problem in the future, however.  You’ve decided the solution to the problem is to just continue doing what lead to the situation in the first place and that hasn’t resolved the problem in fifteen years.  The “social rule” you’re advocating for the universalization of is, simply put, the cause of the problem in the first place.
---
Does this guy still really have a 12 slot bag? Come on man, you can get a 14 slot bag for a couple gold
---
How about I help your petty ass out, champ.
---
www.google.com
---
Go nuts.
---
Ask google what the intention of Need &gt; Greed is.
---
Greed is explicitly **-as in literally on the icon-** for something you want only for the purpose of turning it into gold.
---
I don't give a fiddler's fuck about your epic mount. Go farm elementals for the next two weeks.
---
If Archmage drops and you Need on it as a Paladin in a group with a Tailoring Mage and the group leader didn't say it was open-roll on all BoEs, you deserve a bad time and a bad reputation.
---
You're a ninja.
---
Don't try to redefine words to protect your ego. If you want to be a shitbag, at least own being a shitbag.
---
There's already so much competition there's no point in doing it. Kinda makes it pointless for you to go gank low levels.
---
i am honestly curious  whats Faerlina like from the perspective of a player that is not a streamer fanboy. As an eu player, it looks like hell.
---
Lol who fucking cares if deyori got a green its legit tradeable and he would have given it to you! ETP is Filled with great people and good raiders dont waste your time on such a shit post on a GREEN item. No one CARES
---
They want *intact* pieces/parts. It’s like you’re having to find the I text pieces out of the carnage after the fight.
---
I dont remember the numbers exactly but spells with a cast time of 3 seconds or longer (untalented) get 100% of the plus healing. A spell like flash heal gets around 60% of the healing and instant cast spells are even less.
---
I haven't gotten to this point on Classic yet, but it's always hilarious when I Jumper Cables a corpse on my Hunter.  When it's successful they're always so confused about getting a rez from a Hunter.
---
Because this is Classic?
---
 Every healing spell gains a certain percent of your total +healing. Generally, slower-casting spells gain more from spellpower/+healing than fast-casting or instant spells.
---
For a list of spellpower coefficients (the percentage of bonus damage or healing applied when you cast the spell), see https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121
---
Can you explain how I use port forwarding to improve latency?
---
Druids are fine for 95% of the content in the game.
---
How many threads do we need on this topic? Like come on, it's been beaten to death by now
---
I bought my mount at level 40 selling leather and herbs steadily as I leveled.  Didn’t go out of my way to farm, you pick up a lot anyway.   I’m level 42 and recovered about 30 of the gold already just questing, and selling the skins/herbs I find along the way.
---
They’re playing the metres, not as a team. Skull dies too fast so they pick a different target to ramp their DPS up on, but then nobody is on skull..
---
&gt;race:gnome
---
&gt;class:new hunter aka mage
---
just yuk
---
You don’t need it honestly. The death ray has a cast time so if you’re in ranged you’ll want to be using your auto attacks and spells anyways. Just get the netomatic from a gnomish engineer because it’s BOE and go goblin. 
---
If someone is in your dead zone use grenades, goblin mortar, netomatic, rocket helm, etc.
---
Don’t waste your life grinding engi up twice that’s my opinion!
---
Every class still plays uniguely  in retail. That's like saying Shamans / Warrios &amp; Paladins in classic are the same. Because all you do 90% of the time is autohits and a spell every 6s.
---
Good post.
---
In Vanilla basically every Horde race has PvP advantages and strong enough PvE advantages to compete with the best alliance ones.
---
I think he is talking about solo grinding at lower levels and not about tanking dungeons
---
Fuckin reddit kind demonize anyone out of context lol. 
---
It’s not like the guy screwed him over, he just got insanely luck with the tie, then won the coin toss.
---
These idiots really think you can just arms tank UBRS with no problem. Enjoy getting your shit blown in in the 2nd half of the dungeon.
---
Blizzard is a total noob spec for dungeons. Shatter coc followed by ae is about 50% more damage. 1 mage freezes all 3 coc, 2nd mage freezes while you ae spam then 3rd mage freezes and you coc again. Problem is too many mages suck and just blizzard.
---
Is Resto Shaman viable while leveling I'm thinking of rerolling.
---
What level are you?  For Scarlet Monastery it’s popular to have the Warlock “tank” with the Eye of Kilrogg
---
I agree with you that they lost the uniqueness and that’s one of the reasons I’m playing classic. I think it’s silly to say that rotations are more fun in classic though, especially warlocks being just shadow bolt and maybe corruption if you’re lucky.
---
IMO class design was at its peak in MoP. Regardless though rotations isn’t why anyone’s playing classic.
---
Hey thanks for the resource.
---
I did a lot of theory crafting and came to a very different BiS list.
---
Maybe I missed something so I wanted to ask how was this list made?
---
Lately with the surge of the "frostmage is the new huntard" i noticed myself ganking frostmages on purpose. Maybe some people feel the same.   
---
But in all seriousness frost mage is good against mellee classes but a hunter for example eats him for breakfast
---
Plus the fact that not bothering with ganking the opposite faction and engaging in arguably pointless world pvp saves quite a bit of time from 1-60. Everyone wins.
---
Wat? In vanilla 15 years ago there was a big that would brighten your shadow form as soon as you mounted until you canceld form and reclicked it. People were furious and it was really annoying until they finally fixed it
---
That landmass on the northeast is Ghostlands and Quel'thalas, homeland of the Blood Elves.
---
I’d like to play with good and friendly players.  This idea that everyone is toxic on pvp servers is pretty tired.  Most people are fine, some people are great. Ignore the very few toxic idiots and move on.
---
Just hit 50 as an Orc Warrior. Currently still using WW Axe, but have been looking at Lord Alexanders Axe.
---
Would that be a good choice from 50 onwards?
---
Just spent 5 hours in BRD. That was one hella fun journey!
---
Clearly you dont know what BIS actually is. No surprise though, you can't even spell raiders right.
---
LOL, as if the name wasn't enough!
---
Happy cake-day!
---
Tanris is swarmed because of the quests and zf. I would find a different spot to grind.
---
time to do what you want to do
---
Most of what the nochanges crowd was going for was a good idea, but the idea that they needed to leave class balance in the terrible position it was at the end of classic is still so stupid, like what does most classes having one or more useless specs add to the game?
---
you can fucking auto run from IF over the mountains into wetlands, drown/die, take res sickness and you're basically there. Imagine replying all these excuses days later trying to look like some tough guy you are pathetic as hell. no one cares you twat
---
I mean I hate to be called buddy or bud, especially by someone I don’t know very well. It just sounds like they’re talking down to me. Like a dad calling his kid sport.
---
But with being said I’m not goi g to flip out over it
---
it's one of the reasons we used CC in dungeons. Tanks can't hold aggro on that many mobs. And if its the little dwarf packs, they are just that way.
---
Sunder armor is quicker I think, because you get quite a lot more OP procs. Also hs is very rage inefficient because it costs 15rage + the rage your next hit would've generated
---
Generally everyone freeze for 5+ seconds, then one presses greed or need, and rest follow. You can each time instantly say "all need" to simplify it, but there's never going to be a general rule that everyone agrees to regarding boe epics. In 12 days /played I've encountered 2 in pre-MC environment and I might have been lucky to see even that many. Not once has anyone in any group said what we should do if boe epic dropped. It's not something you can prepare to due to rarity.
---
MIC DROP
---
Or depending on the jump, tell it to STAY. When you get out of range, pet despawns and you re-summon.
---
I found it amusing that all the bad players people come in contact with, you assume are retails players. There are so many players that have not played retail in years or played in private servers, that are now coming back to game. Now that classic is out can we have break from all the segregation. I bet there are clueless players from all the different places.
---
If he's so skilled why didn't he win the staff eh?  Checkmate.
---
is the dagger + offhand better than the quest reward staff from wc? (for a mage)
---
I played Prot Paladin from 10-60 and continue it in getting my Retribution pre-raid gear, and I’ve never been in a group that wanted to do the spell cleave nonsense without it being previously stated.
---
What has happened is being asked to pull a few more because we’re tearing through 5 mobs with some AoE, and the Healer isn’t being stressed, so let’s get 8 mobs instead, but it was never some assholish demand.
---
how many lvl 5 wands are there?
---
Hello forced namechange if your playing on EU servers ^^
---
Horlock = Whorelock @ Nordic
---
The axe is obviously better...
---
Yep, just pointing out that you were a bit hasty to HIIIIGHLY disagree.
---
Pos
---
It could just be my salt and lack of pvp experience on a mage. I'm just curious if a frostbite build would give me more "tools" etc for surviving the MANY ganks I've been receiving.
---
Cool I’m gonna ca everyone buddy so they can get fucked.
---
Don't level in healing spec. It's not worth it. You can heal levelling dungeons perfectly well in a dps spec, but at higher levels, solo questing as a healing spec sucks. Most people who want to play a resto shaman level as enh until 40 then respec to ele, then respec to resto when they start running endgame dungeons.
---
LOL. Ever heard of CC?
---
Healing spec on priest doesn't matter at all thru mara... You just have to have intellect gear for your mana pool and it's easymode to heal on a priest
---
wahhhhhh wahhhhhhhh
---
How is explaining how the energy tick mechanic works in any way defensive? are you confused dude?
---
This will still loot the chest if you have auto loot.
---
Yeah, zf with a group of 40s is a very bad idea though
---
It's the first result on google, not a screenshot I took
---
Woah,
---
Nice shield.
---
Looks awesome.
---
Hes said multiple times that he started in TBC

You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

Genuine laugh from me, nice!

 CC is for the weak.

Basically, bad tanks for the most part. When you get that occasional good tank it becomes very apparent you shouldnt ever really be pulling threat.
---
The only real way to mitigate getting threat of the initial pull is to time a big heal for when the tank is about 50%. Basically try to delay healing as long as you can.
---
If i tank cant hold off healing agro theyre just bad.
---
tsm says its 25g atm average on my server.... it's always gone though
---
hmm well thats good, but i did watch him literally ninja something despite losing the roll in the past few weeks lol ..
---
The assassins are also in the pulls themselves.  Those are the ones I am mostly concerned with.
---
I do agree, no changes
---
Yeah, I thought the same and specced destro to farm SM. Turns out the talent is far worse then it sounds on paper.
---
Mh, fair, I'll try to keep that in mind.
---
Don't shield warriors. They will have threat issues. Only use it if you know the tank is about to take massive damage.
---
This even seems terrible for the mages. There's some great caster loot in LBRS and nobody wants to split it 3 ways (possibly 4 with a priest healer).
---
Hi, /u/mzyzz95

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/db2su3/whats_the_difference_between_the_2_quests/). 
---
I have almost an entire set of decent tank gear without having tanked a dungeon till i felt comfortable doing it with the defense gear i had. I'm not defending anyone here, im just debunking the "U NEED FULL PRE RAID BIS AND DEEP PROT SPEC TO BE ABLE TO TANK REND RUNS". Prot will help you keep threat more easily, but isn't needed if you bother marking a skull during a pack.
---
Firemaw eu
---
Yah, i'll pass on the arms warrior wearing green of the defense leather gear, thx.
---
fully agree.
---
Also it seems my thread is being downvoted. Don't understand this dogmatic preaching by the purists. Are they in a cult/religion of classic? Classic WoW had many big problems, being deathly boring to anyone of us who didn't have nostalgia, for example. We don't need to bring back broken things just because it existed back then.
---
That landmass is Quel'Thalas. It got made accessible in the first expansion, Burning Crusade, as the home for the new Blood Elf race. The landmass on the southwest side of Lordaeron (the upper part of Eastern Kingdoms) is Gilneas, which would be unveiled in the third expansion, Cataclysm, as having been torn through by the Curse of the Worgen though they had cured the associated madness, leading to the Worgen being added as a playable race.
---
Bloodvine in phase 4 is pretty good
---
Lost a healer last night because I ‘ninjaed’ a plate helm with defense as the tank, because apparently my mail Herod helm was god tier, and I must have wanted to sell it for gold.
---
Got to admit i slowed alot of runs down myself by doing exactly that. 
---
Good point!
---
But with evasion up every 3,5min you have a perfectly fit Offtank with a way to reset aggro in his kit, in your team!
---
And also, sometimes more than 1 mob in a pack is dangerous. I’m thinking about the squishy but deadly guardian skeles from Strat undead as an example!
---
But I’m really agreeing with you on your point, who gives a shit about topdps in the meter is the total dungeonclear time is slower because of the extra downtime..
---
Also, rogues often have tools to skip the repair bill others might not!
---
What was it about VeCo that brought out the assholes? Anyone remember the Order of the Ancients drama from way back in the day?
---
It depends on the warrior. In the current dungeon meta you are probably going to want to pop it before they pull 3 groups.
---
That's correct for basically all the healing classes, I believe.  Your most mana-efficient heals are usually mid-rank heals after you have a good amount of +healing stacked on your gear.
---
Wanted it for ages, talked about how much better the community of classic would be, talked about going back to a non toxic form of gaming. 
---
IMMEDIATELY becomes the most toxic fucking person in this game, takes gold from his followers, encourages ninja looting from his guildies, shouts down anyone who dares to speak up against him in a group. Just generally being the scummiest kind of streamer you could possibly be.
---
My memory of slugging it is 40 onwards.
---
Not in terms of views, just in terms of content. I used to watch him when he gave solid info about WoW. He was a great resource. Now he just complains and gives opinions about other people giving opinions.
---
is it better to party up for quests that involve item drops ? does group loot affect quests with item drop rates ? I only party up for quests that involve slaying x amount of mobs but never the item quests one
---
He didn't ask how to tank, he asked how to solo mobs.
---
You could also say you worked really hard making sure that their final moments as poison test subjects for the Royal Apothecary were enjoyable by bringing them a keg of a reputable, delicious stout. Sure you killed dozens of dwarves in order to do so, but let's not let our good deed be muddied by excessive detail.
---
half way is level 44, which is still pretty far off
---
but yeah who cares
---
How on earth are you doing 100g an hour ? That's roughly double anyone elses really good farm so seems unlikely
---
That's a guarantee just from being a streamer.
---
Yes - it's more holy damage that will let you coast through things like silences as long as you keep it up. I recommend doing an initial one at max rank and then settling into a rank 1 for decent extra damage on a block + you still get that lovely 30% block chance even with a rank 1. Same strat goes for consecration too.
---
Mark your kill order, salv your dps party members and you're good to go.
---
Also don't judge for damage unless you need to, I prefer using judgement as a little nudge on the threat meter if something breaks away from you. As a last ditch effort you can BoP a dps who you can't break threat away from.
---
Paladin tanking can be very smooth.
---
Probably the expectation players from 2004 have now matured as human beings and can act like one when interacting with others.
---
Didn't this guy level with asmongold? How does he not have an epic mount (for his race too) after weeks of being level 60?
---
Would explain the soiled pants..
---
Fight the power. When I finally get around to leveling a mage I'm going fire just to watch people's heads explode when they see a not-frost mage.
---
People leave guilds all the time for more silly reasons than the one you have.  Honestly, what happened to you is a fairly common reason for guilds to dissolve.  Disband it and find one that you will enjoy playing with more.  In the end, nobody is gonna care.
---
Laughing at the Murloc Island in dustwallow being bright pink
---
Sounds like you're more interested in bitching about your groups than you are looking for a solution.
---
That leaves your options as either suck it up and git gud at tanking, or uninstall.
---
Jesus there is a website...
---
I hate warriors so much...  It's like listening to a spoiled rich kid whine about their sweet 16 birthday party.
---
That updated method is fantastic
---
He literally said that his guildies are encouraged to ninja as long as its from non guild members, just so his guild has better gear.
---
Lost sight, and wanted to close the gap so he could see again... The fuckk is the difference
---
Hopefully.  This shit is despicable and he's at least condoning it, if not encouraging it.
---
I do. I wear a lot of spell power gear. But imo, sometimes the Int is more useful and at that level I can also do the +5 int on the 2H as well so the overall stat bonuses just feel more worth it than the dagger and offhand.
---
Home...
---
Disagree - there’s a huge variation while people gear up.  Also it’s a huge part of the game to be able to see graphically what someone else’s gear is be they friend or foe.
---
You don't need a new account,  just use a different server for Horde. I'm maining Alliance on Kirtonos, but the other day when the server went down briefly I made a Horde character on Smolderweb to kill time until it came back up.
---
I have 100% intention of farming this drop regardless of how low it is for a black one
---
What did people expect ? Asmon said in his guildmeeting that people of his guild can ninja as much as they want as long as they don't ninja from guildies
---
Shoulda rolled a tank bro
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who does this. The old ui of reddit was perfect. I don't know why they decided to screw it up. Thank god this method still works.
---
How is stoneform better than WotF? You don't lose control of your character due to poison, disease or bleeding.
---
Gotta make room for the smash hit Age of Sigmar models of course. 
---
...right?
---
No surprise there
---
What addon do yo use for the health and mana bars around your character?
---
I am already good.
---
Outrage culture. So stunning. So brave
---
Honestly classic is getting ruder every day I swear.
---
It started off so well with all the hype, but it seems like that's wearing off
---
No, Asmon is garbage, just like this guy
---
Ppl are lazy and war dos is braindead.
---
because you're a narrow-minded moron, yes.
---
DPS is more important the speed. Watch for staves as well, their DPS can be as competitive for typical melee weapons.
---
As long as people don't ninja from guildies he's fine with it
---
Bear druid here doing the dirty work only to be neglected later.
---
Wow what a piece of shit. Assmongold and his followers need to leave this planet.
---
Even more so as a leader. Now he gets to decide who gets what loot, where if he was just a streamer in a guild he'd have no say. It also makes the whole guild bank/tax scam that much more legitimate  looking.
---
Noticed the same on yojamba! Win win for me on my warr having a good pic of dungeons to do 😁
---
Think it's a bit Daunting for people leveling as a dps spec then tanking, I'm arms but have shield/1hander/ setup to tank
---
That was the only reason I could come up with - Yojamba, Horde.
---
If that was you lmk and I’m happy to help you learn / give you some pointers in game :)
---
Ok buddy.
---
Lol Fairbanks ignoring you now.
---
I thought theres only a green and red one
---
I Dinged 60 in LBRS on a AOE pull before the Wolf boss .
---
On the topic of bugs... is druid cat form bugged?
---
I had 20 misses in a row on same levels mobs yesterday with no debuff.
---
Usually a fight involves 5 misses in a row before I get a single combo point
---
Def run lbrs, strat undead, and Scholo as they are easy 5 mans. 
---
For best threat generation in a group of mobs: charge, battle shout, demo shout, revenge main target if up, if revenge not up, sunder main target, then tab sunder targets, taunt when needed. 
---
Good luck!
---
Why would a warrior ever pick up green leather "of defense" gear though. Please be real and stop trying to make some crazy out of spectrum case that never happened.
---
I'm tanking UBRS runs arms specced with 5 pieces with defense on it and do just fine.
---
I want a litre-a-cola!
---
correct
---
A lot of what you said is straight out untrue.
---
This is oddly specific.
---
Hopefully the dipstick retail players leave and stop ruining the economy by listing things at vendor prices.
---
I don't think it's twitch specifically, but certain types of streamers. If a streamer is a shit person, and someone enjoys regularly watching and participating in his stream.. it's likely the viewer is just as shit as the streamer.
---
Oh, because if I play horde I don't know shamans? Really?
---
Your healers do fine.  You are getting your shit pushed in.
---
“They’re turning the Murlocs gay!”
---
Never played bfa, never intend to
---
simple answer would be fine, 3, 4 , to be best there must be 3 or more choices. good..better...best. one is just one
---
Nostalgia
---
Oh yeah, the druid's pain of having only 3 bags. Me too be that kind of elf
---
When is it not alt leveling season? Gotta get that rest xp!
---
In my server the neutral AH is dead as fuck
---
Honestly, when the mob is dying quickly like that, don’t do a 5 point finisher...just go 2-3 and begin building on X after skull is dead.  No angry tanks and the targets still go down.
---
IDK MAN IF I HAD TO GUESS I'D SAY TO BLIZZARD?!?!?!?!?
---
precisely calibrated boomstick aka precisely calibrated statstick (for rogues) and hurricane are not good hunter weapons because of their too fast speeds
---
TIL, calling someone buddy makes you a horrible person.
---
Ok then buddies.
---
Never heard that one before
---
Funny , I got that last night myself . Badass Staff .
---
There's already a ton of grinding and other time/gold consuming things to do at Lv60 even in the initial phase. This will become more and more true as more content phases are added. Honestly these and doing dungeons and raids are far more interesting than leveling imo. Regardless it doesn't matter if they rush or not... There's always something to do.
---
There's a reason many people say that the game really begins at max aftetall, even in classic. Leveling is just a tiny part of it.
---
if you're in a raid with group loot turned off wtf are you doing in that raid group thats got ninja written all over it.
---
it happened a lot. Even for people that I don't think are really ninja looters, but instead just are used to doing it a certain way possibly or maybe tired or whatever. Either way, doesn't matter if you do it with all need because it eliminates the chance.
---
Just set hearth in IF 5head
---
Black Diamonds aren't worth anything, they drop like rain in BRD. Like seriously it's not uncommon to get like 10+ of them to drop in a single emp run.
---
You can talent it up to 24 yards
---
Dark (black) Whelpling as well
---
Then that just leaves uninstall :)

Donald Dukes
---
The point is to treat everyone equally and provide the same opportunity to everyone.  What people do with that equality is up to them.
---
What an absolute wad of human trash.
---
Read my comment again. I quite clearly stated that I'm not saying he should kill himself
---
Theres also the moments where everyone gathers in one place for raiding orgrimmar through the zep in booty bay or right before where everyone gathers in ironforge to celebrate the first legendary craft
---
Because DPS actually have to moderate their own threat in classic, and blaming healers or tanks is much easier than recognizing their faults.
---
&gt;when he gave solid info about WoW. He was a great resource.
---
Uhhh, asmon is like, C-Tier at BEST. Without his recognition he'd be lucky to lick a raid guilds boots.
---
With mage being the new huntard meta and super populous in number I can’t believe this.
---
Sell it to the vendor dude i'm telling you no one in their right mind will buy that for more than 2g...
---
Bless healers like you lmao. If i fuck up, I want to be the only one responsible for my fuckups
---
Fuck Grimtotem, ruining tauren reputation of a good guys
---
Bring your shitty xpac somewhere else.
---
I thought I remember getting the distinct impression that he was kidding/being facetious when he said that? I can't find the clip though so if you could send me a link I'd appreciate it.
---
I'm on westfall, alliance, but thanks though!
---
yes please someone help
---
I havent seen any full servers unless you're on Faerlina, Whitemane, Pagle, Herod and a couple others.
---
Goldshire Inn called...
---
And so did Emerald Dream.
---
You have two new Voicemails.
---
Yes, I think so. For you guys the hardest part will be stealthing to the boss. You might have to vanish to get by some spots.
---
&gt;I don't like him anymore so he's a failure
---
Actually, you probably should take the 40 dps 3.8 speed weapon once you've got MS and WW on Warrior. The 40 dps weapon hits for 152 damage on average, while the 45 dps weapon its for 126 on average, so your MS, WW, and Overpower all hit significantly harder with the 40 dps weapon. 
---
The rage generation for the two ought to be the same, from what I understand of rage generation mechanics, so long as they're both 2hers. So you're trading weaker special hits for more frequent, but weaker white hits, and at that point, the balance definitely starts to shift towards your yellow attacks.
---
At lower levels, when you're almost exclusively relying on your white damage to kill things, the higher dps weapon reigns supreme. But as you rise in levels, and especially past the point where you have Mortal Strike, the rule starts to break down.
---
And on Rogue, it's just as important, because Sinister Strike is such a large portion of your damage. A mh weapon with higher damage range trumps a mh weapon with a lower damage range but higher dps the majority of the time, so long as the dps difference isn't extreme.
---

---
The post is only 9 years old.
---
I just did desolace and did STV at 35. Better chances and PvP way more fun
---
Running BRD this time around makes me feel like they vastly increased the drop rates on these things. I never remember getting so many. Took four away in one run, and everyone else won least one or two.
---
Damn bud you need to chill
---
no form is correctly set to form 4. I was just giving an example of my macro layout. But yeah i'm sure it's because it's not switching to another bar.
---
Just keeping two of spirit pieces of gear in your bag to put on while you eat makes a big difference
---
would he? he has been in indestructible for about a decade now -- long before he became efamous. they have always been a relatively okay guild.
---
lol touche
---
Wetlands
---
It'll be playable until MC
---
Sry im new to WoW, but why should everyone go Greed? Why shouldnt everyone go Need from the start?? Except its a BoP for a specific class
---
Yeah it's really not bad at all. It just feels like a very lively and fun server. I have alts on other servers for when I don't feel like queue'ing or want to play a horde alt and honestly they haven't been nearly as fun as Faerlina. But I'm also the kind of person that enjoys when a streamer tries to raid a city or do some crazy events with their ability to amass large groups of people. I just find that shit fun and a big reason I play an mmo to begin with.
---
Report to blizzard and they will get yelled at and/or temp banned.
---
There was a clip where he said "I'm going to promote the ninja guy because now he has better gear" or something like that.
---
Edit: Found it. https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulBreakableWrenchUncleNox
---
Guess it just depends where you're from? People say it all the time where I live, and not in a condescending way, just in a friendly way.
---
Crushing blow kick sin was really fun! Or a bone spear necro.. man. Am I going to install d2 later?
---
That seems *really* offtopic. Best bet is to wait for blizzcon where they will likely announce the date. It has to before the end of this year or else they're breaking EU laws on pre-orders.
---
I guess we'll see what happens.
---
I've read so many of your comments and you just keep saying the same dumb shit. All these people trying to explain this easy logic to you and all you can say is nINjA LooT. It must be hard only reading on a 2nd grade level.
---
He doesn't condone ninjaing... Look at some of his recent videos with guild drama, he's been kicking the ninja looters left right and center, you'd know that if you actually watched him **after** classics release.. As for the gold... He gets traded gold all the time by people, wowee.. Retail and classic, you'd be an idiot not to take it. I know, I would.
---
I would spend hours LFG as my rogue. Pally? 10 min tops lol.
---
What a strange way to phrase that, especially since no one said anything about anyone killing themselves until you randomly brought it up. Your comment definitely gives off a "disclaimer to protect myself" kind of vibe. 
---
Regardless, believing someone should be I guess, magically removed from the earth, for ninja looting is still hella fucked up.
---
Man it's such a tease of a racial
---
You do realize that the term BiS is derived from the min maxing a character not a term to describe thantos's infinity gauntlet, Min maxing is where a character maxes out one skill to diminishing returns. over all others in orded increase the output of dps or heals or increased armor at the cost of mana, health, or survivability stats. thus the BiS lable was given to the gear and gear setup that achieved the best results for a vere narrow purpose. Eg fire resist sets or healing sets vs resilience sets for pvp. other than that it goes , grey, white, green, blue, purple, gold.
---
Honestly, it might be because social media like reddit/twitch/etc makes it more obvious, but as a vanilla player what I'm seeing is people acting much much worse than they ever did back then.
---
Failed streamer with literally highest average viewer count site wide and 30k subs? Care to elaborate
---
They arent the hunters of classic, but they are the huntards of classic
---
They never grew out of it
---
Does Alex really work a an auntie Annie’s lol
---
Sub daggers
---
I'd say you ran it about 50 times too many, my friend.
---
You just made that up.
---
My favorite was definitely bone spear necro. Followed shortly by a trapsin.
---
The charts are so everywhere right now. There's basically a frost build for single target big damage. A AOE build and a fire one. Some sites I'm seeing that the fire build over power the frost some I see frost better. So just go with what feels right and fun if anything just respec if it comes to that. I hope builds come more concrete on the best path to take. And sorry this didn't answer your question any just what I've read and seen. As far as I know (and I could be wrong) the AOE build is not for end game it's simply there for leveling
---
LoL! I agree
---
I hate silencing mobs, I spend some fights just running away from my party members lol.
---
You’re still on this? Jeez man, just go play the damn game.
---
I hate it
---
I notice this also, my 2pc devilsaur wasn’t giving me the hit set bonus. I had to keep re-equipping it to make it work.
---
Gnomage used to be mine
---
You can always buy a shirt under it. better to not catch cold
---
There’s always retail
---
You should have let him die and laughed at his corpse.  It would have been worth it.
---
&gt;If people care about the game and their monthly $15 at all, then they won’t buy gold.
---
What does this even mean?
---
Until it caused a shitload of issues with the guild, he kicks people for it now.
---
I would advise against taking holy shield. It uses quite a bit of mana and you get only 4 stacks, which may or may not proc depending if you use redoubt or not.
---
Besides, your righteous fury combined with salvation will give you plenty of threat. For survivability purposes, I think divine favour is the preferred option, as it gives you a free critting holy light, effectively mitigating more damage than holy shield. In addition, going this route will let you be able to play as a healer more efficiently, because you have access to the 5% spell crit. 
---
Holy shield does improve your solo clear speed however, as it has the potential to do around 400 damage per use, especially if you force redoubt procs by using the sit macro. This damage increases with shield spike and blessing of salv. However, since holy shield has 4 stacks, you shouldnt touch this when aoe farming more than 4 mobs.
---
World is divided by zones, rated by level ranges.  Try to complete all the quests you can in a zone, but don't obsess over it.  Once you finish a 1-10 zone, go to another 1-10 zone and do the whole thing too.  That way you'll end up in a 10-20 zone at 15 or 16 instead of 11 or 12.  Do another 10-20 zone after that.
---
If you get bored or frustrated with questing, you can also join dungeon groups.  Dungeons are for the most part static, every time you run it will be the same other than a rare spawn or two.  They also have quests you can do once that will give you great rewards and experience.
---
If you have a quest to kill a certain person or number of things and see others doing that quest, feel free to invite them.  If you need a certain number of drops, you're probably better off by yourself unless you have issues killing stuff.  A mage/hunter/warlock can do most things solo, but healers and tanks can benefit greatly from another member.
---
I'd suggest you take skinning and mining as your professions, so you can either sell the stuff you collect or save it for another profession later.
---
Shocker, manchild has the mentality of a child and cannot take responsibility for his actions.
---
It’s a common word used in Canada.  People call me buddy all the time and likewise.  Not a big deal at all.
---
Hahaha, like they will actually do that.
---
But did he drop the gloves
---
It is u always want SND up. Open up with your opener then SND. Then build to 5 by then your 1 pointer is gone then u get a max lvl. Weave eviscerates where u can. 3 point SND is usually more than enough though
---
Omg that also happend to me while i was at that question with a ultra low drop rate on the quest item. Since im new to wow i sold it for 100g..
---
How do you even sit like this?
---
he disciplines guild members all the time for being shitty
---
Man I'm loving priest after rolling a Warr.  Not slow at all. Ofc I am doing a lot of dungeon spamming but so far compared to my warrior leveling is a breeze and I don't think I've died once out in the world.
---
Stars just align sometimes. A guildie of mine got Second Wind on the first kill while it took me over 40, I got the "of healing" cloak from Strat live on my first kill (like 1.85% chance), as well as a sash of mercy through drop and both my t2 pieces on the first kills.  
---
Other times you just have to put your nose to the grindstone and run a stupid dungeon over a hundred times.  There is no in between :p
---
he's been at twitchcon all week
---
Except ninja looting will absolutely have action taken by blizzard so long as there is in game evidence, which there is.
---
They likely won't consider this clip as they don't generally use external stuff as evidence but in this case it's not needed.
---
I don't agree with the purist stance. But I personally don't want the common ideas of Classic+ either; instead I want #SomeChanges. 
---
Mostly just class rebalanced. Blows my mind that some people are happy that some specs are dead at end game PvE. That they have to go through so many hoops just to push mediocre numbers.
---
\*Hands tissue paper\*
---
You have some brown stuff all over your nose and mouth. Might want to clean that up.
---
Honestly I think so. I've watched him raid enough to know that while yes, he can hold his own, his skill level isn't in-line with the content he's clearing. 
---
But that's all just my opinion, I could be wrong. My warrior friends can't stand him though.
---
Out of those two choices I’d say Warlock due to the lack of downtime and not as gear dependent as a Rogue.  
---
I’d also consider a Hunter or Druid.
---
I had this and the grog quest as Alliance and went over to the shore of the zone.
---
This was after a long trek to solo Jintha Alor and get the egg, and my Hinterlands journey was almost complete. Grabbed the 12 grogs and saw this elite turtle, Gammerita. "Hey, wonder if I can solo it?" And solo it I did, getting just some grey vendor trash. 
---
Finished up in the Hinterlands, I hearthed back to Gadgetzan and opened my quest log. **Snapshot of Gammerita: 0/1**
---
That's cool as heck. How do you do that?
---
The pet thing doesn’t need to be changed because a mechanic already exists in the game to prevent that problem, you can dismiss the pet.
---
I’m fine with the small QoL changes like changing the order of the characters, the clock, being able to mail multiple items at a time and the flight point dismount button.  
---
I would accept Summoning Stones if they functioned like warlock summon (requires 3 people).  But that’s about it.
---
I like the “imbalance”, I think it makes the races and classes unique.
---
Yeah some people are just assholes. This guy is that.
---
If you’ve done the quest, then you know I’m saying this because the drop rate on the item is so low. Also, why so salty?
---
dang you are all over this thread defending your dom/father figure.
---
relax man, he'll be okay.
---
Why not, it's one of the only funny posts on here.
---
Salty virgin nonmages incoming telling you how much spellcleave groups are ruining the game.
---
It is, read more carefully
---
I like it a lot.
---
Report and get this fucker banned. Do not let him get away with this. Absolutely gross
---
Hows your shaman at pvp? Are you elemental?
---
It was stated in chat everyone would greed is the problem here. And everyone did. Except him.
---
True, they died much less often in vanilla.
---
Not really - I join PUGs from trade chat, or start my own groups. Only once have I tried to join a group and it turned out to be an AOE farm group. I didn't want to go (nor did they want to take me).
---
There are plenty of spell cleave groups going, but they are identify themselves as such beforehand. Nobody is forced into participating.
---
Yes, it was there to clarify that I'm not encouraging him to take his life. Very straightforward. 
---
And no, again, I didn't say "he should be  magically removed from the earth", I just said I or anyone else here probably wouldn't care if he ceased to exist. He's a shit person and just otherwise not very important in any way, so it's a very rational thought, in my opinion of course.
---
I'm above 40 and have my money but I also just spent all my gold (67) on a Disgusting Oozling pet. I have the collector's edition so my Panda Cub is always following behind me but I'm going to hang on to the Oozling and possibly use it or sell it later
---
Excellent observation - good question - weird what’s going on here
---
How is bat guy tho?
---
What an asshole lol
---
What a beautiful duwang.
---
This is very good news. I was thinking BRD was full fire resistant for some reason.
---
He needs to be banned! Anyone who groups with him is a idiot.
---
Did you just call having friends to play in a group a "niche scenario"?
---
I mean real talk, you’re not wrong in general but you probably could do that
---
I remember way back in 2005  I looted an Ardent Custodian epic 1h mace off those same wolves in Hinterlands. Good stuff!! That staff sells for 400g on my server Incendius.
---
Makes me aim you First on a BG. Lucky you there's no BG yet.
---
The ones you made up?
---
He said he dont give a fuck and he will not be banned, missed the clip but it will be in his twitch when it ends i think? it happened now.
---
That was a different guy. The first guy was an idiot for saying demo shout spam works. The second guy was right about battle shout.
---
In a group of 5 battle shout generates more threat than sunder and it's spread amongst everything that has you on its threat table. Generates even more threat if there are pets. It has no cooldown, costs 10 rage, and can be used in defensive stance. It's the standard way of tanking the first phase of Nefarion. It's by far the best aoe threat tool a warrior has.
---
Basically you're supposed to follow the loot rules and not doing so is considered to be ninjaing. He called for everyone to roll greed then rolled need himself and selling the item.
---
There's absolutely argument for everyone rolling need for a BoP, the only instance you wouldn't be better off doing so was if you were letting someone who could equip the item need/keep it and everybody would roll need if that person was going to pass.. but it's not something I'd ever recommend with even a single random/not completely trusted person in group.
---
But yes this shit is super common. In wrath there was an orb that dropped at the end of every dungeon that everyone needed for crafting.. start of every instance I told everyone I would be rolling need and suggested they do the same, as I was tired of people waiting for others to all hit greed before stealing it.
---
Ehh okay. 
---
I guess there is only one right way to some people - the guy I actually discussed this with seemed more open minded tho.
---
To the first guy - Yea If warlock try to do it i guess their kit is “dying” and soulstoning out of trouble..
---
Also rogues should never strafe to far from the tank, so unless the resistgods aren’t in your favor you are inside the tauntingdistance
---
Also, as a rogue I do t think I would be able to play anything else without constantly wiping the group cause of these “bad habits”
---
I’m glad the rogue kit make the bit more aggressive play style viable tho.
---
This is partly what drove me towards playing a Warlock, I normally would be a healer but I wanted to be more self sufficient this time around. Warlocks, being relatively scarce, are a good combination of self sufficient, but still sought out for dungeon groups.
---
&gt;*when you start being so extremely hyperbolic*
---
Was it hyperbolic, though?
---
The person displayed some fairly simplistic traits of each: complete disregard of other's feelings, and manipulative/lack of remorse. 
---
If he/anyone else doesn't want to be viewed with that kind of arm-chair psychology perhaps they shouldn't be such an obvious dick. The observation IS accurate, but no one is trying to proclaim they're a professional capable of accurately diagnosing. It's fucking Reddit. ***Woof***.
---
I kept the single target frost build all through leveling and never had an issue. I still am and always was topping the DPS meters using the Winter’s Chill build
---
Probably too slow for an offhand. You want something speedy for poison procs.
---
Dinged 60 last night. Spirit set in my bags from very early on. Zero food purchased. I used some that I found when I was in a rush but spirit did some WORK.
---
No, because it’s CLASSIC WoW you twit.
---
That video linked was from 3 months ago. Can’t exactly represent what he is about today. 
---
However, I’ve said this before. Asmon said on stream that you should just fucking need an epic boe. Drama gone. 
---
This guy, however, is a loser. There should be some consequences.
---
This dude I’ve never heard of is a real piece of shit
---
Pom pyro is fun
---
While you absolutely didn't do anything wrong, I tend to start passing after having been incredibly lucky with the rng gods for some time.
---
...then why play on a pvp server?
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
Most likely he's one of the manchildren that follow asmon
---
What a weirdo.
---
Thanks, I just don't think I can handle frostbolt spamming or Blizzing with 2 other mages anymore, it's so linear in a rich game like WoW
---
I used Xloot and then stopped, now all my loot windows are broken as fuck.
---
I assume he's herb/alch as well?
---
Lol yes that’s why they exist why do blue and green BOE exist then?
---
So special.
---
Mental gymnastics.
---
You'll just pull aggro and die a lot, there's a reason why aoeing as a mage is more effective as frost: tanks can't hold aggro on everything.
---
I guess cause they didnt want to itemize leather with tank stats, even tho that's a shitty excuse.  Also hybrid tax.
---
You clearly said that beacause horde was ganking you to oblivion why lying? Why would you even say fUcK tHe hOrDe blablabla if it was because of the droprate? Lol.
---
What a fucking loser.
---
Pretty much yeah. Until you get mind flay at 30, obviously depends on how you spec’d
---
Is it ok if I read this in Alex Jones voice
---
Hands off my pet heal equip!
---
they said early 2019 and i figured someone here might have more info lol
---
Black Diamonds are worse than garbage because you can't vendor them and have to click an extra dialogue box to destroy them.
---
Yes I've heard so :D Would you take Arcane Power or Combustion?
---
Its not bad at all. Very nice server with good balance between Horde and Alliance. I've ran into a few streamers and played with them like timthetatman and it wasn't bad at all and they didn't demand items if someone else in the group needed it. Youll rarely see them and they wont effect your gameplay
---
What is this from
---
What is better for retribution damage?
---
Bonebiter (paladin class quest): https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter
---
or
---
Diabolic Skiver (ZF drop): https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9475/diabolic-skiver
---
I know I am supposed to choose the slowest, and highest hitting weapon... but Diabolic Skiver is many levels more than Bonebiter, plus the chance-on-hit throws my calculations off.
---
As a human both are not my race specialization so that's out of the picture at least.
---
dno about LLD's but my charm-stacked poison javelin would like to have a word with you
---
There was a Belgian Poet who needed cash.
---
He did not resort to anything rash.
---
He used his wisdom, without a flout.
---
To buy himself an epic mount.
---
Or something like that.
---
Nice work!
---
Damn. But rushing hard to end game leads to lack of new content. Im doin in my 40s well rn, and I have no need for any phase updates yet for a long time
---
That's all you can come out with.... 
---
Mad, cos it's true?
---
I’ve been putting points into affliction, and after I use my Dots On a mob I generally just spam shadow bolt until they die.
---
Is that pretty standard, or should affiction warlocks be using something else? It seems like my shadowvbolt does way more damage than dots, so I’m kind of wondering what’s the point of affliction (I’m level 22)
---
I assume you mean sanctuary and not salvation?  Sanct reduces damage and reflects on blocks, salv reduces threat.  You do at least get sanct?  Because i dont think you can reach spell crit if so.
---
Edit:  Just did the calculator.  I was wrong.  You can!
---
Loot rules were clearly stated in this post, but that didn't help anything.
---
Not always, an epic mount is still 1k gold later on.  Depends what you're looking to spend the money on.
---
This isn't true vanilla. This is classic, the dynamics you speak of don't all exist in 2019. But judging by your other posts, i'm not surprised this eludes you
---
Every Dwarf in vicinity: "THAT'S GOIN' IN THE BOOK"
---
There are a huge portion of players who have tremendous anxiety around tanking. You can see this with all of the posts on this sub about issues with tanking dungeons. 
---
They will NEVER tank unless it's a dungeon they massively outgear. It just stresses them out, they don't want to do it. 
---
So yeah, for that player, not having a 1h and shield in their inventory is a benefit. It's an easy excuse rather than having to admit to their group that it's just too much responsibility.
---
Yes, if you're solo playing. Again, I said fire is better with a group. Him calling it "niche" is pretty sad as it just means having friends or a guild to level with. Fire beats shatter spec still.
---
What a fucking sociopath.
---
I demand a shifty goblin to buy my lobster!!!
---
Poison at low levels wasn’t very viable due to most using Deaths Hand set, it reduced poision duration by 75% and gave +50% resistance.
---
Glitched twice for me. Had a friend have it glitch 5 times on him. Total luck of the draw.
---
U look really cool rn BB ;)
---
I'm not sure what unit frames you use, but any debuff with a blue border is a magical effect and can be dispelled.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Thanks for the clarification :) I'll keep this in mind for my future pugs
---
my guy is looking at his cash stack and the mount at the same time
---
What other posts?
---
there are leather gears having dodge stats though...  that's good enough for druids
---
are there even plates and mails with +parry stats? (i think str affects this stats too so would be nice for druids)
---
Probably arcane power
---
Because there is lots of tempting shit to spend your gold on, lol.
---
meanwhile I’m at 30 runs still trying to get my Ban’thok Sash lol
---
Plus, warlocks are like mages, except awesome.
---
Silicon Valley
---
That's why I said "dno about LLD's"... I only did regular pvp
---
I'm ally on incendius! Can almost get these so Ill start putting them on the AH! Maybe toss some cats and owls in there too. Not that your kind cares, I assume you just want to eat them all anyways ;)
---
Uh I think you're a bit too sensitive to be alive.
---
Actually you might be right about BRD. I don't think they're immune to fire but they most likely have resistance
---
Mostly. But if you have a 3 mob pull, and there's another pull 100 yards away on your screen, you will cycle through them.
---
I feel you.
---
Definitely, but healers having to drink more versus not having a tank. I see a clear winner here. If my healer is doing fine, that means I'm not dying, which means I'm doing fine.
---
I work from home/own my own business.
---
Is the whole premise of the video not to say the "go" person is the dickhead person?
---
I mean...
---
I said it was a poor excuse but I believe it was one reason they didnt add it for druids.  But mainly hybrid tax
---
What a little bitch
---
If everyone needs, then nobody needs. It's as simple as that when it comes to boe epics and boe bis twink blues. I thought people would have learned this lesson over a decade ago
---
I’m the tank, had 3 priests at a dbf run. And a hunter. Second last boss, hunter agros every single mob because can’t control his pat. I die trying to agro all the mobs that our hunter agrod. 
---
Last boss I charge in, start tanking. Making sure I have the highest threat in our party. 200 dmg to my face each hit. (Started with 1200 hp I was on 240-300 hp when I typed in party chat “hels pls”) 200 dmg in the face down to 40-100 health. Should I use a potion, nah we have 3 priests I’m not gonna waist it here, they must be already casting heals on me after all boss is on half health and I’m almost dead, they can’t possibly take it down without a tank. But nop none of them healed me. I died (had all my gear broken), luckily our last one standing finished it, and could res all of us. 
---
Still I was extremely pissed how we had 3 priests and none of them healed me, even after asking in chat for it.
---
I'm somewhat noobish, so I wanna make sure I dont get flamed trying to tank.  So improved righteous fury is something i really wanna take.
---
Are you that spec because you wanna be ret for raiding?
---
